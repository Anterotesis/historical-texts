            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>WHAT I write is with a view to explain my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which has not been underſtood. It is poſſible I may not be able to remove the miſconception of every one. I am aware how difficult it is to change opinion, even with the beſt cauſe on my ſide: But I may ſupport thoſe who have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken my defence in converſation; and it may ſatisfy others, who are diſpoſed to find men innocent rather than criminal.</p>
               <p>ON the evening of the 14th of July, David Lenox, marſhal of the diſtrict of Pennſylvania, was introduced to me at my houſe. I had heard that he had been, on his way, ſerving proceſs, on delinquent diſtillers, in the intermediate counties from Philadelphia to the weſtern country; and in the weſtern country itſelf. The converſation turned on this ſubject; and the marſhal expreſſed, with great ſenſibility, his ſatisfaction, in having met with no inſult, much leſs injury, in the execution of his duty. My impreſſion was that of ſurpriſe, that he ſhould have apprehended any. For, though the people had been in the habit of thinking it no inconſiſtency with the reputation of a good citizen, to inſult or abuſe an exciſe officer; yet I had conſidered them as diſtinguiſhing between theſe, and other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of government. For though outrages had been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on exciſe officers, yet no ſheriff, nor conſtable, had been oppoſed in arreſting the offenders. They had been brought in upon proceſs, and proſecuted at the court. There was no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the diſtinction; but it was made. It was owing to this;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028332_0003_0FD899AF01AF1F30"/>
that the exciſe law was odious, and the public voice againſt the officers; but the office of ſheriff, or conſtable, carried with it the authority of law, which the people had been in the habit of reſpecting; and the oppoſing which would be conſidered infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, in public opinion. I had ſuppoſed they would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the marſhal in the light of a ſheriff, or judicial officer, and would not moleſt him. However, it ſo happened, that I was miſtaken in my confidence of his ſecurity; for the evening of the next day, having been out in company with the inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the revenue for the diſtrict, John Neville, ſerving ſome remaining writs upon diſtillers, in the county of Alleghany, he returned with an unfavourable account of his reception. He had ſerved the laſt writ he had to ſerve, in that quarter, and had juſt quitted the houſe of a diſtiller, of the name of Miller, when a number of men were obſerved to be in purſuit of them, and a gun was diſcharged. The marſhal conceiving it not to be with a view to injure, but intimidate, turned and expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. But obſerving a ſullenneſs of countenance, and adviſed by the inſpector, who knew their diſpoſition better, he thought proper to ride off, and eſcape from them; and had come to town. The inſpector had gone to his own houſe, about 7 miles from Pittſburg, and about the ſam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> diſtance from the houſe of Miller.</p>
               <p>The next morning, after day-break, the inſpector having juſt got out of bed, and opened the door, diſcovered a number of armed men, about the houſe; and demanding of them who they were, and whence they came; the anſwer was ſuch, as induced him to conſider their intention to be hoſtile; and on their refuſing to diſperſe, he fired on them. The fire was returned, and a conteſt enſued. The negroes, from ſome adjoining ſmall buildings, fired upon the flank of the aſſailants, and they were repulſed, with ſix wounded; one mortally. The inſpector or his family received no injury; his houſe, which was a frame building, was perforated with the balls.</p>
               <p>Towards the middle of the next day, the ſon of the inſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, Preſley Neville, who reſided in the town of Pittſburgh, read a letter from his father, written at his houſe in the country, informing, that a large number were ſaid to be collecting at a place known by the name of Couche's fort, about four miles diſtant from his houſe. The ſon expreſſed to me his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for the ſituation of his father. It was aſked by me, What he underſtood to be their object? It was anſwered, To demand
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028332_0004_0FD899B077D987F8"/>
of his father, to deliver up his commiſſion. Deliver it, ſaid I. It was anſwered, No.</p>
               <p>My idea was, to put by the tempeſt for the preſent, until the civil authority could interpoſe, and bring to account indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually, thoſe who had diſturbed the peace. If the mob who burned the houſe of lord Mansfield, in the riot in London, could have been put off by his delivering his commiſſion, I preſume he would have delivered it. Another could eaſily have been made out for him.</p>
               <p>It may be ſaid, that it would have occurred to a good citizen, to give aſſiſtance to the inſpector, and to help him to defend his houſe: and that the gallant and ſucceſsful defence, which had been made the preceding morning, gave ground of reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to attempt defence againſt a farther force. But I eaſily diſtinguiſhed between the ſurpriſe of an unexpected reſiſtance, and the deliberation where it is expected. It was alſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, from the letter of the inſpector, that a much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable force, perhaps five hundred men, were ſaid to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting. I eaſily conceived, that, as the diſaſter of the firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack had brought a ſecond, the repulſe of a ſecond would bring a third; and the numbers, and the rage, would increaſe. I am not a fighting man; and it was moſt natural for me to think of policy, and the giving the rioters the piece of paper which they had their minds upon, and let the juſtices of the peace, the conſtables, the ſheriffs, the grand juries of the courts, ſettle it with them afterwards. It may be ſaid, they could not have been brought to juſtice. That might have been the caſe; but I thought at the time they could.</p>
               <p>In the afternoon of the day, John Wilkins, junior, of Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, a brigadier general of the militia, calling upon me, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me, that a demand by Neville the younger, on behalf of his father, had been made of John Gibſon, major general of the militia, and of himſelf, as brigadier general, to call out the militia, in order to ſuppreſs the rioters; and wiſhed to have my opinion, as to their authority to call them out. Having given the queſtion a ſhort conſideration, I thought they had not the power. The governor, under an article of the conſtitution, has, conſtructively, the power: "He ſhall take care that the laws be faithfully executed." And by an act of the legiſlature, of April 11th, 1783, he is expreſsly empowered, "to call in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to actual ſervice, whenever it may be neceſſary, part of the militia, in caſe of rebellion, or of an actual, or threatened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion." But it appeared to me, that the conſtitution, and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028332_0005_0FD899B4F1B87848"/>
the act, conſtitutes the governor the judge of the occaſion; and that it is not in his power to delegate this diſcretion, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute another the judge of it. But if he could, on enquiring of general Wilkins, I found the fact to be, that he had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated this diſcretion, or conſtituted theſe officers the judges of the occaſion of calling out the militia; no proviſional inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as in the caſe of an Indian invaſion, having been given, that reſpected an oppoſition to the laws, or a rebellion<note n="*" place="bottom">A letter from the governor, to major general Gibſon, of the 25th of July, when the account of the attack upon the houſe of the inſpector had reached the government, contained no orders for calling out the militia. It evident, from the report of his ſecretary, Mr. Dallas, to the legiſlature of the ſtate, of February 13th, 1795, that the governor had not thought himſelf juſtifiable, on this emergency, in calling out the militia. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing is an extract from that report: "No poſitive law exiſted, under the authority of the ſtate, defining the emergency that could juſtify an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from the judicial to the military power; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>; but that the act of interpoſing the aid of the military power, ſhould likewiſe be founded upon their requiſition."</note>.</p>
               <p>General Wilkins returned to me a ſhort time afterwards; and ſaid, that Neville the younger had called upon John Gibſon and himſelf, as judges of the court, to raiſe the poſſe of the county, and he wiſhed my opinion with reſpect to their power in this caſe. Giving it a ſhort conſideration, I was of opinion, that they had not the power. By the conſtitution, the judges of the court are juſtices of the peace, ſo far as relates to criminal matters. A juſtice of the peace, on information given, can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his warrant to the conſtables, to apprehend offenders; or, on an affray in his preſence, can command aſſiſtance to ſuppreſs it. But it did not appear to me, that he could raiſe the poſſe of the county. But, ſaid I, the ſheriff can.—He is in town; let him be called upon.</p>
               <p>Judge Wilkins left me; and in a ſhort time returned, and ſaid, the ſheriff doubted his authority. Judge Wilkins wiſhed me to explain it to him. I ſaid I was ready. He left me, and in a ſhort time I received a note from him, requeſting my company at the public houſe, whence the note was dated. I attended inſtantly, and found there judge Gibſon, judge M'Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and the ſheriff of the county. I was requeſted by judge Wilkins, to explain to the ſheriff his authority. I did ſo, fully.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028332_0006_0FD8858BE4E37B40"/>
The ſheriff appeared alarmed at the taſk of raiſing the poſſe, and thought it not practicable. I was aſked my opinion. I do not recollect from whom the queſtion came. I gave it decidedly, that it was not practicable: All concurred.</p>
               <p>But, ſaid I, this can be done;—ride out without arms, and addreſs the people. Perſuaſion will avail more than force. If this is adopted, I will be one to go. It was agreed; and in a few minutes, I had returned to my houſe, was on horſeback, and at the river, to croſs with the company; who were all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with the ſame expedition.</p>
               <p>At the moment we came to the river, we fell in with Neville the younger, marſhal Lenox, and a young man of the name of Ormſby, a ſon of John Ormſby of Pittſburgh, a family for whom I had regard; but knew the young man to be inconſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate and raſh; and was perſuaded, that on this occaſion he acted without the knowledge, or at leaſt the approbation of his parents: All three were armed, which I thought imprudent. I felt concern for them; and taking that liberty with the young man, which I could not take with the others, I addreſſed him abruptly:—What! ſaid I, armed? Yes, ſaid he. You will not ride with us armed. You may ride as you pleaſe, ſaid he, I am armed. Neville the younger, who was mounted on a gay horſe, with piſtols in his holſters, ſpoke:—We are not all born orators, ſaid he: we are going to fight; you to ſpeak. I thought him a better chevalier than a judge of the occaſion.</p>
               <p>But I did not know, at the time, that arrangements had been made, on their part, for a defence; tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> major Kirkpatrick, and ten or a dozen ſoldiers from the garriſon of Pittſburgh, had gone to the houſe of the inſpector.</p>
               <p>At the river, we found two boats. They took one, and we took the other.</p>
               <p>Croſſing the river, being many in the boat, and croſſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther high, we ſtranded the boat on the bar, the water being low; and this circumſtance being likely to give ſome delay, to lighten the boat, I leapt my horſe overboard, and rode the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the bar, and ſwam the channel on the other ſide. One or two of the gentlemen in the boat, followed me, I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this circumſtance, as marking our anxiety to reach the people.</p>
               <p>Aſcending the hill on the other ſide of the river, I reflected, that I had heard, that the roads to Pittſburgh were guarded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that perſons, that day, had been ſtopped, and interrogated, who were on their way to the town, or from it. It ſtruck me,

that we might be thus ſtopped, or delayed, or prevented alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from going forward. Mentioning this to the ſheriff, who was ſome diſtance a-head with me, I enquired of him, if, riding through the country in the execution of his office, he did not know of any leſs public road, equally near, or not much leſs ſo, than the main road, which we could take, and avoid the out parties of which I ſpoke. The ſheriff ſaid, he knew the old road to Couche's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>t, which was the place; and that he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently took it going that courſe: It was equally near, or not much leſs ſo, than the new road. We waited at the fork of the road for the company, and ſuggeſting theſe reaſons, it was agreed to take the old road. It may ſeem trifling to mention this circumſtance; but it becomes material, when it is known, that it has been alledged that we quitted the main road, with a view to avoid the very object which we propoſed, which was, that of falling in with the body of the people.</p>
               <p>Couche's fort was about 9 miles diſtant: As we rode, which was with all the expedition poſſible, we obſerved the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt fields deſerted by the men; women only to be ſeen. Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at a houſe, and enquiring, with a view to gain intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the movements of the country, the woman of the houſe, as we took her to be, appeared alarmed at ſeeing us, and knowing the ſheriff, aſked him, Are you of Neville's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? This impreſſed me, as ſhewing the popular idea, that the country was on one ſide, and the revenue officer on the other.</p>
               <p>Reflecting on the beſt means of introducing our intention to the body, who were ſuppoſed to be in arms, it ſtruck me that ſeeing the ſheriff and the judges of the court coming forward, the firſt impreſſion would be, that it was with a view to take cognizance as civil officers of what was done, and this might make our ſituation dangerous. It was propoſed, and agreed therefore, that theſe gentleman ſhould remain, and that I, who was the only one of the company who was not a civil officer, ſhould ride forward, and acquaint them with our views in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: That it was to diſſuade and prevent, and not to take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance.</p>
               <p>Coming to the houſe of a certain Hulſe, where theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen had propoſed to ſtop, and which was half a mile off Couche's fort, we were informed that the body had marched for Neville's houſe.</p>
               <p>We ſet out to overtake them, and rode with haſte. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within a mile and a half of Neville's, at the houſe of a doctor Adams; we learned from ſome who had been ſpectators, that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028332_0008_0FD899BA6D71ED28"/>
all was over, and the houſe burned; that the people were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, and in great rage at the loſs of their leader: This was a James M'Farlane, who, it ſeems, commanded on that occaſion. It was not thought adviſable for us to go forward as things now were; nor even ſafe to remain, and be in their way, as they would miſconſtrue our intention in coming; and ſuppoſing it to have been with a view of aſſiſting the exciſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, make us objects of their paſſion. We ſet out therefore, for Pittſburgh, and riſing the hill, above the houſe where we had been, we ſaw the failing flame of the burning, and heard the firing and the ſhouts of the parties on their way home from it.</p>
               <p>Riding about two miles, we ſtopped at a public houſe kept by a man of the name of Shochan, and underſtood that the tav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern-keeper had rode towards Neville's houſe to learn or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what was to be done. After ſome time he returned, but having obſerved only at a diſtance, he could give us no particular information. We had intended to remain at his houſe until we received ſome farther account; but the people appearing, the woman eſpecially, uneaſy at our being there, leſt it ſhould be heard afterwards, and injure them, we ſet out, and came to Pittſburgh. I mention the uneaſineſs of theſe people, as ſhewing the fear which was impreſſed of ſeeming to have had any thing to ſay to any one, that might be diſpoſed to take a part on behalf of the exciſe officer: And as officers of government, and from the town, that ſuſpicion might ly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome of us.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>THE opinion which I gave with reſpect to the power of the judges of the court, in calling out the poſſe, may be queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and from thence it may be inferred, that I was favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the deſigns of the rioters. This would be unfair, as at the ſame time, it was part of my opinion that, with the ſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iff, they had power; and the ſheriff was at hand, who inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of his official character, was known to be a man of great perſonal intrepidity, and of a ſolid and extenſive popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar influence.</p>
               <p>But though, on a rapid conſideration of the queſtion, I may have been miſtaken with regard to the power of the judges independent of the ſheriff, yet on examination, it will be found, there is ſuch ground in the queſtion as might lead to a miſtake.</p>
               <p>By the conſtitution, the judges have no more power "as to criminal matters," than a juſtice of the peace. The queſtion then will be, Has a juſtice of the peace, power to raiſe the poſſe?</p>
               <p>The office of juſtice of the peace was not known to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law. It was firſt inſtituted by 1. Edward 3. chap. 16. with power under the general term, "aſſigned to keep the peace."</p>
               <p>By 4. Edward 3. chap. 2. Farther power is given.</p>
               <p>By 18. Edward 3. chap. 2. Still farther power.</p>
               <p>By 34. Edward 3. chap. 1. Power is given, which, <hi>by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,</hi> may ſeem to authoriſe to raiſe the poſſe.</p>
               <p>By 17. Richard 2. chap. 10. The power is thought to be expreſsly given under the term "<hi>miniſters,</hi>" which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a juſtice of the peace.</p>
               <p>13. Henry 4. chap. 7. is the laſt ſtatute that reſpects the power of the juſtices in raiſing the poſſe.—It is in theſe words:
<q>If any riot, aſſembly, or rout of people againſt the law, be made in parties of the realm, the juſtices of peace, three, or two of them at the leaſt, and the ſheriff, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſheriff of the county, where ſuch riot, aſſembly or rout ſhall be made hereafter, ſhall come <hi>with the power of the county,</hi> if need be to arreſt, and ſhall arreſt them; and the ſame juſtices, and ſheriff, or under ſheriff, ſhall have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to record that which they ſhall find ſo done in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028332_0010_0FD899BD452C1CA8"/>
againſt the law, and that by the record of the ſame juſtices and ſheriff, or under ſheriff, ſuch treſpaſſers, and offenders, ſhall be convict in the manner and form as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſtatutes of forcible entries.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whether the power of juſtices, without the ſheriff, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſheriff, to raiſe the poſſe, is taken away by this ſtatute, is the queſtion. There would ſeem reaſon in not leaving it to a ſingle juſtice of the peace, to alarm and raiſe the county at his diſcretion, on information of an affray, at a diſtance. And yet it may be ſaid, and probably is the juſt conſtruction of the ſtatute, that the power of the juſtices is not reſtrained in raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poſſe, but enlarged to a farther act, which two, or more with the ſheriff, or under ſheriff, may exerciſe; that is, make a record of the riot, which ſhall have the force of an inquiſition by a jury, or a preſentment, or indictment at the court.</p>
               <p>Be this as it may, in the opinion I gave judge Wilkins, I certainly pointed to the ſafeſt, and moſt effectual means, which was, that of proceeding with the ſheriff.</p>
               <p>The ſheriff is himſelf, by the common law, the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator of the peace of his county. He may
<q>apprehend, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and commit to priſon all affrayors, and all ſuch as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his juriſdiction, and in his preſence, ſhall in any ſort, break, or attempt to break the king's peace: and may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the aid and force of others to arreſt ſuch offenders, and may cauſe them to find ſureties for the peace; and when any <hi>Rebellion, Inſurrection,</hi> or <hi>riotous aſſembly</hi> of people ſhall be within land, the ſheriff may raiſe the power of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to apprehend ſuch malefactors.</q>

               <p>The ſheriff, as keeper of the peace, both by common law, and ſpecial commiſſion, is the firſt man in the county, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior in rank to any nobleman therein, during his office. 1. Roll: reports 237.</p>
               <p>To theſe authorities Blackſtone refers in his commentaries, and recognizes the law. Volume 1. page 342.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid, that the opinion which I gave that an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to raiſe the poſſe was not expedient, indicated a diſpoſition favourable to the views of the rioters. Let it be obſerved, that I gave no opinion, in the caſe, until the queſtion was put to me. I had confined myſelf ſtrictly to the legal points pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Alſo before my opinion was given, the ſheriff had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his opinion. It appears alſo that before our conference,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028332_0011_0FD899BECF9902F0"/>
judge Gibſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and judge Wilkins had declared the ſame opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion <note n="*" place="bottom">The teſtimony of Neville the younger, in the caſe of the United States v. Miller.</note>. At all events they inſtantly concurred with me. I did not at all wonder that Neville the younger, or any other of the immediate connections, ſhould have been ſanguine with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the practicability of raiſing the poſſe. The paſſion which they felt, promoted them to overlook the difficulty; and whether practicable or not to any great extent, it was natural for them to wiſh the attempt made. It would give them company; it would make thoſe equally obnoxious who did attempt it; or at leaſt who did obey; and wounded pride and ſelf-love was not ready to indulge a proper concern for the ſafety of others; or make a proper calculation of the effect, which a concern for his own ſafety, in the then temper of the country, muſt leave upon every mind. Beſides, they could not know, ſo well as others, the general rage of the cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ry, againſt the exciſe law, and its officers. Some things that regard themſelves, will always be concealed from men; and perſons may appear moderate in their tranſactions with them who have the moſt hoſtile ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. They did not even know the diſpoſition of the town of Pittſburgh; I ſpeak of the affections of the people perſonally towards them. They counted more upon the attachment of the people, as is natural for men, than could be depended on.</p>
               <p>But the fact was, had th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y been the greateſt favourites, the people would not have be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> commanded, in a cauſe of that nature. From the country they could not. A ſentiment of oppoſition to the law was univerſal; and though force had been heretofore uſed with ſome concealment, yet it was thought laudable to uſe it; and the example being ſet of uſing it open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the general bent would be to follow.</p>
               <p>From the town, the people could not have been commanded. Many of them had connections in the country, and would not ſubmit to an order of taking arms <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gainſt them. Beſides, they had, themſelves, a good deal of the ſame ſpirit of oppoſition to the law; not ſo much from any conſideration of the law, or its effects, but be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>uſe it was the patriotic and faſhionable language. Others, as is natural, wiſhed for ſomething new; and would rather have joined them, than fought againſt them. It is a fact, that ſome influential men, and commiſſioned in the militia, were heard to ſay that day, that if they were ordered out, and were to fight at all, it would be with the people. Thus,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028332_0012_0FD8858D2A3CD208"/>
the cauſe of the people, and that of the government, were thought to be very different things.</p>
               <p>But, with the beſt diſpoſition in the town of Pittſburgh, a concern for their general intereſt, as mechanics, or ſhopkeepers, would render them reluctant to enter into a conteſt with the country, from whence a great part of their cuſtom came: And a concern for their immediate ſafety, would prevent them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. They would reflect, the moſt ignorant of them, that the militia of the town, about 250 men, were they unanimous, and ſpirited in ſupport of government, would be nothing to the country; which would, in the next inſtance, after an attack on the exciſe officer, turn itſelf againſt the town. It could ſtarve them out, and the garriſon with them, by an interdict of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions; or, as was threatened afterwards, it could plunder and burn. It would have been extreme cruelty, to force the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to this danger. It would have been extreme impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy; and would have anſwered no other end, than to ſhew the rioters the ſtrength they had even in the town, either from thoſe who really were, or from ſelf-preſervation would affect to be, with them. It was ſafeſt to let the matter reſt unknown. Perſuaſion, for the moment, and the ſteady, and accuſtomed ſtep of civil authority, by the known officers, afterward, were the only means that were eligible. The raiſing the poſſe of the county, as a legal act, was a thing unknown to the people, and would not be underſtood. It would be conſidered as the party of the exciſe officer, diſpoſed to try their ſtrength with the friends of liberty. It would have been a moſt raſh act. I will trace what would have been the conſequence.—The poſſe could have been raiſed, or it could not. If it could not have been raiſed, the weakneſs of the government, and the ſtrength of the rioters, was diſcovered by the experiment. If it could have been raiſed, and brought forward, a conteſt would have taken place, and lives have been loſt. The victory muſt have been on the ſide of the rioters; for the ſtrength of the country was with them. The plundering, and deſtruction of the town of Pittſburgh, would have enſued. The garriſon would have been ſtarved out, or taken; for there was not, at that time, more than a day's proviſion in it. The whole country would have been involved inſtantly. Deſperation would have led to prompt, and deciſive meaſures. Theſe would be, to croſs the mountains, and receive acceſſion of force, and procure the means, and occupy the ground of war in the midland country. On the circumſtances that afterwards took place, it was what I was
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028332_0013_0FD899C03178AC40"/>
afraid they would do; as will be ſeen by and by, when I come to explain a letter that I wrote to the government.</p>
               <p>But in order to rebut ſtill farther the preſumption, that I gave my opinion againſt raiſing the poſſe, from motives favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the rioters, let it be obſerved, that if the poſſe had been raiſed, I ſhould have paſſed unnoticed in the croud, and could have excuſed myſelf, by alledging the compulſion of the law; but, in taking upon me to interfere in ſo oſtenſible a manner, as I was diſpoſed to do, in addreſſing them on the unlawful, and atrocious act which they were about to perpetrate, I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a readineſs to ſacrifice popular favour for the public good. And that I would ſacrifice whatever I did poſſeſs of it, if I did poſſeſs any, I knew to be the conſequence; and expreſsly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned this view of the reſult as to myſelf, to the company as we rode. I had juſt before ſuffered my name to be introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or if any one would chuſe to have it ſo, had managed to have it introduced, as a candidate, for the Congreſs of the United States, for the diſtrict of Waſhington and Allegheny counties; and my pride was now engaged, to carry my elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Was it the way to carry it, to oppoſe myſelf to a ſtrong popular paſſion, and obſtruct the accompliſhment of a favourite object? It may be ſaid, I would have obtained credit after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with the people themſelves, for preventing what on co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> reflection they would ſee would have been dangerous. With ſome I might have obtained credit, but with the far greater part, I would not. Even thoſe that approved it, would affect to condemn it, and leave me to bear the odium. If at a future day, I might have obtained general credit, which probably would have been the caſe, it would have been too late to ſerve me in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> object at that time.</p>
               <p>But if any one ſhould ſtill inſiſt, that the experiment ought to have been made, and that the probability is, that the poſſe could have been raiſed, I will give them a farther preſumption to the contrary. The Neville family is numerous, and wealthy: The inſpector himſelf, with the advantage of an office, which though it brings general odium, yet ſecures particular depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents: His ſon a member of Aſſembly, brigade inſpector, and ſurveyor of the county: His ſon-in-law, Iſaac Craig, deputy quarter maſter, with the care of the military ſtores, and the conſtructing public buildings, and the employment of mechanics which this gives: His brother-in-law, Abraham Kirkpatrick, with money, and means of aſſiſting his neighbours. What is more, Neville the elder, not diſliked perſonally; Neville the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028332_0014_0FD899C54ECBEB08"/>
younger, generally popular; and both the father and the ſon hoſpitable, remarkably; and the ſon-in-law, Craig, ſufficiently ſo; and the brother-in-law, of late, for certain reaſons, laviſhly ſo;—and yet, with theſe advantages, and the influence conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, nor to be able to engage the voluntary aid of more than the inconſiderate young man whom I have mentioned, muſt prove the general ſenſe, that the aſſiſting an exciſe officer was too obnoxious an act for any to undertake, and live in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>

               <p>GREAT pains were taken, at Couche's fort, by an aged and venerable clergymen, the reverend John Clark, to diſſuade the people from the object they had in view. It was to no purpoſe. They conſidered him as in his dotage; or as having ſkill in ſpiritual affairs; but not in the temp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ral intereſts of the country. It may be thought from hence, that diſſuaſion from no one, could have had effect. That does not follow. Regard might have been paid to the repreſentations of thoſe who were ſuppoſed to know the law, and to be able to calculate the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable conſequences of the act.</p>
               <p>A certain James Lang, of Brownſville, formerly of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, was on his way to Pittſburgh, and halted ſome time, and converſed with M'Farlane, and uſed much endeavour to diſſuade him from the act. M'Farlane fairly owned, that, on reflection, he had become ſenſible of the raſhneſs of it; but that they had gone too far to retreat. That was, I preſume, he could not find a reaſonable pretence of receding; and could not, with a good grace, draw off, after having uſed activity in exciting the people.</p>
               <p>If this was the caſe, it will prove the uſe of our having gone forward to diſſuade. It would afforded a reaſonable pretence of relinquiſhing the enterpriſe: The leaders, that is, thoſe who had been moſt active in collecting the multitude, would ſay, that a light had been thrown upon the matter, by a lawyer, and judges, which had not before ſtruck them; and that, all things conſidered, it might be adviſeable to relinquiſh it. They would not have been aſhamed to have it thought, that they were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter informed, by men of greater opportunities of legal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and eſpecially by one whoſe profeſſion was the law itſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:028332_0015_0FD899C637779D90"/>M'Farlane had been in Pittſburgh that day, and purchaſed a quantity of flints. He informed the people in the rendezvous, that they might count upon a force from the town of Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh; that the ſheriff was ſent for to raiſe the poſſe; and that ſoldiers had gone out from the garriſon to Neville's houſe. This information ſeemed to animate: They had no idea of an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that could be formidable.</p>
               <p>In arranging the meaſures of the enterpriſe, a committee was appointed; with power like that of the national commiſſioners with the French armies. This committee offered the command to a Benjamin Parkiſon; who excuſed himſelf, as not being a man of military knowledge. James M'Farlane was then nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and accepted it. This was a major M'Farlane of the militia, who had ſerved with reputation, in the rank of a lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, in the war with Great Britain, from the beginning to the end of it; and was a man of good private character; and had acquired a very handſome property, by induſtry in trade, after the expiration of the war.</p>
               <p>The body having marched, and approached the houſe of the inſpector, the horſes were left with a guard; and arrangements made for an attack, ſhould it be neceſſary. A flag was ſent from the committee, with a demand of the inſpector to deliver up his papers. This appears to have been the ultimate object of the rioters. The inſpector had withdrawn from the houſe; having ſeen the force that was advancing: conceiving, I preſume, that a demand might be made of his perſon; and that, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the encounter of the preceding morning, and the loſs ſuſtained by the aſſailants, his life would be in danger. In this caſe, he muſt have counted on the not being able to defend the houſe. Why then not have given direction to thoſe whom he left in the houſe, not to attempt a defence? Perhaps he did it; but his brother-in-law, Kirkpatrick, a major in the ſervice laſt war, judging leſs prudently, entertained the idea of being able to defend it.</p>
               <p>It being communicated, on the return of the flag, that the inſpector had left the houſe, a ſecond flag was ſent, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand made, that ſix perſons ſhould be admitted into the houſe, to ſearch for his papers, and take them. This was refuſed; and notice was then given, by a third flag, for the lady of the inſpector, and any other female part of the family to withdraw. They did withdraw; and the attack commenced. About fifteen minutes after the commencement, a flag was preſented, or was thought to be preſented, from the houſe; upon which, M'Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028332_0016_0FD899C7C7C68250"/>
ſtepping from a tree, behind which he ſtood, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding a ceſſation of the firing, received a ball in the inſide of his thigh, near the groin, and inſtantly expired. The firing then continued; and a meſſage was ſent to the committee, who were ſitting at ſome diſtance, to know whether the houſe ſhould not be ſtormed: But, in the mean time, fire had been ſet to a barn, and to other buildings adjoining the manſion houſe; and in a ſhort time, the intenſeneſs of the heat, and the evident communicability of the flame to the houſe, had ſtruck thoſe in the houſe, with a ſenſe of immediate danger of life; and they began to call for quarter: on which the firing ceaſed, and they were deſired to come out, and ſurrender themſelves. They came out; and the ſoldiers, three of whom are ſaid to have been wounded, were ſuffered to paſs by, and go where they thought proper. Major Kirkpatrick himſelf, had nearly paſſed through, when he was diſtinguiſhed from the ſoldiers, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted; and ordered to deliver his muſket. This he refuſed; when one preſenting a gun to his breaſt, was about to fire; he dropped upon his knee, and aſked quarter. The man took the major's hat from his head, and put it on the muzzle of his gun; but did him no other damage.—I depict theſe incidents, merely to give an intimate idea of the manners and ſpirit of the people.</p>
               <p>Fire had been put to an end of the manſion houſe, before the fire communicated from the barn and other buildings. All were conſumed; one ſmall building excepted; to which fire was not put, but a guard ſet over it, at the ſuggeſtion of the negroes, that it contained their bacon.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the houſe was on fire, the undiſciplined of the troops, if I may be allowed the expreſſion; or, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would ſay, the unprincipled amongſt them, entered, and began to plunder. The cellar was broke open, and wine and other liquors rolled out, and drank.</p>
               <p>Major Kirkpatrick, after being carried ſome diſtance under guard, was taken up by David Hamilton, behind him on horſe-back; when, thinking himſelf protected, he began to anſwer thoſe who came up occaſionally, with indignant language: when Hamilton, addreſſing him, ſaid, You ſee I am endeavouring to ſave you, at the riſk of my own ſafety; and yet you are acting a part, that makes it ſtill more dangerous for me. On this he was ſilent; and being carried ſome diſtance farther by Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and getting into the buſhes of the wood, he was adviſed to make his eſcape; and he effected it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:028332_0017_0FD899CE47C25BD0"/>Neville the younger, marſhal Lenox, and the young man of the name of Ormſby, had arrived at the outguard, about the time the firing had begun at the houſe. They were arreſted, and put under guard. Neville ſolicited greatly to go forward; and would engage, that every demand, ſhort of life, ſhould be complied with. In the then ſtate of things, he could not be permitted. In a ſhort time, he had the pain to ſee the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on fire; and to be uncertain of the fate of his father and family; whether they were in the houſe, or out of it.</p>
               <p>On the termination of the buſineſs, and the return of the people from the houſe, Neville and the Marſhal were carried along, and in great perſonal danger from the multitude, many of whom, by this time, had become intoxicated. Young Ormſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by being known to many of them, after being treated with ſome indignity, was diſmiſſed.</p>
               <p>The marſhal alſo, after ſome time, having ſtipulated to ſerve no farther proceſs on the weſt of the mountains, and to ſurrender himſelf when demanded; and Neville the younger having become ſponſor for the fidelity of this engagement, was diſmiſſed from the main body: Neville alſo went with him. They had inſiſted on an engagement from the marſhal that he would not return his proceſſes which had been ſerved. He told them with candour, that this was not in his power, being under an oath of office to return them. The firmneſs of the marſhal in having the candour to make this acknowledgment, even though at the manifeſt riſk of life, deſerves great commendation. It won it, and had it from them, as ſome of them have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to me. I have heard all ſpeak, with great admiration of the manly, and compoſed behaviour of the marſhal: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt Neville; but that he exhibited a little too much of the chevalier at the firſt. Coming up to the out-guard on his firſt advance, "If there is a gentleman amongſt you," ſaid he, "let him come out and ſpeak to me." This was conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as an affront to the whole; and ſeveral raiſed their piec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and were diſpoſed to fire. But with preſence of mind, changing his voice to greater ſoftneſs, and calling out that he was not armed, they advanced, and made him priſoner. His piſtols had not been drawn from the holſters, and therefore he might ſay, he was not armed.</p>
               <p>After being diſmiſſed from the body, they fell in with an out party, the greater part, greatly intoxicated. The marſhal, taken afreſh by theſe, was carried towards Couche's fort, to which they were returning. He was in danger of life. The
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028332_0018_0FD899CF32A68998"/>
reſult muſt have appeared to him on this occaſion very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. He was for ſome time under the care of a James M'Allis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who had reſcued him from great danger, but given his word to the more violent, not to ſuffer him to eſcape. M'Allister, who had every diſpoſition to ſave him, did not to dare to let him go. After ſome time, he ſurrendered him to a Colonel David Philips, who advancing ſome diſtance before the croud, with the marſhal, was intreated by the marſhal to be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to eſcape. Philips told him that his own life would anſwer for it. However he was at laſt prevailed upon, juſt as they approached the main body who had advanced to Couche's fort, with the corpſe of M'Farlane, to ſhew him a road in a certain direction, and ſuffer him to eſcape. He got into the main road towards Pittſburgh, and about 2 o'clock that morning came to the town.</p>
               <p>There is one thing that may have ſtruck the reader: Why it was, that the judges, the ſheriff and myſelf, when within a mile or two of Neville's houſe, the evening it was burned, knowing the marſhal to have gone forward, we did not, on his account at leaſt, as being a ſtranger to the people, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no perſonal friends, which the Nevilles, notwithſtanding this outrage on their property, certainly had, we did not go forward alſo, to uſe our influence to ſave him from injury. I had a perfect ſenſe of his danger from the moment that I ſaw him on horſe-back to go out that day; and on the occaſion to which the query refers, I could not be leſs apprehenſive than I had been. As circumſtances then were, it was a different caſe, from what it was when we ſet out to Couche's fort, and when the idea would be, that we were not intereſting ourſelves, for an officer, or for government, but for the ſafety of the people themſelves, in giving them good advice. Yet I would have ventured to have gone forward, provided two gentlemen of the company would remain; theſe were judge Gibſon, and judge Wilkins, both of whom I knew to be, at that juncture, obnoxious; judge Wilkins eſpecially.</p>
               <p>Judge Gibſon, on account of his ſuppoſed intimacy with the Neville family; and judge Wilkins on account of an advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Pittſburgh Gazette, calling for whiſkey that had paid duties<note n="*" place="bottom">"Whiſkey will be purchaſed with caſh by the ſubſcribers at Pittſburgh; but to accompliſh the object of trade for which it is intended, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry any whiſkey offered for ſale to them, ſhould have paid, or ſecured the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and be accompanied with the marks and certificates from the inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or inſpectors, according to law.

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028332_0019_0FD899D0B5044BD0"/>
law: It was ſuppoſed he was in ſubordination to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpector, and the rage againſt him, was at that time great. He had been before that time the moſt popular man in Alleghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny county: but the ſingle circumſtance of the advertiſement had reduced him to that ſituation in the opinion of the people, that I thought it neceſſary to uſe ſome delicacy in preſenting myſelf with him.</p>
               <p>We deliberated ſome time, whether we ſhould go on to Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville's houſe. I mentioned to ſheriff Gralt expreſsly, my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions with regard to Gibſon and Wilkins; and hinted it to the gentlemen themſelves, with as much delicacy as poſſible; and expreſſed a willingneſs to go forward myſelf, to bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, if they would remain where they were. Judge Wilkins appeared to me to underſtand his ſituation perfectly; but though not thinking it ſafe to go forward himſelf, yet did not like the idea of any elſe going, and himſelf not to go. This was not expreſsly ſaid, yet I could ſufficiently diſcover it; and I knew it was a delicate conflict between his ſafety and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. It was the general opinion, that all ſhould go, or none. This put an end to all thought of any going.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſentiments of my mind, at the time, with regard to judge Gibſon and judge Wilkins, have never been fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to thoſe gentlemen to this hour, and perhaps they have never underſtood them perfectly; but this ſituation in which they were with regard to the people, will ſhew the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of ſuppoſing, that they could have called out the poſſe comitatus. The attempt would have been the ſignal of their own immediate deſtruction. They would not have lived on the weſt of the mountains twenty-four hours.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <p>THE day after, in the evening, a David Hamilton, a juſtice of the peace, and John Black, came to Pittſburgh; with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in writing, to demand of the marſhal, a ſurrender of his writs which had been ſerved; agreeably to his engagement, as they ſaid, for which Neville the younger had become ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. A conference with the marſhal, and with Neville, took place. It was denied, on the part of the marſhal and Neville, that the engagement was, to deliver, or even not to return the writs; but only to make no farther ſervice. It was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood otherwiſe on the part of Hamilton; who thought it but of ſmall account to make no farther ſervice, as it could be of no uſe to thoſe on whom the proceſs had been ſerved. This led to the queſtion, Whether the marſhal was bound to return; and what would be the effect of the return? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ether judgment could be taken, which would bind the lands here; ſo that they could be ſold in Philadelphia?</p>
               <p>The marſhal conceived it, from what he had underſtood, to be but an initiatory proceſs; and that judgment could not be taken; that there muſt be another writ, and ſervice of it, in order to found a judgment: He referred them to my opinion, which he conceived muſt be to that effect. John Black waited upon me; ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his queſtion, and explaining the circumſtances which led to his putting it. I felt all the delicacy of having any converſation with perſons, who I conceived had involved themſelves in the guilt of high treaſon; much leſs, of giving any counſel on a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral queſtion. I anſwered him, by ſaying, it was a delicate point, and I would talk with the marſhal. I went out, and found the marſhal, and ſtated to him the circumſtance; and wiſhed to know his wiſh, whether I ſhould conſider the caſe, and give an opinion. He ſaid he would ſpeak with Neville. A ſhort time afterwards, he came to me, with Neville, (I ſpeak of Neville the younger), and expreſſed his willingneſs that I ſhould give an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; that he thought it muſt be as he had ſtated, viz. that it was but an initiatory proceſs, and that judgment could not go by default, upon it. Declaring myſelf unacquainted with the practice of the federal court, though admitted in it; and that I could form my opinion only by analogy, and from the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028332_0021_0FD899D901A1E090"/>
face of the writ itſelf, I undertook the conſideration of the queſtion that evening, and propoſed giving an anſwer in the morning. With a view to this, the marſhal furniſhed me with one of his writs; the only one, I underſtood, which had not been ſerved. Neville the younger, furniſhed me with a copy of the laws of the United States; my own being, at that time, out of my office. I ſtate theſe things minutely, to ſhew, that no preſumption exiſts, in the circumſtance of having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted by theſe people, or in giving an opinion in this caſe, that I was in confidence, in any of their tranſactions.</p>
               <p>Conſulting the judiciary laws of the United States, I found nothing relative to the practice of the courts, or the nature of the proceſs. Nor did I much expect it; as this can be deviſed and regulated by the courts themſelves. I found nothing in the revenue law itſelf; and was left to a conſideration of the writ from the words of it, and the analogy to the practice of other courts. It appeared to me, as the marſhal had conceived, to be but in the nature of a ſummons, to ſhew cauſe why proceſs ſhould not iſſue. I preſume, it had been deviſed by the court, for the greater mildneſs in carrying into operation the exciſe law. It was analagous to the ſubpoena from the court of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery; in diſobedience of which an attachment iſſues. My an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer therefore, which I gave in writing, and which I gave to ſerve the marſhal, for it was without ſee from any one, was to this effect, viz. That the marſhal was on oath to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of his writs; but that judgment could not be taken on theſe returns, which would be final, and bind their lands in this country, or ſound proceedings to a ſale. Of this opinion, I made out two copies; and gave one to Hamilton and Black, and one to the marſhal.</p>
               <p>Hamilton was apprehenſive that this would not ſatisfy the committee: that if the people had known the marſhal was bound to return his writs, he doubted much if he ever would have got off the ground. I communicated this to the marſhal; and he appeared, as there was reaſon, much ſtruck with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He ſaw the impoſſibility of ſatisfying theſe people, and the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of getting out of the country, ſhould he attempt to go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their conſent: It would be leaving Neville the younger al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, in a diſagreeable ſituation, who had become ſurety, that he would not go away, until the people were ſatisfied as to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment of what he had engaged.</p>
               <p>I have ſince aſcertained it, as I have ſtated in my narrative, that the marſhal expreſsly refuſed to engage not to return his
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028332_0022_0FD8858EA7218C30"/>
writs: but it had been underſtood otherwiſe; or, on reflection, they had ſeen, that this was the principal matter, and they were determined to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſt upon it.</p>
               <p>I made the marſhal's caſe my own, with as much ſenſibility as the human heart could feel: and deviſing an expedient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, communicated it to him; viz. That I would propoſe going forward to the committee, and offer to appear for them in the federal court, as counſel, and have the writs quaſhed, or the ſervice ſet aſide; or if I did not accompliſh this, pay the penalties myſelf: that I knew the court, under theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, would not exact the penalties. But, that it would not be neceſſary to make this offer, but in the laſt reſort. The marſhal thought ſo.</p>
               <p>I had underſtood, that the committee were then ſitting, at the diſtance of four miles, at the public houſe that has been mentioned; Shochan's. The idea of a number of men being there, had been held out by Hamilton and Black, for their own ſafety in the town. Being now about to return, they men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the going by the battle ground, as they called it; that is, by the late houſe of the inſpector; in order to look for the body of a man that was miſſing, and ſuppoſed to be killed; and they expreſſed a wiſh, that I, and ſome others of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, would go with them. I ſaw they were under ſome apprehenſions for their ſafety, in going by themſelves; either from thoſe who might way-lay them on the road, or from the negroes on the farm. The laſt only was ſuggeſted. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to go, provided ſome others could be got to go; and more eſpecially, as in that caſe, I would go on to the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, which would be in my way, on another road, on my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I mentioned this to the marſhal, who approved of it: To Neville alſo, if I recollect right. I had underſtood, that ſeveral gentlemen propoſed to go: I was ready on the Monon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gahela bank, at the ferry, at the time propoſed. Hamilton and Black were there. Two of the gentlemen came down, and mentioned, that they had not found it convenient to go. I ſaw a delicacy on their part; and this made my going the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate. I had determined not to go. But at that inſtant, a Mr. Johnſtone, a deputy exciſe officer, came up, who wiſhed to go to his reſidence, at the houſe of Neville the younger, juſt by the late reſidence of the inſpector. He had been a tenant, for ſome time, to Neville the younger. I thought I might go, at leaſt that diſtance, having him with me: and I ſpoke to Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Black, to wait until he could get his horſe, and go.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028332_0023_0FD899DA94D86918"/>
We waited a long time, and then propoſed to croſs the river, and wait for him on the other ſide. We did ſo; and croſſing after us, he joined us there.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of our converſation on the way, I underſtood from Hamilton, that, agreeably to his orders from the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, he had been with the inſpector, and demanded of him a reſignation of his office; that Neville the younger had wiſhed him to reſign, and that the inſpector himſelf had agreed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign it, and had written ſomething to that effect, which he had offered to them, to carry to the committee; but that it was conditional and not abſolute, and they could not accept it: that they thought it probable the conſequence would be bad, and there would be no reſtraining the people from coming into Pittſburgh, to take him; that he was apprehenſive alſo, they would come in to demand the marſhal, and at leaſt detain him priſoner, ſo that he could not be able to return his writs. I meditated on the ſtrange inconſiſtency, of ſetting the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at defiance, and yet fearing the return of the writs.</p>
               <p>I underſtood alſo, from Hamilton, that the return of the marſhal himſelf, without the conſent of the people, was imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable; as there was not a ſingle road from the country, which was not that day guarded, for the expreſs purpoſe of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. Hamilton, at the ſame time, expreſſed himſelf with humanity, for the marſhal; and ſaid, that it was to prevent miſchief, that he had propoſed coming into Pittſburgh: For, that the people aſſembled at the interment of M'Farlane were in a rage, and had propoſed marching into Pittſburgh, to take the inſpector and the marſhal; that it was the language of the people, with regard to the marſhal, that it was better one man ſhould die, than ſo many perſons, with their families, loſe their plantations. He alſo gave me to underſtand, that there would not be, that day, a ſingle office ſtanding in the whole ſurvey. I conceived from this, that meaſures of an extenſive nature had been taken.</p>
               <p>On the way, I underſtood that, in fact, there was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee ſitting nearer than at the diſtance of 14 miles, near the place of the interment of M'Farlane.</p>
               <p>Arriving at a houſe where the family of the deputy exciſe officer had retired, and near the late houſe of the inſpector, we ſtopped; and the deputy making out his reſignation, delivered it, to be carried to the committee. He wiſhed Hamilton to give him a certificate, that he might be ſafe. Hamilton ſaid he had no authority to do this; he could only bear his reſignation: But
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028332_0024_0FD899DFE2B062E8"/>
that he thought he would be ſafe, provided he publiſhed a copy of his reſignation in the Pittſburgh Gazette. The deputy ſaid he would do it: and I ſubjoin it, in a note, as it was, and as it appeared in the gazette <note n="*" place="bottom">Finding the oppoſition to the revenue law, more violent than I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; regretting the miſchief that has been done, and may, from the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of meaſures; ſeeing the oppoſition changed from diſguiſed rabble to a reſpectable party; think it my duty, and do reſign my commiſſion.

               <p>We went, the deputy accompanying us, to the late houſe of the inſpector, and found the negroes in ſome cabbins adjoining, which the fire had not reached. It was out of theſe they had fired upon the firſt party, under Holcroft. I underſtood al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that notwithſtanding the attention of the negroes to ſecure the bacon, ſome of it had been carried off.</p>
               <p>We rode over the adjacent ground, but found no dead body. It was found, a few days afterward, by the negroes; and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>
               <p>Having finiſhed our ſurvey, I was urged by Hamilton and Black, to ride with them, at leaſt to a road which led to Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, and was in their way: I excuſed myſelf, and returned with the deputy. The deputy returned with me to the lower ferry, on the Monongahela, oppoſite the town of Pittſburgh. That being his ferry, and not mine, I rode on to a higher. A violent guſt of wind and rain, ſuch as I have ſeldom ſeen, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, I remained in the ferry-houſe, during the ſtorm. Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the river, and arriving at my houſe, I was informed, that the marſhal had been frequently there that day, enquiring with great ſolicitude for my return. I would have called upon him inſtantly, but it was late; and a town-meeting, in the affair of a market houſe, to which I was ſummoned, engaged my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Neville the younger, and Craig the ſon-in-law, and Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patrick, were preſent, and joined in the deliberation. I had no idea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that, in the mean time, and in the middle of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible tempeſt that had fallen, the inſpector and the marſhal had embarked, and deſcended the river.</p>
               <p>In my return from accompanying Hamilton and Black, I had projected in my mind, the plan of reſcuing the marſhal. It was to acompany him inſtantly to the town of Waſhington, and put him on the honour and good policy of the Democratic Society of that place. I had thought he would have been ſafe there; as the idea of being guardians of the conſtitutional principle,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028332_0025_0FD899E2B7872DF0"/>
would have led them to protect him. I thought of having him accompanied thence to Union-town, in Fayette county; and to have got general Douglaſs of that place, and other gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, to have eſcorted him to the Maryland or Virginia line, where he would have been out of danger; eſcaping the Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania counties, in which he had ſerved proceſs.</p>
               <p>Early next morning, I went to the public houſe where the marſhal lodged, and enquired for him; was told he had lodged at the garriſon: enquired frequently in the courſe of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon; but the rumour ſpreading, that he was gone, and the inſpector with him, the preceding evening, I found it was ſo; but was led to believe, he had aſcended the Allegheny river. I had ſuppoſed, he had taken the courſe by Fort Franklin, and the back parts of Pennſylvania; and thought it a judicious courſe. The courſe that he did take was the beſt.</p>
               <p>The queſtion has been aſked, why it was the magiſtrates did not iſſue warrants, and arreſt Hamilton and Black, when they came to Pittſburgh? They did not dare to do it: They were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ag officers from a great power. There was no perſon ſo inconſiderate as to break a thought of it. After the burning of Neville's houſe, the rumour was that another body was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling to come to Pittſburgh, to demoliſh the inſpection houſe kept there; and it was dreaded that they would proceed to other enormities. It was the cry of the inhabitants that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than provoke the country, and bring mad people upon us, it would be beſt to pull the office down. The evening that Hamilton and Black came to town, the report of two having come, had in half an hour ſwelled to two hundred; and it was ſaid there was a thouſand on the hill, on the other ſide of the river. The people were gazing every where, and every one thought he ſaw ſome, and that they had hunting ſhirts. Application was made to Hamilton and Black in my preſence, ſtating that the ladies, thoſe of the Neville fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly particularly, were uneaſy, and requeſting one of them to croſs the river and aſcertain the truth of the circumſtance. Black gravely anſwered, that there might be ſix or eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred on the hill, or not far off; but that he would croſs over, and give orders to diſperſe: He croſſed the river, and came back with an account that there had been none there.</p>
               <p>Craig, the ſon-in-law of the inſpector, after the departure of the inſpector, had ſo juſt an apprehenſion of danger from the country, that he took down the paper on the inſpection of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and called a gentlemen to witneſs, that it was down.

This gentleman was James Lang, of Brownſville. He alſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the fragments of it to this gentleman, to bear to the country, to convince them that it was down. Theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſhew the abſurdity of talking of arreſting Hamilton and Black.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>ON Monday, the 21ſt of July, being the fourth day after burning the houſe of the inſpector, and the ſecond after the departure of the marſhal, in the afternoon of the day, a young man came to my office, and delivered me a note from David Hamilton, informing me, that the committee was to ſit at the Mingo meeting-houſe, on the Wedneſday following, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing a wiſh that I would be preſent. I conceived, that it was with a view to the object he underſtood me before to have, in propoſing to go to the committee; viz. the explaining to the people the effect of the return of the writs, and inducing them to be ſatisfied, and not to arreſt or detain the marſhal. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, I was greatly alarmed, at the idea of having any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with one involved in the guilt of treaſon. I tore the note, and threw it by in the lower part of a cloſet in my office, amongſt uſeleſs papers, meaning never to make farther mention of it.</p>
               <p>The next day, Neville the younger came to my office, and aſked me, if I had not received a note from David Hamilton? I have, ſaid I; but how have you come to the knowledge of it? The young man, ſaid he, that brought it, mentioned it. I had never intended to have mentioned it, ſaid I; but here it is; opening the cloſet, and taking up the pieces, and putting them together, and giving them to him to read. I wiſhed to have him as a witneſs of the contents. Do you mean to go<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid he. No, ſaid I; this is high treaſon that has been com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted; and in treaſon there are no acceſſaries, before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> after the fact, all are principals; and I am aware of the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, of having any thing to ſay to people in the predicament in which theſe are. I have reflected on the ſubject, and think it not ſafe to go. I would wiſh you to go, ſaid he; it might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a good end. Connecting in my mind, his engagement on behalf of the marſhal, who had gone, and his reſponſibility in that caſe, I underſtood him, to wiſh me to go to reconcile the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028332_0027_0FD899E452A135F8"/>
people with the circumſtance, as far as might be; and alſo to counſel moderation in general. Not a word paſſed with regard to my object in going; but I conceived it to be ſufficiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, what the object was. I was ſtill diſpoſed to decline it; but was ſolicited; and finally ſaid, I will go, provided you will vouch with what ſentiments I go. I will, ſaid he. And provided, ſaid I, ſome perſon can be got to go with me, to bear teſtimony of what I ſhall ſay, or do, on the occaſion. It was agreed, that I ſhould ſpeak to ſome, and he ſhould ſpeak to others. He did ſpeak to ſome, and I ſpoke to others. The perſons that agreed to accompany me, were, the chief burgeſs of the town, George Robinſon; the firſt aſſiſtant burgeſs, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah Tannehill; one of the regulators of the town. William H. Beaumont; Peter Audrain, and colonel William Semple, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly of Philadelphia, merchants.</p>
               <p>Setting out on the day, and arriving at the meeting, I was ſtruck, with finding, not a committee, as I had expected, of thoſe perſons who had been concerned in burning the houſe of the inſpector, but a large convention of others, with theſe, from a conſiderable diſtance. I conceived, that theſe perſons had come with the view of counſelling moderation, and deviſing the beſt means of healing what had been done: Yet, from the delicacy of the ſituation, there was a diſtance and ſilence amongſt all of us, as we reclined upon the graſs, or ſtrolled about, prior to the aſſembling of the meeting. I was upon terms of intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with many; and yet do not recollect to have exchanged a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle word with a man. Every countenance diſcovered a ſtrong ſenſe of the ſolemnity of that occaſion: Thoſe who had been involved, not more than thoſe who were afraid to be involved. It will be aſked me, How came any there who were afraid to be involved? I have accounted for my being there; but how came David Bradford James Marſhall, Edward Cook, and Craig Richey there? I ſelect theſe as inſtances. As to Marſhall and Bradford, I am a loſs to ſay any thing, by way of opinion, or deduction. I can only ſtate what I have underſtood from others, or what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s within my own knowledge. Not having had the leaſt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, by word or writing, with Marſhall or Bradford, prior to that day, or on that day, relative to the ſubject, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of my own knowledge. I have underſtood from others, that after the firſt attack upon the houſe of the inſpector, when the adjacent country was about to be rouſed to a ſecond attack, perſons went to the town of Waſhington, and called on Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall and Bradford to come forward, on that occaſion. They
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028332_0028_0FD899E5B39903D0"/>
declined it. The expreſſion of Bradford, reported to me, is, "I cannot act; you may do as you think proper." He alluded, as was underſtood, to his being the proſecuting counſel for the commonwealth; and, in that caſe, not at liberty to do what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might.</p>
               <p>After the deſtruction of the houſe, perſons went to Marſhall and Bradford, demanding of them to come forward, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port what was done, or they would burn their houſes. They had a claim upon them, as having been conſpicuous in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberative committees, with regard to the exciſe law; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that Bradford had encouraged them to what they had done, by his words, when urged to take part before the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I encourage, ſaid he: Good God! I never thought of ſuch a thing. Yes you did encourage, ſaid they; and if you do not come forward now, and ſupport us, you ſhall be treated in the ſame, or a worſe manner, with the exciſe officer. He found himſelf under the neceſſity of coming forward; and that being the caſe, he would ſeem, from that time, to have adopted the moſt violent counſels. Marſhall was obliged alſo to come forward; and thought it neceſſary, having come forward, to adopt violent counſels. I am of opinion, that both theſe men acted, in the firſt inſtances, under a ſubordination to popular influence. Be this as it may, it is not from a ſolicitude to make an apology for them, that I ſtate this; but from the wiſh that I have to ſhew the truth of the tranſactions. Edward Cook alſo came forward, probably, at the ſolicitation, and under the fear of the people. Craig Richey, and many others, I know did. They had, with great difficulty, avoided the going to the burning the houſe of Neville; but could not avoid, at leaſt the appearance of being with the people now. I have introduced the names of theſe perſons, becauſe they were conſpicuous at this meeting. It was opened, by putting Cook in the chair, and making Richey ſecretary.</p>
               <p>A letter was produced, and read, from Neville the younger, which had been ſent by a gentlemen of our company, ſtating, that his father and the marſhal had left the country; that the marſhal had not conſidered himſelf bound by that part of his engagement, which was to ſurrender himſelf when demanded, and of which engagement he (Neville) had become ſponſor; becauſe, after the engagement made, and the marſhal diſmiſſed upon it, he had been again arreſted, and was indebted to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for his eſcape. I did not think Neville had been ſo good a
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028332_0029_0FD899E853171D90"/>
caſuiſt. However, the people thought it ſubtilty, and were not ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>He ſtated, that, with regard to what had been done by them, they had burned his father's houſe, and they might burn his; but he had enough beyond their reach.</p>
               <p>As men of honour, he conceived, ſo far from blaming, they could not but approve the intrepidity of Kirkpatrick, in defence of the houſe of a friend.</p>
               <p>The fact was, they did not diſpute the courage of Kirkpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick; but they accuſed his obſtinacy, in obliging them to do what they had done.</p>
               <p>On the whole, the letter of Neville was not well couched, to anſwer the occaſion. It gave great offence; and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as an inſult.</p>
               <p>This, and other letters, being read, and diſcuſſed a little, Benjamin Parkinſon addreſſed the chair: "You know, ſaid he, what has been done: we wiſh to know, whether what has been done is right or wrong; and whether we are to be ſupported in it, or left to ourſelves." Theſe were the words: They im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed me with an agony of mind. There was ſilence for ſome time. Marſhall coming forward, obſerved, that it was not neceſſary to ſay, whether what was done was right or wrong; but what is now to be done? I was relieved at this, and thought him in the right train.</p>
               <p>Bradford now ſpoke: and to my great aſtoniſhment declared his approbation of what had been done, and called upon the meeting to pledge themſelves to ſupport it. His declamation was of conſiderable length, and extremely violent. Yet from my knowledge of the man, I doubted whether he ſpoke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his wiſh, or harangued according to the humour of the people, and from a fear of them.</p>
               <p>After he had ſpoken there was a dead ſilence. The queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be taken; Support, or not ſupport? My ſituation was delicate. There was but a moment between treaſon on the one hand, and popular odium on the other: popular odium which might produce perſonal injury before I left the ground. To withdraw would be the ſame thing as to oppoſe.</p>
               <p>Marſhall came to me, a thing which I ſuſpected from him, or ſome one elſe, and ſolicited me to ſpeak. I had been plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſcheme of an harangue. Having ſettled ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in my mind, I addreſſed the chair.</p>
               <p>I gave them a narrative of what had taken place at Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, ſince Hamilton and Black had been there: That the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028332_0030_0FD899ED0D8C5688"/>
marſhal with the revenue officer had left the country; and as was ſuppoſed, had aſcended or deſcended the river. That the inſpection office was ſhut up, the label which announced it taken down, (and here I related the circumſtance of Craig taking it down, painting it with ſome humour, and making them laugh at his expence.) This with a view to impreſs the idea, that I was diverted with the cataſtrophe of the office, and this as a ſubſtitute for ſaying any thing directly to approve what had been done. Putting them in good humour, I ventured to touch upon the ſubject more ſeriouſly. To avoid the giving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vote upon the queſtion, I ſtated "That we were not dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated for the purpoſe of giving a vote, but ſimply to give a narrative of what had taken place there, with reſpect to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe office, in order to calm the minds of the people, and render it unneceſſary for any force to come and take it down." It will be ſeen that I introduced the idea of a delegation, as an apology for not giving any vote.</p>
               <p>"As an individual, however, I was willing to give advice: what had been done, might be morally right, but it was le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally wrong. In conſtruction of law it was high treaſon. It was a caſe within the power of the Preſident to call out the militia." I ſaw this ſtruck them greatly: They had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained no idea that it would be cognizable otherwiſe, than in the county courts. But, ſaid I, "the Preſident will reflect upon the difficulty of getting the militia to march. They will be reluctant from the midland parts of Pennſylvania, from the upper parts of Maryland and Virginia. It will probably be neceſſary to bring them from Jerſey and the lower parts of the ſtates. For this reaſon the Preſident may be diſpoſed to give an amneſty." Here I ſtated the amneſty which had been given by the ſtate of Pennſylvania, in the caſe of the riot at Wilſon's houſe in Philadelphia, in 1779, as an example.</p>
               <p>I continued to obſerve, "That in order to obtain amneſty, an application muſt be made to the executive; that it would come with a better grace, and with more ſupport from thoſe not involved, on behalf of thoſe that were, than from thoſe that were involved; that it was not the intereſt of thoſe involved, to involve others; but to let them remain as they were, in order to act as mediating men with the government." Here I diſcovered rage in the countenance of Benjamin Parkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and others. They conſidered me as evading the ſupport which was more agreeable; viz. the coming fairly in with
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028332_0031_0FD899F066039528"/>
them in the tranſaction, and making it a common cauſe. I ſaw that they diſtruſted the certainty of an amneſty, and did not reliſh the idea of aſking it. I had therefore to impreſs two things ſtrongly; the neceſſity of aſking an amneſty, and the probability of obtaining it.</p>
               <p>In order to impreſs the firſt, I enlarged upon the want of power to ſupport what was done; the ſmall baſis on which they had to ſtand; a ſmall part of a ſmall country, not even the whole country weſt of the mountains, with them; unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided at the ſame time time with arms, ammunition, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources of war.</p>
               <p>In order to impreſs the laſt, the probability of obtaining an amneſty, I ſtated, "the evidences which the executive had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given, of a diſpoſition to avoid war; even to a degree that was blamed, or perhaps, blameable; in the caſe of the ſpoilations on our commerce, by the Britiſh, and in the caſe of the Indian tribes. Here I introduced the countermand of the Preſqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iſle eſtabliſhment, at the interference of the executive of the United States, in conſequence of threats from Cornplanter, a Seneca Indian; and, in order to put them in good humour, and at the ſame time lead to the point I had in view, the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticability of obtaining an amneſty, I indulged a good deal of pleaſantry at the expence of the executive, on the ſubject of Indian treaties: I introduced general Knox on the one ſide, and Cornplanter on the other; and made them make ſpeeches. Now, ſaid I, if Indians can have treaties, why cannot we have one two? Returning gradually to ſeriouſneſs, I concluded, by propoſing a larger meeting, perhaps co-extenſive with the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey; and ſending delegates to the executive, on the ſubject of an arrangement with regard to what had been raſhly, and, in legal conſtruction, criminally acted: that if this meaſure was adopted, though it would be inconvenient for me, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable in the heat of that ſeaſon, to take ſuch a journey; yet I was willing to be one, to go to the executive."</p>
               <p>I have been the more particular in giving the ſubſtance of my ſpeech on this occaſion, and the clue to underſtand it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it has been miſconceived; and the pleaſantry which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged on the ſubject of Indian treaties, conſtrued into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the executive. If the Preſident himſelf had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, perceiving my drift, he would have excuſed me. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, depoſitions were taken of this part of my ſpeech, and conſidered as an evidence of a <hi>male mens,</hi> a bad diſpoſition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards government.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:028332_0032_0FD899F1CBCA8A18"/>In the courſe of my ſpeech, I had perceived different impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, on the different deſcriptions of thoſe preſent. Thoſe not involved, were greatly relieved, and ſatisfied; and manifeſted this by the countenance, and by the nod of the head: Thoſe involved, the more diſcerning of them, were diſſatisfied; and manifeſted this by the countenance, and by the ſhaking of the head.</p>
               <p>After I had done ſpeaking, there was a total ſilence; and the greater part left their ſeats: a conſiderable part left the houſe. I went out, and walked about; waiting to learn what the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral impreſſion was. My company from Pittſburgh, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to me, that numbers of the people were diſſatisfied, and there appeared to be a murmuring amongſt them. Daniel Hamilton, who had been at the burning of Neville's houſe, but who was perſonally well diſpoſed to me, came to me, and informed me, that there was a conſiderable diſſatisfaction at what I had ſaid: that Benjamin Parkinſon, and that man, ſaid he, pointing to a man in a blue coat, with a black ſcarf on his arm; and who, I have ſince been told, whether truly or not I do not know, was a brother of M'Farlane that had fallen, are ſtirring up the people againſt you. On this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſtepped in, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what was doing there. I obſerved the chairman, Edward Cook, James Marſhal, David Bradford, and others, in a knot, or globe, in the centre of the houſe, converſing with their heads together, in a low voice. I paſſed by, in a ſlow walk, along the entry of the meeting-houſe. I was not aſked to ſtop, or join in the deliberation. I walked back; and, as I paſſed, juſt ſpoke to James Marſhal, and aſked what they were concluding on. He ſaid he did not know. I thought myſelf not truſted, and withdrew.</p>
               <p>I have ſince engaged Alexander Addiſon to make enquiry, and to find from Marſhal, or Cook, what was the ſubject of deliberation at the time. He informs me, that they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect that there was any thing material. I can only ſay, that the language of James Marſhal, on the motion of Parkinſon, and the conduct of Cook, in nodding from the chair, with an appearance of aſſent to me, in my propoſing, that thoſe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, ſhould remain ſo, had impreſſed me with an idea, that they were averſe to violent meaſures. However, I was ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed with what I then ſaw, and what I had heard out of doors, that I immediately went out, and found ſome of my company, and gave the hint to get off as ſpeedily as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. They collected, and ſet off. Mixing amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028332_0033_0FD899F3304E5928"/>
I made an apology that my company were going, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> wiſhing to loſe my company, I was about to go. I ſet off, and met John Cannon, who wiſhed me to ſtay. I ſaid it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material, for that not being delegated, I could give no vote on any queſtion. Getting off to ſome diſtance, we were called upon: but we haſtened our pace. Coming to the houſe where we had left our horſes, and having got them from the paſture, and dined, which might take up an hour; it was ſuggeſted by ſome of the company, that we had come off abruptly, and we might be accounted ſpies; and it might be well if I would go back, and ſhew myſelf, and make ſome apology. I had felt an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the kind myſelf; and taking my horſe, I rode back, and diſmounting, and leaving him in a bottom at a ſtream, at ſome diſtance, I walked up, as if I had not been at all away. I found that a great number of the people had gone, and ſome were going away. Thoſe remaining, were engaged in hearing ſome man, who was making the amende honourable, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining ſome conduct, or ſome expreſſions, which had indicated a diſpoſition to comply with the exciſe law.</p>
               <p>Having juſt ſhewn myſelf, I withdrew, returned, and joined my company. Before we ſet out, the maſter of the houſe where we were, an old gentleman, returned, and informed, that nothing had been done, but a large meeting agreed upon, at another day.</p>

               <p>When I ſaw it, I was not alarmed; I conceived that what I propoſed had been adopted; the inſtituting a negociation with the government, for the purpoſe of compoſing the diſturbance. The taking in the counties of Virginia, did not appear to me inexpedient, inaſmuch as outrages on deputies under the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe law, had been committed in ſome part of them. A Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would ſeem the beſt means, on the one hand, to eſtabliſh principles of acquieſcence with the law, until it could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutionally changed; and on the other, to prevail with the government, on ſuch aſſurances coming from the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to paſs over what had taken place. I had no idea that the government would give an amneſty, on any other principle, but that of gaining, for the future, a general acquieſcence; and that for this reaſon, an application from the individuals involved would avail little, becauſe they could promiſe but for themſelves only. However, converſing with general St. Clair, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be at Pittſburgh at this time, I was ſtruck with his obſerving, that ſuch a Convention would be dangerous. I had not ſeen it in that point of view; not ſuppoſing that any other object would be contemplated, than ſimply reſcuing the men who had involved themſelves in a capital offence, by putting it in the power of government to cover it with oblivion.</p>

                           <p>I preſume you have heard of the ſpirited oppoſition given to the exciſe law in this ſtate—matters have been ſo brought to paſs here, that all are under the neceſſity of bringing their minds to a final concluſion. This has been the queſtion amongſt us ſome days: "Shall we diſapprove of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of thoſe engaged againſt Neville, the exciſe officer, or approve? Or, in other words, Shall we ſuffer them to fall a ſacrifice to a federal proſecution, or ſhall we ſupport them?" On the reſult of this buſineſs we have fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated, and have determined, with <hi>head, heart, hand,</hi> and <hi>voice,</hi> that we will ſupport the oppoſition to the exciſe law. The criſis is now come: <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> or <hi>oppoſition</hi>—We are determined in the oppoſition—We are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in future to act agreeably to ſyſtem; to form arrangements, guided by <hi>reaſon, prudence, fortitude,</hi> and <hi>ſpirited conduct.</hi> We have propoſed a general meeting of the four counties of Pennſylvania; and have invited our brethren in the neighbouring counties in Virginia, to come forward, and join us in council and deliberation, on this important criſis; and conclude upon meaſures intereſting to the weſtern counties of Pennſylvania and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia. A notification of this kind may be ſeen in the Pittſburgh paper. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon's ferry is the place propoſed, as moſt central, and the 14th of Auguſt the time.</p>
                           <p>We ſolicit you, by all the ties that an union of intereſts can ſuggeſt, to come forward, to join with us in our deliberations.—The cauſe is common to us all; we invite you to come, even ſhould you differ with us in opinion; we wiſh you to hear our reaſons influencing our conduct.</p>

               <p>An act which was perpetrated the third day after the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of which Bradford was the author, ſtill further evinces it. But this act was projected before the meeting at Mingo creek. I ſpeak of the intercepting the mail. My information of the ſource of this, is a letter from Alexander Addiſon, of which the following is an extract:

                        <p>I have been purſuing the plan for robbing the mail, and can trace it no higher than Bradford. It was propoſed by him to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028332_0036_0FD899FCF5F34398"/>
Marſhal, on their way to Mingo meeting-houſe; Baldwin and David Hamilton were in company, and it was put on them to execute it. The object to be obtained was, to know the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of the people on the buſineſs carried on. The poſt to be robbed, was the poſt from Waſhington to Pittſburgh; and it was only when Baldwin and Hamilton ſent word, that they could not perform their part, and when it was then too late to intercept the mail to Pittſburgh, that the plan was chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to what was really executed. Bradford ſent his couſin Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, and Daniel Hamilton, I believe, ſent John Mitchell, who executed the buſineſs. My information is from a good ſource, and may be depended on. The matter, I believe, was not talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of at Mingo creek meeting-houſe, nor did Edward Cook know any thing of it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I have ſince ſeen Baldwin, and gave him to underſtand what I had heard: he bluſhed, and his expreſſion was, "How things will come out." He did not ſeem to wiſh to give me the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars himſelf, and I could not, on principles of delicacy, urge. I have taken an opportunity of introducing the ſubject to Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilton, but he waved it. I had a deſire to know how it was, that the firſt undertaking failed.</p>
               <p>The poſt was interrupted on the 26th of July, on the way from Pittſburgh, and near Greenſburgh. The packet from Waſhington and Pittſburgh was taken out. It was carried by Benjamin Parkinſon to Waſhington, and from thence it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied, by Bradford and Marſhal, and others, to Cannonſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, a village ſeven miles diſtant. It was there opened. No letter, on the late affairs, from any individual of Waſhington: There were letters from individuals of Pittſburgh; theſe letters gave great offence, and made the writers objects of reſentment.</p>
               <p>The reſult of the convention at Canonſburgh, at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the mail, was the iſſuing circular letters to the officers of the militia, propoſing a rendezvous at Braddock's field, for the purpoſe of a march to Pittſburgh. The object of the march was, the taking the magazines of the garriſon, and any military ſtores that might be found in the town. It was alſo contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated, to take the writers of the letters, and impriſon them in the jail of Waſhington. Theſe were the objects contemplated, according to the information given me: It may not be correct.</p>
               <p>What was the object of intercepting the mail, is queſtionable. Bradford was a weak man; but yet it ſeems hardly probable, that he could be ſo weak as to think it any object to know what
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028332_0037_0FD899FE778C8CF0"/>
people would think of what had taken place. He might eaſily know what individuals would write from his town, knowing what they were uſed to ſpeak in it. Knowing characters, he might know opinions. It is more probable, what has been ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by men of that town, viz. that knowing what ſome would write, if they wrote at all; and expecting theſe might write, and being an enemy, and wiſhing an advantage, he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to have it in his power to turn the rage of the people on them. If this was his object, he was diſappointed in it: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, he was ſufficiently incenſed againſt the writers of the letters; and whether it was this reſentment, that gave riſe to the idea of a march to Pittſburgh, for the purpoſe of arreſting theſe men, and this drew with it the idea of taking the maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine; or whether the taking the magazine was the primary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and this incidently brought in, I am not ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. It would ſeem probable, that the march to Pittſburgh, and the taking the magazine, would have been, at all events, attempted, as a neceſſary act to furniſh means of defending what had been done, the intercepting the mail. For it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, if we ſuppoſe the actors in this affair to have had reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they had made up their minds, to ſet the government at defiance: In that caſe, it became them to arm themſelves with the means of war.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028332_0038_0FD899FFF65AB410"/>
greater promptitude. When an officer diſapproved of it, he did not dare to conceal from his battalion, or company, that he had received ſuch a notice; and when communicated, it was the people commanding the officer, not the officer the people.— Call us out, or we will take vengeance on you, as a traitor to your country. The whole country was one inflammable maſs; it required but the leaſt touch of fire to inflame it. I had ſeen the ſpirit which prevailed, at the time of the ſtamp act, and at the commencement of the revolution from the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of Great Britain; but it was by no means ſo general, and ſo vigorous, amongſt the common people, as the ſpirit which now exiſted in this country.</p>
               <p>After my return from the Mingo meeting, I was called upon by great numbers from the country, on all ſides adjacent, in order to know the reſult of that meeting. I ſtated facts, but found, that, even on my own ſhewing, I was not about to be the ſubject of eulogium. They wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d have approved more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive counſels, and deciſive meaſures, to ſupport what had been done. Said I, to ſome of them, What will be the conſequence? a war will enſue. Well, ſaid they, let thoſe that do not chuſe to ſtand with the country, leave it; there will be enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind without them: what they leave will help to carry on the war.</p>
               <p>Knowing that the government could not poſſibly overlook the outrages committed, and finding theſe diſpoſitions in the people to ſupport them, I ſaw my ſituation perfectly; and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſed in my mind, the practicability of lying by, and remaining ſpectator, or the neceſſity of abandoning the country. I thought alſo of taking part, but the cauſe was not good; at the ſame time hazardous, and nothing to be got by it. A revolution did not ſuit me, nor any man elſe that had any thing to loſe, or was in a way of making ſomething. A ſeceſſion of the country from the government, preſented nothing, that could be an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028332_0039_0FD89A0181C932F8"/>
with me. The repealing the law, by an exhibition of force, might be the only thing in view, with the people, at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but I well knew they would not ſtop there. The op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing one law, would lead to oppoſe another; they would fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally oppoſe all, and demand a new modelling of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and there would be a revolution: or they would be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. For my part, I had ſeen and heard enough of revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to have any wiſh to bear a part in one. But to lie by wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> impoſſible; no man would be ſuffered to remain neutral. I thought, therefore, of emigrating. Theſe ſentiments have not remained unknown to all, but myſelf; I have vouchers of them. But I could refer, more fully, on this ſubject, to general John Wilkins, with whom I converſed daily, and who found himſelf preciſely in the ſame ſituation, and with the ſame reflections that I had. It had been conſidered, which way it would be moſt prudent to withdraw. He thought of going up the Allegheny, into the woods, under a pretence of improving and ſurveying lands. I thought of croſſing the mountains to Philadelphia: Nothing but the ſuddenneſs with which the march to Braddock's fields came upon us, prevented my being out of the way, at that time. It was impoſſible to make arrangements in ſo ſhort a period. When that came, I thought of nothing but weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blaſt, for the moment, and then making my eſcape.</p>
               <p>Reflecting on the conduct of thoſe, who had now become the principal actor, on the ſcene, I was not much ſurpriſed at that of Bradford: for I knew him to be capable of any folly; and the more abſurd the meaſure, he was the more likely to adopt it. But I was aſtoniſhed at that of James Marſhall, a man of good ſenſe, cool and deliberate. I had juſt heard of the part he acted in the intercepting, or at leaſt the opening of the mail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the orders for a rendezvous at Braddock's fields; when late in the evening, a relation of James Marſhall; having called upon me, on buſineſs at my houſe in Pittſburgh, I ſtated to him my ſurpriſe at the conduct of Marſhall; he ſaid he had not ſeen him, for he was of a part of the county, conſiderably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from Waſhington; but he was equally ſurpriſed with me. I explained to him ſtrongly my diſapprobation of what had been done, and wiſhed him, as he was about to return through the town of Waſhington, to explain my ſentiments to Marſhall. I have not ſeen him ſince, I mean the relation, and do not know whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>But whether my ſentiments were communicated to James Marſhall, or not, the ſentiments of others were, both to him and

               <p>It was carried that the march to Braddock's fields ſhould go forward. To ſhew their diſapprobation of the apoſtacy of Marſhall, the door of his houſe was tarred and feathered that night. Threats were alſo thrown out of perſonal injury, and he was under the neceſſity of declaring his readineſs to go forward. Threats were alſo thrown out againſt others. Indiſpoſition, lameneſs, preſſing buſineſs, was affected; many yielded to their fears, and thought it ſafeſt to go. Others were diſpoſed to go, with a view of endeavouring to moderate the multitude, and and prevent outrages. Of this laſt deſcription there were num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the principal officers of the militia, who came with battalions or companies, to humour them, and keep them from miſchief. The common language of the county, at the time, was, they were coming to take Pittſburgh; ſome would talk of plundering it; others of burning it. It was an expreſſion, that Sodom had been burnt by fire from heaven; but this ſecond
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028332_0041_0FD89A08F05828E0"/>
Sodom ſhould be burned with fire from earth. I believe plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was an object with many. The ſhopkeepers were told a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> their counters, by perſons cheapening their goods, that they would get them at a leſs price in a few days. The very women coming in from the country, would ſay, "that fine lady live<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in a fine houſe, but her pride will be humbled by and by." Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were coming to the blackſmiths with old guns, that had laid by a long time, to have them repaired. Others were buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up flints and powder from the ſtores; there were many that were ſuppoſed to be from diſtant parts, no one of the town knowing them. I ſaw ſome, whom I took for ſpies, who had been ſent to look at the ſtate of the garriſon, or of the town. I traced ſome without appearing to do it, and found them loung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from place to place, without ſeeming to have any thing to do.</p>
               <p>We had ſeen copies of the order of march; and now it was underſtood, from various accounts, that the people were on their way to Braddock's fields. Major Butler had been induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious to improve the defence of his garriſon; Major Craig had removed his family into it; Colonel Neville had prepared to defend himſelf in his own houſe. It was thought adviſable to have a town meeting, to conſider what was beſt to be done; notice was given of a meeting in the evening.</p>

               <p>A Town-meeting was aſſembled about duſk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> almoſt the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> of the town convened; General John Gibſon in the chair; Mathew Erneſt, Secretary.</p>
               <p>It was announced, juſt at this moment, that individuals had arrived from Waſhington, with a meſſage to the inhabitants of Pittſburgh, which they wiſhed to deliver. A committee of the meeting was appointed, to wait upon the perſons, and receive the meſſages. The committee were general Wilkins, George Wallace, and myſelf. The individuals from Waſhington were, Braid, Meetkirk, Blakenay, and Purviance. They had brought the mail, which had been intercepted, and were about to deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it to the poſt-office, with the letters which had been in it, except certain letters from individuals in Pittſburgh, which had given great offence, and which they were not to deliver; that theſe letters were from colonel Preſly Neville, to his father-in-law, General Morgan; General Gibſon to the governor of Pennſylvania; James Briſon, prothonotary, to the governor; Major Butler, to the ſecretary at war; and Edward Day, to the ſecretary of the treaſury. That theſe letters had made the writers obnoxious; and that it was determined by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, now on their march to Braddock's field, to take vengeance on them; that nothing could exceed their rage, that all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means had been uſed, by moderate men, to reſtrain them; that a great number of the principal men in the country had thrown themſelves in with them, and were coming along, with a view to reſtrain violence; that the prevailing idea was to ſeize the writers of the letters, and burn the town of Pittſburgh; that after all the means that could be uſed, it was doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it could be ſaved; that they had come, in confidence with the well diſpoſed, to give us notice, and concert with us, the means of our ſalvation; that it was with great difficulty they had made their way through the people; that notwithſtanding it was with the knowledge of Bradford and Marſhall, they had come, and who had delivered them the mail; yet in fact it was contrary to the wiſh of the multitude, who wiſhed no intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to be given, or an opportunity of eſcaping afforded to the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

fact they had been arreſted on the way, and addreſs had been neceſſary to be uſed in order to be ſuffered to come on; that there were two things which, in their opinion, it behoved the town to do; the one, to have the obnoxious perſons ſent away, and the other, to affect to join the people at Braddock's field, and take away the pretence of coming to Pittſburgh. For, that if they came, moſt aſſuredly lives would be taken, and the town laid in aſhes; that the obnoxious perſons were thoſe mentioned; but of theſe, Day and Briſon peculiarly ſo; that Abraham Kirkpatrick was obnoxious, on account of his defence of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville's houſe, and his being ſuppoſed to be the cauſe of the death of M'Farlane; that theſe three were the primary objects of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>entment of the people; that others were ſo, in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary degree. Perhaps it might be neceſſary for them to go; but that unleſs theſe were ſent away, as a neceſſary ſacrifice to the reſentment of the people, there would be no poſſibility of ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them from coming to the town, and executing any purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The meſſage from Waſhington was announced to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Pittſburgh, the names of thoſe, that were announced, read; Day and Briſon were preſent; it ſtruck every one, and perhaps theſe perſons themſelves, that it became neceſſary for them to be out of the way; it was thought adviſeable by their particular friends, about them. They ſeemed to acquieſce, ſo far as I could diſcover; I heard no objection. I do not know that Kirkpatrick was preſent, but Neville, his relation, was there; if he had any particular friends, they were there; for the whole town was preſent. There was no diſſent by any one, no previous queſtion, no objection. There was no man ſo deſtitute of ſenſe, as not to ſee the inſtant propriety of the meaſure. It was generally and perfectly underſtood, that theſe perſons acquieſced in the policy of the manoeuvre.</p>
               <p>It being then agreed upon, that theſe perſons, on the one hand, ſhould leave the town, under the idea of being baniſhed from it; and that the reſt of us ſhould put on a maſk of being with the people, and join them at Braddock's field, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that a committee ſhould be appointed to conduct the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the part we were to act: A committee of 21 was nominated by the chairman. It was entruſted to theſe to draw up ſomething that might be ſtruck off from the preſs, and ſent forward to the people at Braddock's field, informing them of what had been done, and what we were diſpoſed to do.</p>
               <p>The meeting being diſſolved, and the committee, now by ourſelves, for I had been appointed one, particular perſons,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:028332_0044_0FD89A144B2C13B0"/>
the more intimate with Kirkpatrick, were directed to call upon him, and explain the circumſtance; it was underſtood, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to us, on their return, that he was perfectly ſatisfied of the neceſſity of the caſe, and would ſet out in the morning. Day and Briſon had been preſent, and there was no neceſſity of ſaying any thing to them. They had declared themſelves ready to leave the town. I heard Briſon myſelf ſay, that he was perfectly ſatisfied that it had fallen upon him, having no family; that he had entertained the idea of taking a ride below, at any rate, and the inconvenience would not be great to be out of the way a while.</p>
               <p>It was agreed upon, to draw up, in the nature of reſolves, ſomething which might anſwer the purpoſe of maſking ourſelves with the people. It was done, and 600 copies ſtruck off, at the preſs, that night <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>Late at night, the committee having diſſolved, Henry Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viance, of Waſhington, came to me, and expreſſed a concern of mind, that the gentlemen of his company, thoſe from Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, who had come with the meſſage, had, as he conceived, from motives of delicacy, heſitated to expreſs, in the caſe of colonel Neville, and general Gibſon, the full extent of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in which they were; that he could not conceive on what principle colonel Blakeney, who had undertaken to explain the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028332_0045_0FD88591A8152390"/>
information, had made a diſtinction in the caſe of Neville and Gibſon: that they were certainly equally obnoxious with the others, and would be equally unſafe in the event of being found in the town, if the people ſhould march in; and it was cruelty in the effect, though humanity in the principle, not to inform thoſe gentlemen of the whole predicament in which they ſtood, I thought ſo too; and that it appeared to me very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, at the time of the diſtinction made; for the letter of Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was preciſely to the ſame effect with that of Briſon; and that of Neville appeared to me more likely to give offence to thoſe, who had become leaders in the inſurrection, than any thing in the letters of the others. This, coupled with his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſon of the exciſe officer, would ſeem likely to put him in the firſt liſt of thoſe that ought to be proſcribed.</p>
               <p>However, it was thought adviſeable to explain this to our committee. Having collected them, or a greater part of them together, it was explained by Mr. Purviance. It was thought proper, that thoſe gentlemen, Neville and Gibſon, ſhould be made acquainted with their ſituation, in the morning, that they might do as they ſhould think proper. Mr. Purviance was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to explain to them.</p>
               <p>General Gibſon came to me in the morning, and appeared to have a juſt ſenſe of what had been explained to him; and
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:028332_0046_0FD89A15DE946650"/>
requeſted my opinion candidly, as to his danger, and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency of his going to Braddock's field. I thought it not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient that he ſhould go; and added, that colonel Neville did not appear to me to have a proper impreſſion of his danger, and that I ſhould not think it adviſeable for him to go. Colonel Neville was anxious to go; but was prevailed upon not to think of it.</p>
               <p>The fact was, I thought it not only unſafe for theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to go, for their own ſakes, but impolitic for us; as it would deſtroy the effect of our maſk; as it would naturally oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, What! you in earneſt in the cauſe, and yet bring theſe obnoxious perſons along with you, as good citizens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>I had the ſame ſentiments with regard to general Wilkins, and on the ſame principles, would have thought it adviſeable for him not to go to the rendezvous; and it was a great queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the gentlemen of Waſhington, and with his friends in Pittſburgh, what he ought to do? the obnoxious advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was in the mouth of the people: However, he determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed finally to riſk the going. Gibſon and Neville thought it prudent not to go.</p>
               <p>Having marched, early in the day, to the place of rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, which was at the diſtance of about 8 miles, we halted two miles ſhort of it, and waited until the meſſengers from Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, ſhould go forward with a number of the hand-bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nounced a good effect from the hand-bills, and the information given of the expulſion of obnoxious charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. We then marched to the field, the committee in front, but without arms: this to evince that no oppoſition was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on our part. Advancing to the field, my reflections were not pleaſant: I was far from thinking myſelf ſecure from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal danger. I knew I had ſtood, in general, well with the country, before this period; but I had given myſelf a ſtab, as to my popularity, by what I ſaid at the Mingo meeting-houſe. I had underſtood, that a current of obloquy ran ſtrong againſt me, from that quarter. It had been announced, every day, in Pittſburgh, by the people from the country. In fact, I was thought to be at beſt but a half-way whig, as the term was, and Bradford the real man to be depended on. I have ſince underſtood, that it was a good deal debated amongſt the people, coming to the field, what my ſentiments were with regard to the exciſe law. Thoſe perſonally well affected to me, gave it
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:028332_0047_0FD89A1B1BE8C680"/>
as a proof that I was againſt the exciſe law, that I had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, in Philadelphia, ſome years ago, in the face of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſomething againſt the law, and put my name to it; and that I had brought ſuit againſt the exciſe officer, for ſomething done in the execution of his office. Theſe circumſtances gave a favourable impreſſion, and ſome were of opinion that my houſe ought not to be burned; others thought that it might as well go with the reſt. That converſation of this nature took place, amongſt the people, I have from many on the march with them to the field, and who were under ſtrong apprehenſions that, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all that could be done, great outrages would be committed.</p>
               <p>But independent of any unpopular thing lately ſaid or done, I well knew, that it was poſſible there were perſons there, who had a perſonal prejudice againſt me; though I could think of but two, that I thought it probable would be there, who had any; theſe were Benjamin Parkinſon and Andrew M'Farlane, the brother of him who had fallen before the houſe of Neville. The prejudice they had entertained, was of an old ſtanding; but I did not know but that it might ſtill exiſt in its full vigour. My backwardneſs at the Mingo meeting-houſe, I had reaſon to ſuppoſe, had increaſed the prejudice of Parkinſon; I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived M'Farlane to be of a fixed and perſevering diſpoſition, and if he was diſpoſed to injure me, the advantage he derived from his brother's fall, would give him great weight amongſt the people, and put it in his power. The idea of the people, at the time, was, that law was diſſolved, and that the people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in their collective capacity, were the only tribunal. There could be no idea, therefore, that the putting a man to death, who was obnoxious to the people, would be any offence. I mentioned my apprehenſions of M'Farlane and Parkinſon to ſome of our committee, as we rode; I think to Adamſon Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nehill for one.</p>
               <p>Though I had ſtood well with Bradford heretofore, yet I was apprehenſive of him now. He might be diſſatisfied at my not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting him at the Mingo meeting-houſe; and he might natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuppoſe, that it was ſome of the company with me, or perhaps myſelf, that had communicated the account of his ſpeech on that occaſion; of which ſpeech, the letters intercepted in the mail were conveying the intelligence to government; and on that account had drawn forth his reſentment againſt the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. I was apprehenſive that it would be enquired, upon the ground, who it was that had communicated this information to the writers. The fact was, we had all given it. I though it
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028332_0048_0FD88593B3434E68"/>
fortunate for us, that Briſon and Gibſon, who had touched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſpeech, were not there, to examine them. We would not have dared to juſtify the information, though we could not but acknowledge the having given it. We ſhould have had to have admitted the poſſibility of a miſtake, and ſaved ourſelves with the tyrant of the day, in the beſt manner poſſible.</p>
               <p>Under theſe perſonal apprehenſions for myſelf, and for the Pittſburgh people in general, it was propoſed by me, when near the ground, to advance with a flag, which, even a mob might regard; and pulling out a handerchief, which happened to be white, I put it on my whip. The committee were of opinion, that we ought not to ſeem to diſtruſt, and the flag was put down.</p>
               <p>The fears entertained on this occaſion, may appear unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable: not to any one who has ſeen a large and enraged body of men, under the command of one as mad as themſelves, or under no command at all. In the firſt caſe, they will execute what the one dictates; in the other, what any one ſuggeſts. In the preſent inſtance, I knew Bradford would have great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, but the people themſelves would have more; and there was reaſon to fear both. As to burning the town, it was doubtleſs more talked of, than intended individually; but the talking of it would produce the doing it, contrary to the wiſh of many who did talk of it. Such is the hiſtory of the human mind in a ſtate of anarchy.</p>

I was thinking of his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, when I turned my head a moment, and was ſtruck with the very man I was moſt afraid of, Andrew M'Farlane, juſt by me.

               <p>The next object that arreſted my attention was Bradford walking before a number of battalions, that had juſt croſſed the river, and were ranged upon the bank, to be viewed by him. I was ſolicitous to know what my reception would be. I knew that from his going on to the intercepting the mail, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of this movement of the people, without my knowledge, he had not expected aſſiſtance from me; and his not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating

                  </gap> there no danger of their coming back? our uſual anſwer was, They were gone; they would not be ſuffered to come back. Epithets of indignity were ſometimes uſed with reſpect to them, to maſk our ſentiments the better. It was ſaid by them, that more muſt go. Every one, from Pittſburgh, that I heard ſpeak at all, aſſented to every thing that was ſaid; for it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Having been ſome time upon the ground, I fell in with Benjamin Parkinſon, the other perſon of whom I had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally apprehenſive. He was in a group of men whom I knew to be warm in the cauſe. I advanced with great appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of confidence, and frankneſs of manner, and ſaluted them; I was received with cordiality, and thought myſelf very fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. All, or moſt of thoſe had been at the conflagration of the houſe of the inſpector, and had heard me at the Mingo meeting; but the Pittſburgh hand bill, and my appearance on the ground, now to join them, had effaced the unfavourable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mpreſſions.</p>
               <p>They ſat in a group upon the ground, each with his rifle in his hand, or lying by him. I ſat with them. The conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation turned upon the burning of the houſe; and they expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed great rage againſt Kirkpatrick, who had been the cauſe, as they ſaid, of the burning it, and the death of James M'Farlane, by his refuſing to let the houſe be ſearched for the inſpector's commiſſion and his papers. They expreſſed reſentment againſt Major Butler for ſending out ſoldiers to the houſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpector. They had enquired for Ormſby, who had accompanied Neville the younger, and the Marſhal from Pittſburgh. I ſaid he was upon the ground, but was ſcarcely worth enquiring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He was an inconſiderate young man that would go any where. He had gone there, and he had come here, and it was little matter what he did; that we had heard in what manner they had treated him, when they had him a priſoner; that they had taken his horſe and piſtols and hanger from him; and put him on the bare back of a colt to ride, as a ſteed congenial with his years and diſcretion. I had heard ſomething like this;
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:028332_0051_0FD89A1F9DDBF778"/>
but whatever might have been the caſe, I was diſpoſed to give them the impreſſion that I was diverted with the circumſtance; and therefore put them on the relation of it, and laughed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately; but concluded that he had been ſufficiently puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his apprehenſions, on that occaſion; and as he had gone there without the knowledge of his parents, and had come with their approbation here, it was not worth while to mind him. It was agreed it was not.</p>
               <p>I did not know, that in the mean time, the young man had been on the point of aſſaſſination.</p>
               <p>Fifteen men had painted themſelves black, as the warriors amongſt the Indians do, when they go to war. They had gone in ſearch of Ormſby. Zedick Wright of Peter's creek had diſcovered it, and having a good will for the family, or from motives of humanity, made haſte to give him intelligence of it. He had eſcaped but a few minutes, not a quarter of an hour, when they were ſeen to paſs by openly in purſuit of him. He made his way to Pittſburgh, in the courſe of the day, by devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous routes, and lay concealed in the barracks of the old garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, until the whole cavalcade was over.</p>
               <p>I was greatly diſconcerted, on one occaſion, in the courſe of this day by James Roſs of Waſhington. It was the firſt time I had ſeen him on the ground, when, ſitting with two or three others, at the root of a tree, paſſing by, ſaid he to me, with a ſmile, you have got a great of ſubtility; but you will have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for it all. I was alarmed, and looked about to ſee who muſt have heard him. There were none near me, but thoſe juſt with with me, whom I knew, and who were wearing the the maſk alſo. But I gave him to underſtand that he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed me, for he could not know the characters of thoſe with me; he ſaid he did, and conſidered that before he ſpoke. Talking of the arrangements made, he thought the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs well managed on part of the town; and that nothing elſe could have ſaved lives and property.</p>
               <p>People were coming in from every quarter all that day; gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally armed: but ſome without arms. It was impoſſible to know the real ſentiments of almoſt any one amongſt the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: how far they were there from neceſſity or of choice. Every man was afraid of the opinion of another. Sometimes a word dropped, which might be conſtrued away, if not well taken, would lead to a confidence. The great bulk of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were certainly in earneſt; and the revolutionary language and the ideas of the French people, had become familiar. It
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028332_0052_0FD89A20EFF17BB8"/>
was not taring and feathering, as at the commencement of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f even Bradford himſelf, that day, had ventured to check the violence of the people, in any way that was not agreeable to them; and had betrayed the leaſt partiality for the exciſe law; or perhaps even a remiſſion of his zeal againſt it, he would have ſunk, in an inſtant, from his power, and they would have hung him on the firſt tree. Yet he was weak enough not to have foreſeen this; it had been an argument uſed with him, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading him from a perſeverance in the meaſure undertaken, that no man could calculate the conſequence of putting the maſs in motion, with arms in their hands. His anſwer was, that he could ſay to them, Hitherto ſhalt thou go, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Certain it is that his influence was great. I ſaw a man wade into the river, lift cool water from the bottom of the channel, and bring it his hat to him to drink. Applications were made to him that day for commiſſions in the ſervice.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, whatever his idea might have been, he would have ſeen the extent of his power, if he had ventured to tell the people that they ſhould return without going on to Pittſburgh. It was the object of all men who were apprehenſive of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, to diſſuade from this; but it appeared very doubtful, through the whole day, whether or not it was practicable. It was afterwards found that it was not.</p>
               <p>Towards the evening, there was a council of the Pittſburgh committee. It had been repreſented to them, and was the fact, that the people from the town, not expecting to detain that night, had brought no proviſions with them; it was ſuggeſted that they might be ſuffered to return to town, and be at the place of rendezvous early in the morning. It was thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, and orders were given accordingly.</p>
               <p>I had ſeen general Wilkins but little through the day; he had remained cloſe with the Pittſburgh people, and ventured little though the multitude. On his firſt coming, he had gone up to Bradford, apprehenſive that he might denounce him, and addreſſed him: "Sir, have you any thing againſt me?" No, ſaid he. This reſolute behaviour probably prevented him hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing to ſay.</p>
               <p>On its being known that the people of Pittſburgh were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home for the night, there was a great clamour in the camp. It was ſaid, they were about to deſert the cauſe; and in fact never had been ſincere in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:028332_0053_0FD89A2666497BB0"/>The fact is, there were of them ſhrewd enough to diſcover this. Some would ſay, pleaſed with our addreſs, but who would rather have had us all in earneſt, "You have acted well; but we underſtand you. We give you credit for your management." It would be anſwered, "What! do you doubt our ſincerity?" They would ſay, "We do not diſpute your good policy."</p>
               <p>Finding the effect of the departure of the Pittſburgh people, it was thought adviſeable to countermand the leave given. I rode after them with great haſte, and turned them to the field; with orders not to leave it, let their want of food be what it might, rather than produce a diſſatisfaction with the people on the ground, and bring them irregularly, and in bad humour, to the town. It will be aſked, Whence had I this authority? and how was I obeyed ſo readily? I was of the committee to whom the power had been entruſted of conducting all affairs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the occaſion.</p>
               <p>On my return with the Pittſburgh people, I ſaw James Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, for the firſt time, upon the ground. I ſaw he was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here in his mind at the trouble he had brought upon us; and had great ſolicitude with regard to the event. I explained to him the diſſatisfaction that had taken place at the departure of our people, and wiſhed him to ride through the camp, and give information that he ſaw us all returned. He mounted his horſe, with his rifle in his hand, and ſet out to do it.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of the day, a great ſubject of converſation had been, the taking the garriſon. It would ſeem to have been the original object of the movement; but had been laid aſide. On what principle I do not know; whether on account of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of accompliſhing it; or the projectors of the enterpriſe heſitating to make war ſo immediately on the United States. I ſhould rather think it was the danger of the enterpriſe that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated on the mind of Bradford: for he would naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that he could not avoid taking a part in the attempt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and I have no idea that he was a man of courage under certain danger. The reaſon oſtenſibly aſſigned, at the relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhment of this object, was, that it was found the military ſtores in the garriſon were intended for the campaign againſt the Indians; and it would be improper to derange the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that campaign, by ſeizing them. This part of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe had been abandoned by the projectors of it; but the rumour had gone abroad, and it was not generally known to the people that it was abandoned. The query, every where, was, Were we to take the garriſon? I anſwered always, that
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028332_0054_0FD88597481E9918"/>
we were. The query then was, Could we take it? It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, No doubt of it. But at a great loſs? Not at all; not above a thouſand killed, and five hundred mortally wounded. This loſs, to the more thinking part, appeared very ſerious.</p>
               <p>Various modes were propoſed of taking it: Some thought of providing ſtakes, with ſharpened points, and ruſhing up with thoſe, and putting them in the port holes, obſtruct the firing from them; while others were cutting away the pickets. In the mean time, others with their rifles taking off the men at the guns, in the block-houſes of the baſtions, as the Indians took off the artillery men, in St. Clair's expedition. I was aſked, what was my plan of taking it? I ſuggeſted the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining and blowing up a baſtion: but they would fire upon the diggers; beſides, it would waſte powder.</p>
               <p>To ſome complaining, that called out ſo haſtily, they were not well furniſhed with proviſions, I propoſed ſtarving out the garriſon; but theſe were apprehenſive they would ſtarve out themſelves.</p>
               <p>After night I had a great deal of converſation on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in the buſhes, and at the ſides of ſences; laying our heads together, and whiſpering. I was for the moſt deſperate mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; but admitted that much blood muſt be loſt.</p>
               <p>About midnight, I rode through the camp, where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were laying at the fires, in their blankets or without. I made a pretence of enquiring for the Pittſburgh battalion; and this with a view, at the ſame time, to let them know that the Pittſburgh people were upon the ground. My principal object was, to aſcertain the determination of the people, with regard to their coming to Pittſburgh. I found the univerſal ſentiment to be, that they would ſee the town. There was little ſleep in the camp. The firing and ſhooting had ceaſed; but there was a continual converſation.</p>
               <p>Coming up to a fire, a perſon to whom I was known accoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me: Is Kirkpatrick gone? ſaid he. He is gone. And why the devil did you let him go? ſaid a perſon ſtarting up behind him. The queſtion came ſo ſuddenly upon me, that I was a little ſtruck with it; but recovering, I replied, that it was no fault of mine that he wont away; I would rather have kept him here, and puniſhed him by law. This was the truth; for I was proſecuting him at that very time, for miſdemeanors. The enrage, or enraged man, as I may call him, made no reply; but the perſon who firſt ſpoke to me, gave me a touch in the ſide, and ſaid, Come, take a dram: we will not detain you. This
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028332_0055_0FD89A27CEBB58D8"/>
I underſtood to be a hint to go away. I give this incident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe; that having mentioned it afterwards, it was uſed by ſome as a proof that I had endeavoured to inflame the people againſt Kirkpatrick, by talking of puniſhing by law. It is true, the man deſerves my reſentment: nevertheleſs, I had too much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for my own feelings, and the opinion of the public, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail myſelf of that occaſion to do him any injury. But my expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in the caſe mentioned, was equivocal; and was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by them as it was intended it ſhould be underſtood; viz. as relating to the circumſtance which was the ground of their reſentment, the defending Neville's houſe; my inſinuation was, that this was puniſhable by law. The thought was new to the man, and it occupied his mind for the moment.</p>
               <p>Paſſing on to a range of fires, I found Hamilton's battalion. This had arrived late in the evening; it had been long expected, and was called the bloody battalion. The greateſt part of it had been at the burning of the inſpector's houſe. We expected deſperate meaſures when theſe came. It was commanded by John Hamilton, a man very moderate and reaſonable; and who was diſpoſed to reſtrain the people from violence, and with that view had come with them.</p>
               <p>Daniel Hamilton, his couſin, was the firſt that accoſted me; and wiſhing to ſerve me with the people, called out, This is a true whig. But what do you think of that damn'd fellow, James Roſs? he has been here, and all through camp, perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people not to go to Pittſburgh. I ſaw now that it was in vain to oppoſe the going; and it was better to acquieſce, and ſay they ſhould go. In that caſe, there would be more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of them, than if they came in ſpite of oppoſition. I ſaw this, and took my part decidedly.—Damn the fellow, ſaid I, what buſineſs has he with Pittſburgh? the people of Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh wiſh to ſee the army; and you muſt go through it, and let the damn'd garriſon ſee, that we could take it, if we would. It will convince the government that we are no mob, but a regular army, and can preſerve diſcipline, and paſs thro' a town, like the French and American armies, in the courſe of laſt war, without doing the leaſt injury to perſons or property. There was a general acclamation, and all profeſſed a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to moleſt no one.</p>
               <p>Returning to a farm houſe, juſt by the camp, where ſome of our committee were, I communicated the reſult of my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations. Some of them had been through the camp, in the ſame manner; and had the ſame impreſſions that I had, with
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:028332_0056_0FD89A29371E8CC8"/>
regard to the impoſſibility of preventing the people coming to town.</p>
               <p>In the morning, having convened in the camp, and held a council of principal officers, it was propoſed to form a commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, to conſiſt of three deputies from each regiment, who ſhould deliberate on what was to be done. Deputies being choſen, and the committee met, of which I was one, as repreſentative, with general John Wilkins, and captain John M'Maſters, for the militia of Pittſburgh; in order that our deliberations might be the more free, it was propoſed to withdraw to ſome diſtance. We withdrew, and occupied a ſhady ground in the wood. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cook was appointed chairman. Bradford opened the meeting, by ſtating the cauſe of their aſſembling in arms; viz. in order to chaſtiſe certain perſons, who had diſcovered ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments friendly to the exciſe law; that their ſentiments had come to light through the vigilance of ſome perſons, who had intercepted the mail, and found their letters; that theſe letters would ſpeak for themſelves. Here taking out the letters from his pocket, he read them and commented on them. That, from major Butler of the garriſon, giving ſome account of the outrages committed, and his ſenſe of the atrocity. That, from Neville, the ſon of the inſpector, alluding to the authors of the diſturbance and giving them the epithet of raſcals. That, from Edward Day, ſuggeſting a project of carrying the exciſe law into operation. That, from general Gibſon, ſtating a motion by Bradford, at the Mingo meeting, to ſupport the outrages committed. That, from the prothonotary Briſon, to the ſame effect. At the authors of theſe two laſt letters he appeared particularly enraged as diſtinguiſhing him at the Mingo meeting, and repreſenting him as making ſuch motion. Addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to me, Were you not there? did I make ſuch a motion? I looked at the man with aſtoniſhment. Is it poſſible, thought I, that you did not know the ſcope of your harangue? you did not make the motion, but you ſupported it, and that is all the inaccuracy in the ſtatement of the letter. But is it poſſible that you would regard the being diſtinguiſhed to the government, as ſupporting violent counſels, when you have diſtinguiſhed your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo effectually in the very act of obtaining theſe letters? however it was no time to explain; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It was now the queſtion, what reſolution ſhould be taken with regard to theſe men. It was propoſed and adopted, that the queſtion with reſpect to them ſhould be taken ſingly. The caſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There was no man ſo raſh as to queſtion the illegality of theſe acts; but it was obſerved by me, that being an officer of the United States, he was amenable to the executive, for any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hing unconſtitutionally done; and on a repreſentation to the Preſident, there could be no queſtion, but that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him; at leaſt from the command in this country. It would be therefore moſt adviſeable to take no order with regard to him, at that time, but poſtpone the conſideration of his caſe until the meeting at Parkinſon's ferry, and then remonſtrate to the executive, and obtain his recal. It was agreed.</p>
               <p>The caſe of Craig was taken up next. It was obſerved by me, that there was certainly ground of ſuſpicion of his being over zealous in behalf of the exciſe law; nevertheleſs it might be bad policy to order him out of the country at this time. In his capacity of quarter maſter, he had the care of the military ſtores that were ſent forward occaſionally, and intended for the campaign at that time carrying on againſt the Indians; that it might derange theſe operations, and give offence to the people of Kentucky, who were alſo againſt the exciſe law, to diſturb the quarter-maſter in his arrangements, and prevent the forwarding theſe ſtores. But he was alſo an officer of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, appointed by the ſecretary at war, General Knox, and that the ſame ſteps might be taken with regard to him, as with Major Butler; a repreſentation could be ſent, from the meeting at Parkinſon's ferry, to the ſecretary, with informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he was proſcribed by us, and a demand that he ſhould be ſuperſeded in his office, and proſcribed by him alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="unknown:028332_0059_0FD89A3427FEE828"/>The only difficulty that occurred to any one, in this caſe, was the queſtion, By whom he was appointed, and to whom the repreſentation ought to be made? was it not the Preſident that had appointed him? James Roſs, who was a member of the committee, but who attended late, came in juſt at this moment; and being of the Senate of the United States, and of courſe ſuppoſed to have an accurate knowledge of the ſource of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, the queſtion was put to him, Who it was that had the commiſſioning the quarter-maſter? It was his opinion, that though the Preſident was the conſtitutional ſource of appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet that, in fact, the ſecretary at war had the nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in theſe caſes. It was agreed, therefore, to addreſs Knox on the ſubject of Craig.</p>
               <p>Theſe being diſpoſed of, the caſe of Gibſon and Neville, the two letter writers, was taken up. On their behalf I ſpoke alſo: and with regard to Gibſon, obſerved, that he was a man of an inoffenſive diſpoſition, not much harm with him; could do little injury, go or ſtay; was a man in trade, and the being diſturbed would affect him in making remittances to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; and the fraud, in that caſe, would be theirs, not his; that it was no object to baniſh him. With regard to Neville, he had uſed harſh expreſſions, it was true; but it was under the influence of paſſion, and in a private letter to a relation.</p>
               <p>It was diſcoverable, that it did not go down well to paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all. There were many that diſcovered ill humour; there were ſundry ſpeakers for and againſt. In the caſe of Neville, there was a man, leaning on one knee, with his chin upon the head of his ſtaff, and a ſlouched hat upon his head, who ſpoke ſoftly, but with great eagerneſs, for Neville; but at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a man, whom I afterwards underſtood to be a captain Murray, with great livelineſs of manners, came forward, dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a light blue camblet coat, leather overalls, buff waiſtcoat, and a cutlaſs by his ſide; he had not been preſent until that moment. The fact was, that freſh battalions of militia were every moment arriving; and as they arrived, they choſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to the committee. Murray, wiſhing to make up for his loſt time, was very active now; and underſtanding the queſtion was, with regard to the baniſhment of certain individuals, he was ſtrenuous for the baniſhment. If it had been for hanging, it would have been the ſame thing; for the man had no reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, politically or perſonally, but ſimply wiſhed to diſtinguiſh himſelf, and become conſpicuous in the revolution.</p>
               <p>I felt little or no concern in the caſe of Neville, for I did
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:028332_0060_0FD8859936274030"/>
not ſee it to be of any conſequence to him, whether he was to go or ſtay. I rather thought it was his intereſt to be ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and I had underſtood that it was his wiſh to get out of the country. He actually expreſſed himſelf to that effect, to the meſſengers from Waſhington, who came with the intercepted mail, and applied to them for a paſſport, miſtaking their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. I had ſeen him, the morning of our march to Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock's fields, and with as much anxiety of countenance as a man could diſcover, who conceived his life to be in danger; his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion was, "The only thing I think of, is to eſcape aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." Well, I thought of nothing but this, the ſaving his life and property. For Gibſon I was concerned; not that I thought it would ultimately be of any damage to him to be baniſhed, but I ſuppoſed his feelings would be hurt for the preſent, and he might think it of conſequence to be ſent away.</p>
               <p>I was ſtanding by Bradford at this time; turning to him, I obſerved, with ſome warmth, "the ſending away the people is a farce; it will be the beſt recommendation they can have to the government; they will get into office, and be great men by it; it is better to let them ſtay and be inſignificant where they are: you could not have done a better thing to thoſe that are gone, than to have ſent them off." My language was candid; and his anſwer was equally ſo. But ſaid he, "the people came out to do ſomething, and ſomething they muſt do." I now ſaw that, whatever his theory might have been, with regard to the extent of his power over the people, his feelings for his own ſafety corrected his vanity; and he ſaw the neceſſity of giving a tub to the whale. He had heard the declamation of Murray, viz. that we muſt be firm, and clear the country of diſaffected perſons, &amp;c.; and conceiving that Murray, juſt freſh from the camp, had brought its ſenſibilities with him, he was unwilling to relax in his diſpoſition, with regard to the expulſion. We ought to be firm, ſaid he, and unanimous.</p>
               <p>At the firſt withdrawing of the committee, and taking their ſtation in the wood, we were followed by numbers, who wiſhed to hear the deliberation. The committee being opened, it was move<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the chairman was directed, to inform the people, that it was our wiſh to deliberate in private. The chairman addreſſed them to this effect. Some went away, and others did not; ſome came again, and others with them. There was a conſtant intercourſe between the committee and the camp. It was frequently told them, that we wiſhed to be by ourſelves; but in ſpite of all that we could do, we had a gallery of rifle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.

I have never heard how this ſtory originated, but it was not true: however, it ſerved our purpoſe at the time; and the doubt now only was, that they would come back. We ſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

come back. It was ſaid by me particularly, that if they came back "they might ſeize us in their place." It was ſaid by one, "Remember the forfeit."</p>
               <p>It was agreed, that the ſending away Gibſon and Neville, at the expiration of the time mentioned, ſhould be left to the Pittſburgh committee.</p>
               <p>Bradford now moved, that the troops ſhould go on to Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh. Yes, ſaid I, by all means; and if with no other view, at leaſt to give a proof that the ſtricteſt order can be preſerved, and no damage done. We will juſt march through, and taking a turn, come out upon the plain of the Monongahela's banks; and taking a little whiſkey with the inhabitants of the town, the troops will embark, and croſs the river.</p>
               <p>James Roſs, at this moment, ſtepping from another part of the committee, and paſſing by me, ſaid, "the veil is getting too thin, I am afr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>d it will be ſeen through." But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee had now riſen, and were going away.</p>
               <p>It is well for you, ſaid Benjamin Parkinſon to me, that the committee has broke up in ſuch a hurry; you would have been taken notice of, you gentlemen of Pittſburgh. Give us whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key! we don't go there for your whiſkey. This was ſaid, grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the teeth, and biting the lip. I conſidered his umbrage at theſe words, as no more than a pretence of a quarrel, and was alarmed; but made, in the ſofteſt manner, an explanation, that I meant no more than that we ſhould drink together, and not any offence whatever; and that it would affect me in the moſt ſenſible manner, if any thing, inadvertently ſaid by me, ſhould interrupt harmony, and injure the cauſe. I got him to ſeem ſatisfied; but I rather ſuppoſe, that he had begun to ſuſpect me of not being in earneſt in the cauſe, and that this was the real ground of his reſentment.</p>
               <p>A number of the Pittſburg committee having met, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and thought adviſeable, that ſome individuals, in whom major Butler would have confidence, ſhould ride in before the multitude, and inform him of the ſtate of things: that there was no intention of diſturbing him, and this, leſt he ſhould miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the caſe, and fire upon the people; and they might ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the town in colluſion with him, and make this a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of injuring it. Some members ſet out, and went into town for this purpoſe. Others were diſpatched, who undertook to have the boats ready, at a proper place, to tranſport the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and water and whiſkey on the ground where we ſhould halt: that there might be no pretence of leaving the ranks, in order to obtain refreſhment.</p>

Entering the town, and marching to the main ſtreet, to ſatisfy the people, and wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the left, and leaving the town, the whole body was halted on the plain to the eaſt of the town. By the beſt eſtimate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

About a fourth of the whole numbers, at Braddock's field, had return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thence, and not come to town. So that, at the place of rendezvous, there might have been in the whole, about 7000 men.</p>
               <p>By the order of the committee every poſſible proviſion had been made for them on the ground, that the ſhort ſpace of time could allow; and as ſoon as the Pittſburgh militia, who had marched in the rear, could be diſmiſſed from the ranks, they were employed in carrying water to the plain. Members of the committee ſet the example, by carrying water and whiſkey to theſe whiſkey-boys, as they have been ſince called. I was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed amongſt the reſt, very buſily. I thought it better to be employed in extinguiſhing the fire of their thirſt, than of my houſe. Moſt other perſons thought in the ſame manner; and every man had at leaſt a hut that he could not afford to have plundered, or burned down. In ſpite of all that could be done; ſtraggling companies left the ground, and came into the town, and were extremely inſulting and troubleſome. By order of the committee the taverns had been ſhut up, but the tavern-keepers were under the neceſſity of diſtributing gratis.</p>

                  </gap>orſe, which might be a third of the number, could ford the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iver. Knowing the ford, which is at the confluence of the Monongehela and Allegheny rivers, I rode down and attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; it was found to be practicable. Returning and leading <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>own a few ſquadrons, they croſſed. When it had been announc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the river was fordable, the whole of the multitude, that had come on horſe-back, came down and croſſed the river. The foot in the mean time, the greateſt part, had croſſed, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e had the proſpect of having the town clear that night.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all exertions, an hundred or two had remained in the town; theſe were in concert with ſome of theſe who had croſſed the river, and who were to burn ſome farm buildings belonging to Kirkpatrick on the hill oppoſite the town; and the inflaming theſe, was to be the ſignal to thoſe in town, to ſet on fire his houſe, in town. It was alſo ſaid, that the houſe of the company whoſe clerk Day had been, and Gibſon's houſe, Neville's, and that in which Briſon had lived, were to be conſumed. The burning theſe, from their ſituation, would have burned the quarter part of the town. But if they had begun to burn at all, the whole would have been burned.</p>
               <p>A company commanded by a captain Riddle, dreſſed in yellow hunting ſhirts, were ſeen in the evening parading the town, as having ſomething in view. They appeared bent on miſchief. About 9 o'clock at night, the alarm was, that theſe, and others, were about to burn the houſe of Kirkpatrick. The inhabitants were called upon to defend it; I found general Wilkins, and a number with arms, ruſhing down. I addreſſed them, "This will not do; it is contrary to the ſyſtem we have hitherto pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, and which has been ſucceſsful. Return, and lay down your arms. If a drop of blood is ſhed between the town and the country, it will never be forgiven: it will be known, that there is a tumult in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>own, between the inhabitants and the country people; and thoſe that have croſſed the river, many of them will return, and we ſhall fall a ſacrifice. If the houſe is
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:028332_0065_0FD89A3F07163D50"/>
to be defended, it muſt be by the people of the country them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves."</p>
               <p>In fact, a number of the people of the country were at this time in arms, to aſſiſt in defending the houſe. James Marſhall and Edward Cook, and a brother of M'Farlane that had fallen, had gone down. He had been called forward on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that being ſuppoſed to have the greateſt cauſe of reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Kirkpatrick, if he ſhould oppoſe the burning, no other could, with a good grace, inſiſt.</p>
               <p>It was on the ſame principle, (an incident which I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in my narrative), that the committee of Braddock's fields had ſent for Andrew M'Farlane; and repreſenting to him our apprehenſions of injury to the property of Kirkpatrick, requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, as we well knew it would be no gratification to a man of ſenſe, as he was, to deſtroy the property, even of one by whom his family had been injured, that he would expreſs his ſentiments in the camp, and make it as public as poſſible. His anſwer was, "that he had no with to injure the property, and would declare it publicly; but that if ever Kirkpatrick and he ſhould meet, one of them ſhould die."</p>
               <p>Thoſe in arms, with general Wilkins, reſted where they were. Going forward, I addreſſed myſelf to the people that were going forward for the purpoſe of burning the houſe. Said I, Gentlemen, you cannot burn this houſe without burning that of colonel O'Hara, that is near it; he is a good man, and he is abſent. If it is to be deſtroyed, let it be pulled down, not burned. I will be the firſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o pull a board off myſelf; but what neceſſity to take the trouble now; or to give yourſelf the trouble at all? the people of Pittſburgh will pull it down, and throw it in the river.</p>
               <p>Theſe deſiſted to go forward. There had been ſome at the houſe, and were preparing to ſet fire, when Cook, Marſhall, and M'Farlane came forward, and prevented it. A miſtake of Cook was fortunate. Thinking thoſe he ſaw before him, at the houſe, to be of the perſons that were there to defend it; ſaid he, Boys, are your guns loaded? Yes. "Then put in a ſecond ball; and the firſt man that puts fire to the houſe, ſhoot him down." Some affected to be there to defend the houſe, and ſome went off.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, intelligence had been brought, that the people were about to deſtroy the buildings of Kirkpatrick, on the ſouth ſide of the river; I fell in with David Hamilton and Thomas Stokely, about to croſs for the purpoſe of diſſuading
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028332_0066_0FD89A406E703EA0"/>
from it; I croſſed with them, to direct the ferry boats to be ſent over to the town ſide of the river, in order to prevent any part of thoſe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eady over, from re-croſſing to the town. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordered the boats over, I was returning, when the flame of a building of Kirkpatrick's, on the hill, began to illuminate the river. It was a barn, with the produce of the harveſt in it. This had been the ſignal agreed upon, for the inflammation of the houſe of Kirkpatrick in town, or other buildings. This had been prevented, by the meaſures taken.</p>
               <p>I have been minute in my relation of the incidents that reſpect Kirkpatrick's houſe, and my concern to ſave it, becauſe it has been inſinuated, that I had a wiſh to have it burned. I do not affect a regard for the man, for I have none; and it is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of my regard for him, that I wiſhed to ſave his houſe; but rather the contrary; for I well knew that, if burned, he would make five times the value of it, out of it. It was in ſome degree for the ſake of the people themſelves, that I wiſhed to ſave them from doing miſchief. How would Kirkpatrick make five times the value, by the deſtruction of his property? It would be conſidered as deſtroyed in the cauſe of the government; and therefore liberally repaired. The being the brother-in-law of the inſpector, would eſtabliſh a connection between his loſs and that of the officer.</p>
               <p>That plunder had been an object with many of the multitude, is certain. Amongſt other proofs of this, I ſaw a man, on Braddock's fields, put his hat, an indifferent one, on the muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle of his rifle, and twirling it about, ſay, I have a bad hat now, but I expect to have a better one ſoon. On the day the people marched into Pittſburgh, there were numbers of wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n on the hills oppoſite the town, from a conſiderable diſtance, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to ſee the deſtruction of the town, and to ſhare in the plunder. The day ſucceeding, a body, near a thouſand, at the diſtance of four or five miles halted, and deliberated, and with difficulty were prevented from coming back to plunder. On their way, on another road, by the farm houſe of Neville the younger, where a tenant lived, who had been a deputy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the inſpector, they deliberated on the plundering and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the houſe, and preſented their pieces to ſhoot the wife of the deputy.</p>
               <p>It will be queried, Whence the authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I inſinuate myſelf to have poſſeſſed, in the interfering with the orders of general Wilkins, with regard to the defence of Kirkpatrick's houſe, by the militia of the town; and in ordering ferry boats
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028332_0067_0FD89A44FA2E2E28"/>
from one ſide of the river to the other; to remain all night with the hands, to prevent the re-croſſing of the people? I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, that I was a member of the conmittee, which was ſuppoſed to have ſuperſeded, for that occaſion, all other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. We were a kind of national commiſſioners. The idea ſtruck Henry Purviance, of Waſhington, who addreſſed me by the deſignation of Commiſſioner Brackenridge. General Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins was therefore no general now; I was a member of the committee, and had an equal power with him, and might aſſume more ſometimes; and if not conteſted, it was exerciſed.</p>

               <p>THE affair of Braddock's fields, and the marching to the town of Pittſburgh, being over, it will be aſked, Could 250 or 300 men, which was the extent of the militia of the town, at the time, maintain it againſt 7000? but there might not be 7000; but ſuppoſe only 700. The people of the town were not uſed to arms; they might parade, on a review day, with empty muſkets in their hands, but had no other prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. They had the advantage of buildings out of which to fire; but ſo had Kirkpatrick, at Neville's houſe: and yet the buildings were burned. But the inhabitants of Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh were more, than the party of Kirkpatrick, and the houſes more than the houſes of the inſpector: but the force of the country was proportionably more againſt it; and if this force had been repulſed, is it to be ſuppoſed that a greater force would not return? but there muſt be ſuppoſed to be a proportion of the town that had not yet acquired the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty with others, and would not like to put their lives to an equal riſk in defence. Another proportion, from an acquaintance or connection with the country, would preſume themſelves ſafe, and would not chuſe to defend. The garriſon could have been of no uſe; for they could have taken the town between the garriſon and them. They might have taken the garriſon itſelf; it was a quadrangle with baſtions ſtockaded, and a block-houſe in the north-weſt, and north-eaſt angles, with a 6 or 9 pounder in each. But the baſtions towards the town were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of cannon; and the port holes might have been cloſed, and the pickets cut away. The people were mad; and if any man
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:028332_0068_0FD89A466F4011C0"/>
wiſhes to calculate the force of madneſs, let him think of the French revolution, and the ſtorming the Baſtile, and the Thuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. It never came into my head, nor did I hear any one elſe, ſuggeſt the idea, of uſing force on this occaſion. I thought it the ſafeſt way to give good words, and good drink, rather than balls and powder. It coſt me four barrels of old whiſkey, that day, and I would rather ſpare that, than a ſingle quart of blood.</p>
               <p>But it will be ſaid, that the ſeeming to join the people at Braddock's fields, and to ſupport them in their views, did great public miſchief, as it deceived numbers in the country, and lead them to an oppoſition to the laws, or confirmed them in it; and that it would have been better for the government, for us to have, at leaſt, remained at home, or to have made our eſcape from the town. It is difficult to ſay, which has had the beſt effect generally; I admit the truth and full force of the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that it was calculated to give a temporary confidence of ſtrength; but on the other hand, the deſperate act of plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and burning the town, in whole, or in part, would have led the perpetrators to every poſſible extent of violence, in order to protect what had been done; and no poſſibility of accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with government could exiſt after ſuch an outrage. But in the preſent caſe, it was like the raking of the leaves towards the flame, when the woods are on fire: the burning is greater for the moment, but it cannot paſs the path, where there is nothing to ſeed it.</p>
               <p>It will be aſked, how can we juſtify the ſending away the proſcribed perſons? I know of no caſe in our law, ſtrictly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allel. I recollect an oriental caſe, that may come near it. It is reported in the Negariſtan.</p>
               <p>Two travellers paſſing by a pool, on the ſide of the road, one of them, miſſing a foot, ſell in. The ſurface of the pool was ſome feet beneath the level of the bank, and of itſelf deep; laying hold of the bank, he ſtruggled to get up, but it was ſteep, and he could not. His companion, extending himſelf on his breaſt, and reclining over the bank of the pool, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down his hands, got hold of the hair of the other, and with ſome difficulty, extracted him from the pool. But in dragging him againſt the bank, by ſome means an eye was injured, ſo as to loſe the ſight of it. He conceived himſelf intitled to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages againſt his companion, who had thus, without his interfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and application, dragged him out.

He had thought more deeply on the ſubject.</p>
               <p>A day or two after this, Henry Purviance, of Waſhington, gave me to underſtand, that Neville the younger had expreſſed to him his ſuſpicion that I was in confidence with Bradford, and had been privy to the intercepting the mail; and had laid the plan of the expulſion of the perſons denounced; and this with an immediate view to them particularly. It was obſerved to him, that this was totally improbable; as I could not, at the time of projecting the intercepting the mail, provide that thoſe perſons ſhould write letters by it. This would exceed the power of any one, that had not an inviſible power over the minds of individuals, ſo as to make them act as the projector wiſhed.</p>
               <p>This obſervation was deciſive. I muſt have had a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural power, or uncommon good fortune, in having theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to do what would give pretence for the expulſion, which had been previouſly projected.</p>
               <p>Neville could not anſwer this; but ſaid, that if I had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it; I was pleaſed with it now, that it had taken place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="unknown:028332_0070_0FD89A496DD0ED78"/>I was ſtruck, for the firſt time, with the knowledge that Neville had not a perfect confidence in me; but it did not make much impreſſion on me, as I conceived him in a fever; and, like perſons in a fever, ready to complain of thoſe that were taking the beſt care of them.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe me to have been inimical to him, and the others; would expulſion have ſerved my turn? would I not rather have had them knocked in the head at once? had any arrangements been made to keep them away? would not the government re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them? It was like ſchool-boys ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No; I knew the ſending them away might wound their feelings for the moment, but would not do them any eſſential or permanent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. On the contrary, it would ultimately ſerve them. It would hold them up as martyrs of the government, and give them offices and emoluments. I expreſſed this at the time; and it has ſo happened with ſome of them.</p>
               <p>It was ſaid, that I had been at variance with all theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. I had with Kirkpatrick, but with none elſe, to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. If there was any variance, it was in their minds only, and not known to me. There had been a variance with Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but it had paſſed away; at leaſt I had forgot it. There might he ſtill a degree of diſtance; but it was the aukwardneſs of pride in coming to a formal reconciliation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> With Neville I had no difference, real or apparent: but his obſervation ſhews, that he was not well diſpoſed towards me. With Day there was both a real and apparent good underſtanding. I knew Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to have had malice of an old ſtanding againſt me; but I had thought it was dead. I never had any againſt him. As to Kirkpatrick, I was proſecuting him for miſdemeanors. But it was defeating my purpoſe to ſend him away. I had him under recognizance to court.</p>
               <p>The ſecond day after the departure of the multitude from Pittſburgh, it was rumoured that Kirkpatrick had been ſeen in town. It was traced to an inhabitant of Pittſburgh, who ſaid; he had it from a perſon from the country, who ſaid he had ſeen him. The committee was called, to enquire of this inhabitant; and cenſure him, if, without foundation, he had circulated this report. As the committee were meeting, at a public houſe, Neville the younger, and Craig, were coming down from the garriſon: they were interrogated, and acknowledged, that Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patrick had returned to town, and was then in the garriſon. It excited great indignation, becauſe he had deceived us, leading
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028332_0071_0FD89A4FA1434A10"/>
us to ſuppoſe that he had gone, and to pledge ourſelves to that effect. Neville and Craig alleged, that he had not intended to return, but that he had been dogged by parties, and had been under the neceſſity of returning, to be ſafe. It was anſwered, why not then have given early information to the committee, that they might have taken meaſures to eſcort him? Neville ſaid, that he had not known of his being in town until within half an hour; and on ſaying this, they left us. It was thought ill uſage, after all the paine we had taken on behalf of Kirkpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick. If he had gone to the garriſon at firſt, there could have been nothing ſaid about it; but the being there now, would not excuſe us, who woul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> be ſuppoſed to have deceived the country. The committee were determined on deciſive meaſures. Having had a difference with the man, I gave this as an apology, and declined acting; but the reſolution was, that Neville and Craig ſhould be ſeized in his place, and ſent to Waſhington. Perſons were diſpatched to demand their perſons. It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that they were privy to his being in the neighbourhood of the town, the whole time; and that he had never attempted to go away. Craig made his eſcape to the garriſon; Neville gave his word of honour, that in half an hour he would appear before the committee. He did appear, and came up ſmoking a ſegar. I conceived the man was amuſing himſelf with our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; and in fact he was, or affecting to do ſo; for his pride was wounded, and he had miſconceived the ſincerity of our good will, and earneſt deſire to ſave every one, and hurt none. He paſſed by me with that compreſſed laugh, which conveys in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult without ſaying any thing. I ſaw that he conſidered me as diverted with his embarraſſment: he did me great injuſtice.</p>
               <p>However, when he came before the committee, he expreſſed himſelf with diſcretion, and gave aſſurance, that if they would provide Kirkpatrick with an eſcort, he would leave the garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and go away. This had been offered to him when he went at firſt, but he declined taking it. The committee undertook to do this, and an eſcort was provided.</p>
               <p>Some of the people of the town, who had heard that Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patrick was in the garriſon, and not knowing that the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee had taken meaſures, had determined to lay in wait for him; preſuming that he would come out in the night. Their view was, to take him and ſurrender him to the country. It has been ſaid, that ſome talked of ſhooting him; and that he was actually fired upon, as he came out of the garriſon, when he went away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="unknown:028332_0072_0FD89A5117DAF6D0"/>The committee hearing this, next day, called a town meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the evening, in order to explain to the people the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of ſuch behaviour; all things that regarded the police of the country, or the management of the affairs of the times, having been delegated to them, for the occaſion. It had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come neceſſary on another account; the idea had prevailed, that all law was at an end, that a juſtice of the peace could iſſue no warrant, or conſtable ſerve it.</p>
               <p>It was put on me to harangue the meeting, which I did; and denounced, in ſtrong terms, the impropriety of acting as in the caſe of Kirkpatrick, without the orders of the committee; informing them alſo, that law was in force.</p>
               <p>I was diverted with an expreſſion of John Wilkins, ſenior, on this occaſion—"It is only the exciſe law that is repealed."</p>
               <p>I had ſaid, that it was only that law that the country had ſuſpended. It will be ſeen from hence, the manner in which we had to accommodate our language, even to the town of Pittſburgh.</p>
               <p>Had the denounced perſons left the country immediately, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it became known extenſively that they were obnoxious, they could have got out of it without difficulty; but it was no eaſy matter afterwards. The cauſe of their proſcription was not diſtinctly known; and it was thought to be ſome great ſtate crime that had come to light. The people had an idea, that it would be no harm to ſhoot them down; at leaſt to arreſt and impriſon them.</p>
               <p>Kirkpatrick was to have had an eſcort of two men, but one only had been able to join him; the other had been detained by the people, who, not knowing the meaſures of the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, were lying in wait, to apprehend him. With the perſon that had been able to join him, he eſcaped, by a circuitous route, on the frontiers of the country, as far as the Allegheny moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and then ventured to take the road.</p>
               <p>Prothonotary Briſon had been detained a night at the houſe of the deputy attorney for the commonwealth, at the diſtance of ſome miles from Pittſburgh. It was rumoured in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, that he was there ſtill. A party, of about forty perſons, had collected in the night, and ſurrounded the houſe. They demanded of the attorney, to give them entrance, that they might ſearch for the culprit. It could not be refuſed. The lady of the attorney had fainted with the fright; a mulatto wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had been diſpatched to the ſpring haſtily, for a glaſs of cool water; and miſtaking her complexion, in the dark, ſhe
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028332_0073_0FD8859AA7D81A90"/>
was taken ſon the prothonotary, making his eſcape in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of a night cap. She was purſued; and ſuppoſing herſelf obnoxious, ſhe left the glaſs, and took to the woods. It was thought that the prothonotary had eſcaped, and the reſentment fell on the attorney, for harbouring a criminal; and it was with great difficulty, and not until the mulatto woman, recovering herſelf, had come back, that he could convince them of the truth.</p>
               <p>Edward Day had taken the ſafeſt route, and deſcended the river to fort Waſhington.</p>
               <p>The inſpection offices, through the whole ſurvey, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending five counties, had, at this time, been burned down, with the dwelling houſes of the deputies. Liberty poles, with inſcriptions and devices, raiſed every where. Inſcriptions, ſuch as, "an equal tax, and no exciſe;" devices, ſuch as a ſnake divided, with this motto, "united we ſtand, divided we fall." I met with no man that ſeemed to have an idea, that we were to ſeparate from the government, or to overthrow it, but ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to oppoſe the exciſe law; and yet the people acted and ſpoke as if we were in a ſtate of revolution. They threatened life and property familiarly. They talked of not ſuffering Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Addiſon, the diſtrict judge, to return to the country. He was, at that time, at Philadelphia, A report, that, on his way down, he had met the marſhal, and encouraged him to come forward with his writs, had rendered him obnoxious.

               <p>In the mean time, a kind of temporary block-houſe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the middle of the garriſon to defend the curtain on the ſouth, of which I have before made mention, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were made to furniſh the garriſon with two months pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions. Application was made to a perſon, concerned in buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit baking in the town, to ſell the public the buſcuit he had on hand. He conſulted me, apprehenſive that it might not be ſafe, as the country might hear of it, and make him the object of reſentment. I thought they could not take offence at his diſpoſing of what was in the way of buſineſs; but that, to ſave appearances, it might be well to let the public barge come round and take it from him. I mention this to ſhew the delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the apprehenſions of individuals.</p>
               <p>It was ſuggeſted by me, and approved by others, that the records of the county, in the prothonotary's office, ſhould be

put up, and kept ready to be removed to the garriſon, at the ſhorteſt notice, if the town ſhould have any reaſon to apprehend any thing from another movement.</p>
               <p>As to myſelf, I canvaſſed my ſituation fully, and begun more ſeriouſly to think of emigration; but in that caſe, I would be conſidered in the light of a deſerter, and my property become a ſacrifice. I thought of diſpoſing of my houſe, which was periſhable, to ſome individual leſs conſpicuous, and under his name ſave it. But that would be ſuſpected or diſcovered. I thought of being abſent on ſome pretence that might be plauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible; and it ſtruck me to prevail with the people of Pittſburgh to appoint me as an envoy to the executive, to ſtate the motives of their conduct, and explain their ſituation. I mentioned this to James Roſs, who approved of it, and at my requeſt, to ſound General Wilkins, to get him to favour it. Mr. Roſs did ſo, but informed me that General Wilkins was not willing that I ſhould leave the town. He was in the ſame ſituation himſelf, and did not like to loſe company. I have learned ſince, that there were more in the ſame ſituation, and with the ſame reflections, elſewhere, who had planned the getting out of the country, by pretending to go below, to purchaſe powder. Subſcriptions were opened in reality, in places, for the ſending below for arms and ammunition.</p>
               <p>I made up my mind now to wait the reſult of the meeting at Parkinſon's ferry. My object was, a pacification of the country, by means ſhort of force. With a view to this, I wiſhed the government to have a juſt idea of the ſituation of the country; the magnitude and extent of the oppoſition. In that caſe, the executive might be diſpoſed to adopt conciliatory meaſures. On this principle, having received a packet, containing ſome papers, from Tench Coxe of Philadelphia, on agricultural ſubjects, to be communicated to the people of this country, it ſtruck me, to communicate to the government, by writing to him, my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, with regard to the diſturbance. This letter was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood, and conſidered as proof that I was engaged in the inſurrection. Some expreſſions led to this miſconception, which I had uſed to ſave myſelf with the more violent of the people of the country, if it ſhould fall into their hands, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the mail; a thing conſtantly expected. In writing to Tench Coxe, I conſidered myſelf as writing to the government, underſtanding him to be in an official ſituation near the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>

It was at the time of the maſked attack on a certain William Cochran, who rendered himſelf obnoxious by an entry of his ſtill, according to law. His ſtill was cut to pieces; and this was humorouſly called, mending his ſtill; and the menders, of courſe, muſt be tinkers, and the name, collectively, became Tom the Tinker. Advertiſements were now put up on trees, in the high ways, or in other conſpicuous places, under the ſignature of Tom the Tinker, threatening individuals, or admoniſhing, or command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, in meaſures with regard to the exciſe law <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>. In the march from Braddock's fields, the acclamation was, Huzza for Tom the Tinker. It was not now, Are you whig or tory? but, Are you a Tom the Tinker's man? Every man was willing to be thought ſo; and ſome had a great deal of trouble to wipe off imputations to the contrary. Advertiſements appeared in the gazettes, from individuals, appealing to the public, and avering the falſhood of aſperſions upon them, as ſavouring the exciſe law.</p>
               <p>It having been announced to Gibſon and Neville, that, by our undertaking, in their behalf, with the committee of batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions on Braddock's fields, they were to leave the town in ten days, I received a note from Neville, addreſſed to me, as chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the committee of 21, demanding a paſſport from the country, and an eſcort. I diſcovered a ſymptom of ill humour,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:028332_0077_0FD8859DA6B70E78"/>
in addreſſing me as chairman; for he knew it had never been my place to be chairman, but to be amongſt thoſe that addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the chair. I was the more diſpoſed to conſtrue it in this manner, having found him, in a converſation the day before, in an irritated ſtate of mind, with regard to the part that had been taken by me and others, in his expulſion. His expreſſion was, that he underſtood "it was the members from Pittſburgh that inſiſted on his expulſion." It might have been ſo repreſented to him; and his informants may have miſconceived our conduct.</p>
               <p>I was hurt with theſe ſuſpicions, and the unreaſonable diſſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction with me perſonally. Nevertheleſs, conſidering the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, I was determined to maintain a perfect apathy to all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of reſentment, and go on to render him every ſervice in my power. Having taken the trouble to go round, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the committee; paſſports were made for him and Gibſon: double paſſports for each: one in a few words, to ſerve them to paſs through the country; and couched for them, as for priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers under a guard. I have not a copy of it.</p>
               <p>Another, and the principal one, was a ſtatement of the ground of expulſion: that it might be ſeen below, and manifeſt the futility of the charges againſt them. The idea of this was ſuggeſted by me, and the paſſport dictated to the ſecretary. It was afterwards publiſhed in the gazettes of Philadelphia.

               <p>Agreeable to our reſolves, prior to the meeting at Braddock's fields, delegates were to be elected to the meeting at Parkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's ferry.</p>
               <p>Circumſtances were ſo materially changed, from what they were at the time of the Mingo creek meeting, that I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined all idea of going forward as a delegate; and gave it to be known in the town, that in the appointment, I would not

chuſe to have my name mentioned. There appeared to me but little proſpect, that the meeting ſhould reſt ſhort of deliberate and ſyſtematic hoſtility. I had heard of the language of Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, after his return to Waſhington, from the march to Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh. "A glorious revolution accompliſhed without blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed." I conceived from thence, that he muſt have an idea of ſupporting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> at all hazards, what had been done. My impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Marſhall, from what I had heard, from others, and what I had ſeen of his conduct, was, that he had inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly involved himſelf in the buſineſs, but would be happy to get out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he could. But I knew the people would not let him; he would not dare to talk of any thing, but going on to war; and ſuch was his ſituation, from his perſonal acts, that it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as much his policy, as any man's, to meditate defence.</p>
               <p>On theſe principles, I thought it moſt adviſeable to ſend to that meeting ſome perſons, who would not be under the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of acting a conſpicuous part, by being called upon to ſpeak, not being ſuppoſed in the habit of it, as I profeſſionally was. That in ſhort, to ſave appearances, it was adviſeable to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>end ſome perſons; but, at the ſame time, ſuch perſons as could have it in their power to remain obſcure.</p>
               <p>James Roſs and general Wilkins, to whom I communicated theſe ideas, were of a contrary opinion, and thought it adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to go forward; and, at the ſame time, to uſe endeavours to get forwards, from all parts of the country, delegates, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to violent meaſures. I yielded to their opinion; and gave it to be underſtood, that I was willing to go to the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if I ſhould be choſen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="unknown:028332_0079_0FD89A5CF0FD7D18"/>General Wilkins and others, in the town and adjoining coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, were active in getting forward perſons in the county of All<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gheny, of the deſcription before ſuggeſted. James Roſs had gone to Waſhington, with the ſame views.</p>
               <p>The election for delegates to the meeting took place, with ſome form<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Pittſburgh, and under the appearance of being warm in the cauſe of Tom the Tinker. John Wilkins, ſenior, was made a judge of the election; and being a man of humour, with great gravity, made it a teſt of the right of ſuffrage, the being for Tom the Tinker; and affected to ſcruple the votes of ſome, who, not perceiving the burleſque, heſitated to ſay they were for Tom. When I came in, to give my vote, ſaid Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, I need not aſk any teſt from you, for you are Tom the Tinker himſelf; meaning, that I had acted his part, in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of Braddock's fields, in the moſt diſtinguiſhed manner. The whole of this was underſtood to be a jeſt: nevertheleſs, affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits of this pleaſantry of Wilkins, in the caſe of the teſt, were carried to the executive; and he was afterwards alarmed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
               <p>I was choſen a delegate, with general Wilkins and others. The firſt great object to be accompliſhed by that meeting, was, the taking the buſineſs out of the hands of the multitude, by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing an organiſation, through which alone they could act: Firſt, reſolving it to be the ſenſe of the committee, that the ſtate laws were in force; and that the authority of all civil officers was to be reſpected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and no violence to be done by any man, on his mere motion, under pain of being denounced by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, as an enemy to his country.</p>
               <p>For it will be underſtood, that the idea of a committee had become more formidable than that of a court. It was a new authority, ſpringing freſh from the people's power, and had the force of opinion on its ſide. The mulct of a court, for a breach of the peace, would affect the property; but the cenſure of a committee, would render a man infamous.</p>
               <p>Secondly, reſolving, that the meeting addreſs the Preſident; ſtating what had taken place, and praying a ſuſpenſion of force againſt the country, and an oblivion of what had taken place; under ſuch arrangements as might be obtainable.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, reſolving, that a ſtanding committee of ſafety be appointed, to be conſervators of the peace, in ſupport of the civil authority; and to be the organ of negociation with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive, on the ſubject of an amneſty, and the arrangements that might be obtainable.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Agreeable to the ſcheme of theſe reſolves, I had drawn up an addreſs to the Preſident, and another to the people, on the principle ſtated, and had them prepared to be laid before the meeting.</p>
               <p>General Gibſon, at this time, or before it, had left the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Colonel Neville was about to go; but had ſome reluctance.

               <p>He came to me after the delegation to Parkinſon's ferry, and expreſſed an idea, that he had a right to expect of me, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers delegated from the town, that, at the meeting, we ſhould go forward, and demand an examination of his caſe, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal of the ſentence of the committee of battalions, on Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock's fields; that he had a right to expect this, in as much as it was on the account of the town, that the ſentence was to be carried into effect.</p>
               <p>I was hurt at his want of a juſt conception of the caſe, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, that it was on account of the town, that he was to go away. It was on account of him, and others, that the town had been in danger; and it was for his own ſake, that he was to go away. I had conſidered him as conſigning his caſe to my management, from what he had ſaid to me, the morning I went to Braddock's fields; and I never managed the caſe of a client, at the bar, with more fidelity, than I did his, on this occaſion. I had thought the buſineſs well managed, in diverting an enfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riated mob from coming in to ſeize him, and others: and this was accompliſhed, by the policy of getting the mob to condenſe themſelves into a committee; and then managing that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, to adopt the mild reſolution of leaving him in the hands of the committee of Pittſburgh, as guardians, in fact, of his ſafety, though nominally the executors of the ſentence.</p>
               <p>I do not mean to blame him, or others, for writing by the mail, or for what they wrote; but I ſtate the writing as the occaſion of the cavalcade, and our diſturbance.</p>
               <p>I ſtated this candidly to Neville; and perhaps, in a more

pointed manner, than I would otherwiſe have done, had not my feelings been hurt, by his ſuſpicions which had been ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to me.</p>
               <p>But I farther obſerved to him, that, ſuppoſing it demandable of the town, to go forward, and propoſe the recalling him; was it practicable? did he not know, that he was conſidered by the people, as the inſpector himſelf? what the father got, the ſon had. It is known, that, before your father accepted the office, you were conſulted, and adviſed the acceptance. It is known, that application has been made to you, to adviſe your father to reſign the office: You have ſaid, No; would any of them reſign an office of ſuch value? It is known, that you are the author of that advertiſement, which has appeared in the gazette, alledging, that certificates and bonds were plundered and carried off, at the time your father's houſe was burned <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </gap>ille behaved mildly, and ſaid little; but, I ſuppoſe, thought the more; and ſet this down in his mind, as a further proof that I was an inſurgent. I have heard that he has men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned it as a proof; and that he reſents a declaration made by me, at the time, that, if I was to advocate the caſe of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it would be that of judge Addiſon; who, it ſeems, had become obnoxious. I am not capable of the indelicacy of wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſelf-love of any man, by a perſonal preference of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to his face; but I gave this as a proof, that, even in a caſe where my own intereſt was materially concerned, as the having the preſident of the court in the circuit, without whom the buſineſs of my profeſſion muſt, in a great degree, be at a ſtand, I would not think it expedient to go forward, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his name. By that direct mode of acting, I could not bring him back; and I would put myſelf away. I had in view, to ſave the influence that I happened to poſſeſs, in order that the people might let me work with them, in conſtructing the wheel, the revolution of which, would ſet all matters right, and bring Alexander Addiſon and Preſly Neville into their places again.</p>
               <p>The fact is, there was a great proportion of thoſe at the burning of the houſe, capable of all that was alleged; but the bulk of the leaders, were themſelves led by falſe ideas of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm, and though guilty of a great offence, at the moment, would have ſhrunk from the violation of moral truth, or the commiſſion of diſhoneſty. I write this, not to make their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology, but to explain human nature.</p>
               <p>I had frequently heard it ſaid, by the people of the country, ſince the introduction of the exciſe law, that it were better for them to be under the Britiſh; and at this time, ſuch language began to be very common. But I cannot ſay, that I ever heard any perſon of note breathe the idea. It was ſaid, that arms and ammunition could be obtained from the Britiſh.</p>
               <p>At this time, reports from the eaſt of the mountains were, that the people on that ſide, were as violent as thoſe on this; that they had proceeded to outrages. This was alarming. I ſaw before me, the anarchy of a period; a ſhock to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and poſſibly a revolution,—a revolution impregnated with the Jacobin principles of France, and which might become equally bloody to the principal actors. It would be bloody unavoidably to them; and to the people, deſtructive. Let no man ſuppoſe, that I coveted a revolution. I had ſeen the evils of one already, the American; and I had read the evils of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, the French. My imagination preſented the evils of the
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028332_0083_0FD89A685E463E80"/>
laſt ſo ſtrongly to my view, and brought them ſo cloſe to a probable experience at home, that, during the whole period of the inſurrection, I could ſcarcely bear to caſt my eye upon a paragraph of French news. This is not a ſtatement of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, invented now; they were my expreſſions at the time. It was not the exciſe law, alone, that was the object with the people; it was, with many, not the principal object. A man, of ſome note, and whoſe family had been at the burning of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville's houſe, was ſeen on horſeback, in Pittſburgh, the day of Braddock's field, riding along with a tomahawk in his hand, and raiſed over his head—"This is not all that I want: it is not the exciſe law only, that muſt go down; your diſtrict and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate judges muſt go down; your high offices and ſalaries. A great deal more is to be done; I am but beginning yet."</p>
               <p>In the appointment of aſſociate judges, there were great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments among individuals; and the juſtices of the peace, many of them, wiſhed to be again upon the bench.</p>
               <p>I ſaw the courſe of things; that there would be no occaſion for a lawyer for a while; and on a retroſpective view, I had conceived ſuch a deteſtation of pleading before juſtices of the peace, that, if that order of things ſhould once more take place, I would never plead at all. Of all things that I ever met with in life, it was the greateſt abſurdity, to be appealing to men, as judges of principles, the knowledge of which requires a ſtudy and practice of twenty years; to men, deſtitute of a knowledge of a ſingle element of the ſcience. I had conſidered the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the courts of Pennſylvania, as a great acquiſition, and was unwilling that it ſhould be diſturbed: but, as a proof that reforms of this nature were meditated, let me ſtate, that, far before this time, repreſentations to the legiſlature, had been circulated in the country, and ſubſcribed; praying a reduction of ſalaries of judges, and a reinſtatement of juſtices of the peace upon the bench. A committee, inſtituted a year before, at Mingo creek, and which was the cradle of the inſurrection, went further; and propoſed ſuſpending the courts and the juſtices of the peace altogether; and actually drew cauſes to their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, and exerciſed judiciary authority. Benjamin Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon was preſident of that committee.</p>
               <p>There was an accidental circumſtance, which, independen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It preceded the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſheriff, and members of aſſembly; and without meaning any thing more than to be elected, the candidate was clamorous

This claſs of men were numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and greatly vociferous. Strange as it may ſeem, it never once ſtruck them, that if things went on in that manner, there could be no election.</p>

               <p>IN the morning of the meeting at Parkinſon's ferry, I ſaw James Marſhall; and in order to reconcile himſelf with his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and diſpoſe him favourably towards me, I obſerved, that the calling out the people to Braddock's fields, was a raſh act; but it might have a good effect. It would impreſs the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with a fear of the extent of the oppoſition to the law. He ſeemed pleaſed with the apology made for it, and obſerved, "that Bradford was haſty in undertaking things, and had not abilities afterwards to manage them." I conſidered this as an apology to me, for the raſhneſs of what had been done.</p>
               <p>But I found that he contemplated the going on to ſupport, by force of arms, what had been done. He ſhewed me a ſet of reſolutions, which he had drawn up, to lay before the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; one of which contemplated force againſt the government. He gave me to underſtand, that Bradford alſo, had made a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of ſome things that he meant to move. Bradford here joined us, and I ſaw his ſchedule. It contained the heads of particulars, that would be the ſubject of conſideration. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of ſafety, magazines, arms, ammunition, clothing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>There were two or three of the reſolutions of Marſhall, in ſubſtance, the ſame with thoſe I had deviſed in my mind, and I approved of them. I developed my plan of ſending commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners to the executive, and ſhewed the addreſs I had drawn up to be preſented to him. They approved of it.</p>
               <p>In order to retain the management of Bradford, it was my policy, at that period, to conceal from him my total diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of what had been done. I ſaid not a word with reſpect
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:028332_0085_0FD89A6B30C496B0"/>
to it; nor did I venture to oppoſe, on the ſubject of making war; but to keep him from thinking, and coming to a cloſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, I amuſed him with pleaſantry, and kept him laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I made uſe of major Craig for this purpoſe, and encored the ſtory of the big guns, to be drawn out of Braddock's ford<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that of taking down the inſcription of the inſpection office, as related to me by captain Lang.</p>
               <p>Juſt before the opening of the meeting, Bradford came <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> me, and put it upon me to introduce the buſineſs, by giving a hiſtory of what had taken place, ſince the meeting at Ming<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> creek; and offered me the letters which had been intercepted in the mail, to read to the people. I declined it, by obſerving, that his acquaintance with the ſubject was more than mine; and that the ſedate dignified narrative, was more his talent than mine. And beſides, there had been people expelled from Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, on account of thoſe letters; and living in the ſame vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage with the connections and families of theſe, it was a caſe of greater delicacy with me, than it could be with him, to explain the propriety of their expulſion, or read the letters.</p>
               <p>The meeting was opened, by placing Edward Cook in the chair, and making Albert Gallatin ſecretary. The credentials of our election were produced; and there appeared to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers from Ohio county, in Virginia, and five counties of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania. In the whole, there were 260. Our hall was a grove; and we might well be called the Mountain, for we were on a very lofty ground, overlooking the river. We had a gallery of lying timber and ſtumps; and there were more people col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected there, than there was of the committee.</p>
               <p>Bradford opened the meeting, by giving ſome deduction of who had taken place;—the appearance of the marſhal to ſerve his writs, the attack on Neville's houſe, the flight of the inſpector, the expulſion of other obnoxious characters, &amp;c. Here he read the letters intercepted in the mail.</p>
               <p>Marſhall now brought forward his propoſitions:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That taking citizens of the United States, from their reſpective abodes, or vicinage, to be tried, for real or ſuppoſed offenoes, is a violation of the rights of the citizens, is a forced and dangerous conſtruction of the conſtitution, and ought not to be exerciſed by the judicial authority.</p>
               <p>It was alleged by Marſhall, that the language of this reſolve, as of the others, might not be correct, or the idea well expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and he wiſhed the ſecretary to frame it as might ſeem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. I ſpoke on this occaſion: and obſerved, that, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,

the whole ſtate was made the vicinage <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>; and the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary had it in their power, to make uſe of it to that extent. Nevertheleſs, it certainly was an abridgment of that advantage which the citizens had before the conſtitution exiſted, where the vicinage was the county; and that it was a hard conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the conſtitution, to ſuppoſe, that it contemplated ſuch a judiciary ſyſtem, as would bring citizens from one end of the ſtate to the other. For that reaſon, I approved of the ſubſtance of the reſolution; but as probably it might be improved in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, I propoſed, that we ſhould go over the reſolutions, and having agreed upon the ſubſtance, to refer them to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of three, or more, to digeſt the arrangement, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſenſe, in the beſt manner, and lay them before the meeting for their final conſideration. It was agreed, and we paſſed on the ſecond reſolution, viz.</p>
               <p>That a ſtanding committee be appointed, to conſiſt of  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap>  members from each county, to be denominated, a Committee of Public Safety; whoſe duty it ſhall be, to call forth the reſources of the weſtern country, to repel any hoſtile attempts, that may be made againſt the rights of the citizens, or of the body of the people.</p>
               <p>Comparing this reſolution with the firſt, I ſaw that Marſhall had conceived, that the act of the diſtrict officer, in ſerving writs in this country, to anſwer at Philadelphia, was illegal and void, and that it might be conſtitutionally reſiſted; and alſo, that an attempt of the government to enforce ſuch an act, by purſuing thoſe that had reſiſted, might be conſtitutionally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; on the ſame principle that the money tax, and the force of government in aid of it, was conſtitutionally oppoſed by Hamden; or the declaratory act, and the enforcing of it, was oppoſed by America againſt Britain. Coupling, therefore, theſe reſolutions, they would ſeem to contemplate the reſiſting the authority of the officer of the diſtrict, and protecting, by arms, thoſe who had reſiſted him. Taking the words by themſelves, they were not exceptionable: for, doubtleſs the people retain the right to repel hoſtile attempts againſt their rights; on the ſame principle that I may repel the officer, who would ſeize me without proceſs. But coupling the words with the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolution, and with the acts perpetrated in the country, and
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:028332_0087_0FD89A72BAA68E90"/>
with the ſtate of it, they appeared to me exceptionable. The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e were my reflections, from the time I had read the reſolutions, in the morning, until that time.</p>
               <p>The reſolution being read, ſecretary Gallatin roſe:—What reaſon, ſaid he, have we to ſuppoſe, that hoſtile attempts will be made againſt our rights? and why, therefore, prepare to reſiſt them? Riots have taken place, which may be the ſubject of judiciary cognizance; but we are not to ſuppoſe a military force, on the part of the government.</p>
               <p>If I am not accurate in ſtating this language, or theſe ideas of the ſecretary, it ought to be attributed to defect of memory, not deſign. It was my impreſſion, at the time, either that it was the only pretence that occurred to him to uſe, to wave the reſolution, or that actually he did not know, that the acts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted brought it within the power of the Preſident to order out the militia.</p>
               <p>I ſaw the principle, and reſpected the courage of the ſecreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in meeting the reſolution; but I knew that it was a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite one, with all thoſe that had been involved in any of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, and, at the ſame time, a popular one generally. I was alarmed, therefore, at the idea of any diſcuſion of it; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, before any one could have an opportunity of ſpeaking, I affected to oppoſe the ſecretary; and thought it might not be amiſs to have the reſolution; but it might be ſoftened in terms, without altering the ſubſtance, and it might be ſaid, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee ſhould have power to take ſuch meaſures as the ſituation of affairs might require; and that the committee of four, to whom the modelling of the reſolutions was to be committed, might model the terms. Marſhall acquieſced, and there was no queſtion, or debate.</p>
               <p>Third reſolution, That a committee of  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap>  members be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to draft a remonſtrance to Congreſs; praying a repeal of the exciſe law, and that a more equal, and leſs odious tax, will be cheerfully paid by the people of theſe counties; and that the ſame remonſtrance be ſigned by the chairman of this meeting, in behalf of the people whom we repreſent.</p>
               <p>This reſolution was oppoſed, on the principle, that it was uſeleſs to remonſtrate to Congreſs; that body having treated with contempt, all former remonſtrances on that ſubject. It was, however, carried; thoſe who had oppoſed it, acquieſcing.</p>
               <p>Fourth reſolution, Whereas the motives by which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the weſtern country have been actuated, in the late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy diſturbances, at Neville's houſe, and in the great and
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:028332_0088_0FD89A7446D9EBE8"/>
general rendezvous at Braddock's fields, &amp;c. are liable to be miſconſtrued, as well by our fellow citizens, throughout the United States, as by their and our public ſervants, to whom is conſigned the adminiſtration of the federal government, Reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That a committee be appointed, to make a fair and candid ſtatement of the whole tranſaction, to the Preſident of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, and to the governments of Pennſylvania and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia; and, if it ſhould become neceſſary, that the ſaid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee do publiſh to the world, a manifeſto or declaration, whereby the true motives and principles of the people of this country, ſhall be fairly and fully ſtated.</p>
               <p>This was committed, without debate, to the committee of four, to be modelled as to arrangement and expreſſion.</p>
               <p>Fifth reſolution, That we will, with the reſt of our fellow citizens, ſupport the laws and government of the reſpective ſtates in which we live, and the government of the United States; the exciſe law, and the taking away citizens out of their reſpective counties, only excepted: and, therefore, we will aid and aſſiſt all civil officers, in the execution of their reſpective functions; and endeavour, by every proper means in our power, to bring to juſtice all offenders in the premiſes.</p>
               <p>On the conſideration of this reſolution, the ſtate of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, without law and ſafety, to perſons or property, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, at ſome length, by me. Mr. Gallatin ſupported the neceſſity of the reſolution, with a view to the eſtabliſhment of the laws, and the conſervation of the peace.</p>
               <p>Though he did not venture to touch on the reſiſtance to the marſhal, or the expulſion of the proſcribed, yet he ſtrongly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned the deſtruction of property; the burning of the barn of Kirkpatrick, for inſtance. What! ſaid a fiery fellow in the committee, do you blame that? The ſecretary found himſelf embarraſſed; he pauſed for a moment.—If you had burned him in it, ſaid he, it might have been ſomething; but the barn had done no harm. Ay, ay, ſaid the man, that is right enough. I admired the preſence of mind of Gallatin; and give the inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as a proof of the delicacy neceſſary to manage the people on that occaſion.</p>
               <p>A member of the committee, who had ſeen the ſchedule of Bradford, moved that it ſhould be brought forward. It was brought forward, and laid upon the table. Several perſons ſpoke on the ſubject of conſtituting magazines of arms and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition; and ſeemed to wiſh reſolutions pointedly to this, on the ground of Bradford's ſchedule. Gallatin was labouring hard
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028332_0089_0FD89A75C6F14C48"/>
to divert this, by attacking it in front. It did ſeem to do: there was danger of ſome queſtion of this nature being taken. I had been out of the circle; but returned at this juncture. I affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as before, to oppoſe Gallatin; and made an apology for thoſe, who were for providing means of war.—Said I, it may not be amiſs to talk of theſe things, and to hold out the idea of fighting, with a view to avoid it; juſt as a general diſplays co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, meaning, by that diſplay, to avoid engaging. The idea of our being about to fight, may induce government to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate with the country. But enough is done. Theſe things will all be left to the direction of the ſtanding committee.</p>
               <p>The apology ſaved the pride of the ſpeakers, and ſatisfied the hopes of the violent; and there was no more ſaid. I was thought to be for war, if it ſhould be neceſſary. I was applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the gallery; and it was ſaid, I had gained what I had loſt at Mingo creek.</p>
               <p>I had founded the public mind, before I came to the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with regard to the recal of the prothonotary of Alleghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny county. He had left a young man in the office: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the abſence of the prothonotary himſelf, was a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience to the country, and to me, in my profeſſion. I had ſounded the committee, ſince I had come, and made up my mind, that it was not adviſeable to introduce his name. A cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, independent of his letter writing, had made him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious.</p>
               <p>While the ſtate exciſe had been in force, writs had been iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued from his office, againſt delinquent diſtillers; 70, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to one term. The prothonotary was ſuppoſed to have had ſome concern in the matter, for the ſake of his fees. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, by purchaſing claims in litigated caſes, he had acquired the reputation of a ſpeculating prothonotary.</p>
               <p>However, perſons of his acquaintance, members of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee from Allegheny, were anxious to make trial of having him recalled; and one of them, George Wallace, a judge of the court, ſolicited me to ſpeak to Bradford, to prevail with him not to oppoſe the motion. I did ſo; and made uſe of the addreſs which my judgment ſuggeſted.—There is no queſtion, ſaid I, but this prothonotary has acted with great impertinence, in writing to the government, and introducing your name; and the coxcomb deſerves what he has got, for his pains. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, it is an injury to the country, and to myſelf, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonotary ſhould be abſent; let us recal him for the preſent, and have him removed in due time. I know there is a difficulty
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028332_0090_0FD89A772DA7FD00"/>
in the way, from the prejudices of others againſt him, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his ſpeculations, and the affair of the 70 writs; ſome of the diſtillers, againſt whom they were iſſued, being now of the committee; but, if you do not oppoſe the motion, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly it may be carried. He ſaid, he would not oppoſe it; but the people had thought they had done ſomething, by going to Braddock's fields, and if it was undone, they would be diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>I related this anſwer of Bradford to judge Wallace; and alſo ſaid, I would ſupport the motion, provided he could get ſome perſon to make it. He could get no one.</p>
               <p>My introducing the idea of difficulty from others, in the caſe of Briſon, was a ſtroke of art. It was as much as to ſay, I know you care very little about it, whether he comes or ſtays; but there will be objections from theſe people. This was intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with me, to overcome the objections; at leaſt, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his own. It had the effect.</p>
               <p>The committee adjourned to the next day. The committee of four, who were to model the reſolutions, were to meet ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the next morning. This committee were, Gallatin, Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Herman Huſband, and myſelf.</p>
               <p>I lay, that night, at a farm houſe in the neighbourhood, with an hundred, or more, of the gallery or committee about me. The whole cry was, War. From the manner in which they had underſtood me, I was greatly popular with them. Stand by us, ſaid they, and we will ſtand by you.</p>
               <p>I felt my ſituation, with extreme ſenſibility. I had an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the people, becauſe they had an attachment to me: and I thought of the conſequence: What ſuppoſe that, in the proſecution of the plan I have in view, arrangements cannot be made to ſatisfy them, and that a war muſt enſue; what ſhall I do? I am under no obligation of honour, to take a part in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting them; for I have no way contributed to produce the diſturbance. And though, on principles of conſcience, it may be excuſeable in them to make war, for they think they are right; yet it would not be ſo in me, for I think them wrong. But, on the ſcore of ſelf-preſervation, and perſonal intereſt, what am I to do? It is a miſerable thing to be an emigrant; there is a ſecret contempt attached to it, even with thoſe to whom you come. They reſpect more the valour, though they diſapprove the principle, of thoſe that ſtay at home. All I have in the world, is in this country. It is not in money; I cannot
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028332_0091_0FD8859F26CB4258"/>
carry it with me; and if I go abroad, I go poor: and I am too far advanced in life, to begin the world altogether.</p>
               <p>But as to theſe people; what chance have they? They may defend the paſſes of the mountains; they are warlike, accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the uſe of arms; capable of hunger and fatigue; and can lie in the water like badgers. They are enthuſiaſtic to mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and the effect of this is beyond calculation.</p>
               <p>The people on the eaſt of the mountains are, many of them, diſſatisfied, on the ſame principle; and will be little diſpoſed to diſturb the people here, if they ſhould mean to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It is true, the conſequence of war, ſuppoſing the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try independent of the United States, will be poverty, and a miſerable ſtate of things, for a long time; but ſtill, thoſe who ſtand by the country, where they are, have the beſt chance, and the moſt credit in the end. Should I emigrate, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try be reduced, I cannot live in it again, for a thouſand rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. I am in a quandary; and in either caſe, the election is painful. The only thing that can ſuit me, is an accommodation, and having the matter ſettled without a civil war. But is there any proſpect of this? Will the executive be diſpoſed to act with mildneſs, or rigour, in this inſtance? The exciſe law is a branch of the funding ſyſtem, which is a child of the ſecretary of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury; who is conſidered as the miniſter of the Preſident. He will feel a perſonal antipathy againſt the oppoſers of it; and will be inclined to ſanguinary counſels. The Preſident himſelf, will conſider it, as a more dangerous caſe than the Indian war, or the Britiſh ſpoilations; and will be diſpoſed to apply more deſperate remedies. He will ſee, that here the vitals are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; whereas there, the attack was upon the extremities. Nevertheleſs, the extreme reluctance which he muſt have, to ſhed the blood of the people, with whom he is perſonally popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, will diſpoſe him to overtures of amneſty.—Theſe were my reveries, as I lay with my head upon a ſaddle, on the floor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a cabin.</p>
               <p>In the morning, the committee of four having met, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the arranging and mending the reſolutions. Bradford was not ſatisfied with the indefinite expreſſion of the power giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the ſtanding committee, but wiſhed to have it in plain terms; probably with a view to get ſomething to paſs the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, that would involve all equally with himſelf, in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons committed. I wiſhed to evade it; and endeavoured to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert his attention, by keeping him laughing. I diſpenſed with Craig, on this occaſion, and made uſe of Herman Huſband. I
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:028332_0092_0FD89A7CDC3D4750"/>
endeavoured to amuſe Bradford with him, as a perſon would a boy, by playing with a bear.</p>
               <p>I had heard of this extraordinary character, many years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, when a principal of the inſurgents, known by the name of Regulators, in North Carolina. I had ſeen him in the year 1778, when he was a member of the legiſlature of Pennſylvania. I was preſent, when a Quaker lady was introduced, and preached before the houſe. Herman, who was a divine, as well as a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician, thought her not orthodox, and wiſhed to controvert; but the houſe, willing to avoid religious controverſies, would not ſuffer him.</p>
               <p>I had viſited him, in the year 1780, at his reſidence, in the glades of the Allegheny mountain, on my way from Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia to Pittſburgh. He had then juſt finiſhed a commentary on a part of the prophet Ezekiel: it was the viſion of the temple; the walls, the gates, the ſea of glaſs, &amp;c. Logger-head divines, heretofore, had interpreted it of the New Jeruſalem; but he conceived it to apply to the weſtern country; and the walls were the mountains, the gates, the gaps in them, by which the roads came, and the ſea of glaſs, the lake on the weſt of us. I had no heſitation in ſaying, that the commentary was analagous to the viſion. He was pleaſed; and ſaid, I was the only perſon, except his wife, that he ever got to believe it. Thought I, your church is compoſed, like many others, of the ignorant and the diſſembling.</p>
               <p>It was to this topic I drew him at preſent, and wiſhed him to explain his reveries. But Bradford was too intent on getting the reſolution amended, to an explicit proviſional declaration of war; he complained of my laughing, and wiſhed me to be ſerious. Gallatin, not perceiving my drift, ſaid, cynically, "He laughs all by himſelf." I let Bradford alone then, and he puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled the ſecretary enough, and obliged him to put in a ſentence, to avoid a worſe, viz. that in the laſt of the ſecond reſolution, as it was brought in.</p>
               <p>The reſolutions, as brought in, are as follows:</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. Reſolved, that taking the citizens of the United States from their reſpective abodes, or vicinage, to be tried, for real or ſuppoſed offences, is a violation of the rights of the citizens; is a forced and dangerous conſtruction of the conſtitution, and ought not, under any pretence whatever, to be exerciſed by the judicial authority.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. That a ſtanding committee, to conſiſt of  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028332_0093_0FD89A7DF7C42368"/>
from each county, be appointed, for the purpoſes hereafter mentioned, viz.</p>
               <p>To draft a remonſtrance to Congreſs, praying a repeal of the exciſe law; at the ſame time, requeſting that a more equal, and leſs odious tax, be laid; and giving aſſurances, that ſuch a tax will be cheerfully paid by the people of theſe counties: To make and publiſh a ſtatement of the tranſactions, which have lately taken place in this country, relative to the exciſe law, and of the cauſes which gave riſe thereto; and make a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Preſident on the ſubject: To have power to call together a meeting of the deputies, here convened, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of taking ſuch further meaſures as the future ſituation of affairs may require; <hi>and in caſe of any ſudden emergency, to take ſuch temporary meaſures as they may think neceſſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3d. That we will exert ourſelves, and that it be earneſtly recommended to our fellow citizens to exert themſelves, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the municipal laws of the reſpective ſtates; and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in preventing any violence or outrage, againſt the property and perſon of any individual.</p>
               <p>The firſt reſolution was read, and adopted.</p>
               <p>On reading the ſecond, it was moved by me, to fill up the blank with the number two, and to change the word county to townſhip; ſo that the ſtanding committee ſhould conſiſt of two deputies from each townſhip. My argument was, that a great object being to have them conſervators of the peace, in aid of the civil authority, it was neceſſary they ſhould be numerous, and every where alſo, that by them the ſtanding committee could the more readily diſſeminate their ideas and reſolutions amongſt the body of the people.</p>
               <p>There were perſons who thought my object wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It was moved by me, to inſert, before the words "to call together a meeting of the deputies," theſe words, "a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>either of a new repreſentation of the people,</hi> or of the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>My argument was, that a frequent change of repreſentation was correſpondent with democratic principles; but thy real rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was, to have it in my power to be quit of the buſineſs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided I ſaw no proſpect of accommodation with the government, or ſubmiſſion with the people. I was ſeconded in this, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidity,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:028332_0094_0FD885A52AC2C318"/>
by an aſſociate judge of Waſhington, James Edgar; and though I have not converſed with him, yet I will venture to ſay, it was upon the fame principle. The motion was ſupported by a number, and I am perſuaded, from the ſame motives. It was carried.</p>
               <p>An adjournment took place, to chuſe the ſtanding committee; which was done by each townſhip for itſelf. I was one for the townſhip of Pittſburgh.</p>
               <p>The committee now met again. I had drafted the following reſolution, viz. "That  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap>  commiſſioners be appointed to wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t on the Preſident of the United States, with the repreſentation of the people, and report to the ſtanding committee the anſwer they may receive."</p>
               <p>But it having been announced, in the courſe of our ſitting, that commiſſioners, from the executive to us, had arrived in the country, I changed the reſolution to the following, viz. "That a committee, to conſiſt of  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap>  members of each county, be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to meet any commiſſioners that have, or may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the government; and to report the reſult of this conference to the ſtanding committee." It was carried; and the blanks filled up with "three" members.</p>
               <p>There was a conſiderable oppoſition to this. It was ſaid, that, as the commiſſioners were now in the country, and ſaid to be but a day's journey diſtant, the committee could wait until their arrival, and hear their propoſitions, and determine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>This was conſidered as extremely dangerous to the object in view. James Roſs was preſent, and had juſt received his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, as a commiſſioner from the executive; and thought that, from the temper of the committee, and that of the gallery, by which they would be influenced, it did not appear probable that any propoſitions the commiſſioners could have it in their power to make, would be received. The buſineſs muſt be more gradually broken, and brought by degrees, and with cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, before the people. It was, therefore a great object to carry the reſolution as it was.</p>
               <p>In ſupport of this, the inconvenience of ſtaying at the place was alleged; no accommodation for ourſelves, or the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners: that it would take a long time for us to underſtand them, and them to underſtand us: that the negociation would conſiſt of conference and correſpondence; that there was no convenience of writing at the place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="unknown:028332_0095_0FD89A7F819EA088"/>The reſolution was carried, with conſiderable difficulty, that commiſſioners ſhould be appointed.</p>
               <p>But it was moved, that the committee ſhould wait where they were, or in the neighbourhood, until the commiſſioners, appointed by them, ſhould report to them.</p>
               <p>This was thought dangerous, on the principle before ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The report would come better, in the firſt inſtance, to the ſtanding committee; in chuſing which, addreſs had been uſed, to get the more reaſonable and moderate members; and that committee, being a ſmaller body, would be more eaſily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged.</p>
               <p>The time the conference would take up, and the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of waiting on the ground, or in the neighbourhood, was urged; but ſuch was the avidity of curioſity, that they were anxious to remain. Gallatin had exerted himſelf very much in theſe debates, and on this laſt point eſpecially: others had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him, but ſeemed to fail.</p>
               <p>I was walking on the outſide of the circle; commiſſioner Roſs came to me, and wiſhed me to ſtep forward. I do not ſee that I can do any thing, ſaid I; Gallatin, and others, have ſaid all that is reaſonable in the caſe, and yet have failed. You can do it, ſaid Roſs.</p>
               <p>I then ſtepped forward. Knowing that it was the impatience of curioſity, that made them anxious to ſtay, I obſerved, that it was not probable theſe commiſſioners had any thing of much conſequence to propoſe, the Preſident not having ſeen our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation before they had ſet out; and therefore though, on principles of common decency, it was proper to hear them, yet it was not worth while for the committee to waſte their time waiting for them.</p>
               <p>It was agreed, and the reſolution carried as it ſtands.</p>
               <p>It may be ſaid, that it is from motives of vanity, that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce myſelf ſo much in theſe tranſactions. No; it is from motives of ſelf-defence. I am explaining my conduct. Might I not do this, without introducing my ſpeeches ſo much? No; theſe ſpeeches have been miſconceived, and miſrepreſented; I am explaining the <hi>quo animo,</hi> or view with which they were made.</p>
               <p>The inſtruction movers now came forward. We muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the meeting. This was parried, by getting it to be obſerved, and preſſed, that inſtructions could not be given, with regard to propoſitions, when it could not be known what thoſe propoſitions were.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="unknown:028332_0096_0FD89A80F35A4550"/>It was now moved, that the time of the meeting of the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing committee ſhould be fixed. It was carried, that the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing committee ſhould fix their time of meeting themſelves.</p>
               <p>The committee adjourned without day.</p>
               <p>The ſtanding committee met, and fixed for their day of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap>  of September; and the place, Brownſville, on the Monongahela.</p>
               <p>The commiſſioners to confer with thoſe on the part of the United States, fixed the time the 20th of Auguſt, and the place Pittſburgh.</p>
               <p>Before my going to Parkinſon's ferry, an old man, of the name of Bar, from Mingo creek, calling at my office on buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, informed me, that though the people in his quarter had been offended with my ſpeech at Mingo creek, they had come home well pleaſed with my behaviour in the affair of Braddock's field; and now talked of making Bradford or me governor, on this ſide of the mountains. This led me to think there muſt have been ſome talk of an independent government. I had taken it for granted there had been; and in my letter to Tench Coxe, which I wrote about this time, ſuggeſted it. But on going to Parkinſon's ferry, I heard not a whiſper of the kind. I ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed James Marſhall, by aſking, when I read his reſolutions, that ſeemed to contemplate defenſive operations, By what ſyſtem he meant to act? was it by the organization of a government; or ſimply by a committee? I found that he had never thought of any thing but a committee.</p>
               <p>In our way to this meeting, we had found liberty poles in abundance. At Parkinſon's ferry, I think it was the morning of the ſecond day, one was raiſed, with a flag with ſix ſtripes, emblematical of the ſix counties there repreſented. I fell in with Benjamin Parkinſon, carrying down a board, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, to fix upon the pole. I read the inſcription; it was,
<q>
                     <list>
                        <item>Equal taxation, and no exciſe.</item>
                        <item>No aſylum for traitors and cowards.</item>
                     </list>
                  </q>
Thought I, there are two of us, then, that ought to be away: For you are a coward, and I am a traitor; for I do not mean to go to war, and if you do, you will not fight. This was the character of Benjamin.</p>
               <p>This morning, juſt before the opening of the committee, Torence Campbell, of Weſtmoreland, came to me, and informed me, that the exciſe law was not the only object with which the people were diſſatisfied; the high ſalaries of officers, both in the general and ſtate governments, were a grievance; that he had
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:028332_0097_0FD89A85D57F43F0"/>
prepared reſolves on this, and ſome other ſubjects, which he would hand to me to bring forward. I took him aſide into the buſhes, as if to communicate ſome great ſtate ſecrets, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him, that the plan agreed upon, was not to take up more things than one at once;—let us bull-bait the exciſe law for the preſent, and, in due time, we will knock down every thing elſe.</p>
               <p>Campbell had been ſecretary to a meeting in his county, and had draughted a remonſtrance againſt the uſe of judges in courts, and wiſhed only juſtices.</p>
               <p>A number of other perſons were anxious to bring forward reſolves, and motions, to the ſame effect with Torence. But it was given them to underſtand, that the policy of the occaſion did not admit ſo general a reform all at once.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI.</head>
               <p>I HAVE mentioned James Roſs, as a commiſſioner on the part of the United States; the others were, William Bradford, attorney general of the United States, and Jaſper Yates, a judge of the ſupreme court of Pennſylvania. The two laſt had arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Parkinſon's ferry, a ſhort time after the adjournment of the meeting; from thence they came Pittſburgh. Being known to the attorney general, and the judge, I waited on them, at the public houſe, after their arrival. I found major Craig giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them a tragical account of the cruel treatment of Kirkpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick, Neville, and the others, by the people of Pittſburgh, in ſending them away. I felt great indignation; and addreſſed him before the commiſſioners: Said I, The repreſentation is not juſt; you are impoſing upon theſe gentlemen; you are leading them to ſuppoſe, that the people of Pittſburgh expelled theſe men; it was the country. We acted as their guardians in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them away; the act was for them, more than for ourſelves. Here I gave a detail of the circumſtances. He was ſilent, and withdrew.</p>
               <p>I had diſcovered in the commiſſioners, unfavourable impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions towards me; I was at a loſs, whether to attribute them to what they had heard on the way, or to the account of Craig.
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:028332_0098_0FD89A87B6BE7EF0"/>
An expreſſion of the attorney general ſtruck me much. In my obſervations on the account of Craig, I had ſaid, that I had never conſidered myſelf as an inſurgent. I was employed to negociate for thoſe who were; but that did not involve the fact, that I was one myſelf. Said the attorney general, "That will be a ſubject of future conſideration." I was with the commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers but a ſhort time; finding the point of view in which I conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf to ſtand with them. The expreſſion of the attorney gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral had hurt my mind; and, with the language of Craig, became the ſubject of very ſerious reflections. I conſidered Craig but as an automaton; and that his impreſſions muſt be thoſe with which colonel Neville went away. That being the caſe, I had reaſon to ſuppoſe that this repreſentation would be the ſame which Neville would make to the executive. The people of Pittſburgh, and in particular myſelf, would be held up as inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents. After all my labour to get matters ſettled, this family would conſider me as having injured them; and when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, I ſhould be inſulted by them. I had found it hard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, in the village before, to ſupport myſelf againſt them; but it would be worſe now. I began to conſider, whether it would not be better to ſtand with the Sans Culottes of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and keep theſe men away, while they were away. But was it practicable? I could not reconcile it to myſelf to diſturb the union; that would be a wickedneſs beyond all poſſibility of contemplation. But this country might ſecede from it. That is a right that is never given up in ſociety. A part of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as well as an individual, may quit a government; and no doubt this country will quit the United States, in due time. That may be by a conſent of the union, or without it. But at preſent there would be no conſent. The example would be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to give. Common intereſt would not ſuffer it. We are bound to the union for our proportion of the public debt. We muſt diſcharge demands againſt the partnerſhip, before the firm, as to that, can be legally diſſolved. The United States have land beyond us; they cannot ſuffer us to ſhut them out from theſe, by an independent government between.</p>
               <p>But is it practicable to eſtabliſh and ſupport ſuch a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Perhaps it might;—claim theſe lands to the weſtward, and invite all the world to take poſſeſſion of them. Collect all the banditti on the frontiers of the ſtate, to help us to fight for them; tell the Spaniards to come up to the mouth of the Ohio, and give us a free trade; let the Britiſh keep the poſts, and furniſh us with arms and ammunition; get the Indians of the
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:028332_0099_0FD898DE5B40AB58"/>
woods to aſſiſt us; tell them, that the people on the eaſt of the mountains want our whiſkey, and their lands;—we might wage wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and perhaps ſucceed. It is true, we ſhould ſucceed to miſery, for a while, and poverty at laſt. But even this would be more tolerable to me, than to live under any circumſtances, ſuſpected by the government, and treated with contumely by theſe people, when they had returned, loaded with the favours of the government, as having been the great defenders of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the thoughts of a night. When I ſaw James Roſs in the morning, I explained to him my chagrin of the preceding day, and my reflections in conſequence of it; and gave him to underſtand, that I had half a mind to become an inſurgent. He took it more ſeriouſly than I intended it; his expreſſion was, "The force of genius is almighty; give them not the aid of yours."</p>
               <p>I told him, that nothing but ſelf-preſervation would lead me to think of it; or the being unjuſtly ſuſpected. He ſoothed my mind, by aſſuring me, that no ſuſpicion could poſſibly fall on me; that the commiſſioners, the preceding day, were perfectly ſatisfied with the explanation I had given in the preſence of Craig; and that what he had ſaid, had not left the leaſt impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Commiſſioners on the part of the ſtate of Pennſylvania, had been appointed by the governor; and had arrived. Theſe were, the honourable Thomas M'Kean, chief juſtice of the ſtate, and general William Irwin.</p>
               <p>A liberty-pole was raiſed in Pittſburgh, in the preſence of the commiſſioners; and it was with the greateſt difficulty, that we could prevent the hoiſting the ſix ſtripes upon it. The flag was made, and ready to be put up. The people were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to ſubſtitute the fifteen. Yet it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> where the poſſe was to have been raiſed.</p>
               <p>I fell in with Gallatin, the morning of our opening our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the commiſſioners. Said I, You underſtand me, Mr. Gallatin. I do, ſaid he, perfectly. It was the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation I had with him, ſince our modelling the reſolutions, at Parkinſon's ferry; and I did not know but that he might have miſconceived my ſpeeches. I explained to him the policy with which I had found it neceſſary to act; and the fears I had entertained on that occaſion, leaſt, by openly oppoſing, and bringing the matter to queſtion, it ſhould be carried againſt him: That he had preſumed more upon the powers of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and the reaſon of the people, than he was warranted
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:028332_0100_0FD898DF34FEE8E8"/>
in doing, where the paſſions were ſo violent; that a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular acquaintance with the fury of the people from what I had heard from Waſhington, and ſeen at the Mingo meeting, and at Braddock's fields, enabled me to judge.</p>
               <p>This was the firſt converſation that I ever had with Albert Gallatin in my life. I have underſtood from him ſince, that, at Parkinſon's ferry, he had been ſomewhat at a loſs to know my drift perfectly; but that James Roſs had explained to him, and he underſtood it.</p>
               <p>The point was now gained, to which I had always looked forward; the point where the foot was to be fixed, in order to make an open ſtand againſt the inſurrection. This was my expreſſion to James Roſs, when I walked out of the circle of the committee, at Parkinſon's ferry, having carried the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the committee to confer with the commiſſioners. The point is gained, ſaid I; there is a baſis now laid, from which we can act: to this point I had always looked forward, not expecting commiſſioners from the government, but propoſitions from it to commiſſioners, on our part, holding out an amneſty, which I took to be the great ſecret of compoſing the diſturbance. Until that appeared, the diſpoſition of thoſe involved; would lead them to cut throats, to ſupport themſelves; and the whole country, conſcious that every man had, in ſome degree, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, by words or actions, to produce that mental oppoſition to the law, which had terminated in actual force, could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile it to their feelings, to abandon thoſe who had acted, with precipitation, in the late inſtances. But an amneſty being given, theſe could ſay to their countrymen, You are now on a ground with us; ſtop, we wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> go no further.</p>
               <p>I conſidered the appointment of commiſſioners, on the part of the executive, as a pledge of amneſty; though I had yet no information of their powers. I therefore ſaw the way clear for the country to get out; and now the conduct ought no longer to be, a concealment of intentions, and a half-way acquieſcence, but an explicit avowal of opinions.</p>
               <p>On this principle, I took the firſt opportunity I had with Bradford and Marſhall, and it was in the preſence of one of the committee, before any conference with the commiſſioners, to inform them of my real ſentiments, with regard to the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the laws, which had taken place; and particularly with reg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rd to thoſe in which they had been implicated; the intercepting the mail, and the rendezvous at Braddock's fields. Bradford looked red and angry, Marſhall pale and affected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="unknown:028332_0101_0FD8856F2725A6F8"/>My impreſſion always was, that Marſhall had become ſenſible of the raſhneſs of the acts, and would be willing to make a good retreat as ſpeedily as poſſible. Until this time, alſo, I had an idea that Bradford would be manageable, as ſoon as he could ſee his way out. I had ſome apprehenſions now, and explained this to James Roſs; and it was agreed, to ſpeak to general Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win, whom we underſtood to be a favourite with Bradford, to take him in tow, and ſee what he could do with him. Our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for ſuppoſing Irwin a favourite, was a circumſtance of Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, while in the legiſlature of Pennſylvania, voting ſingly for Irwin, in the election of a ſenator of the United States, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Irwin was not in nomination at the time, and no other perſon voted for him. The chief juſtice alſo undertook to manage him.</p>
               <p>It was with a view to manage Bradford, and alſo to have a good effect with others of the committee, whoſe ſentiments I did not know, that in our firſt conference with the commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I ſtated, at ſome length, in ſtrong terms, the paſt and preſent grievances of this country. My idea was, that having ſhewed myſelf impreſſed with a ſenſe of all theſe evils, in addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the exciſe law, and yet diſpoſed to yield, others well might, who had not appeared to have ſo ſtrong an impreſſion of them.</p>
               <p>Our committee had conceived themſelves appointed only to receive and report propoſitions. But the commiſſioners inſiſted on acquieſcing or rejecting; as otherwiſe they would not think it worth their while to continue the negotiation. I did not think our acquieſcing would be of any uſe. We would appear to have exceeded our authority; and having given our aſſent, we could not come forward in the committee, to which we were to make report, as deliberating with others, whether we ſhould accede, or not; and a ſtate of deliberation for myſelf, as others, is that in which I would chuſe to be, in order to bring others with me; making them believe that they had half perſuaded me, when in fact I had wholly perſuaded them.</p>
               <p>My ſyſtem from the commencement, had been to take the buſineſs out of the hands of the multitude, as ſpeedily as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by inſtituting an extenſive committee. Not to take a final queſtion; but having enlightened that committee, and rendered them moderate, to make uſe of them as evangeliſts amongſt the people, when they went home, to diſſeminate the proper doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines. It was on this principle, that I had ſuggeſted the Park<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſon's ferry meeting. The fury of the people, at that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:028332_0102_0FD898E0BA98AFC8"/>
led me to ſee the neceſſity of reducing the country into ſtill ſmaller bounds, by a committee extracted from the firſt. It was on this principle, I approved and ſupported the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a ſtanding committee; even this committee was too large, with which to break the buſineſs, and therefore I wiſhed the ſmaller committee of twelve, to be the body with which we ſhould begin to act. Having inſtructed and enlightened theſe, and gained their aſſent, we ſhould come forward with them to the ſtanding committee, as ſo many diſciples, not wounding the pride of others by having taken it upon them, without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, to judge; but deliberating, as if not having judged at all.</p>
               <p>Having inſtructed and converted the ſtanding committee, we ſhould ſend them home to diſciple as many as they could; and come forward in the original and extenſive committee, in order to govern the reſult. In the mean time, by the gazettes and hand bills, to reach the body of the people with reaſonings on the ſubject. If this ſyſtem could have been adopted, it might have ſucceeded. For it is a great miſtake to ſuppoſe that Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford or Marſhall, or others, led the people. It was the people led them. It was the maſs of the people that commanded; and it was the fear of them, that operated on the minds of the more conſpicuous individuals. Even Bradford was the moſt obſtinate, becauſe he was the greateſt coward. He had not reach of thought, to ſee the danger from the government; but the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from the people was juſt before his noſe.</p>
               <p>This was the ſyſtem of proceeding which I had laid down in my mind, and agreeable to which, we urged with the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners the ſuffering us to go forward to the ſtanding commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, with the report merely; without having given our opinion on the propoſition, as a committee; and to wait until the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing committee ſhould have called the original repreſentatives at Parkinſon's, or a new general convention.</p>
               <p>The commiſſioners thought it more adviſeable that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of twleve ſhould declare their ſentiments, on the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and make it part of our report to the ſtanding committee; and as to delaying until the original or a new repreſentation of the people could be called, at Parkinſon's, it was impracticable, as the ſeaſon was advancing; and if offenſive operations muſt be commenced againſt the country, the Preſident muſt know it ſoon.</p>
               <p>This was deciſive. I had it, alſo, in confidence, at the time, from one or more of the commiſſioners, that there was danger
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:028332_0103_0FD898E230D3AA10"/>
of the flame ſpreading from the country; that diſcontents had actually begun to ſhew themſelves, and the like outrages to break out, in other places; that, for this reaſon, if conciliation did not anſwer the end, ſevere remedie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> muſt be ſpeedily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
               <p>Thus, the conduct of the people below, contributed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of that time, that was neceſſary to bring the public mind, amongſt ourſelves, to a proper ſenſe of intereſt and duty.</p>
               <p>In draughting our report, which had been committed to me, on the part of our committee, I had introduced our ſtatement, at leaſt the ſtatement made by me, of our general grievances in this country. It was with a view to ſhew the people, that we had made the moſt of our caſe, and of courſe muſt be ſuppoſed to have got the beſt terms, that could be given; and if we, who had been thus impreſſed, had yielded, they might. The commiſſioners thought it might rather ſtrengthen oppoſition in their minds, and it was ſtruck out.</p>
               <p>I had ſtated ſtrongly, on the part of the commiſſioners, the ſenſe they had expreſſed of the outrages committed; the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the expulſions, and eſpecially the intercepting the mail, and the march to Braddock's fields. It was with a view to bring theſe ſtrongly before the minds of the people, that, ſenſible of the attrocity, they might the more appreciate the value of an amneſty. But I am diſpoſed to believe, that this gave offence to Marſhall and Bradford, who had been implicated in the laſt acts. For I can no otherwiſe account for the diſſatisfaction they diſcovered towards me, from this time. I cannot believe that Marſhall, eſpecially, was at all diſſatisfied at being relieved from the extremely hazardous ſituation in which he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved.</p>
               <p>Concluding the report, I added ſome reaſons, which had been ſuggeſted, at leaſt by myſelf, in the committee, as ground<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of conceding to the propoſitions of the commiſſioners. They were ſuch, as I thought would have weight with the people. Albert Gallatin, in his ſpeech, in the legiſlature of Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, on the ſubject of the inſurrection, ſpeaking of theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſays, "They are, I ſuppoſe, ſuch as, in the judgment of the author, would make the moſt impreſſion upon the people. On that head, however, I think he was miſtaken." I think now, as I did then, that they were the moſt likely to impreſs; but that is a matter of opinion, I am not going to diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. The true democratic principle, on which it ſhould be put, doubtleſs was, that "the will of the majority ſhould go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern:
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:028332_0104_0FD898E3B3ED0B88"/>
the national will had made the law, and it ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed." However unequal and oppreſſive, on this part of the community, we might ſuppoſe it; yet the good of the whole demanded our ſubmiſſion.</p>
               <p>It is an abſtract argument that muſt ſatisfy the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but can never reconcile the heart. It is preciſely the ſame with the theological argument of the divines, The good of the whole requires that ſome ſhould be damned; and a man cannot be a ſaint, until he feels a diſpoſition to be reconciled to the Divine will, in this particular, even if it ſhould fall to his lot to go to hell. A man regenerated may come to this, but a natural man never will: ſo an enlightened politician, may comprehend and acquieſce in the principle of ſubmiſſion, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of burdens, when the nation dooms him to it; but the common mind revolts; and nothing will quiet him, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that he cannot help himſelf. My argument, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, chiefly contemplated the want of power; and ſometimes, by introducing an idea of poſtponement, on the ground of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting circumſtances, I endeavoured to get an acquieſcence for the preſent. Uſing this argument with one, his anſwer was, "The people never can be rouſed again." I knew that; and it was on this principle I ſuggeſted it. It was quite ſafe to talk of another day; for if the devil had been once laid, it would be difficult to raiſe him again. The people would begin to look back, and be made ſenſible of the precipice on which they had been ſtanding. Let the law be put in operation, and they would not find it the evil they had conceived it to be.</p>
               <p>At the requeſt of the commiſſioners, it had been urged to call a meeting of the ſtanding committee, at an earlier day than appointed. They were called to meet on the 28th of Auguſt.</p>

               <p>OUR committee of conference met at Brownſville, on the morning of the 28th of Auguſt. Brownſville is on the Monon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The firſt thing that ſtruck us, was a party of men, perhaps <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, armed with rifles; who had marched from the upper part of Waſhington, with a view, as we underſtood, to take the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and burn the buildings, mill, dwelling houſe, &amp;c. of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Jackſon, near that place, who had given offence, by an expreſſion diſreſpectful to the committee. Pains were taken to diſſuade from outrage; informing them, that, by the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made at Parkinſon's ferry, all complaints againſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, were to come before the committee, who were to decide upon the criminality, and upon the puniſhment. They were prevailed upon to be contented with having him brought before the committee, and tried in form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> but inſiſted upon going, with a file of men, to bring him.</p>
               <p>The committee of ſixty having met, which was under a ſhade of boards, conſtructed for the occaſion, Edward Cook was conſtituted chairman, and Albert Gallatin, ſecretary.</p>
               <p>Samuel Jackſon had been, by this time, brought up and was before the committee. He was of the denomination of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, called Quakers; a tall man, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h a broad brim to his hat. He preſerved a grave demeanor, and ſtood with an appearance of compoſed ſubmiſſion to the ſufferings that might await him.</p>
               <p>The charge againſt him was, that ſpeaking of the committee, he had called it a Scrub Congreſs. The charge was proved by two witneſſes. The queſtion now was, What puniſhment ſhould be inflic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> if he was found guilty, in the language of ſcripture, of "ſpeaking evil of dignities?" By the Scottiſh law it was what is called "leeſe-making," and ſubjects to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation. By the common law of England, which is our law, it might be conſtrued "ſedition," indictable and puniſhable as a miſdemeanor. In the delicate ſituation in which the country then was, it was thought to be a dangerous language, tending to leſſen the reſpect due to the newly conſtituted authorities, and
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:028332_0106_0FD898E9B4AAAA80"/>
evincing a bad diſpoſition towards the cauſe of the people. A general and ſincere concern was felt for the man, becauſe it was made a ſerious matter by the country, and eſpecially by the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of armed men who had marched a diſtance of 20 or 30 miles, to do execution on his perſon and property. There were of the committee, who muſt be ſuppoſed incenſed, and of courſe reſentful of the inſult.</p>
               <p>I had recourſe to my uſual expedient in deſperate caſes; pleaſantry. I recollect, ſaid I, to have read, that, in the time of Oliver Cromwell, lord protector of England, when he was in the height of his glory, a perſon came to him, and gave him information of words, uſed by another, greatly contemp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uous of his dignity; viz. he has ſaid, that your excellency may kiſs his —. You may tell him, ſaid Oliver, that he may kiſs mine. This Quaker has called us a Scrub Congreſs; let our ſentence be, that he ſhall be called a Scrub himſelf.</p>
               <p>The ſtory of Cromwell had produced a ſudden, involuntary, and loud laugh, and thrown a light upon the affair of Jackſon; introducing a proper ſentiment with regard to him, viz. that there was more magnanimity in diſregarding his expreſſions, than in puniſhing them. The troop that had brought him, laughed, and took him off to give him the epithet. He got a bucket of whiſkey and water, to drink with them, and we heard no more of it.</p>
               <p>The report was now about to be read; and a number of copies having been ſtruck off, they were diſtributed amongſt the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. While it was reading, there appeared great agitation in the committee. At ſome ſentences, a rumour, as in a church at the reſponſe.—Not, "Lord help us to keep this law;" but that of, "Good Lord deliver us."</p>
               <p>The popular mind had, by this time, gone far beyond the idea of an amneſty; and they rather thought of giving an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, than of taking it; paſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> by the injuries of government, on condition that it did not repeat them. They had expected a ſuſpenſion of the law; or, at leaſt, a promiſe of a repeal of it.</p>
               <p>I was a good deal alarmed; and ſaw that it would not do to come forward in defence of the report, immediately. It would be neceſſary to give them time to reflect a little; and to prepare the way, by a general converſation, out of doors. Finley, Smiley, and other popular men, were on the ground, and might contribute to inform the people.</p>
               <p>It had ſtruck Gallatin, and others, in the ſame point of view, and it was moved to adjourn, until the next morning. It was
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:028332_0107_0FD88571682B43A0"/>
with a view to give the members time to conſider the report. An adjournment took place; and I heard Bradford calling out, for the Waſhington members to convene by themſelves.</p>
               <p>I had croſſed the river that night, and lodged at a farm houſe, on the weſt ſide; and this, not only with a view to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, but alſo to be out of the way, if, in conſequence of diſſatisfaction with our report, any perſonal violence, to the committee of twelve, or any of them, ſhould be meditated; a thing wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch I thought not at all improbable: for what avails popularity in ſuch times as theſe? it is but the turning of the hand; the palm up or down; from the height of favour, to the loweſt point of obloquy and perſecution. Was there any man in Pennſylvania, more popular than John Dickinſon, at the commencement of the American revolution? he was ſaid to be oppoſed to a declaration of independence, and became ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious. James Wilſon was at the height of political fame, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people; but he had diſapproved of the form of conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, they had adopted in the commonwealth, and they were about to murder him in his own houſe. I poſſeſſed, at this preſent time, the beſt kind of popularity, viz. that obtained af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much obloquy, through a ſeries of years, ſuffered to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect itſelf: a popularity obtained, doubtleſs, by ſailing a little with the popular gale; at leaſt, not oppoſing it; but chiefly by a ſteady and upright demeanor in my profeſſion. The popular mind, though paſſionate, is generous; and if it becomes ſenſible that it has wronged a man, will repair it. I mean to explain this more fully, as far as regards myſelf, in the concluſion of this narrative.</p>
               <p>But though poſſeſſing, at this time, a ſolid popularity, I knew that a breath, on the ſubject of the exciſe law, would put it to a temporary death. However, I had no thought now of the loſs of popularity, but ſo far as it would produce permanent danger, in the ground. Gallatin was in his own county, amongſt a people more moderate, and he might be in leſs danger; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, he was not without apprehenſions, and had reaſon.</p>
               <p>In the morning, croſſing the river, and coming into the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, I was led to underſtand, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the private meeting of the Waſhington members, the preceding evening, great warmth, and a talk of guillo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing, was heard, and the clapping of hands. <hi>I</hi> met Gallatin, and James Lang, a member of the committee of twelve; and who was of that village, and was greatly alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from what he had ſeen and heard. It was early, and the committe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of ſixty had not yet collected, and the gallery, of
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:028332_0108_0FD898EB38E0AF28"/>
which great numbers were from the neighbourhood of the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go meeting-houſe, had not yet convened. I had converſed with ſome, the preceding evening, before I left the village; and found ſtrong prejudices againſt me, as having made uſe of my talents, as a lawyer, to perſuade the committee of conference to the acquieſcence with the propoſitions of the commiſſioners. It was inſinuated that we had been bribed; and it was told my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that attornies would take fees. I heſitated, therefore, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhould remain or not. It might be ſafeſt to return to Pittſburgh. I thought of this; more eſpecially, as I had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that Bradford had preſerved a diſtance from me, and appeared to be diſſatisfied. I knew that the example of arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing members in the French Convention, the knowledge of which was familiar here, might lead to the arreſting me, or others that were obnoxious; and between an arreſt and putting to death, as there, ſo here, there would be but little interval. Gallatin acknowledged himſelf not inſenſible of the delicacy of the ſituation; and that inſult, at leaſt, might be offered; but obſerved, that we had bound ourſelves, in honour, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, to come forward, and ſupport the propoſitions. I reflected with myſelf, that, nevertheleſs, in this undertaking of our committee of conference with the commiſſioners, it was not underſtood, that we were to run a riſk of life, or even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities, in recommending their own intereſt to the people. However, as Gallatin was diſpoſed to try it, I was willing. It was then conſidered, what ſhould be the order of our ſpeaking; there was a reluctance with each of us, to break the buſineſs. I propoſed, that we ſhould get James Edgar, a member of the committee of twelve, to begin. He was an aſſociate judge of the court of Waſhington, and a kind of a rabbi in the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian churches of the weſtern country: had been a preſbyter, or elder, from his youth; had been a member of committees, in the early period of the American revolution; and of legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive aſſemblies, executive and cenſorial councils, or deliberative conventions, ever ſince. His head was prematurely hoary, with prayers, and faſtings, and religious exerciſes; his face thin and puritanic, like the figures of the old republicans, in the time of the long parliament in England. He was a man of ſenſe, and not deſtitute of eloquence. It was agreed, that he ſhould open the way for us. It was propoſed to him, but he appeared reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; I know not on what principle. It was impoſed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, upon Gallatin.</p>
               <p>The committee having convened, with a formidable gallery,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:028332_0109_0FD898ECF64F6D58"/>
as the day before, Gallatin addreſſed the ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ir, in a ſpeech of ſome hours. It was a piece of perfect eloquence; and was heard with attention, and without diſturbance. I ſhall not undertake to give the ſcope of this ſpeech, as I could not do it juſtice; and probably they have miſconceived, and mignt miſtake ſome part of it.</p>
               <p>I followed Gallatin, in a ſpeech of ſome length, but under that advantage, which a ſpeaker feels, when he attempts a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject recently exhauſted. In the courſe of advocating, Gallatin had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ply traverſed the ground of diſtinction between our caſe, and the caſe of America at the revolution. In our caſe, no prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple was violated; we had been repreſented, and were ſtill to be repreſented in the body which enacted the law. He exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined the exciſe l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w itſelf, and ſhewed the ameliorations, which had taken place, as to the quantum of duty, and the mode and means of raiſing it, and repreſented the probable extinction of it in due time altogether. He explained the conceſſions made by the commiſſioners, in the relinquiſhment of arrearages, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under a ſtipulation in the propoſitions, that "benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial arrangements would be made." He diſcuſſed the local, and exiſting reaſons of our complaints; the Indian war; our obtaining the poſts, the Miſſiſſippi trade, by the negociation of the union. He painted the miſchiefs which had been done, and would ſtill farther be done to this country, if we perſiſted in oppoſition; by weakening the ſpirit of liberty itſelf; of which the inſurrection in the ſtate of Maſſachuſetts was an example, formerly the moſt democratic ſtate in the union, now the moſt ariſtocratic. For certain it is, the illegal oppoſition, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, has a tendency to make the people abject, and the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment tyrannie. He conſidered the injury to the ſpirit of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty throughout the union, and the injury to the republican cauſe throughout the world. He demonſtrated the ſuperiority of the ſtructure of our republic, over all that had been; and painted the atrocity of undermining or ſhaking the fabric. He took a full and conſpicuous view of the comparative ſtrength and reſources of a conteſt of this country with the United States; the ſuperiority in numbers, advantage of funds, ſea coaſts. He repelled the abſurdity of expecting, if any did expect, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or aſſiſtance from Spain, or Britain. If eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and the little to be gained in the reſult. Finally, the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated ignominy and ruin, on all theſe principles, of perſiſting in a courſe, that was bad in itſelf, and hopeleſs in its ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="unknown:028332_0110_0FD898EE34263070"/>It was a difficulty with me to find any thing new that could be advanced; and I ſpoke more for the ſake of ſhewing that I had courage to ſpeak, than from an idea that I could add to the argument, or improve the impreſſion that had been made. However I exerted my invention to vary the light of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to add ſomething new. Gallatin had addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf chiefly to the patriotiſm of the audience. I addreſſed myſelf to their conſcience and fears. I confeſs that it was in their fears that I had the moſt confidence. Gallatin had been didactic and deliberate, though animated. I became more impaſſioned, and declamatory. My obſervations were to the following ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:</p>
               <p>It ſeems to be an idea entertained by the people that we can remain a part of the government, and yet wage war againſt it. That is impoſſible, in the nature of the caſe; we are known to the government by repreſentation only, and not by force. We muſt therefore either overthrow it, or it muſt overthrow us. But we have ſworn to ſupport it. If we contemplate the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Where is our oath of allegiance? But can we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it? we might as well think of toſſing the Allegheny mountain from its baſe.</p>
               <p>But we may obtain a repeal of the law, by an exhibition of force; by poſſeſſing the mountain, and making a ſhew of arms. That is not probable, after the ſteps taken by the Preſident. On principle of example, it would ſo vitally affect the ſafety of the government, that it can never be countenanced. We are told by the commiſſioners, and we have no reaſon to doubt it, that the whole force of the union will be exerted, to cruſh ſuch a precedent.</p>
               <p>But cannot we ſecede from the union? not, and remain a part of the government at the ſame time. We muſt diſſolve our connection with Pennſylvania, before we can ceaſe to be under the government of the United States. But have we a right to diſſolve our union with both? an individual may emigrate from ſociety; and a part of a ſociety may ſeparate from the whole, but an individual cannot leave a ſtate in war, becauſe he owes ſervice for the benefits he has enjoyed in peace. He cannot leave it without diſcharging debts he owes to individuals, or to the public. How then can a part of the community ſeparate, before it has diſcharged the obligations contracted by the whole? we are bound for the payment of the public debt, a part of which has been contracted for our ſpecial protection. The ſtate

There is no manner of queſtion, but the time will come when the weſtern country will fall off from the eaſtern, as north will from the ſouth, and produce a confederacy of four; but ſurely it is our mutual intereſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main together as long as poſſible; to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>I have heretofore felt myſelf embarraſſed, in knowing what to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I conſidered the feelings of the country with partiality of heart; knowing the ground of them to be, the unequal law in queſtion.

give, that you acquieſce with the propoſitions of the commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and accept the amneſty offered you. It is the expedient left to ſave the country, which has been already impaired <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It was improving in agriculture, repleniſhing with buildings, becoming an object of emigration from abroad; and is now dejected, from this height, to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable depth, from what it was. The value of property is reduced, from what has happened. I do not conſider what I poſſeſs, at this moment, as of more than one half of the value of what it was three months ago; but it will be ſtill worſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the evils that are impending, are prevented by an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate acquieſcence.</p>
               <p>The above is the ſubſtance of what was ſaid by me, but at that time developed and detailed to a greater extent.</p>
               <p>Edgar followed me, with great earneſtneſs, and with the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of an evening ſermon, in a diſcourſe of great length.</p>
               <p>Bradford now roſe to ſpeak; and, contrary to his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the commiſſioners, perſonally, and his agreement with the report of the committee, he oppoſed the acceptance of the propoſitions, in direct and violent terms. Speaking of the reſources of war, arms, ammunition, &amp;c. ſaid he, "We will defeat the firſt army that comes over the mountains, and take their arms and baggage."</p>
               <p>"Not ſo eaſy neither," ſaid a man in a blue coat, who was in the gallery. This, I underſtood afterwards, was a colonel Crawford, a brave Indian warrior of the frontiers. He had ſome experience of what fighting was, and an idea there might be fighting; Bradford had none.</p>
               <p>Alluding to my obſervation, that I conſidered that what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty I might have in the country as having loſt half its value, on account of the diſturbance, Bradford uſed this expreſſion— "Daſtardly to talk of property, when liberty is in queſtion." This was contemptuous and provoking; nevertheleſs, I did not think it prudent, on the concluſion of his ſpeech, to riſe again, or to make any obſervations. I ſaw, from the countenance of many of the committee, that they were with him.</p>
               <p>Gallatin ſpoke a little; and moved to take the vote, on the propoſitions of the commiſſioners. Objections were made to the taking any vote at all. The queſtion was then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

be known, on the ſubject, was the reaſon of objecting to the taking the vote publicly. The queſtion was put, Shall a private vote by ballot be taken? It was negatived; the twelve only, as before, riſing.</p>
               <p>Here was a moment of delicacy indeed. The taking no vote was rejecting the propoſitions; and what was the conſequence? Meaſures muſt have been taken inſtantly, to prepare for war. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For the example of the Terroriſts, as they have been called, in France, was in the public mind, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially with Bradford, who had ſome light wandering infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of French affairs, as he had of other ſubjects; and had heard of their arreſting one another, after their debates, and cutting off heads; and coupling the ſucceſſes and the executions together, he would conceive the idea, that the executions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the ſucceſſes.</p>
               <p>Gallatin, with great preſence of mind, ſeized the moment, and propoſed, that we ſhould take a final vote, by ballot; not to be made a part of our anſwer to the commiſſioners, but ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in order to know our own minds.</p>
               <p>There was heſitation, even at this; for every man was afraid the hand writing, even of his ballot, would be known; and by ſome means it might tranſpire, in what manner he had voted.</p>
               <p>At this inſtant, a member of the committee riſing, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſcrap of paper in his fingers, with the word Yea written one part, and the word Nay on the other, held it up, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that 60 ſuch ſcraps, with the words yea and nay, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the ſame manner, ſhould be made out by the ſecretary, and a ſcrap given to each of the members; and let every one divide his ſcrap in two parts, with the Yea on one, and the Nay on the other; and let him chew, or tear the Yea or the Nay, as he thought proper, and put the other piece into a h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, held by the ſecretary. When theſe were drawn out, it would be ſeen, what the private ſenſe of the committee was, without the poſſibility of any one knowing how another voted. This mode was thought ſufficiently ſafe, and adopted.</p>
               <p>It ſtruck me greatly, to obſerve the carefulneſs of every one, in dividing or putting in his yea or no; to conceal it. All having been put in, and the tickets drawn out, there were found 34 Yeas, and 23 Nays.</p>
               <p>It verified what I had ſtated, that the ſentiments of a great
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:028332_0115_0FD8857467F971B8"/>
part were not, privately, what they publicly avowed. I muſt confeſs, I was rather ſurpriſed, that, in a committee which had been ſelected with great care and addreſs, from the general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, at Parkinſon's; and after the amneſty offered, and the maſterly reaſoning of Gallatin, and the direct and plain explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by me, and the peroratory ſermon of Edgar, there ſhould have been ſo many Nays. It may be ſeen, from this, what would have been the caſe, if the queſtion of war had been ſuffered to be directly called for, and taken, at Parkinſon's.</p>
               <p>Bradford appeared ſtruck, on finding that the majority was with us. His countenance became dark and diſmayed; for I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked him with attention. The members that had been for war, were pretty eaſily diſcoverable, by the diſſatisfaction they evinced by the countenance, or by language. There were ſome of them conſiderably enraged. But the gallery were the moſt explicit, in ſhewing ſatisfaction or diſſatisfaction with the vote. It was, in general, not a popular one.</p>
               <p>However, it had changed the face of things; and there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing a majority in favour of adopting the propoſitions, it remained for the committee to go on, and make up their anſwer to the commiſſioners. But having ſat a long time, it was thought proper to adjourn, and meet again for the purpoſe. During the adjournment Bradford went home.</p>
               <p>It may be aſked me, How will I account for his conduct in coming forward with his inflammatory ſpeech? Had he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived originally any project of ambition, either in ſubverting the government, or erecting a ſeparate commonwealth? Not at all; he had not ſcope of mind enough to think of either; he thought of nothing, but an exhibition of force inducing the Congreſs to repeal the exciſe law. He did not conſider, that, though in ſuch a government as the republic of Rome, where there were two diſtinct powers, actually in operation, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natorial and tribunitial, the ſeceſſion of the people, to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine or Aventine mount, might impoſe terms upon the ſenate; and that, though in a monarchy, ſuch as Great Britain, where the ſtatute of the parliament is ſometimes the ſtatute of the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter, a diſſatisfaction and diſturbance may alarm the miniſter, for the enjoyment of his place; knowing, that the king may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile his ſubjects, by removing him; and he may uſe the ſame influence to have the law repealed, that he did to have it enacted;—but that, in our government, there was but one or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of the public will, the Congreſs; and no temporary offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, on whom the odium of an unpopular law could be thrown,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:028332_0116_0FD885AEA14BF4D0"/>
ſo as ſtill to ſave the dignity of the enacting power. It was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, without ſapping all foundation of authority, to yield to the force, not the requiſition of a part.</p>
               <p>Was Bradford ſincere in conceding finally to the terms of the commiſſioners, and engaging to go forward and advocate them with the committee? I believe he was. How then will I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for his change of diſpoſition? In this manner: while the committee of conference ſat with the commiſſioners, at Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, there were individuals from the country, waiting for the reſult, and ſome occaſionally in town, upon buſineſs, but who were ſolicitious to know what was done. It had tranſpired, therefore, that "we were to ſubmit to the exciſe law." This was carried to the country, and produced a flame. It was ſaid that the commiſſioners had brought up gold, that I had got e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make it unneceſſary for me to plead law any more. I had heard ſo much of this, that in riding to Brownſville with the report, and paſſing through the Mingo creek ſettlement, I made haſte, apprehenſive that I might be ſtopped, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port taken from me. Bradford had gone to Waſhington, and finding how the current ran, he denied that he had acquieſced, and laid the blame on Gallatin and me. Yet he had not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take any active part in oppoſing, but ſimply to glide with the current, until he went to Brownſville, and ſaw the unfav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable manner in which the report was received the firſt day; nor even then had he not perfectly made up his mind, until in the committee, a ſhort time before he ſpoke, when two of the members urged him, ſaying, Will Brackenridge and Gallatin run us intirely down? Can we have nothing to ſay on this ſide? This information I have from James Alliſon, his brother-in-law, a judge of the court of Waſhington, to whom Bradford ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it, before he went away. I am the more inclined to believe this, from recollecting an obſervation of Bradford to me at Parkinſon's ferry, when I mentioned to him, that the march to Braddock's field had been a raſh act; he laid it upon the people; and ſaid that Marſhall had nearly ruined himſelf by retracting, but that he had ſaved himſelf by falling in with them. In ſhort, I knew him to entertain the idea, that it was ſafeſt always to ſtand with the people, not diſtinguiſhing in this caſe, who were the people. If this country had been lopped off from the world, it would have been all well enough.</p>
               <p>It may be aſked, Was he a man of eloquence? Could his harangue have ſuch effect? It ſerved to give a face to an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and doubtleſs prevented the general acquieſcence. Had
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:028332_0117_0FD898F98594B9E8"/>
he taken a contrary part, he would have loſt popularity, for the time; but there would have been no thought of further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The committee having met, the queſtion now was, Whether more favourable terms might not be obtained from the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners; or at leaſt time to convene the original meeting of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties at Parkinſon's ferry, in order to lay the propoſitions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. It was well known to thoſe who had been of the committee of 12, that no better terms could be obtained. We were doubtful that the commiſſioners would not wait for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the deputies, at Parkinſon's, after a diſſent of ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable minority of the ſtanding committee; nevertheleſs, in order to ſatisfy the people, as to the firſt, and to leave it to the commiſſioners, as to the laſt, it was perfectly agreeable to us, that a new committee ſhould be appointed, to wait upon the commiſſioners. It would at leaſt ſuſpend the expectation of the people, and prevent any violent meaſures being adopted in the mean time. Accordingly it was approved, on our part, that a new committee of conference ſhould be appointed.</p>
               <p>A new committee of 12 was appointed, three from each county, and the ſtanding committee adjourned without day.</p>
               <p>No gallery, or little, had attended in the afternoon. On going out I ſaw clubs, and cluſters of thoſe, who had been the gallery, in private and cloſe converſation in different places. Paſſing by ſome of them, I ſpoke with confidence, as if I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected nothing; but was received with ſilence, and with looks of indignity.

                  </gap>e were perſons, who were at that time, my clients, in cauſes of moment, and whom I had ſerved with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in former caſes, and with whom I had been long in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of attachment; yet notwithſtanding every lien of amity, they behaved to me in this manner: A man, whom I had brought with me from Pittſburgh, to carry the copies of the report, a few hundred of which had been printed, gave me to underſtand, that from what he could over-hear, there was ſomething on foot. I gave him money to diſcharge my bill at the public houſe, and as ſpeedily as I could, without ſeeming to be in haſte, croſſed the river; my horſes had been left in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, on that ſide; I aſſiſted a lad in driving them up, brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them, and had them ſaddled, and was ready to mount, when the man, whom I had left, had got over. Some perſons had croſſed over with him; amongſt theſe were four of the Alleghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny members of the committee. It was then dark; we rode eighteen miles that night, and got through the bulk of the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go creek ſettlement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="unknown:028332_0118_0FD88575E65A5430"/>I have learnt ſince, that nothing but a want of deciſion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented them from arreſting me, after my ſpeech, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. It was in agitation, but they wavered in attempting it. The going away of Bradford alſo diſcouraged them. They had talked of arreſting Gallatin, but his ſpeech had been more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract and guarded, and had not given ſo much offence as mine. It was in agitation, ſome days after this, to take him, and a body of men had actually collected at Fredericktown, on the weſt of the Monongahela, for that purpoſe. They were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded by perſons who went over from Fayette county, and who endeavoured to remove their miſconceptions.</p>
               <p>In our company that night, of the four Allegheny members that were along, was one of the name of Miller. When he firſt joined us, I was ſuſpicious of him, knowing that he had been a principal, in the two attacks upon the houſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpector, and commanding a company upon Peter's creek, in a ſettlement through which we had to paſs. I did not know but he might have been diſpatched with orders to arreſt me, as I went through. I communicated this to ſome of the other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the company; and we took care to ride faſt enough not to put it in his power to be much a-head of us. He lodged with us, where we halted a few hours, and ſlept on the planks, at the houſe of a German.</p>
               <p>In the morning when we had ſet out, which was early, on our way, I kept cloſe by him, and fell into converſation. He had been in the American ſervice during the war with Great Britain; had been employed chiefly in the weſtern country, in the war againſt the Indians. Had diſtinguiſhed himſelf for fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, activity, and bravery, on every occaſion. I led him to talk of his ſervices, and he gave the hiſtory of a variety of inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. Sliding gradually from thence, I touched upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent affairs of the country; the coming of the marſhal, the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to him, the attack upon the houſe of the inſpector, &amp;c. I knew he had been one of the delinquent diſtillers, and that it was on leaving his houſe, after having ſerved a writ, that the marſhal had been fired upon; which was the firſt oppoſition he had met with, in the ſervice of proceſs. Miller gave me, with frankneſs, a relation of the whole circumſtances. The federal ſheriff, ſaid he, was reading the writ, and general Neville was on horſeback in the lane, when he called to the ſheriff to make haſte. I looked up, and ſaw a party of men running acroſs the field, as it were to head the ſheriff. He ſet off with general Neville, and when they got to the head of the lane, the people
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:028332_0119_0FD898FDF3168978"/>
fired upon them. Do you think, ſaid I, they fired with balls, and meant to hit them? Said he, I believe they meant to hit them; they purſued them, and would have killed them.</p>
               <p>That night, continued Miller, it was concluded that we would go on to Neville's, and take him and the marſhal. I felt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf mad with paſſion. I thought 250 dollars would ruin me; and to have to go the federal court, at Philadelphia, would keep me from going to Kentucky this fall, after I had ſold my plantation, and was getting ready <note n="*" place="bottom">This was one of the men that was thought might be depended upon, in caſe of a war.</note>. I felt my blood boil, at ſeeing general Neville along, to pilot the ſheriff to my very door. He had been againſt the exciſe law as much as any body. When old Graham, the exciſe man, was catched, and had his hair cut off, I heard general Neville himſelf ſay, they ought to have cut off the ears of the old raſcal; and when the diſtillers were ſued, ſome years ago, for fines, he talked as much againſt it as any body. But he wanted to keep in the aſſembly then. But whenever he got an offer of the office himſelf, he took it. I am a relation of Kirkpatrick, his mother and my mother were ſiſters; I was always for general Neville, in his elections; and it put me mad to ſee him coming to ruin me.</p>
               <p>I deſired him to give me the particulars of the attack upon Neville's houſe, the firſt day. He did ſo: he ſaid they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirty men, with fifteen guns, ſix only in order. They found the general juſt got up; after ſome words, he fired firſt. It was from the windows. A horn was blowing in the houſe, the time of the firing. Was the door open? ſaid I. It was, ſaid he. Why then did you not ruſh into the entry? We were afraid, ſaid he, that he had a ſwivel, or a big gun there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>The negroes, continued Miller, by this time, fired out of their cabins upon our backs, and ſhot ſeveral; and we got off as well as we could.</p>
               <p>Well, what now; are you for war? No, ſaid he, I voted for peace; but if I was to acknowledge that, I need never go home. I will have to deny it; and I will have to do whatever my company will inſiſt upon me doing now. But I expect to get away ſoon, and to be clear of it.</p>
               <p>By this time, we had arrived at his houſe, about eight miles from Pittſburgh. As we came up, three pretty children pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves, in the inſide of the fence that encloſed the cabin; and one of them ſaid, putting his fingers between the

                  </note>. I was ſenſibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the reflection, that poſſibly that daddy might come to be hanged, and that brother fatherleſs, before it could know that it ever had one.</p>
               <p>The new committee of conference met at Pittſburgh, on the firſt of September. Nine only attended. They requeſted a more general and explicit relinquiſhment of arrearages; and demanded until the 11th of October, to take the ſenſe of the people.</p>
               <p>The commiſſioners could not relax, in a ſingle particular, from their former propoſitions. But, conſidering the ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations with the former committee of conference as at an end, there not being a proſpect of that general ſubmiſſion, on which the amneſty was to depend, yet willing to grant it to thoſe who were diſpoſed to ſubmit, they propoſed a mode of taking the ſenſe of the country, and putting it in the power of every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual to ſave himſelf; viz. that on the 11th of September, any man, in his diſtrict, ſhould ſubſcribe his name to a paper, declaring his willingneſs to yield obedience to the law, and faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing acquieſcence for the future.</p>
               <p>The neceſſity of individually ſigning, would be conſidered by the people as humiliating; nevertheleſs, it became neceſſary now, under a proſpect of war, in order to enable the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment to diſtinguiſh the penitent or peaceable, from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate or refractory. But an advantage was gained, as the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty was made to depend upon the conduct of the individual himſelf, and not upon the peace being kept by the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>Alexander Addiſon, preſident of the diſtrict on the weſt of the mountains, had arrived at Pittſburgh, before this time. He had been returning from the court of errors and appeals, at Philadelphia; but hearing of the perſonal prejudice againſt him, of which commiſſioner Roſs, after conſultation with me, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him by letter, he had remained at Bedford, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of 105 miles from Pittſburgh. I had, in the mean time, ventured to write to him, recommending the coming directly to Pittſburgh; but not to his reſidence at Waſhington. The let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had paſſed him on the way; for he had adopted, from his own reflections, a reſolution, the ſame that I had ſuggeſted, and had come on to Pittſburgh. Meeting here with gentlemen from Waſhington, and a pacification being now agreed upon, he thought it ſafe to go on to Waſhington. He went; and had
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:028332_0121_0FD89901B5D21F38"/>
been preſent at the meeting at Brownſville. He had returned from Waſhington, and was now in Pittſburgh. In the mean time, having conſiderably allayed the prejudice againſt himſelf, by his converſation with the people; by a candid ſtatement of his conduct, viz. that on his way to Philadelphia, he had met with the marſhal, and gave it as his opinion to him, that he would meet with no inſult in the execution of his duty; and this was the confidence that he had in the reaſon of the people, at the time, and it was unfortunate that he had found himſelf miſtaken. Judge Addiſon, alſo, was active in conciliating to an acceptance of the propoſitions of the commiſſioners.</p>
               <p>The court of Allegheny, to be held the firſt Monday in Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, was now to be opened. It was a queſtion, whether it was beſt to be opened at all, or not? It was ſuggeſted, that that the ſuſpenſion of juſtice might ſtrike the public mind, with view of the lurid ſtate of things; like the interdict of the pope, on the performance of religious rites, in the catholic countries. It did not appear to me, that it would diſpleaſe generally, but rather pleaſe, as a liberation from the reſtraint of law; and leading to a wiſh, with the moſt violent, that it ſhould always remain ſo.</p>
               <p>The court was opened; but it was a queſtion, whether the grand jury ſhould be charged with the preſent merits of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences lately committed in the country, in oppoſition to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe law. The chief juſtice and judge Yates were conſulted by judge Addiſon, and it was thought adviſeable, that they ſhould not; as an amneſty, under conditions of ſubmiſſion, was in offer to the country; and it could not be known who would avail themſelves of it.</p>
               <p>Such was the ſtate of things, when the commiſſioners, both of the United States and of the ſtate of Pennſylvania, having done all that was in their power to do, left the country. And here I cannot deny myſelf the pleaſure, of expreſſing the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility with which I then felt, and do now feel, the patience, the mildneſs, and the philoſophy, diſcovered by the commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, both on the part of the United States, and of the ſtate of Pennſylvania, in hearing every thing, in conceding every thing that was tolerable or practicable, in our negociation; their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude to ſave the people here from deſtruction, and the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment from embarraſſment; their thoughts to be in union with us, I ſpeak of thoſe of us, and the greater part of the twelve conferees were ſuch, as had the ſame ſingle point in view, to heal the miſchiefs of the country.</p>

               <p>FROM the temper of the country, I was not without appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions that the commiſſioners might be inſulted on their return. It had not been thought ſafe for them to go to Brownſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, and be preſent at the deliberations of the ſtanding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee. I found that it would not have been ſafe for the chief juſtice, a commiſſioner on the part of Pennſylvania, to have gone. It had been carried to the country, by individuals oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally in town, that the chief juſtice was very rigid in the management of the negociation; and particularly inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on having the recalling the exiled, made an article of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the commiſſioners. This, doubtleſs, had been urged by the chief juſtice; but relinquiſhed, on our obſerving, that the ſubmiſſion on the part of the country, which was ſtipulated, as the condition of the amneſty, drew with it, neceſſarily, the diſcontinuance of all perſonal violence; and that the return of theſe perſons would be of courſe, without ſaying any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; that the idea of ſubmiſſion itſelf, would be ſufficiently difficult of digeſtion, even though not accompanied with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumſtance, at which the mind would revolt.</p>
               <p>At Greenſburgh, the ſeat of juſtice of Weſtmoreland, a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oter had the impertinence to charge the ſervant of the chief juſtice with ſtealing his boots and ſpurs, and, under this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, had collected a party, to attack the houſe in which the commiſſioners lodged. They were troubleſome, during the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028332_0123_0FD8990959C9DA38"/>
greateſt part of the night. A liberty-pole ſtood near the houſe, and creeping up, they would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> themſelves behind this, and give abuſive language. They threw ſtones at the houſe, and broke the glaſs of ſome of the windows. The commiſſioners were armed with piſtols, and ſtood on their defence. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had been intoxicated, and were not heard of in the morning.</p>
               <p>It was unfortunate, that, at this time, the ſpirit of inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, on the eaſt of the mountains, had ſhewn itſelf in the midland parts of Pennſylvania, and in the upper parts of Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and whatever of it did exiſt, was greatly exaggerated by intelligence. Every one that came to our country, gave the moſt flattering accounts of the congeniality of temper elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, with the people here. They brought meſſages in real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, or pretended to bring meſſages, deſiring the country to ſtand out. This had a moſt unfavourable effect, in prejudicing the public mind againſt a ſubmiſſion.</p>

                                    <p>BROTHERS, we welcome you to the old council fire at this place.—It is a lucky ſpot of ground for holding Indian treaties. No good has attended your treaties at Beaver creek, Muſhingum, &amp;c. As the proffer of this treaty has originated with your great council at Philadelphia, we therefore expect you have good terms to offer. But you know, brothers, that it ever has been a cuſtom, to pay Indians well for coming to treaties; and you may be aſſured, that unleſs we are well paid, or <hi>fully ſatisfied,</hi> your <hi>attempts, of any kind,</hi> will have not the leaſt effect.—However, we doubt not but the pay is provided; and that you have a ſufficiency of blankets and breech-clouts, powder and lead; and that the waggons are cloſe at hand. You know, brothers, that our neighbours the Britiſh, over the lakes, pay their Indians well; that they have inexhauſtible ſtores of blankets and ammunition, and that if they were offering us a treaty, they would not heſitate a moment to ſatisfy all our demands.</p>

Surely the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will apply with equal force, in both caſes. We ſay that our whiſkey ſhall not be ſaddled with an unequal tax—You ſay it ſhall: and to enforce the collection of three or four thouſand dollars per annum, of nett proceeds, you will ſend an army of 12,950 men, or double that number, if neceſſary.

We, the Six United Nations of White Indians, are principally his legitimate offspring; and thoſe who are not, have all imbibed his principles and paſſions—that is, a love of whiſkey; and will, therefore, fight for our bottle till the laſt gaſp. Brothers, you muſt not think to frighten us with fine arranged liſts of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, compoſed of your water-melon armies from the Jerſey ſhore; they would cut a much better figure, in warring with the crabs and oyſters, about the capes of Delaware. It is a common thing for Indians, to fight your beſt armies at the proportion of one to five; therefore, we would not heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate a moment to attack this army at the rate of one to ten. Our nations can, upon an emergency, produce twenty thouſand warriors; you may then calculate what your army ought to be.

They are at preſent Miſſiſſippi mad, and we are whiſkey mad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is, therefore, hard to tell what may be the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of ſuch united madneſs. It appears as if the Kentuckians were diſpoſed to bow the knee to the Spaniſh monarch, or kiſs the pope's a—e, and wear a crucifix, rather than be longer deprived of their darling Miſſiſſippi: and we might be deſperate enough, rather than ſubmit to an odious exciſe, or unequal taxes, to invite Prince William Henry, or ſome other royal pup, to take us by the hand, provided he would guarantee equal taxation, and exempt our whiſkey. This would be a pleaſing overture to the royal family of England; they would eagerly embrace the favourable moment, to add again to their curtailed dominions in America, to accommodate ſome of their numerous brood with kingdoms and principalities. We would ſoon find that great warrior of the lakes, Simcoe, flying to our relief, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying thoſe numerous legions of white and yellow ſavages, for a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent purpoſe to what they have now in view. If the Kentuckians ſhould alſo take it into their heads, to withhold ſupplies from your good old war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Wayne, who is very often near ſtarving in the wilderneſs, his army muſt be immediately annihilated, and your great council might for ever bid adieu to their territory weſt of the mountains.

                           <p>POOR TOM takes this opportunity to inform his friends, throughout the country, that he is obliged to take up his commiſſion, once more, though diſagreeable to his inclination. I thought, when I laid down my commiſſion before, that we had got the country ſo well united, that there would have been no more need for me, in that line; but my friends ſee more need for me than ever. They choſe a ſet of men whom they thought they could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in, but find themſelves much miſtaken; for the majority of them have proved traitors. Four or five big men from below, has ſcared a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but few are killed yet. But I hope none of thoſe are any that ever pretended to be a friend to poor Tom; ſo I would have all my friends keep up their ſpirits, and ſtand to their integrity, their rights, and liberty, and you will find poor Tom be your friend.—This is a fair warning; traitors take care, for my hammer is up, and my ladle is hot. I cannot travel the country for nothing.</p>

               <p>John Gaſton, the perſon who brought Tom the Tinker's letter to the printer, was a client of mine, in an ejectment brought for him againſt a certain M'Clure. He called upon me at my office, and, with a freedom which he thought he could take with his lawyer, who would not ſuſpect him of perſonal ill will, he inveighed againſt me much, for having conſented to the propoſitions of the commiſſioners. What? ſaid he, five men ſcare 75.—The court being at hand, he was led to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, when his cauſe would come on? Not at all, ſaid I. How ſo? ſaid he. Why, ſaid I, the government is gone to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; the courts are overthrown; all law is at an end; there can be no juſtice now. The ſtrong hand muſt manage all things. Is this M'Clure a ſtout fellow? has he any ſons? Cannot you and your ſons beat him? take the cudgel and drive him off. Ah, ſaid he, that will not do. It may be, ſaid I, there is no help for it; that is all that can be done now; at leaſt until ſome other government, and other courts of law, are ſet up, in the place of thoſe that are overthrown <note n="†" place="bottom">If this language to John Gaſton had tranſpired, and he had come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſtated it, the quo animo with which I ſpoke being out of view, it would have been ſtrong evidence of my inſurgency.</note>. He did not appear ſenſible of the ſcope of my obſervations, but thought it a play of fancy, on my part, and laughed; and, after inveighing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028332_0127_0FD899158FCC8A58"/>
while againſt the committee of conference, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the queſtion, "When will my cauſe with M'Clure come to trial?" I mention this incident, to ſhew the indiſtinct conception, on the part of the people, of the connection between the ſtate government and the federal. Though laws of the ſtate are not the laws of the union, yet the laws of the union are laws of the ſtate. I ſcarcely ever met with a man, that I could get to comprehend this.</p>
               <p>On the firſt of September, Alexander Addiſon, the preſident of the court, delivered an excellent charge to the grand jury of Allegheny county. It was publiſhed in the Pittſburgh Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette, of the 6th of September; and has been ſince republiſhed in moſt of the gazettes of the United States. However excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, yet the grand jury could not be brought to approve of it. It appeared in the paper, with the following note.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The above ſentiments of peace and obedience to the laws, would have received the ſanction of the grand jury, but a few members declined their aſſent; ſilence was thought bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than an approbation not unanimous.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This was the beſt apology that could be made, and putting the beſt face on it. The grand jury, though ſummoned by a ſheriff well diſpoſed, and themſelves chiefly well diſpoſed, yet were under ſuch apprehenſions from the country, as not to think it ſafe to manifeſt an approbation of the ſentiments contained in the charge.</p>
               <p>The language of individuals, from the country, had all along from the commencement of the diſturbances, been highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious, and we where conſtantly threatened with Tom the Tinker. The ſyſtem of tolerance and conciliation had been that, which we had hitherto purſued; we had thought it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to uſe the utmoſt policy, from the firſt, to maſk our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and to ſave ourſelves from the odium that exiſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the town. To give an inſtance which I have omitted in my narrative, I think it was after the affair of Braddock's fields: A man came to me from the country, and mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the circumſtance of one of the men, who had been wounded at the attack of Neville's houſe the firſt day, being at the houſe of a doctor in the neighbourhood, who was to take care of him, on principles of humanity, for that the man himſelf had nothing in the world; that the congregation of the rev. Mr. Clerk had propoſed to raiſe a collection for him, to help to ſubſiſt him, and to pay the doctor. That it would have a good effect in the country, and allay the fury againſt the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028332_0128_0FD899159332FA60"/>
town, if we were to raiſe ſomething for the wounded man. I thought ſo; and ſpoke to a perſon to go about to collect, and gave half a dollar myſelf. I did it on the double prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of humanity, and the policy ſuggeſted. I always won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that this circumſtance was not brought forward againſt me, as a proof that I was an inſurgent. I never heard it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>The union of the people being now broken by the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the commiſſioners, and a ſtandard erected, round which thoſe, oppoſed to the inſurrection, could rally. It was ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as adviſeable for the town of Pittſburgh, to aſſociate and form a ſyſtem of defence; to protect againſt the inſults of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, or an attack by the inſurgents, ſhould any part of the country be finally diſpoſed to go to war againſt the government. General Wilkins thought it might be now ſafe to take a ſtep of this nature. I doubted it, not with regard to the expediency of an aſſociation to protect againſt the inſults of individuals, but with regard to the holding out the idea of protecting againſt the country, ſhould any part of it embody in arms againſt the government; I had doubts of the prudence of ſuch a meaſure. It might put it into the minds of the country to come and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the town, when otherwiſe they would not perhaps have thought of it. It might be beſt to continue, for ſome time, our ſyſtem of conciliation, and affect to repoſe a confidence in the good diſpoſition of the people towards us. I was not ſure, if the country ſhould go to war, what proportion of the town would go with it. It might be well enough to wait the reſult of the taking the ſenſe of the people, on the 11th of the month, as propoſed by the commiſſioners, before we entered on a ſtep of this nature. However, General Wilkins had loſt patience, and ſaid, he would loſe his life, rather than to be bullied any longer. I yielded, contrary to my judgment, and propoſed the calling a town-meeting and explaining the reaſons for the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and taking their ſenſe upon it.</p>
               <p>A town-meeting was called, accordingly, on the 6th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember. It was opened by me, taking a view, in a ſpeech of conſiderable length, of what had taken place ſince the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the inſurrection; the principles of the policy, which it had been neceſſary for the town of Pittſburgh, to adopt; the change which had taken place, in the ſituation of affairs, and the probable ſafety now of avowing real ſentiments; and the poſſible expediency of aſſociating for the purpoſe of defence, in
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028332_0129_0FD89916B440A1F8"/>
caſe of inſult from individuals of the country, or an attack from a body in arms, ſhould a war be contemplated.</p>
               <p>I ſaw inſtantly, that this idea produced a revulſion in the minds of the people. It ſtruck ſome, as unſafe to ſet the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try at defiance; and probably others, as ineligible, becauſe they meant at all events to ſtand with it.</p>
               <p>General Wilkins ſupported the expediency and neceſſity of aſſociating; however it did not appear to go down with the meeting. There was a viſible reluctance. On this I ſuggeſted a poſtponement for the purpoſe of conſideration.</p>
               <p>The meeting broke-up. In the evening, General Wilkin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> was ſent, requeſting my company, in order to deliberate on the ſubject of an aſſociation. We met; and as before, I expreſſed my doubts as to the expedience of an aſſociation, bringing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly into view a defence againſt the country, ſhould it embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in arms, to attack the town. If a war ſhould enſue, there was no manner of queſtion, but that the garriſon would be the firſt object; the town could ſupport it very little; and the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon could not ſupport the town at all. The town might be ſafe by lying by and remaining quiet. That for my part, if a war ſhould enſue, it was probable I ſhould quit the country, and not conſider myſelf as bound by any aſſociation to remain and defend the town. However, if it was thought adviſeable to aſſociate at all, it might be under an idea of defending againſt banditti, and ſmall parties, who, for the ſake of plunder, might be diſpoſed to come againſt us.</p>
               <p>This idea met with approbation, and an aſſociation was drawn upon that principle, with all poſſible caution. It was as far as appeared prudent to go at that time <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>WHEREAS by the committees appointed, on the part of the people to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with commiſſioners on the part of the union and the ſtate of Pennſylvania, certain propoſitions have been agreed upon, and recommended to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, viz. an amneſty or oblivion of offences in the violation of the laws, with other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But for example, and more eſpecially as by this teſt, the government would be able to determine the queſtion, whether force was, or was not neceſſary.</p>

               <p>I HAD now ſet out to attend the court of Weſtmoreland, at the ſeat of juſtice at Greenſburgh. The ſtate of the public mind in this county was, as elſewhere, unfavourable to ſubmiſſion. The ſame charge, with additions, was deliver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> by Judge Addiſon, here, as at Pittſburgh, but I recollect no reply or approbation of the grand jury. The election for a member of Congreſs, and for the ſtate legiſlature was approaching, and the people talked fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly of reſiſting, and yet electing. The tide of popularity had not ebbed ſo far againſt me, in that quarter, being remote from Brownſville, where I had declared myſelf. Application were made to me to let my name run for Congreſs, in that diſtrict, as they were diſſatisfied with Findley, on account of his recommending it to them, to ſubmit to the laws. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it as ſtrangely inconſiſtent, that he ſhould have been ſpeaking and writing againſt the law, and ſhould, all at once, turn round, and be in favour of it. Having had a political difference with Findley, which had become perſonal, I might have been diſpoſed, on a leſs delicate occaſion, to improve the prejudice againſt him; and it might have been amuſing to have taken advantage of the adverſe gale to fail by him, in a popular vote, in his own diſtrict. But it muſt have been at the expenſe of the people and myſelf, in an eſſential point of allegiance and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, to have availed myſelf of this error of the people at the time; I had therefore to juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fy Findley, in his recommendation to them, to ſubmit. This had a good effect; for, if ſo ſtrong an adverſary to Findley, as they conceived me to be, and with the offer of a ſeat in Congreſs againſt him, nevertheleſs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the ſame ſentiments, which were rendering him unpopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; theſe ſentiments muſt be right, and for their intereſt.</p>
               <p>During the fitting of the court, great pains were taken to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the people and perſuade them. The ſecond evening, all that were attending, were convened and harangued by Findley, and by gentlemen of the bar of that county. The diſpoſition appeared to have become general, to ſubmit; that is, to make a declaration of committing no outrrge, for the future, upon
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028332_0132_0FD8991B84229BE8"/>
officers of the revenue. But there was a reluctance at the idea of ſigning the words in the form of the commiſſioners.</p>
               <p>In the evening of the third day, I underſtood that a young man, by the name of Parker, who reſided in Weſtmoreland, was about ſetting out from Greenſburgh, to his father's fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, near Parkinſon's ferry, in the county of Waſhington, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to inform them of the general diſpoſition to ſubmit, in his county, and induce them to ſign, and to take advantage of the amneſty; as ſeveral of his brothers had been involved in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of Neville's houſe. It ſtruck me, at the moment, that it would be rendering an eſſential ſervice to humanity, and to the object of compoſing the country, if that ſettlement, from which the inſurrection ſprung, could be brought to ſubmit. I reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that my apprehenſions at Brownſville, might have been, in ſome degree, imaginary; but, if not, by this time the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic mind might have cooled a little, and reaſon have begun to take place; and that this young man, coming from Weſtmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and informing them of a diſpoſition, in that county, to ſubmit, the fear of being left by themſelves would take place, and reduce their violence. I felt a paſſion, at the moment, of riſking my own ſafety, to aſſiſt in accompliſhing this object; and propoſed to the court, to excuſe my attendance, and I would ride into the Parkinſon's ferry ſettlement. The diſtance to Parkinſon's ferry, was about 25 miles. Having ſet out, and croſſed the Youghageny river, in the night, we halted, and went to ſleep, for ſome hours, in the ferry houſe. Setting out, we arrived at the Monongahela, oppoſite Parkinſon's fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, early in the day. Enquiring of the keeper of the ferry, of the name of Devore, with regard to the ſentiments of the country, he referred us to a major Scott, who was ſtanding by, loading his rifle. I was over, ſaid major Scott, the other day, on Mingo creek, when there were about 200 preſent, and they all, to a man, pledged themſelves not to ſign, and to ſhoot any man that will. I am going to the meeting in the forks of the rivers, and I will take care that nobody ſhall ſign there.</p>
               <p>I was ſilent; and croſſed the river. When on the other ſide, I addreſſed the young man, and obſerved, that, from this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of major Scott, I thought it dangerous for myſelf to go further; I would take the road directly down the river, and make my way to Pittſburgh. He ſuggeſted the enquiring at the ferry houſe of Parkinſon, who was a brother to Benjamin, and hearing what intelligence there. We did ſo; and had a contrary information, that the people were diſpoſed to ſubmit.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028332_0133_0FD8992060198398"/>
On this, it was ſuggeſted by the young man, to ride on to the houſe of Benjamin Parkinſon; about a mile a-head. I heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; informing him, that I knew of but two men in the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who had any prediſpoſition to aſſaſſinate me; and that Benjamin Parkinſon was one of them; Andrew M'Farlane the other. He urged me with great earneſtneſs, and pledged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to loſe his life before I ſhould loſe mine. I rode on.</p>
               <p>Coming oppoſite to the houſe, and having leapt over a ſmall pair of bars, into the yard, I was ſtruck with a horſe ſtanding ſaddled, and a rifle, at the door. I took it, that Benjamin Parkinſon was ſetting out for the place of meeting, for the purpoſe of taking the ſenſe of the people that day; and the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his rifle with him, was no good ſymptom of a diſpoſition for ſubmiſſion.</p>
               <p>Alighting, and entering the houſe to an inner apartment, I was all at once appalled, with the ſight of Benjamin Parkinſon and Andrew M'Farlane together; Andrew M'Farlane with a rifle ſtanding by him. I was ſhocked; but concealing my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, I addreſſed Parkinſon with an appearance of perfect confidence. He ſpoke frankly, and with a countenance of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Stepping out with young Parker, he left me with M'Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane, to whom I had bowed, but not yet ſpoken. I was ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting juſt by him, within a ſtep, in the ſmall room. I kept my eye upon his hand, and his rifle, and thought, if I ſaw him move, to ſeize his rifle; I could, perhaps, by a ſudden ſpring, gain the door. I caſt a glance at a window in the room, and thought of ſpringing, head foremoſt, through it, if I ſaw him move. My fear was, that the young man would not have the reſolution to offend the country, by interfering to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me, after what Parkinſon might communicate to him, out of doors. I thought my ſituation precarious, and the chances againſt me. While theſe were my ſenſations, I turned round, with an open and direct countenance, to M'Farlane; Mr. M'Farlane, ſaid I, theſe are diſagreeable times, Indeed they are, Mr. Brackenridge, ſaid he. The expreſſion, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, relieved me from my apprehenſions in a moment; and left me only at a loſs to account for his ſeeming cordiality. For, continued he, I have been, for theſe two days, afraid of my life, becauſe I recommended ſubmiſſion. I have been afraid to ſleep at home, and I am obliged now to go with my rifle. Ah hah, thought I, I ſhall not be ſhot yet.</p>
               <p>Benjamin Parkinſon, in the mean time, came in, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf extremely happy at the information he had received
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028332_0134_0FD89923850B2B10"/>
from young Parker; and much obliged to me, for my intention of coming over to ſerve the ſettlement; that, for his part, he was heartily diſpoſed to ſubmit, and was going to the meeting for the purpoſe. I aſked him, if he had a form of the ſubmiſſion? that, if not, I had a number of them in my pocket. He ſaid, he had one. On enquiry, I found that the diſtrict, where he had to attend, lay up the Monongahela, and out of my way to Pittſburgh. Young Parker and Parkinſon urged me, with great ſolicitation, to ride there, in order to aſſiſt in perſuading the people; but, judging from their apprehenſions, I did not think it adviſeable to run the riſk. I anſwered, that the Parker's family would doubtleſs credit their brother; and that he could give the ſame information that I could, and ſtate my ſolicitude, in riding all night, to ſerve them; that if I went to any meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all, it would be to the Mingo meeting, which was on my way, and to that of Peter's creek diſtrict, which was on my way alſo. The only queſtion now was, Whether it would be adviſeable to go to the Mingo meeting? M'Farlane, with can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and good will towards me, gave his opinion, that it was not adviſeable; that the rage of the people, againſt our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee at Pittſburgh, and me eſpecially, was violent; that, for his part, he was under apprehenſions of going himſelf to the Mingo diſtrict, though amongſt his neighbours; and meant to go to David Hamilton's, about four miles diſtant, in a lateral direction, in order to find out, whether it would be ſafe to go to the meeting. On this, I declined going; but purpoſed writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by him, to Hamilton, an open letter, which might be read at the meeting, or elſewhere, as containing information from me. The letter was as follows:
<floatingText type="letter">

                        <p>I have rode all night, from the court at Weſtmoreland, with a view to come to the meeting of the Mingo creek diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict, but, from what I hear, do not think it ſafe; but I ſtate my ſentiments, by letter, which you may conſider as written to you and to others. It is to inform them, that the greater part of Allegheny county will ſubmit, and all Weſtmoreland will, and I preſume Fayette. You will then be left alone. Surely you would not wiſh to give the exciſe officer the ſatisfaction of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you hanged. For this reaſon, all thoſe that have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in any violence, ought eſpecially to ſave themſelves. It is from motives of humanity that I have taken this trouble.

               <p>I took the road now towards Pittſburgh, but not the direct road, as it would have led me by the Mingo creek meeting-houſe. As I rode, I fell in with numbers, croſſing my courſe, in a direction to the meeting, and all of them armed. Stopping at a cabin, to enquire the way, I was ſtruck with the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of John M'Donald, the ſecretary of the Mingo creek ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, ſtepping out. I was not afraid of him, having had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with him in Pittſburgh, and knowing his ſentiments to be moderate. His advice alſo to me was, not to go to the meeting: his expreſſion was, "Let them go to the devil their own way."</p>
               <p>Enquiring the way to Pittſburgh, he directed me by the houſe of John Holcroft. That is the very man, ſaid I, that I am the moſt afraid of; he is Tom the Tinker. I was obliged to put up with the inſulting language of one of his ſons, the other day, in Pittſburgh; not thinking it ſafe to reſent it, in the preſent ſtate of things. He threatened the town with Tom the Tinker.</p>
               <p>M'Donald gave me directions, in what manner, croſſing a certain road, that led from the houſe of Holcroft, I could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it, by a circuit through the woods, and come into the road again. But before I had got to that point, I met two men on horſeback, one of whom accoſted me by name, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf ſorry, that he had ſet out before I had got to his houſe, that he might have offered me a little whiſkey, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for my horſe to eat; but, ſaid he, I will go back with you to the houſe. I was not without apprehenſions of every man; nevertheleſs, I thought the ſafeſt way was, to affect to have confidence, and I ſuffered him to ride back with me. The man with him accompanied us.</p>
               <p>When we came in ſight of the houſe, I knew the farm to be that on which a certain Samuel Irwin, ſome years ago, had lived; and which I knew had been ſold to Holcroft. Heavens! thought I, is this Tom the Tinker? is he to get his ſons to help to murder me, that he is taking me to his own houſe? pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing civility, but meaning to put it out my power to negociate with commiſſioners any more. However, I concealed my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and entered his houſe. Our converſation turned
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028332_0136_0FD8992526022DC8"/>
upon the buſineſs of the day; the ſigning a ſubmiſſion. Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft gave me to underſtand, that the people were greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in that neighbourhood, and threatened death. That is unreaſonable, ſaid the man that was in company; it is not ſo with us, in our ſettlement. We allow free liberty of conſcience, and moleſt no man for doing what he pleaſes. Every man that chuſes to ſubmit, let him do it; and we give him five weeks, to ſell off his effects, and move out of the country. I was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted with his ideas of perfect freedom; but thought that, in five weeks, probably, the ſituation of the proſcribed and the proſcribing would be changed, without the days of grace, to ſell off effects and move away.</p>
               <p>I could diſcover, in Holcroft, heſitation to know what to do. I explained myſelf fully; informed him of the hiſtory of croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from Weſtmoreland, with what views, &amp;c. He expreſſed himſelf happy in having ſeen me, and wiſhed me to go to the meeting with him, and to which he had been on his way; but acknowledged there would be danger of inſult. I declined go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for this reaſon, and becauſe I was now on my way paſt the ground. I took leave of Tom the Tinker, and came on.</p>
               <p>On my way to Peter's creek, I underſtood that a company of rifle-men had gone forward, in order to oppoſe a ſubmiſſion. Nevertheleſs, I did not heſitate to go on, as it was in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Pittſburgh, viz. about 7 miles diſtant; and I felt myſelf more at home, and knew the people more generally, and had a greater confidence in my influence with them. On my arrival at the meeting, I was informed, that captain Miller, the member of the committee, of whom I have given ſome account, with his company, had oppoſed the ſigning the ſubmiſſion, and threatened death; but that the ſigning was then opened in the houſe, and perſons had begun to go in. I ſaw Miller's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany by themſelves, under ſome trees, at at a diſtance. Crowds of the people came around me, and I gave them an account of my having come from Weſtmoreland, the preceding evening, and of the diſpoſition of that county to ſubmit. Having delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed half an hour, and conceiving all things to be going on well, I ſet out to Pittſburgh. Coming to town, I was happy to learn, that the people had generally ſigned the form of ſubmiſſion. It was too late, and the hours of ſigning expired; but it was not for this reaſon, but becauſe I had no ſolicitude to bring myſelf within the amneſty, not conceiving myſelf to have any need of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I did not go forward, even then, to put my name to the paper. I went forward next day and put my name to it,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028332_0137_0FD899268B357608"/>
that I might ſhew the people, that I would do what I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to them to do; and that it had been my abſence only, that had hindered me from being amongſt the firſt.</p>

               <p>BEFORE the day of ſubmiſſion, great pains had been tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, not only by the civil officers, and men of political appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by the bar in different counties, and prudent men every where; but, in particular, by the clergy, in various congregations. The reverend Samuel Porter, and the rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end John M'Millan, and others of the ſame denomination, had, from the firſt, borne a decided teſtimony againſt the forcible op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the laws. Previous to the day of giving the teſt of ſubmiſſion, M'Millan having appointed a day for giving the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of bread and wine, adjourned the celebration, until it could be known who would ſubmit; meaning to exclude thoſe from the ordinance, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> ſhould remain obſtinate, and refuſe this declaration of fidelity. He attended himſelf, on the day of ſubmiſſion, and uſed his immediate influence, but not to much effect. The table was carried away, on which the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were put, to be ſigned; and ſuch was the diſturbance, that the meeting had finally to break up.</p>
               <p>At Mingo creek, a body of men armed, paraded, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naced death to any one that would breathe a thought of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting. A juſtice of the peace had taken his ſeat, and a few perſons had got their names on his paper, when the armed mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude broke in, and prevented any more. They tore the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in pieces; and it was not until after night, when every thing was thought to be over, that the ſame perſons, and ſome others, getting together with the magiſtrate again, ſigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new; and the juſtice, putting it in the pad of his ſaddle, got off with it, to the place of return, at Waſhington.</p>
               <p>At Waſhington, Bradford had become a convert to ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; putting it on the principle of being deſerted and left to himſelf, and therefore it was in vain any longer to ſtand out. At a large meeting of the people, in the court-houſe, he made a ſpeech of two hours, and recommended ſubmiſſion. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſigned on the day. James Marſhall, John Canon, and a
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028332_0138_0FD89928160F8988"/>
conſiderable number of others, who had appeared in the ſcene, alſo ſigned. Some were obſtinate, and would not.</p>
               <p>In the upper part of Waſhington county, the ſigning was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable. In the upper part of Allegheny county, and the lower part of Weſtmoreland, in what are called the forks of the Monongahela and the Youghagheny rivers, major Scott, whom I ſaw at Devore's ferry, attended with his rifle, and headed the violent, who prevented the ſigning. At the diſtrict where Benjamin Parkinſon went, there was an oppoſition, but ſome ſigned; the Parker family particularly; Parkinſon had not the reſolution. In the lower part of Allegheny county, the member of the committee, who had carried down the papers, was ſurrounded, in his houſe, by a maſked body of men, and had his papers taken from him. In ſome places, and ſome at all places, ſigned for war inſtead of ſubmiſſion.</p>
               <p>In Fayette county, the form preſcribed by the commiſſioners was not ſigned at all; it was under an idea, that the laſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of conference, from Brownſville, had not authority to change the terms agreed upon with the firſt. They were commiſſioned only, to endeavour to procure an enlargement and amelioration. This was true; and they did not change. It was the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners that changed; conſidering themſelves as abſolved from their engagement with the firſt ſtipulations, in conſequence of what amounted to a rejection, by the vote of the committee. And there was no queſtion, but by the negative of the minority they were abſolved; for the condition of amneſty, in the firſt, was, "that the peace being kept, and the law obeyed, by the whole country, to the 10th day of July, then next following." Here was what amounted to a declaration of war, by twenty-three townſhips; and put an end to all contemplation of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral and ſincere acquieſcence in the execution of the laws <note n="*" place="bottom">If there ſhall be a general and ſincere acquieſcence, in the ſaid laws, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the ſaid 10th of July next, a general pardon and oblivion, of all ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, ſhall be granted.</note>.</p>
               <p>This was the idea of the commiſſioners, as expreſſed to the ſecond conference <note n="†" place="bottom">The terms required, have not been acceded to. You have come hither to demand new terms, and it is now neceſſary for us to dicide, whether we will return home, or enter into other arrangements.</note>.</p>
               <p>The matter ſeems to have been underſtood otherwiſe, by a meeting of committees, from the ſeveral townſhips of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of Fayette, held at Union Town, on the 10th of September, 1794. Twenty-one members preſent, at leaſt; they preferred the giving government aſſurances of their ſubmiſſion, agreeably to the terms ſettled with the firſt conferees, and made a declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to that effect <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The terms which had been obtained by the firſt committee of confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, having, however, been changed, in point of form, at the laſt confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in which we were repreſented only by one member, altho' the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee had not received power for that purpoſe, it is neceſſary for us to take them into conſideration. It is alledged by the commiſſioners, on the part of the union, that the ſtanding committee of the weſtern counties, having neglected at Redſtone, to make the declaration and recommendations requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them, in the explicit manner which was ſettled at the firſt conference, the terms are broken on the part of the ſaid committee, and the commiſſioners now required that thoſe declarations, which it was the duty of the ſtanding committee to make, ſhould be made by the people themſelves, and teſtified by the individual ſignatures of the citizens, excepting at the ſame time, from the amneſty, ſuch of the concerned in the late offences, as ſhall refuſe or neglect to ſign the ſame. To that, or to a ſimiliar mode of giving aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſubmiſſion, which was propoſed at the firſt conference, it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that ſuch a mode, if adopted, might be miſunderſtood, and have a tendency to defeat the propoſed object, in as much as perſons not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concerned in the riots, would not chuſe to ſign individually, for fear it might be conſtrued as a tacit acknowledgement that they had actually brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the peace. And we may now add, that as a great inducement for the perſons not concerned to give aſſurances of ſubmiſſion at all, was to procure an amneſty for the offenders, this motive exiſts no longer, ſince the pardon for every individual, concerned, depends upon his own ſignature. In as much, therefore, as the body of the people of this country can derive no benefit from an act of oblivion, for offences, in which they have not had any ſhare; we are of opinion, that, however diſpoſed they hitherto have been, might have in the neighbouring counties, will induce us to uſe every means to render the aſſurances of ſubmiſſion more eaſy, and of courſe more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the citizens. The beſt mode of doing it, is, for ourſelves, who are the committee for Fayette county, to make thoſe declarations, which were required from the ſtanding committee of Redſtone, and having thus ſtrictly adhered, on our pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>For theſe reaſons, and upon theſe principles, wiſhing however to have it fully underſtood, that from the following declaration, no implication is to be drawn of an acknowledgement that we have ever failed, either directly, or indirectly in that duty which every citizen owes to his country, viz. ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to its laws; we, the committee of townſhips, for the county of Fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ette, do not heſitate explicitly to declare our determination to ſubmit to the laws of the United States, and of the ſtate of Pennſylvania, not to oppoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or indirectly the execution of the acts for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The fact is, the committee had no power to make new terms; but the commiſſioners had power to offer, through the organ of the committee, new terms to the body of the people. The inhabitants of Fayette county, met in three diſtricts, out of four; 721 attending, out of whom 560 declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their determination to ſubmit to the laws.</p>
               <p>Numbers, that had been prevented ſigning on the day, or who, on reflection, thought it adviſeable to ſign, came to the officer in poſſeſſion of the paper, and ſigned afterwards. I was conſulted on the ſubject by many, who came from a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſtance to have my opinion on the validity of ſigning after the day. I had no heſitation in declaring a perfect confidence in the executive, that a liberal conſtruction would be given to the terms of the commiſſioners; and that where it ſhould be

proved, to the ſatisfaction of the executive, that the not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting was owing to a force preventing them, and that they had ſigned as ſoon as they could have it in their power, after the removal of the force, it would be conſidered as equivalent to a ſigning on the day. It could not be pleaded in a court of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, as a pardon; but the executive would not be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile it with the ſpirit of the terms, to proceed in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; or, at leaſt, he would not chuſe to proceed againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant offenders, under theſe circumſtances.</p>
               <p>The return of the papers, from the ſeveral diſtricts, were to be made to James Roſs, of the commiſſion, on the 16th, at Union Town; who, from thence, was to ſet out for Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</p>
               <p>Having ſet out, he was purſued a day's journey by two men, under pretence of taking the papers from him; but who, coming up, informed him, they wiſhed to get their names put down; and, as it afterwards appeared, theſe very men had been active, in their own diſtricts at home, to hinder others from ſigning, and had not ſigned themſelves.</p>

               <p>IT began now to be mentioned in Pittſburgh, that it might be ſafe to recal the exiles. A town meeting was called, to conſider of it. The idea was ſuggeſted, chiefly a by gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man related to Kirkpatrick, and who had not been preſent dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fury of the diſturbance, and had not a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the yet unſettled diſpoſition of the people. He was, moreover, ſupported in his propoſition by a gentleman of the bar, who had alſo been abſent from the country, the greateſt part of the period, and came forward, at this juncture, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh himſelf, in doing ſomething. He was an adverſary of mine; we had been upon bad terms for a long time. It is on account of his connections, that I do not introduce his name.</p>
               <p>The firſt of his appearance, after his return, was at Brownſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, the firſt morning of our meeting. The moment I ſaw him, I knew his object would be to do me miſchief; but it would be ſome time, before he could reco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>oitre the ground, and determine upon the ways and means of acting. I knew him to be intriguing, and to have exerciſed the powers of his mind in this way, and in no other way, through his life; but I was at a loſs to know what he could lay hold of. He would have ſenſe enough to diſcover, that the inſurrection was broken, by the propoſitions of the commiſſioners; and that it would not be ſafe, now, to take any part with it; and therefore it would not do to oppoſe the ſubmiſſion, or diſapprove of it. He could not, therefore, join in the clamour, with open mouth: or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

having alſo come on from that place, his firſt addreſs was with the commiſſioners; inſinuating, that I had been concerned in the inſurrection, and privy to the tranſactions of Bradford; that Bradford had given him this information at Brownſville.</p>
               <p>I had traverſed in my imagination, all poſſible ground which he would find to injure me, but I had never thought of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation of that nature. I had thought of nothing, but his inflaming Bradford and the people againſt me, and had attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the diſſatisfaction, which Bradford had diſcovered, to his management, in ſome degree. I had alſo obſerved him in cloſe converſation with a younger brother of M'Farlane, that had fallen, and other violent men; and I apprehended a good deal from that increaſe he would give to their reſentment. It nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had entered my mind that he would venture upon a calumny of this kind. I had avered in my public ſpeech, my not only having nothing to do with any of the acts of violence, but my total diſapprobation of them. I was not contradicted by Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; though he replied to me in warm invectives, yet he had not the audacity to inſinuate any thing to this effect.</p>
               <p>I was unwilling that any unfavourable impreſſion ſhould be made upon the minds of the commiſſioners, and I took the firſt opportunity of giving them a key to all that could be ſaid by my brother of the bar; by informing them that a difference exiſted between us, and referring to James Roſs, for a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the fact. The commiſſioners aſſured me, that any thing he had ſaid, had made no impreſſion, and ſhould make none; that even taking it for granted that Bradford had ſaid ſo, he had given ſufficient proof of his want of truth and honour, in violating his private promiſe, and public ſtipulation, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the propoſitions, to put the credibility of any aſſertion of his, altogether out of view. This was the language of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner Yates to me, in the preſence of James Roſs.</p>
               <p>My brother of the bar had, in the mean time, made all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible experiments upon the minds of the people of Pittſburgh, to induce them to believe that I had been privy to the tranſactions of Bradford; that, at the Mingo creek meeting, I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the intercepting the mail, in order to get the letters that were found, and have the writers baniſhed; that, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing private malice againſt theſe perſons, I had planned the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to injure them.

trace the origin of the fact, as I have explained, in the courſe of my narrative. It has been ſeen that it was contrived before the Mingo creek meeting, and before I ſaw Bradford, to have any communication with him.</p>
               <p>It was to have the credit of ſeeming to have done ſomething for the exiles, that my brother of the bar had ſupported the recalling them at this time.</p>
               <p>I had notice of the town-meeting, and attended. My brother of the bar opened the meeting, with an harangue of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble length. The ſcope of it was an invective againſt thoſe who led the people into the inſurrection, and had now deſerted them. This was the only ſentiment he had to expreſs, but if he wanted variety of thought, he made it up by variety of action. But as there was no one, who deſerted the people, his invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive was without an object. He put me in mind of a man, whom I knew in early life, who had been taught the uſe of a ſmall ſword, and when he had taken a cup, as he was accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to do, and was coming home, in a moon light night, and ſeeing a buſh with a ſhadow, he would imagine it to be the devil with a tail, and would begin to fence with his ſtaff, "there I have you, Satan; there I have you, devil." So it was with my brother of the bar, here he was with violent geſtures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming againſt ſome devil, and no one, but himſelf, ſaw any.</p>
               <p>The idea, however, of deſerting the people, was a ſtring to harp upon. I never knew the people themſelves complain of this. They knew that no one had deſerted them; but ſome of them were obſtinate, in not coming off the ground, when a parley had been beaten, a negociation taken place, and the conditions of peace were announced, by the perſons whom they had appointed to negociate. Men of ſenſe accepted the ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and drew off, and told all to do ſo. Some, like fools, would ſtay and fight. Was this deſerting them?</p>
               <p>After this harangue, to which there was no reply, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, related by affinity to Kirkpatrick, brought forward a a propoſition for the recal of the exiles. I was alarmed, and thought it not prudent. The preſent interval of quietneſs in the country, might be an inſiduous calm. The firſt movement that would take place, if any did place, would be on hearing of the advance of a force, on the part of the government. It would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

certainly they would entertain no idea of returning in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſituation of affairs.</p>
               <p>However, it was urged, and I acquieſced; but it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my judgment, and not agreeable to the general ſenſe of the town. There were ſome for it; and it was improper to divide upon it. The reſolution was modelled by my brother of the bar, and publiſhed in the gazette <note n="*" place="bottom">At a meeting of the inhabitants of the town of Pittſburgh, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of conſidering the proſcriptions of certain citizens, during th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE return made to government, of the ſignatures for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, bore ſo ſmall a proportion to the number of the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants, that it had been conſidered, on the part of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as unavoidably neceſſary to ſend a force to reduce them.

                  </note>, from the public papers of Philadelphia, appeared, announcing that a force was collecting. Intelligence by individuals, was to the ſame effect. Many ſtill affected to diſbelieve it, becauſe they had heretofore ſaid, that a force would not come; and ſome did really diſbelieve it. Nevertheleſs, the belief in it was gaining ground every day; and bringing to ſome ſenſe of danger, thoſe who had hitherto ſtood out.</p>
               <p>Though I had heſitated to go the court of Waſhington, which was to begin the 22d of September, yet now, under theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, I thought it ſafe to go.</p>
               <p>At the court, I was informed of what I have ſtated, viz. that
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028332_0146_0FD899391FD60640"/>
Bradford, on the day of ſubmiſſion, had recommended to the people to ſubmit. The popular language, with reſpect to him, was, that "DAGON was fallen."</p>
               <p>I do not know that he had any idea, at this time, that he was not within the amneſty. I preſume not: for he had been ſolicitous to gain the concurrence of the people to ſign, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he might venture to do it himſelf. He was out of the amneſty, no doubt *, by his ſpeech at Brownſville, on the 28th; but the man had not preciſion of thought ſufficient to diſcover it.</p>
               <p>My brother of the bar was paying great court to him; their heads were conſtantly together, at the table, whiſpering; and out of doors, they were arm in arm, walking; or hats off, at a diſtance, to each other. I knew by brother of the bar had deſpiſed Bradford, and Bradford had diſliked him; but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient enmity of the one towards me, and the recent diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the other, had cemented them in great apparent cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diality. I was determined to wait quietly, to ſee what this hatching would produce. I did not know what Bradford might be brought to ſay; I knew my brother of the bar to have will, and not to want ingenuity. From the incidents I have traced, in the courſe of this narrative, it will be ſeen, that Bradford was not incapable of a deflection from the truth. I did not know how far the preſervation of himſelf, in the hope of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the clemency of the government, might lead him to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify thoſe who might have the ear of it. But I truſted to this, that it is ſo difficult to make falſhood conſiſtent, that he would not be able to put it together, in ſuch a manner as to render it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</p>
               <p>The Democratic Society, of Waſhington, was convened, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the court. It had been propoſed to publiſh reſolutions, expreſſing the ſentiments of the ſociety, with regard to the late violations of the laws, after the example of the Democratic Society at New-York, and Philadelphia. A committee was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to draw up the reſolutions.</p>
               <p>A young gentleman of the bar, Dorſey Pentecoſt, was one: and having drawn a ſketch, he ſhewed it to me, and wiſhed me, as having more politically conſidered theſe matters, to aſſiſt him in forming it, to be laid before the committee. I aſſiſted him: and expreſſed myſelf, with regard to the outrages, in very
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028332_0147_0FD8993C42A39150"/>
read in the ſociety. Bradford, who was a member, heard them with embarraſſment, and moved for a poſtponement, for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of them, at that time. He ſaid, a fuller meeting was expected the week following. The conſideration was poſtponed, and I never heard any more of them.</p>
               <p>At the opening of this court, judge Addiſon delivered his charge to the grand jury, and received from them an explicit approbation of the ſentiments contained in it. The people ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have become ſenſible of their error, or at leaſt of their danger. I believe that great numbers had become better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; but I muſt admit, that the converſion, with the bulk, was the reſult of fear.</p>
               <p>Judge Addiſon had held a court, in the mean time, in Fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ette, and brought a favourable account of the impreſſions of the people of that county. On the 17th of the month, a commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of townſhips had met at Union Town, at which reſolutions had been taken into view, and adopted, expreſſive of a good diſpoſition to preſerve order, and ſupport the laws <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>During the ſeſſion of the court, the like favourable account had been received from almoſt all quarters. With the ſuitors of the court, and all perſons attending, there appeared the moſt perfect good diſpoſition to ſubmit to the laws. In the countenances of the unfortunate perſons, who had been involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

                     <p>Whereas the inhabitants of this county, by a large majority, determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſubmit to the laws of the United States, and of the ſtate of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania; and, whereas the general committee, of the weſtern counties, held at Parkinſon's ferry, entered into reſolutions, for the purpoſe of protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſons and property of every individual; and, whereas it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſhow to our fellow citizens, throughout the United States, that the character of the inhabitants of the weſtern country, is not ſuch as may have been repreſented to them; but that, on the contrary, they are diſpoſed to behave in a peaceful manner, and can preſerve good order amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without the aſſiſtance of a military force,</p>

and had not taken the benefit of the amneſty, you could ſee terror and diſmay. They ſaw before them, the neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhing the country inſtantly, or being hanged. I ſaw Benjamin Parkinſon, but he hung down his head as I paſſed. He was conſcious to himſelf, that he had acted like a coward, and that I knew it. A man in a pillory, could not have been more aſhamed to lift up his face. He was one of fifty-two, who met ſome days previous to the ſigning, and ſolemnly pledged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to come forward, at a larger meeting, and ſupport the idea of ſubmitting.</p>
               <p>At a larger meeting, of 200, which took place the day after, finding the current ſet in a contrary direction, he lifted both hands, and declared that he never had conſented to ſign. I have related his earneſtneſs to be put upon the liſt of thoſe entitled to the amneſty, at the time I ſaw him at his houſe; he had not courage to ſign, that day, at his diſtrict. His lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was, "I adviſe you to ſign, but I will not." The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day, he employed a perſon to put his name to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and afterwards denied that he had employed him.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of the week, the court having riſen, I was requeſted to attend a meeting in the court-houſe. I attended. A number of gentlemen of the county had convened; preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Addiſon, the aſſiſtant judges, and others. The ſtate of the country was taken into conſideration, and it was propoſed to paſs reſolutions ſimiliar to thoſe of Fayette.</p>
               <p>Though not of the county, yet having been aſked to the meeting, I took the liberty of obſerving, that, if it was the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to give the government ſuch aſſurances of the reſtoration of order, as would juſtify the diſmiſſion of the force which had been ordered, the proper means would be, to call the original Parkinſon's ferry delegates to meet at the ſame place, and from thence ſend forward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I knew it would not be a wiſh with the government, to be under the neceſſity of coming forward, and I thought it for the honour of the country, that a neceſſity ſhould not exiſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:028332_0149_0FD8993F53F3F4B8"/>A conſiderable number of delegates met at Parkinſon's ferry, on the 2d of October.

General Wilkins made the like obſervations.</p>
               <p>Judge Addiſon, who was ſecretary, obſerved, that as dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates were appointed to explain circumſtances to the Preſident, it could be left to his diſcretion to judge, and relieve us from that perſonal reſponſibility, which would otherwiſe exiſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, unleſs we could ſpeak with ſome poſitiveneſs, it would not be worth while to ſend forward to the Preſident at all; as he could have nothing certain, on which he could depend; that for his part, he would not heſitate to ſpeak with confidence of the three counties, in which he had laſt been; Weſtmoreland, Fayette, and Waſhington.</p>

                  </gap> obſtinacy, which had brought us to this trouble. Bradford appeared thoughtful, but behaved with his uſual folly. He nominated John Cannon to the chair; who took it. It ſtruck judge Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and others of us, as improper; col. Cannon having been chairman of a former obnoxious committee, at Pittſburgh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and alſo deeply involved in the late outrages; and it would be no good ſymptom to the Preſident that we had made him chairman on this occaſion. This was hinted to col. Cannon himſelf, and preſſed with all poſſible delicacy; but Bradford inſiſted on his keeping the chair, and Cannon himſelf was tenacious of it. However, in making out our report, we kept his name out of view, and made no mention of a chairman at all.</p>
               <p>I had no converſation with Bradford, during the court at Waſhington, or at this meeting, but in public. I knew the predicament in which he ſtood, and avoided him. I thought it of little conſequence to him, whether the army came to the country, or not, for he would have to leave it, or be arreſted for trial at Philadelphia. It occurred to me, at the time, that the ſtrongeſt proof the Preſident could have of the reſtoration of the authority of the law, and a proper one, would be for judge Addiſon to arreſt him, and ſend him down. It did not ſuit me to ſuggeſt this. At the ſame time that I wiſhed to ſerve the country, I did not like to hurt myſelf; it would have been an unpopular act; and on principles of humanity, I could not reconcile it to my feelings, to be the means of arreſting any one; nothing but an abſolute official duty could induce me. At the ſame time, it is to be obſerved in his caſe, and that of others, that it would be improper to have undertaken to ſay who were not within the amneſty, or had forfeited it; of this the executive would judge, in the firſt inſtance, and it would
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028332_0151_0FD89944D8A737E0"/>
be proper to wait until orders of arreſt come from the judicial authority of the union.</p>
               <p>I had not ſaid a word to Bradford, in the mean time, with regard to the information he was ſaid to have given to my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the bar; it was for this reaſon: My name was ſtill in view as a candidate for the Congreſs; and Bradford had influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and I did not wiſh to break with him, but as little as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, until that was over. My brother of the bar had ſaid that judge Addiſon was preſent, when Bradford had given the information; or that Bradford had given the like information to judge Addiſon. I aſked judge Addiſon, and he ſaid it was not the caſe. He had heard Bradford ſay nothing more, than to complain of me, that I had not ſpoken more plainly to him, at an earlier period. I made enquiry of Mr. Reddick, with whom Bradford was intimate, whether he had ever ſuggeſted any thing of the kind, that I had been privy to his tranſactions. Mr Reddick ſaid not, but the contrary. He complained that I had not given him my confidence, at an early period. The truth is, I gave it as much as I thought ſafe. The firſt time I ſaw him, was at Mingo creek; he might have ſeen in my ſpeech, what my real ſentiments were. Others ſaw clearly. John Baldwin, one of thoſe involved in the burning of Neville's houſe, has acknowledged to me, that it was that ſpeech that firſt opened his eyes; and he had always thought Bradford a man of ſenſe till that time. It would not have been ſafe for me to ſpeak plainly on Braddock's field, or at Parkinſon's ferry. I did ſpeak, as ſoon as it was prudent to do it; that is, in the committee of conference at Pittſburgh. High enough indeed! Give my confidence to a man who had gone on to the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of high crimes, and had a mob at his command? But did I not ſpeak plainly at Brownſville? ſurely he had my confidence there, for all the meeting had it; and yet he anſwered me with all the pomp that his id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a of ſuperiority over me, in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the public confidence could inſpire, and if he inſulted me after our negociation with the commiſſioners, what would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the appointment of delegates, at the meeting at Parkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's, to wait upon the Preſident, a circumſtance took place, which gave me the impreſſion that Marſhall as well as Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, was not favourably diſpoſed towards me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:028332_0152_0FD89948342E8D10"/>John Lucas, a member of the committee, mentioned to me a converſation with Marſhall, before the opening of the meeting "Whom do you think," ſaid he, "ſhall we ſend as delegates to the Preſident? I have been thinking of Findley, Gallatin, and Brackenridge, but Bradford has conceived a prejudice againſt our friend Brackenridge."</p>
               <p>When the point of chuſing delegates came forward in the meeting, it was urged by judge Addiſon and gen. Wilkins, and others, that four perſons, one from each county, ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and I knew it was their wiſh that I ſhould be one. Bradford ſtrenuouſly oppoſed it, though he could aſſign no plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible reaſons. I ſaw inſtantly it was to prevent the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of me. Marſhall ſupported him; I had ſuppoſed to grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ify him. I ſupported him ſtrenuouſly, though Addiſon and Wilkins were diſſatisfied. I had preciſely the ſame object in view with him; to keep myſelf out. The election was coming on, and I choſe to be at home.</p>
               <p>It was carried that no regard ſhould be paid to counties. It was then moved by Bradford, that two delegates ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed from the weſtern country, and that theſe two ſhould be Findley and Reddick. Marſhall ſupported the appointment of two, but propoſed Findley and Gallatin. I ſaw at this moment, that Marſhall alſo was diſſatisfied with "friend Brackenridge", and that though he differed with Bradford, as to perſons, yet they both wiſhed to exclude me. In this object I concurred with them, but meaning that Bradford ſhould be gratified in all things, I ſupported his nomination of Reddick, and we carried it.</p>
               <p>I have never underſtood what was the ground of Marſhall's diſſatisfaction, if he had any. Bradford had ſaid, that I repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him in an unfavourable point of view to the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners at Pittſburgh, during our conference. That was not the fact; I made the beſt apology for the conduct of both; ſo that on one occaſion the Attorney General obſerved to James Roſs, Is it poſſible that Bradford and Marſhall can be innocent too? I had ſtated no more than what I have done in this narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that it was the people who had carried off both Marſhall and Bradford, and not they the people. And it was with a view to hiſtorical truth that I have ſtated this curcumſtance.</p>
               <p>So far with regard to Bradford for the preſent.</p>
               <p>On my return to Pittſburgh, I encloſed a copy of the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the meeting to Preſident Waſhington, and one to the governor of Pennſylvania.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <p>THE general election, which was to take place on the 14th of October, was now approaching. My brother of the bar had offered himſelf as a candidate before my name was brought forward, and had availed himſelf of the temporary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in canvaſſing againſt me. With thoſe oppoſed to the outrages that had taken place, he inſinuated, that I had been at the bottom of them; and with the inſurgents themſelves, he aſſerted that I had been a ſpy for the government, from the firſt; that I had taken notes, and would be the worſt witneſs that would come forward againſt them. He retailed ſcraps of ſpeeches, which I was ſaid to have made; viz. that the people of the country were a ſet of "vipers and fools," and deſerved to be hanged for what they had done. At leaſt I have been led to underſtand that this was the nature of his addreſs. It was all fair; we were adverſaries.</p>
               <p>Before the court at Waſhington, I had received a note from Daniel Hamilton, who had commanded the advanced guard, on the day of Braddock's fields, and as we rode along had compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented me, at the time, by ſaying, that my behaviour on the occaſion would carry me to Congreſs. He now wiſhed to know whether I continued my name as a candidate for the Congreſs, as the prejudice was ſtrong againſt me, ſince the meeting at Brownſville, and he was quite tired ſupporting me againſt B. Parkinſon, and others. I wrote him a note in anſwer, that I was thinking nothing about it; there were objects of greater moment on my mind. The fact was, I was at that time, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrangements to leave the country, if a war ſhould enſue. Hamilton had written with a view to induce me, to relinquiſh the idea of Congreſs, for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at that time, he had declared himſelf a candidate. In receiving my note, he conſtrued it into a decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation on my part, and rode through the country reading it, with that conſtruction. At the ſame time, he read a letter he pretended to have received from Tom the Tinker, adviſing him, to declare himſelf. So that, I had my brother of the bar on the one hand, and Daniel Hamilton on the other, to contend with. Of the two, my brother of the bar was certainly the beſt
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028332_0154_0FD8994C271E6398"/>
qualified, poſſeſſing ſome legal knowledge; and in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar having the advantage of Hamilton. But, as it was natural, I was willing the people ſhould think me better qualified than either. And I had turned my attention to the object, ſince the proſpect of a reſtoration of order had taken place.</p>
               <p>Thomas Scott of Waſhington, formerly of the Congreſs, was alſo a candidate, but with him and myſelf there was a good underſtanding, viz. that I gave him a preference to Hamilton, or to my brother of the bar. It was with heſitation that I had, at firſt, thought of being a candidate. It was inconvenient, on the one hand, to go; but on the other hand, it was pleaſant to be amongſt political and literary men for a while. At preſent, it was merely on a principle of pride, as my name had been uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that I would not withdraw it.</p>
               <p>A few days before the election, hearing that it was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly credited in Waſhington, that I had declined the election, I put a paragraph in the gazette contradicting the report <note n="*" place="bottom">

It is now circulated that I have declined it; No. Conſidering the delicacy of the times, I might wiſh I had not thought of it, but as it is, it would imply a fear of ſubmitting my conduct to inveſtigation, to withdraw my name from the public; I have therefore not done it. I may, at preſent, have leſs popularity than I had, but the time will come, when I ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as having deſerved well of the country, in all the delicate conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in which we have been ſituated.</p>

                     <p>I received yours of the firſt of this current month, in which
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028332_0156_0FD89951F7A59EE8"/>
you have ſaid, that Mr. Brackenridge aſſerted, in the preſence of the commiſſioners of the United States, that, had it not been for his interpoſition on your behalf at Braddock's fields, that you would have been baniſhed.</p>
                     <p>I muſt inform you, that Mr. Brackenridge has either a very treacherous memory, or a ſtrong diſpoſition to aſſert falſehoods, if he aſſerted as you ſtate: The truth of the caſe was, that he evidenced to me the ſtrongeſt deſire to have you baniſhed. I ſhall ſtate to you his expreſſions, or at leaſt ſome of them. You may then judge for yourſelf.</p>
                     <p>The firſt day day at Braddock's fields, Mr. Brackenridge cold me, the people of Pittſburgh were well pleaſed that the country were about to baniſh the perſons, whoſe names had been mentioned; he added, that they ought to go further, that little<note n="*" place="bottom">He is certainly but a "little" man. However, the epithet is too feeble for my expreſſion; it is a counterfeit; it wants an indicium of the genuine bank-bill. I would have uſed a figure, and have ſaid muſk-rat Craig, if I had ſaid any thing at all.</note> Craig ought to be baniſhed, for he was one of the ſame damned junto <note n="†" place="bottom">I have uſed this phraſe on ſome occaſions, and I might have uſed it on that; and if you will place a general with the office of an inſpector of the revenue for an extenſive ſurvey; a colonel, his ſon, with the office of county ſurveyor, brigade inſpector of the militia, with an independent ſalary annexed to it, and a member of the legiſlature at the ſame time; a major, his ſon-in-law, with the offices of quarter maſter, deputy commiſſary, and notary public; a brother-in-law, now a commiſſary general, a lender of money on intereſt, with a ſalary of 1500 or 2000 dollars, and all theſe weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, independent of their offices. If you will place theſe, I ſay, in a ſmall village of 150 houſes, with all the influence that employment of mechanics, and their cuſtom to ſhopkeepers, and their entertainments can give, they muſt conduct themſelves, with more delicacy, than is uſual with men, if they do not form at leaſt a damnable, if not, "a damned Junto."</note>. I replied, there appeared to be no ground to proceed againſt you, that there was no letter of yours inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, miſtating facts, or the conduct of individuals, to gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. Further converſation took place, which had mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly for its object, to irritate me againſt you<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                           <p>I knew Craig to be at that time in the garriſon; I had underſtood he had removed his family there; of what uſe would a ſentence of baniſhment be, unleſs it had been propoſed to ſtorm the garriſon. It is not impoſſible, but I might have been turning the ſcent upon a falſe chaſe, by holding up Craig and Butler to his noſe, who were ſafe; the one quarter maſter and engineer, the other the commandant of the garriſon; and this in order to divert his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from thoſe, for whom I was more immediately apprehenſive. The quo animo is the thing; not what was ſaid. And that I had nothing more in view, in all my management, than to parry the doing any thing, is evident from what afterwards took place in the committee.</p>
                           <p>It was agreeable to my ſyſtem of managing him, to affect to outſtrip him in his paſſions, and to be the more violent of the two, that if afterwards I relaxed, he well might. This is a key to his ſtatement. It will be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient refutation of any idea on my part, to baniſh any one, that I knew it would do them no harm, but exalt them; and I expreſſed myſelf to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, at the time. I am ſolicitous to ſave myſelf of the imputation of plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or concurring in the baniſhment of theſe people, as much from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to be thought a fool, as to be thought wicked.

Why not move it myſelf? it is well known that the place of ſeconding is more favourable to a warm ſupport of a meaſure, than that of moving it in the firſt inſtance. Beſides, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for me to preſerve myſelf, at that time, from all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble odium, in order to accompliſh objects with the people, of a more ſerious nature, and it would be leſs odious to ſecond, than to move the reſolution. There was no perſon more inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the expulſion of the prothonotary than I was, or more intereſted in his return; and it is falſe in Bradford to ſay that I wiſhed him to oppoſe it. I ſtated difficulties in order to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt him with me to overcome them. It was flattering his vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do this, and the way to perſuade him.</p>
               <p>My brother of the bar, who had, at leaſt, the ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this compoſition of Bradford, was overſeen in letting him put in this paragraph, for it ſhakes the credit of all the reſt. I might be ſuppoſed willing to have the Neville's junto mortified, in getting the people at leaſt to talk of baniſhing them; but it is abſurd to ſuppoſe that a practiſing lawyer would wiſh to derange his own buſineſs, by diſturbing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonotary.</p>
               <p>The paragraph reſpecting Briſon, has alſo this bad effect. It is travelling out of the interogatory of Craig, introducing what relates to an indifferent perſon. It is a negative, pregnant with regard to the allegation that I have been privy to the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of Bradford, in general; that I had adviſed or prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe; for on the ſame ground, at this time, he would have brought every inſtance out. I acknowledge that it operates al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, to give credit with regard to what he has ſtated; for if he choſe to invent at all, why not invent more. This has weight with me, and induces me to reſolve his own ſtatement of facts, where he has miſtated any, into miſconception, and a want of recollection, more than deliberate intention. But there are parts, that appear to me intentionally falſe.</p>
               <p>There is one advantage certainly derived from Craig's publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: It is relinquiſhing his province, the ſword; and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of the preſs. I do not conſider myſelf, now, bound to fight him; he has waved the duel, which with a man of ſuch courage, as I know him to poſſeſs, is a great matter to me. God be praiſed; I have eſcaped a challenge, or any future obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to accept one, from an engineer accuſtomed to the ſound even of big guns, and one of the braveſt men on earth.</p>

               <p>THE general election for a member of Congreſs, for the diſtrict of Waſhington and Allegheny, was held on the 14th of October; it might naturally be ſuppoſed that, notwithſtanding the hurricane of the inſurrection had ſubſided, it muſt have been in a great meaſure, from the impulſe of fear, and that the ſame principle which produced it, muſt ſtill have exiſtence in the minds of the people, and that for this reaſon the ſpirit of inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency muſt govern the election. If ſo, the moſt violent inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, or one the moſt favouring them would be choſen. So it was, nevertheleſs, that Daniel Hamilton, who had a command at the burning of Neville's houſe, and at the election, ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Bradford, was the loweſt on the poll; and Albert Galla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, who had oppoſed the idea of war, more directly, at the meeting at Parkinſon's than I had thought prudent, and who had diſtinguiſhed himſelf, afterwards at Brownſville, in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the purpoſes of the violent, and was under the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of being taking up, on three days notice, and out of his own diſtrict<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was the higheſt.

had but a few votes in that county, but the greater part of Allegheny, where I reſide. I only remark further, that in Hamilton's diſtrict, which is in the neighbourhood of Parkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's ferry and Mingo creek, and was the hot bed of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, I had but 24 votes, Daniel Hamilton, 132, and my brother of the bar, 90; which was about a fourth of the whole he had in the two counties. I ſtate this only to ſhew who it was, that ſtood faireſt with the moſt violent of the inſurgents.</p>
               <p>I had been perfectly quieſcent with regard to the election. I had heard the tales propagated amongſt the inſurgents againſt me, and I had ſeen the horſes from the public ſtables diſpatched by quarter maſter Craig, to all parts of the country, with tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets for my brother of the bar. The French convention had not more couriers out, at that time. But I was not diſturbed at this; for though I did not chuſe to withdraw my name, yet I did not wiſh to be elected. I knew that the ſuffrages of the people, under exiſting circumſtances, would be conſtrued as a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of having been more with them, in the recent convulſion, than became a good citizen. It would render my character queſtionable abroad; I had reaſon in a very ſhort time to look upon it as fortunate that I had not this preſumption. This will open a new ſcene upon the reader, as it did upon me.</p>
               <p>I had heard before this, by individuals from Philadelphia, of the impreſſion made upon the citizens, by my letter to Tench Coxe. That it was conſidered as a letter of defiance, and had excited an irreſiſtable flame of indignation againſt me. This did not much diſturb me, at firſt, for I conceived the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would underſtand it, and take it in good part, and the people in due time would underſtand it alſo. Marſhal Lenox had gone to Philadelphia, and knew my ſolicitude in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, when at Pittſburgh. Preſly Neville had gone, who, though ſomewhat chagrined, becauſe I would not do every thing his way, yet, when his mind cooled, would ſee things in a more proper point of view, and would at all events, do me the juſtice to acknowledge, that it was at his inſtance that I came forward at an early period of the buſineſs. Commiſſioner Roſs, who knew my conduct from the commencement, had been with the executive, and in ſpeaking of thoſe in this country, that were hoſtile or offenders, would repreſent me favourably; on theſe grounds, I was perfectly eaſy, as to men of information near the Preſident, and concluded that from thence, juſt ideas, with regard to me, would ſpread, and gradually correct the popular error, with the militia that were coming forward. I had ſeen
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028332_0163_0FD8995E2E910540"/>
paragraphs unfavourable, with regard to me, in the gazettes; but I thought nothing of that, conſidering them as the reſult of an unavoidable, but temporary miſconception. I had alſo heard of the flame excited by the "Indian treaty" publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was charged to my account; and had raiſed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of the Jerſey militia, in particular, ſo that they were hewing me in imagination, with their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>abres, as they came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and bayoneting every buſh or other thing upon the road, and calling what they bayoneted, "Brackenridge". But I conceived it to be the policy of the more intelligent to let the people exerciſe their minds with ſome objects, and perhaps im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their reſentment, general, or particular, but not that any perſon, who knew my ſtile, would take that publication for mine.</p>
               <p>I had more reaſon to be apprehenſive, than I was aware. A few days after the election, David Reddick, commiſſioner with Findley, from the committee at Parkinſon's, returned from his miſſion to the Preſident, whom he had found at Carliſle, with the army on their march; he called upon me, and with great appearance of ſolicitude, gave me to underſtand the unfavoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble point of view, in which I ſtood with the army, and the great perſonal danger I had to apprehend from the threats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. That having occaſionally introduced my name to the Preſident, as not being concerned in the inſurrection, he was ſilent. But that thoſe about him, appeared to have ſtrong prejudices. This brought to my mind, an expreſſion I had ſeen in the addreſs of the Preſident at Carliſle; exhorting, amongſt other things, "to detect intriguers". Thought I, that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours a little of chevalier Neville. He knows that I cannot be charged with any overt act, and may have inſinuated there, as he had done here, that I have intrigued againſt the government. The fact was, the intriguers here were all on the ſide of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment; there was nothing but open force againſt it.</p>
               <p>At the time Mr. Reddick called, I had juſt finiſhed a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, which I had taken into my head to draw up to the Preſident, and intended to communicate by the poſt; repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, "that whatever doubt might have been entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the pacification of the country, at the time commiſſioners Reddick and Findley left it; yet none could be entertained now, that I would pledge my life for it, that a ſingle troop of horſe might come up and arreſt any man with ſafety: that the depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had been as ſudden and as low, through the country, as the inſurgency was rapid, and the fury high before. That the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:028332_0164_0FD8995F77D98BE0"/>
effect would be greater in reſting the army at Bedford and Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, than in coming further; for report had magnified the force, and imagination is ſtronger than the eye; and it would be a more dignified ſpectacle to ſee the laws reſtored by the bare ſhewing of an army, and the civil authority of this country, itſelf, in motion, to aid the authority of the union, in arreſting offenders, than the whole body coming actually into the country; that five hundred horſe might come on with the judge and the marſhal, merely as an eſcort; not for ſafety, but for dignity. That ſomething was to be left to the honour of the country; and the line of demarcation perciſely marked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the impreſſion of neceſſary awe, and that of degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reduction: that the country could not always be retained by force, and therefore it would not be prudent to extinguiſh affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that the people, then under his command, were ſubject to the like error with the people here; and it might, in the turn of things, at no very diſtant day, happen, that the government would ſtand in need of the country to repreſs inſurrections elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; that if the army ſhould come into the country, they would come weary and fatigued, through the mountains, in the rains of the ſeaſon, and would be ſeen to a diſadvantage; they would be leſs ſatisfied with the campaign themſelves, and the awful apprehenſion, which the people here had, would be leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, and they would begin to ſay they could have fought them. It would be alſo difficult, if not impoſſible, to reſtrain the army from depredations on property, or from perſonal inſult; and that would ſoar the minds of the beſt friends of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and reduce that internal check derived from their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port againſt another inſurrection."</p>
               <p>I mentioned to Mr. Reddick what I had been about, but ſaid, if this is the caſe, that I am ſuſpected, let me ſay what I may, it will be miſconſtrued; I ſhall throw by my papers, and let things take their courſe.</p>
               <p>I was ſtruck with information from Mr. Reddick, of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion by the Preſident, when the commiſſioners were ſtating to him the probable irregularities of the army, from the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in which they were, and poſſible indiſcriminate injury to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as well as property. The Preſident ſaid "that if a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle gun was fired in oppoſition, he could not anſwer for the conſequence." Thought I, if that is the caſe, and the army ſhould march into the country, whether a gun be fired or not, he, or thoſe who may command them, may not be able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for the conſequence to individuals, whoſe names are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028332_0165_0FD89961B3650350"/>
it will not be ſafe for me, as things now ſtand, to truſt myſelf in their way, but to avoid them, if practicable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it can be ſeen, whether diſcipline and ſubordination to civil authority is preſervable, or not.</p>
               <p>Commiſſioner Reddick had propoſed to call a third meeting of the Parkinſon's ferry delegates, and at the ſame time invite the moſt conſpicuous inhabitants to attend, in order to ſend forward ſuch further aſſurances to the Preſident, as might juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy him in ſuſpending the march of the troops, or at leaſt of the whole body.

               <p>In the mean time, I thought it proper to endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the miſconception of the army, with regard to the Indian treaty publication, and at my requeſt, the printer diſcharged me of the imputation, by a paragraph in the paper<note n="†" place="bottom">Underſtanding that a certain publication, which appeared in our paper, ſometime ago, containing ſpeeches, in imitation of an Indian treaty, and ſuppoſed to reflect on the militia of New-Jerſey, and has been attributed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, to Mr. Brackenridge, we are ready to declare that Mr. Brackenridge is not the author.</note>.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
               <p>THE rage of the army againſt me appeared to increaſe, as they approached the country; at leaſt the accounts I received of menaces and death, were every day more frequent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. It was ſaid, that I had ſaved myſelf by the amneſty of the government, but that ſhould not ſave me from death without the forms of law. The executive would not be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable in bringing me to trial, in violation of their faith; but, on moral or political grounds, there would be no impropriety in the army exerciſing, at leaſt in one inſtance, an act of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, though irregular, juſtice. This I underſtood to be the language, not of thoſe in the ranks of the common ſoldiery on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but of the higheſt officers.</p>
               <p>The publication of Bradford had appeared, and that would complete the proof to the exiles, of what they would have only ſuſpected before, viz. that I had prompted Bradford to their expulſion. Theſe were with the army, and would no doubt contribute to the flame that had prevailed. I had underſtood before this, by intelligence from Philadelphia, that Neville the younger, though not publicly charging me with being concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the inſurrection, yet his inſinuations, to individuals, were to that effect. Commiſſioner Reddick, on his return from his firſt miſſion, informed me, that, being in company with general Neville, he had ſaid, that as I had a knowledge that his houſe was to be burned, ſometime before it happened, he thought I might have given him ſome information, that he might have removed at leaſt his papers. I began to reflect what poſſible ground he could have for ſuppoſing that I had a knowledge of an intention of burning his houſe, before it took place. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected that, after the burning of the houſe, I mentioned the language of M'Donald, ſecretary of the Mingo meeting, to me, ſometime before, in my office; viz. that the people talked of breaking up Neville, and burning Pittſburgh; and that I had thought nothing of it, at the time; but as they had burned Neville's houſe, they might accompliſh the other part of the threat, and burn Pittſburgh <note n="*" place="bottom">See the teſtimony of M'Donald in the Appendix.</note>. This had been carried to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028332_0168_0FD8996735E8DF70"/>
Neville, and he had deduced from it, that I had a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that his houſe was to be burned.</p>
               <p>But the publication of Bradford had appeared, and fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, ſo far as the publication could have credit, at leaſt a privity with the expulſion, and a ſupport of it. The army was now at Bedford and Cumberland, and the enquiries, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to me, were, Whether I had left the country? or was it probable I would remain until they could get me in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? It ſeemed to be a conteſt amongſt them, who ſhould have the honour of diſpatching me. I conceived, that the example of the Jacobins in France had infected the maſs of the army, juſt as much as it had the people here, in Tom the Tinker's time; and I thought it not at all improbable that I ſhould be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinated. It appeared to me expedient, to addreſs letters to ſome of the principal officers; ſtating my apprehenſions, and repreſenting the diſgrace that it would bring upon their march, to injure a man who was, and in due time would appear to be, innocent; giving them alſo to underſtand, that I remained in the country, was ready to reſign myſelf to the cognizance of the laws, and made no claim to an amneſty, if I ſtood in need of any. I had written a number of letters to principal officers, to this effect; but I reflected, that individual officers might not like to be addreſſed by me, in my preſent ſituation. It would argue a confidence repoſed in them, from perſonal acquaintance, which it would pleaſe them as well to keep out of view at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Beſides, I did not ſee well what officers could do. My fate would moſt probably come from the corps of horſe, that would come on firſt. Theſe eſpecially, were compoſed of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, in the capacity of common ſoldiers, equal, in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, to thoſe conſtituted officers. It would depend upon the ſentiments of the maſs, more than the diſcipline of officers, with regard to me. It ſtruck me, therefore, to addreſs the army generally, in a hand-bill, which would be circulated through the whole body; whereas, if I addreſſed individuals, my letters could not be generally communicated, in order to correct in any degree the falſe ſentiments entertained of me, or to avert the intention of putting me to death, without enquiry. Under this idea, I drew up a ſhort addreſs <note n="*" place="bottom">

with ſome hundred hand-bills, to commiſſioner Reddick and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who had been appointed from the laſt meeting at Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon's, to wait again upon the Preſident, or other command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officer with the army, in order to lay the ſtate of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try before them. The army had moved from Bedford and Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, and were met by our commiſſioners the march of a day or two from the country. My direction to our commiſſioners, to whom I had tranſmitted my hand-bills, was, to deliver them to the commanding officers of the different parts of the army, to be by them diſtributed, if they thought proper, amongſt the troops. I addreſſed letters, with the hand-bills, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officers, to this effect. The hand-bills were delivered to the commanding officers of the right wing, governors How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell and Mifflin; and to the commander in chief, general Lee, who was, at that time, with the left wing, on his advance from fort Cumberland. The Preſident had returned to Philadelphia. I was informed by letter, from commiſſioner Reddick, that fame had not at all exaggerated the fury of the army againſt me; and there would appear to be no individual, even of thoſe higheſt in command, who appeared diſpoſed to have any ſolicitude on my account, or at leaſt to be willing to have it thought they had any; that governor Howell, on receiving my hand-bills, threw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them inſtantly into the fire; that Mifflin and Lee had given feeble aſſurances, that I ſhould be perſonally ſafe;—but that he himſelf, Mr. Reddick, in order to ſerve me, had contrived that ſome of the hand-bills ſhould find their way amongſt the troops, without going through the hands of the officers. I diſapproved of the having done this; for I knew that offence would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from every thing poſſible, and that the officers would ſay this was wrong. It was ſaid to be wrong; and I began to be
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:028332_0170_0FD88585BB6E4B60"/>
charged with ſtupidity, as well as villany, in not knowing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than to ſend forward papers amongſt the ranks of an army. I was blamed for addreſſing them at all. I had conſidered this army as conſiſting of citizens, and I did not conceive any greater impropriety, in addreſſing them in a camp, by a hand-bill, than in their counting-houſes, or upon their farms, in the gazette of Philadelphia, Trenton, or Richmond. But I was unpopular; I was under the imputation of being a traitor to my country; if I was not hanged, I deſerved to be hanged; and it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material what I ſaid or did, it would be taken in bad part. It was ſaid, it was a damnable impertinence in me, to have the aſſurance to write or ſpeak a word to any body. I ſcarcely knew whether to laugh or indulge chagrin at the abſurdity of ſuch ſpeeches. I had thought the recent inſtances in France, of men being run down by the clamour of an occaſion, and murdered without an opportunity of juſtifying themſelves, might have corrected ſuch precipitancy in the American mind.</p>
               <p>The deputation of commiſſioners from the country, had not anſwered the end of arreſting the march of the army, by aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the reſtoration of tranquillity, and obedience to the laws. The Preſident had ſeen things from a different point of view with me, and had not thought himſelf juſtifiable in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending the march. I preſume, he had not a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the ſubmiſſion of the people. It would ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I preſume he alſo conceived, that the exhibiting ſo formidable a force in the country, would leave an impreſſion of fear; the beſt ſecurity, in his opinion, againſt future oppoſition to the laws. It would take away effectually, the ſaying hereafter, that the militia could not have ſuſtained a march acroſs ſo vaſt a mountain. The difference of expence would be little; as the equipments and appointments for the army had been made, ſtores and every requiſite provided, and the troops might as well be marching into the country, as remaining at diſtant points, until the judiciary had advanced, and finiſhed their examinations and arreſts in the country. It would have a good effect in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the union, where a ſpirit of inſurrection might exiſt, to hear that an army had croſſed even the Allegheny mountain, to the heads of the waters that run to the weſt, in order to cruſh the inſurgency, that had ſhewn itſelf in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſkirt of the government. It would have a good effect in
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:028332_0171_0FD8996BC0109A00"/>
Europe, and reſtore that confidence in the government, which had been leſſened by the report of the diſturbance of the ſummer. Finally, a great part of the army were anxious to ſee the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern country, and they might as well come on embodied as they were.</p>
               <p>The right wing of the army had now croſſed the mountain, and were in the weſtern country. It was like the approach of a tempeſt to me. I could hear the thunder at a diſtance; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day new accounts of butchery denounced againſt me, without judge or jury. I began to hear general Neville raiſe his voice; "the damnedeſt raſcal that ever was on GOD Almighty's earth."</p>
               <p>The left wing had alſo croſſed the mountain, at the diſtance of 30 miles to the weſtward. I could hear of colonel Neville at the table of general Lee, and publickly elſewhere, through that camp, denounce revenge againſt the "damned raſcal," meaning me.</p>
               <p>I began to think it would be unſafe to ſtand it: that I could not have ſufficient confidence in the good diſpoſition of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officers, much leſs in their power, to reſtrain injuries; and that it would be adviſeable to be out of the way a little, until I could ſee whether ſubordination to the civil authority; wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> reſervable or not. I had the wilderneſs behind me; and, as before, I had meditated to eſcape from Tom the Tinker, by going to the eaſt, ſo now, I meditated to eſcape from an equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly outrageous banditti, as I began to think them, by going to the weſt. My ſenſations were violent at the time, but they ought to be excuſed, as I muſt have thought it very extraordinary in people, to have come to ſupport the laws, and to be talking of violating them. I communicated to general Wilkins my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of going, neither to Spainards, nor Britiſh, but of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my chance amongſt the Indians, for a month or two, until I could have a proper aſſurance of protection, in ſurrendering myſelf to the judiciary authority. I had thought of a hunter, whom I could employ to go to the woods with me.</p>
               <p>General Wilkins could not but acknowledge the expediency of going, from all that he had heard or ſeen, and propoſed a hunter, whom he knew, and thought more expert, than the one of whom I had made mention; and engaged to ſpeak to him to go with me. He was to ſend for him next morning.</p>
               <p>I lay upon a couch, and thought of it till midnight. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected that people would always talk more than they would do; and that putting me to death would be more in the language,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028332_0172_0FD8996D152D91E0"/>
than in the intention of the maſs. It was the faſhionable ſpeech of the camp, and every one adopted it; without meaning to carry it into effect. But I reflected alſo, that this very ſtrain of talking, though not originating from intention of act, with the maſs, yet might lead ſome inconſiderate and unprincipled men, to perpetrate what they heard ſpoken of; more eſpecially as I had heard of the violence of the Nevilles, and ſuſpected that the horrid reſentment, which they appear to entertain againſt me, might prompt them to encourage aſſaſſination.</p>
               <p>However, after the deep thought of many hours, I ſprung from my bed couch, and expreſſed my determination, that if I was to be aſſaſſinated, it ſhould be in my own houſe. It never ſhould be ſaid, that I would move a foot from the ground; more eſpecially as in my addreſs to the army, I ſaid I would not. It was true, I made that declaration, at the time, under the impreſſion that my addreſs would be read, and all idea of perſonal injury would be relinquiſhed, and the examination of my conduct left to the judiciary, under the avowal which I made, of putting myſelf entirely upon the merit, or demerit of of it; meaning that I ſhould ſet up no claim to the amneſty, of which it might be ſuppoſed I would be willing to avail myſelf.</p>
               <p>Having now determined to await my fate, I employed a day or two in putting my papers in order, and making a ſhort ſketch of the outlines of my conduct, during the inſurrection, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting it to be deli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But it was what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to others in other times, and would happen a thouſand times again. It had been the caſe of La Rochefoucaut, Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont de Tonnere, and others, at an early period of the French revolution.</p>
               <p>About this time Joſiah Tannehil, an aſſiſtant burgeſs of Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh came to me, and mentioned the name of my brother of the bar, ſaid he, he has diſcovered —. What? ſaid I, the longitude? No, ſaid he, but that you are not within the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, you did not ſign upon the day. Is that all? ſaid I, that will not do me any harm.</p>
               <p>The event of the election had incenſed my brother of the bar ſtill more, if poſſible, than he was before. From a want of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy, or a defect of education, he values himſelf upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of force, and will talk familiarly of knocking down a
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:028332_0173_0FD8996E6DED1098"/>
man. I had heard that he had talked of having recourſe to this mode of ſhewing his ſuperiority over me. If he was not ſo popular, he would convince the people that he was ſtronger, and more ferocious. However, he had loſt ſight of this, when the proſpect appeared of having me aſſaſſinated by the army, the propriety of which he ſtrenuouſly advocated, and conceived, that the army might juſtifiably do that, en maſſe, which every individual would be juſtified in doing by himſelf, upon ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid an inſurgent as I was. He had, no doubt, been buſy in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing this idea, by all avenues, by which he could poſſibly reach the army. But on diſcovering that I was not, in ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, within the amneſty, and beginning to believe that, with good management, ſomething might be done with me with the judiciary, he had relinquiſhed the idea of aſſaſſination, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated the more diſgraceful conſequence to me, the being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominiouſly arreſted, and tried at the bar for high treaſon.</p>
               <p>I had no idea that it had been any ſecret before, that I had not ſigned on the day. I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ever thought of an amneſty. I would have reſented it as an indignity, to have it ſuppoſed that I did. I had ſigned upon the principles I have ſtated in my narrative.</p>
               <p>It ſtruck me, as fortunate, that my brother of the bar had faſtened upon this. He would communicate the circumſtance to the Nevilles with the army, and that would change their views, with regard to the mode of proceeding againſt me; and inſtead of getting the father-in-law, general Morgan's dragoons, to put me to death privately, would lead them to aſſail the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary with accuſations, and to uſe all addreſs, influence, and induſtry, to collect or make teſtimony.</p>
               <p>It was preciſely as I had foreſeen. Accounts from the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, of the language of the Nevilles, now began to be, that of having me hung. I was diverted with a ſpeech of general Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville's, reported to me: When ſome of the people, alarmed for their ſituation, had gone forward to ſolicit his favour; Children, ſaid he, it is not you we want; it is ſome of the "big fiſh," Brack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enridge, Gallatin, and Findley, that we want. Thought I, it is high enough to expect to find me in the ſame ſhoal of fiſh with Gallatin and Findley, when I have had a political difference with Findley, that has produced a diſtance, which ſtill exiſts; and when I have never ſpoke to Gallatin in my life, that I recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, until I ſaw him at Parkinſon's ferry. But the fact was, Findley and Gallatin were obnoxious, perhaps with the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary, but certainly with ſecretary Hamilton, who acted in aid
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028332_0174_0FD899732E718AA8"/>
of the judiciary in the examination of witneſſes; and it would have a good effect to involve me in the odium of Gallatin and Findley. I give credit to the ingenuity of the old general in this.</p>
               <p>Willing to avoid the circumſtance of an arreſt, in any humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating way, I had prepared a letter to judge Peters, giving him to underſtand, that whether within the amneſty or not, I was ready to diſclaim it; and had a right to do this, under the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Juri pro ſe introducto quiſquis renunciari poteſt;</hi> every man may renounce a privilege that has been ſpecially given him; but that it would not be neceſſary to wound my feelings, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching troops to arreſt me. I would come forward upon a moment's notice, or I would remain, and be ready to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der myſelf at Pittſburgh, when they ſhould come forward to that place.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time, I had prepared a paragraph for the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette, calling upon all good citizens, who knew any thing of treaſonable actions, ſpeeches, ſeditious writings, or miſdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of any kind, cognizable by the judiciary of the United States, by me done, ſaid, or written, to come forward, and give their teſtimony to the judiciary, then in the country, and ready to hear them. Commiſſioner Roſs was at this time in Pittſburgh, and was about to ſet out to the army. I ſhewed him my letter to judge Peters, and my advertiſement, which I was about to inſert in the gazette; and I requeſted him to bear my letter to judge Peters. He made this remark, that, in his opinion, the true medium was, on the one hand, not to court a proſecution; on the other, not to fear it. I thought the obſervation ſolid; and I reflected, that I have been always diſſat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>James Roſs undertook to mention it to the judiciary, that I was ready to ſurrender myſelf, and would pledge his honour, that I would not remove from the town, or avoid an inquiſition, This, he preſumed, would ſuperſede the arreſting me with any ignominious circumſtances; a thing which it was poſſible my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies would endeavour to accompliſh, in order to have that gratification, if they could obtain nothing more. On this, I laid aſide my letter to the judge, and my paragraph for the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
               <p>MY brother of the bar had gone to the camp, and had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon his office of ſolicitor of teſtimony againſt me. The juſtice of the peace, on whoſe paper of ſubmiſſion I had put my name, had been called before the judiciary, in order to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the fact, that I was not within the amneſty. It was aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and now the field was open for accuſation. In the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of all witneſſes, the great burden of the ſong was, "What do you know of Brackenridge?" I knew well that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary Hamilton would have a prediſpoſition againſt me. He would rather find the oppoſition to the law to have originated in the plan of ſome leading individuals, than with the maſs of the people: for the exciſe law being a reſult of the funding ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, of which the ſecretary was an advocate, it would ſave the pride of judgment, to have it thought oppoſed by the ſeditious arts of one, or a few, rather than by the feelings or common ſenſe of many. I reflected alſo, that the ſecretary would have obſerved, in my letter to Tench Coxe, and in ſome other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications, that I was not a friend to the funding ſyſtem itſelf. And this, even with a man of integrity, would conſtitute a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as imperceptible to himſelf; and I was ſenſible, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the ſecretary, in my caſe, would have weight with the judiciary.</p>
               <p>Judge Peters I knew to have no prejudice againſt me; and I did not conceive that Rawle had any; but as the army were vociferous to have me made a victim, there would naturally ſpring up, in the minds of both, an inclination to gratify them.</p>
               <p>But with the ſecretary and judiciary, the wiſhes of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villes connections, who were conſidered as martyrs to the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, would have an almoſt irreſiſtible influence. I reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the drift of my ſpeech at the Mingo meeting-houſe, might not have been fully underſtood by all; but more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally my management at Parkinſon's ferry, the firſt meeting, was not underſtood generally, for it was not my wiſh that it ſhould be generally underſtood, and therefore the teſtimony that would of courſe come forward, with regard to what was ſaid or done on theſe occaſions, would place my conduct in an equivocal, if
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:028332_0176_0FD899776DE44698"/>
not in a criminal point of view. When I add to this, the lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that perſons, conſcious of criminality, would have to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the government, by teſtimony againſt a character that was to be run down, in order to gain favour for themſelves, I thought an arreſt not improbable. But when I alſo took into view, the proſpect of favour with government, as to offices, of which it would be ſuppoſed the Nevilles connection would have now the diſtribution, and that an oath, on the preſent occaſion, would go a great way to recommend, I thought my arreſt certain.</p>
               <p>My adverſaries conſidered themſelves as having loſt a great deal, in the departure of Bradford. On the return of the firſt commiſſioners, Reddick and Findley, he had been informed of an obſervation of the Preſident, on the commiſſioners repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, that all the principal actors had taken the benefit of the amneſty; We have heard, ſaid he, of inflammatory ſpeeches made after the 22d day of Auguſt <note n="*" place="bottom">The amneſty reſpected only what was done before this day.</note>. It was underſtood by them, that this had a reference to Bradford: it was on this that he thought proper to abandon the country. If he had known the arrangements that had been made on his behalf, by ſome of my adverſaries, he would perhaps have ſtaid at home. The way had been prepared: it had been given out, that he was a weak man; that he had been gulled into the buſineſs; that he had been ſet up as a thing to be ſhot at, by ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the ſcene; that I was the manager of the puppet ſhew; the moſt dangerous perſon to the government on the weſt of the mountain; that Gallatin and Findley were nothing to me. I will not charge the Nevilles with deviſing this; it was the plan of my brother of the bar. The letter of Craig to Bradford, inſinuating <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>
                        <q>I would not have addreſſed you on the ſubject, had I not ſuppoſed that you were deceived in your information.</q>
                     </p>
                  </note> that it was not ſuppoſeable that he could do or ſay any thing amiſs, gives a key to the ſyſtem of making uſe of him. He was to be repreſented to the ſecretary as deceived, miſled by an artful and deſigning man, whom they wiſhed hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his place. The Nevilles had been brought into it, and begun to adopt the language ſuitable to the occaſion, and which continues to be the rhyme yet, that Bradford was gulled.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, a detachment of horſe, eſcorting general Gibſon, who had been exiled, arrived at Pittſburgh. They were under the command of corporal Cunningham, a merchant of Philadelphia. He had given orders not to ſpeak to me. I
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:028332_0177_0FD89979AFDDDC48"/>
had ſuppoſed, that general Gibſon, who had been acquainted with the commencement of the inſurrection, would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to them the miſtake under which they had laboured with regard to me. I had heard of him, as the only one of the exiles who had the candour to do me juſtice, on his way out of the country. It is probable he had given his opinion favourably, with regard to what had happened before he went away; but it might be ſuppoſed, that I had acted a different part afterwards. I reflected on my ſolicitude on his account, at the time of the expulſion<note n="*" place="bottom">See Meetkirk's depoſition in the appendix, and John Scull's, and others.</note>, when I ſaw him paſs by my houſe, with the dragoons of his train, looking up, and laughing; as much as to ſay, "There lives a fellow that is to be hanged." He ought to have recollected, that he was chairman of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee that exiled the firſt three. But Gibſon is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unfeeling or unjuſt man, but he was under the neceſſity of giving way to the current againſt me; it was too ſtrong to be ſtemmed. He did go ſo far as to ſay, that all things conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he could not conceive me to be ſo much concerned in the inſurrection as I was ſuppoſed to be.</p>
               <p>The next detachment that arrived, was an eſcort of three or four ſquadrons of horſe, conducting, in great pomp, the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Neville. General Morgan himſelf was along. They ſhewed themſelves on the ſouthern bank of the Monongahela; they croſſed the river; the ſtandards were unfurled, and the cornets blew their horns; the guns of the garriſon were diſcharged;— it was like a Roman ovation, a ſpecies of the leſſer triumph.</p>
               <p>General Morgan, in the evening, accompanied by his ſuite, and parading near my houſe, with a military gait, was heard to ſay, "Hang the raſcal, hang him."</p>
               <p>After night, I was informed by my ſervants, that ſome of the dragoons were occaſionally coming and going, and watching the avenues to the houſe; and that two of them had come into the kitchen, and looked into the adjoining rooms. About 9 o'clock, I had farther information, that two of them had been in the yard, and had gone away. This did not ſtrike me much; I reſolved it into curioſity, or an intention of plundering ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. They would naturally think it could be no great harm to make free with the property of an inſurgent.</p>
               <p>However, the danger was greater than I had imagined; that night, about eleven o'clock, I was to have been aſſaſſinated. The troops had advanced within 20 yards of my door, when an
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:028332_0178_0FD8997E3B4022F8"/>
officer, who had been appriſed of their intention, and in vain laboured to diſſuade them, having run to general Morgan, who was in the houſe of Neville the younger, and not gone to bed, gave him information. The general and the colonel ran out without their hats, and the general oppoſing himſelf to the fury of the troops, ſaid, "That it muſt be through him they would reach me;" that I had ſtood my ground; would be cognizable by the judiciary; and let the law take its courſe.</p>
               <p>I had diſmiſſed all apprehenſions of aſſaſſination; conceiving that my adverſaries had turned their attention to a legal proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. It was not until two or three days afterwards, that I heard of the attempt of the troops of cavalry. I had thought myſelf perfectly ſecure, at all events, from a detachment under the immediate command of the general, and who had eſcorted his ſon-in-law, becauſe the murder would be immediately attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to them; and a regard for their own honour, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of all principles of humanity, would lead them to avoid the perpetration at that time; and if any thing was to be executed, let it be by a detachment from ſome other corps, at another time. I will not ſay, that the Nevilles were uſually capable of deliber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately contemplating the putting me to death. The father is outrageouſly paſſionate, but not vindictive or cruel; the ſon is a man of good temper, and humanity; but they laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der irremoveable miſconceptions, owing to a variety of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and their pride had alſo been wounded by acts of mine, which I thought virtuous, and think ſo ſtill. My brother of the bar had all hell in his boſom; and had it not been for the proſpect of hanging me, would have ſtruggled hard to have me murdered. And I knew well, that the miſconception of the Nevilles had been, in a great degree, originally eſtabliſhed by him; and that their rage had been fanned by his information. He was now buſy at the camp, with general Neville. The general, who had been a ſubject of the outrages, was there in the light of a private proſecutor; and in aid of the judiciary, was aſſiſting in bringing forward and interrogating witneſſes. My brother of the bar was active in ſounding, embracing, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalling them; and if, on examination, any thing was omitted by the judiciary, he took the general aſide, and gave him a hint of it. The general would then return to the charge with freſh queſtions. This is the account that I have from witneſſes that were examined, or from gentlemen occaſionally preſent.</p>
               <p>When the matter was thought to be pretty well fixed againſt me, the great and concluding ſtroke was to be given. A trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:028332_0179_0FD8997FB6BD7938"/>
letter of mine, addreſſed to a certain Bradford, had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the hands of my adverſaries. It was dark and myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and reſpected certain papers, a duplicate of which I wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to ſend me, having miſlaid the firſt copy; that theſe were ſo eſſential, I could not go on with the buſineſs without them. This letter was now brought forward. What do you make of that? ſaid ſecretary Hamilton to James Roſs, who was preſent: you have averred, as your opinion, that Brackenridge has had no correſpondence with Bradford; look at that, is it not the hand-writing of Brackenridge? It is the hand-writing, ſaid James Roſs, pauſing for ſome time; and there is only this ſmall matter obſervable in the caſe, that it is addreſſed to William Bradford, attorney general of the United States, not to David Bradford <note n="*" place="bottom">It was wrote to the attorney general, William Bradford, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner at Pittſburgh, when I was ſuperintending the publiſhing the report to be made of the correſpnodence of the committee of twelve and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners. I wrote to him, requeſting ſome of the papers that were to be inſerted. This note had been dropped at the public houſe, and picked up by my adverſaries. They were in ſuch a hurry to believe every thing againſt me, that they had not taken time to examine it with attention. I preſume, major Craig, <hi>virtute officii,</hi> as notary public, had picked it up.</note>.</p>
               <p>When a blaſt, tranſverſe, takes a ſhallop on the river, and throws her on her beam ends, with all her ſails ſet; or when a ſend of wind takes the ſtanding corn of the farmer, and on the field bows the ſtalks to the earth, ſo languiſhed my brother of the bar. The old general ſtood motionleſs and ſpeechleſs, and to this hour had been ſtanding, had not ſecretary Hamilton broke ſilence. "Gentlemen, ſaid he, you are too faſt; this will not do."</p>
               <p>The late circumſtance had weakened the credit of the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; and all things conſidered, eſpecially when James Roſs was examined, it began to be doubted whether it would be for the honour of the government to proſecute me. However, the caſe remained open for farther teſtimony.</p>
               <p>It was not until a conſiderable time afterwards, that I had information of this indiſcreet zeal on the part of the proſecution. I had heard all that I had apprehended confirmed; viz. that there was the ſtrongeſt diſpoſition with the judiciary, and thro' all the branches of the aſſiſtant examiner to find ground of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting me. This was ſo ſtrikingly obſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble by the country, that it quite reſtored me in their good opinion; and if the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been to take place then, there would have been no
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:028332_0180_0FD88587E7783F80"/>
queſtion of my having their ſuffrages. They were ſatisfied they had wronged me, in ſuppoſing that I had ſtipulated any indemnity for myſelf in particular; or had made fair weather with the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, by deſerting them. I had nothing to fear from the body of the people, they would rather lean in my favour; but there were ſtill enough of unprincipled perſons, that might be brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or who would offer themſelves in order to obtain favour. It was amuſing to me, to ſee the numbers of thoſe coming for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and paſſing themſelves for friends of government, whom, during the inſurrection, I had a great deal of trouble to keep down. They took their revenge now, and joined in the cry againſt Brackenridge.</p>
               <p>Some poor fellows did this to ſave themſelves; I had given them leave to do it. They came to me, with tears in their eyes, to conſult whether they would go off or not, or ſtand trial. The army had then croſſed the mountain. I directed them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to let my brother of the bar hear them curſe me, and ſay they had voted againſt me at the election; this would be carried to the ear of my adverſaries, and they would be repreſented as friends of government. They did ſo; and it had the effect.</p>
               <p>At the time I had given this advice, I had dreaded nothing but an aſſaſſination; I had no idea of having any thing to fear from a judiciary proceſs. Now I began to apprehend danger from this ſource. I looked forward to a trial before a jury, in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia; which, heated with prejudice againſt me, would differ little from a revolutionary tribunal of Paris. Beſides, the part I had been drawn in to act, was ſo various, and of ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it would take a multitude of witneſſes to explain the quo animo; and the expences of a trial would ruin me. But, what alarmed me ſtill more, from a ſtroke that I received from a ſedentary life, twenty years ago, I am ſubject to a delinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or ſailing of nerves, eſpecially when any thing affects my mind; and I was afraid that my feelings would kill me, under a ſenſe of the arts that were practiſing againſt me. I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>e it with apparent fortitude, but my ſenſibility was greatly affected. Not that I was uncommonly afraid of death; but I recorded my memory for the ſake of my family, and was apprehenſive, that if I ſunk under the ſenſibility of my affections, it would be reſolved into a conſciouſneſs of guilt, and not into the pain which the ingenuous mind feels when it is wronged by the world.</p>
               <p>It may ſeem to reflect upon the judiciary, to have it ſuppoſed that they would give ſo facile an ear to general Neville, as may ſeem to have been inſinuated. Let it be conſidered, that

they would find, in the courſe of their examination, that even at the burning of the houſe of the inſpector, there were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who had been under the impulſe of fear for themſelves, and were carried there by conſtraint. But more eſpecially at Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock's fields <note n="*" place="bottom">I knew a man, nearly related to me, on B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He yielded on the order to go to Braddock's field, and appeared there with a crooked horn by his ſide, but had no powder in it. He ſaw, as he went along, the tomahawk drawn over the heads of men, at their breakfaſt, or dinner, and obliged to march.</note>, many were preſent under compulſion; and thro' the ſcene in general, men were obliged to pretend to be what they were not. The quo animo, therefore, was to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, a good deal, from what had been known to be their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and conduct heretofore. To whom could this be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red better, than to the inſpector of the revenue, who knew the people? and this gave him an unlimited influence in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations. I have no diſpoſition to be diſſatisfied with the uſe the inſpector made of this advantage, in ſaving individuals; I wiſh I could equally excuſe the uſe he made of it in proſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others. I can only ſoften my cenſure, by acknowledging that, ſo far as I have heard, he exerciſed favour in more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances than prejudice. But in both caſes, he muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as having miſled the judiciary; and though my obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may help him as a man, it muſt hurt him as a proſecutor. It would have been better he could have declined his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the examinations; to have been eſcorted to his houſe, at an early period, and to have remained there; leaving the judicial inveſtigation to an operation unbiaſſed by him; ſo as not only to avoid the influence of opinion, but the ſuſpicion of it. But this is a delicacy which the noble mind alone has from nature, or which a refined education gives.</p>

                              <salute>Sir,</salute>

                           <p>I have it in ſpecial inſtruction from the Preſident of the United States, now at this place, to convey to you, on his behalf, the following inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for the general direction of your conduct, in the command of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia army, with which you are charged.</p>
                           <p>The objects for which the militia have been called forth, are,
<list>
                                 <item>1. To ſuppreſs the combinations which exiſt in ſome of the weſtern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Pennſylvania, in oppoſition to the laws laying duties upon ſpirits diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilled within the United States, and upon the ſtills.</item>
                                 <item>2. To cauſe the laws to be executed.</item>
                              </list>
                           </p>
                           <p>Theſe objects are to be effected in two ways:
<list>
                                 <item>1. By military force.</item>
                                 <item>2. By judiciary proceſs, and other civil proceedings.</item>
                              </list>
                           </p>
                           <p>The objects of the military force are twofold:
<list>
                                 <item>1. To overcome any armed oppoſition which may exiſt.</item>
                                 <item>2. To countenance and ſupport the civil officers in the means of executing the laws.</item>
                              </list>
                           </p>
                           <p>With a view to the firſt of theſe two objects, you will proceed as ſpeedily as may be, with the army under your command, into the inſurgent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to attack, and, as far as ſhall be in your power, ſubdue, all perſons whom you may find in arms, in oppoſition to the laws above mentioned. You will march your army in two columns, from the places where they are now aſſembled, by the moſt convenient routes; having regard to the nature of roads, the convenience of ſupply, and the facility of co-operation and union; and bearing in mind, that you ought to act, until the contrary ſhall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly developed, on the general principle, of having to contend with the whole force of the counties of Fayette, Weſtmoreland, Waſhington, and Alleghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and of that part of Bedford which lies weſtward of the town of Bedford; and that you are to put as little as poſſible to hazard. The approximation, therefore, of your columns, is to be ſought; and the ſubdiviſion of them, ſo as to place the parts out of mutual ſupporting diſtance, to be avoided, as far as local circumſtances will permit. Parkinſon's ferry appears to be a proper point, towards which to direct the march of the columns, for ulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior meaſures.</p>
                           <p>When arrived within the inſurgent country, if an armed oppoſition ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, it may be proper to publiſh a proclamation, inviting all good citizens, friends to the conſtitution and laws, to join the ſtandard of the United States. If no armed oppoſition exiſt, it may be ſtill proper to publiſh a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, exhorting to a peaceable and dutiful demeanor, and giving aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of performing, with good faith and liberality, whatſoever may have been promiſed by the commiſſioners, to thoſe who have complied with the conditions preſcribed by them, and who have not forfeited their title by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent miſconduct.</p>
                           <p>Of theſe perſons in arms, if any, whom you may make priſoners; leaders, including all perſons in command, are to be delivered to the civil magiſtrate; the reſt to be diſarmed, admoniſhed, and ſent home, (except ſuch as may have been particularly violent, and alſo influential); cauſing their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizances for their good behaviour, to be taken, in the caſes in which it may be deemed expedient.</p>
                           <p>With a view to the ſecond point, namely, "the countenance and ſupport of the civil officers, in the means of executing the laws," you will make ſuch diſpoſitions as ſhall appear proper, to countenance and protect, and, if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and required by them, to ſupport and aid the civil officers, in the execution of their reſpective duties—for bringing offenders and delinquents to juſtice; for ſeizing the ſtills of delinquent diſtillers, as far as the ſame ſhall be deemed eligible by the ſuperviſor of the revenue, or chief officer of inſpection; and alſo for conveying to ſafe cuſtody, ſuch perſons as may be apprehended, and not admitted to bail.</p>
                           <p>The objects of judiciary proceſs, and other civil proceedings, will be,
<list>
                                 <item>1. To bring offenders to juſtice.</item>
                                 <item>2 To enforce penalties on delinquent diſtillers, by ſuit.</item>
                                 <item>3. To enfore the penalty of forfeiture, on the ſame perſons, by the ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of their ſtills and ſpirits.</item>
                              </list>
                           </p>
                           <p>The better to effect theſe purpoſes, the judge of the diſtrict, Richard Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, eſq. and the attorney of the diſtrict, William Rawle, eſq. accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the army.</p>
                           <p>You are aware, that the judge cannot be controlled in his functions. But I count on his diſpoſition, to co-operate in ſuch a general plan, as ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you conſiſtent with the policy of the caſe. But your method of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a direction to legal proceedings, according to your general plan, will be by inſtruction to the diſtrict attorney.</p>
                           <p>He ought particularly to be inſtructed, (with due regard to time and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance), 1ſt. To procure to be arreſted, all influential actors in riots, and unlawful aſſemblies, relating to the inſurrection, and combinations to reſiſt the laws; or having for object, to abet that inſurrection, and thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations; and who ſhall not have complied with the terms offered by the commiſſioners, or manifeſted their repentance in ſome other way, which you may deem ſatisfactory. 2dly. To cauſe proceſs to iſſue, for enforcing penalties upon delinquent diſtillers. 3d. To cauſe offenders, who may be arreſted, to be conveyed to gaols where there will be no danger of reſcue— thoſe for miſdemeanors, to the gaols of York and Lancaſter—thoſe for ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital offences, to the gaol of Philadelphia, as more ſecure than the others. 4th. To proſecute indictable offences in the courts of the United States— thoſe for penalties on delinquents, under the laws before mentioned, in the courts of Pennſylvania.</p>
                           <p>As a guide in the caſe, the diſtrict attorney has with him a liſt of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have availed themſelves of the offers of the commiſſioners, on the day appointed.</p>
                           <p>The ſeizure of ſtills, is the province of the ſuperviſor, and other officers of inſpection. It is difficult to chalk out a preciſe line concerning it. There are conſiderations which will require to be nicely balanced, and which muſt be judged of by thoſe officers on the ſpot. It may be found uſeful, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the ſeizures to ſtills of the moſt leading and refractory diſtillers. It may be adviſeable, to extend them far in the moſt refractory county.</p>
                           <p>When the inſurrection is ſubdued, and the requiſite means have been put in execution, to ſecure obedience to the laws, ſo as to render it proper for the army to retire, (an event which you will accelerate as much as ſhall be conſiſtent with the object), you will endeavour to make an arrangement for detaching ſuch a force as you deem adequate, to be ſtationed within the diſaffected country, in ſuch a manner as beſt to afford protection to well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed citizens, and to the officers of the revenue; and to repreſs, by their preſence, the ſpirit of riot and oppoſition to the laws.</p>
                           <p>But before you withdraw the army, you will promiſe on behalf of the Preſident, a general pardon to all ſuch as ſhall not have been arreſted, with ſuch exceptions as you ſhall deem proper. The promiſe muſt be ſo guarded, as not to affect pecuniary claims under the revenue laws. In this meaſure, it is adviſeable there ſhould be a co-operation with the governor of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania.</p>
                           <p>On the return of the army, you will adopt ſome convenient and certain arrangement, for reſtoring to the public magazines, the arms, accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, military ſtores, tents, and other articles of camp equipage, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching tools, which have been furniſhed, and ſhall not have been conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or loſt.</p>
                           <p>You are to exert yourſelf, by all poſſible means, to preſerve diſcipline a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the troops; particularly a ſcrupulous regard to the rights of perſons and property, and a reſpect for the authority of the civil magiſtrate; taking eſpecial care to inculcate, and cauſe to be obſerved, this principle,—that the duties of the army are confined to the attacking and ſubduing of armed opponents of the laws, and to the ſupporting and aiding of the civil officers, in the execution of their functions.</p>
                           <p>It has been ſettled, that the governor of Pennſylvania will be ſecond, the governor of New-Jerſey third in command; and that the troops of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtates, in line, on the march, and upon detachment, are to be poſted according to the rule which prevailed in the army during the late war,— namely, in moving towards the ſea-board, the moſt ſouthern troops will take the right,—in moving weſtward, the moſt northern troops will take the right.</p>
                           <p>Theſe general inſtructions, however, are to be conſidered as liable to ſuch alterations and deviations in the detail, as from local and other cauſes may be found neceſſary, the better to effect the main object, upon the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral principles which have been indicated.</p>

                  <pb n="66" facs="unknown:028332_0183_0FD89989C3EE83F8"/>The judiciary had now been upwards of ten days in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and proceeded a conſiderable length in their examinations,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:028332_0184_0FD8998B3142BF90"/>
ſo as, in their opinion, to have had information with regard to the principal offenders. It ſeemed, therefore, adviſeable to
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:028332_0185_0FD8998C85C8C620"/>
commence arreſtations. In order to avoid delays, and prevent eſcapes, from the alarm that the commencement of arreſtation would cauſe, it was thought adviſeable, to have the arreſts made all at the ſame inſtant, throughout the whole country; more eſpecially, as ſo general and rapid a ſtroke, made in the night, would have a more awful effect upon the minds of the inſurgents. Agreeably to this ſyſtem, communicated to the commander in chief by the judiciary, orders were iſſued by him, to the ſeveral commanding officers, encloſing liſts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be apprehended; and giving directions to arreſt, at diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, others who ſhould be repreſented to them as principal offenders. The arreſtation took place generally, through the country, on the night of the 13th of November.</p>

                           <p>From the delays, and danger of eſcapes, which attend in the preſent ſituation of judiciary inveſtigations, to eſtabliſh preliminary proceſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt offenders, it is deemed adviſeable, to proceed in a more ſummary way, in the moſt diſaffected ſcenes, againſt thoſe who have notoriouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted treaſonable acts; that is, to employ the military, for the purpoſe of apprehending, and bringing ſuch perſons before the judge of the diſtrict, to be by him examined, and dealt with according to law.</p>
                           <p>To you is committed the execution of this object, within that part of Allegheny county to which you are advancing.</p>
                           <p>As a guide to you, you have herewith a liſt of perſons (No. 1.) who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing complied with the terms offered by the commiſſioners of the United States, are entitled to an exemption from arreſt and puniſhment; and who are, therefore, not to be meddled with. You have alſo a liſt (No. 2.) who it is underſtood, on good grounds, have committed acts of treaſon; and who may, therefore, be ſafely apprehended.</p>
                           <p>Beſides theſe, you may, in the courſe of your operations, receive ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory information of others who have committed like acts, and whom, in that caſe, you will alſo cauſe to be apprehended. The acts alluded to, are the following: 1ſt. The firing upon, impriſoning, or interrupting, in the courſe of his duty, the marſhal of the diſtrict. 2d. The two attacks on the houſe of John Neville, eſq. inſpector of the revenue. 3d. The aſſembling, or aiding the aſſemblage, of an army at Braddock's field, in the county of Allegheny, on the firſt day of Auguſt laſt. 4th. The aſſembling, and acting as delegates, at the meeting at Parkinſon's ferry, which began the 14th day of the ſame month. 5th. The meeting at Mingo creek meeting-houſe, termed a Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, ſometimes a Congreſs. 6th. The deſtruction of property, and expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of perſons, at and from the town of Pittſburgh. 7th. The interrupting and plundering of the public mail; and the injuries and violences to the houſes and perſons of Benjamin Wells, John Webſter, and Philip Regan, officers of the revenue. 8th. The planting of poles, impudently called liberty-poles, with the intention to countenance and co operate in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.—You will carefully direct your enquiry towards civil and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary officers, who have been extenſively concerned in the enormities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; it being their ſpecial duty, to have prohibited, by their exertions, every ſpecies of enormity. But in the apprehenſion of perſons, not named in the liſt (No. 2.) you will uſe great circumſpection, to embrace none but real offenders; nor will you be too promiſcuous, or too general. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons apprehended, ought to be leading or influential characters, or particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly violent.—You will alſo find a liſt marked (No. 3.); this paper comprehends witneſſes. The individuals are to be brought forward, and treated as ſuch.</p>
                           <p>Direct all who may be apprehended by you, to be conveyed to your camp; where detain them in ſafety, until further orders. Send off your parties of horſe, with good guides, and at ſuch a period, as to make the ſeizures, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſtant or near, at the ſame moment; or intelligence will precede them, and ſome of the culprits will eſcape. I preſume, the proper hour will be at day-break, on Thurſday morning; and have, therefore, deſired the operation to be then performed, in every quarter.</p>

That being the caſe, general Irwin was, of courſe, confined to the liſt, No. 2, who muſt be ſuppoſed as not in the liſt, No. 1, or as having forfeited the amneſty; that is, not having the liſt of thoſe entitled to the amneſty, he could exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe no diſcretion, agreeably to information he might himſelf receive, but was to ſuppoſe all in it, or innocent, that were not in the liſt of perſons to be arreſted. Of liſt, No. 2, were perſonally known to me, Andrew Watſon, Norris Moriſon, Samuel M'Cord, John Hannah, William Amberſon, William H. Beaumont, Alexander M'Nickle, Mordecai M'Donald, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin

Cooper, and George Robinſon. Of theſe, all had ſigned the amneſty, except George Robinſon, and Mordecai M'Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ald. And with regard to George Robinſon, I never heard a ſingle ſyllable alledged; but, on the contrary, he was known to be a moſt worthy peaceable man; the chief burgeſs of Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh. His not ſigning the paper of ſubmiſſion, was owing to a miſtake of pride, which had exiſted with many, that it would be a virtual acknowledgement of having done ſomething in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the laws. Nevertheleſs, theſe were arreſted, in the night of the 13th of November, all except Andrew M'Nickle and William Amberſon; the laſt of whom had received ſome hint of it, and ſurrendered himſelf to the judiciary, then ſitting in his houſe. Alexander M'Nickle found favour, and by ſome direction to general Irwin, was paſſed over. Martin Cooper, alſo, was paſſed over; and he never knew that he had been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the liſt, until I informed him, the other day, when theſe papers came into my hands. Nothing could be a greater proof to me, of favouritiſm and prejudice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than the forming this liſt, and the management reſpecting to it. Jeremiah Sturgeon had been arreſted, as the perſon intended under the name of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sturgeon. I will now aſſume four of theſe; Andrew Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, William H. Beaumont, Jeremiah Sturgeon, and George Robinſon; than whom, I will pledge myſelf, there are not four leſs ſupected, much leſs offending men, in the whole town of Pittſburgh. With regard to the others, there had been allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in regard of raiſing a liberty-pole; but, as to the greater part of them, found afterwards to be groundleſs.</p>
               <p>Andrew Watſon was my neighbour, one of the moſt worthy men on earth, and a perſon who had ſuffered as much uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, from the diſturbance, as any man could do; had demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf in the moſt unexceptionable manner. Jeremiah Sturgeon, one of the moſt unoffending of men; and of George Robinſon I have already ſpoken. Theſe men were little known out of the town of Pittſburgh; and it muſt have been from thence, that any information againſt them, could have come.</p>
               <p>Theſe men were dragged out of their beds, at two o'clock in the morning: not ſuffered to dreſs themſelves, but in an unfin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed manner; obliged to march, ſome of them, without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on their ſhoes, which they had to carry with them in their hands; dragged out of their beds, amidſt the cries of children, and the tears of mothers; treated with language of the moſt inſulting opprobrium, by thoſe apprehending them; driven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a troop of horſe, at a trot, through muddy roads, ſeven
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:028332_0188_0FD8998F70D73838"/>
miles from Pittſburgh; impounded in a pen, on the wet ſoil. The guard baying them, and aſking them how they would like to be hanged; ſome offering a dollar to have the privilege of ſhooting at them; carried thence four miles towards the town; obliged to lie, all night upon the wet earth, without covering; under a ſeaſon of ſleet, rain, and ſnow; driven from the fire with bayonets, when ſome of them periſhing had crawled, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to be unſeen, towards it; next day empounded in a waſte houſe, and detained there five days; then removed to a newly built and damp room, without fire, in the garriſon at Pittſburgh; at the end of ten days brought before the judiciary, and the information againſt them found not to be regarded.— Was this the way to quell an inſurrection? Was this the way to make good citizens? Do I blame the judiciary? No. I blame the management of thoſe concerned to injure them. Theſe were neighbours and friends of mine, and that is the ſecret of their ſufferings. It was thought by my adverſaries that they might have a knowledge of ſomething againſt me, and that, when alarmed for themſelves, they would diſcloſe it. At leaſt I can in no other way, account for the repreſentation which had been made with regard to them, as ſuſpicious perſons. They were examined, but all they could ſay, was in my favour.</p>
               <p>William H. Beaumont, from the cold, was affected in his eyes, and incapable of doing any thing for the remainder of the winter, and yet labours under a weakneſs in that organ. George Robinſon was affected with a cold, unfit for attending his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which was that of a mechanic, for a long period. Why do I mark theſe things ſo minutely? It is to induce Mr. attorney Rawle, or judge Peters, if they ever read this, to enable me to trace the ſource of information againſt theſe, that in a free country, I may bring the calumniators to juſtice. I feel myſelf concerned, not only perſonally, but for the honour of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of the day or two following, intelligence from the ſeat of examination, to me by citizens who were occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from thence, purported that the teſtimony was becoming ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong, and that recruits of witneſſes againſt me had gone on. It began to be underſtood that a ſecond arreſt was to take place, and that general Wilkins, James Clow, town clerk of Pittſburgh, a certain Fergus Ferguſon, a collier, and myſelf were to be upon the liſt. Is it poſſible, thought I, that mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice can impeach general Wilkins, who, during the inſurrection, was himſelf ſo obnoxious, for his attachment to the government,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028332_0189_0FD89994B9FCECC8"/>
and who exerted every means in his power, that were prudent and proper, to check the inſurrection? As to Clow, his offence could be nothing more than ſigning the paſſport of Neville, which was to ſerve him. Fergus Ferguſon had no concern in the diſturbance that I ever heard of; but he had neglected to appear on the 11th of September, and to ſign the ſubmiſſion paper. He was alarmed, not knowing but that all were to be hanged, that were found out of it. He had conſulted me at an early period. I was of opinion, that as his employment and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence was ſubterraneous, he could plead the not belonging to the ſurface of the earth; or if in ſtrickneſs, this would not bar the juriſdiction of the court; it would at leaſt have weight with the executive, to direct the attorney general to enter a <hi>noli proſequi,</hi> in as much as he had been under ground through the ſummer, and had not heard of the inſurrection, until it was over.</p>
               <p>Charles Smith, ſon-in-law to commiſſioner Yates, one of the aſſiſtant examiners with the judges, had come to town, and mentioned it to a perſon, who communicated to me, that my arreſtation was certain; that he was aſtoniſhed that I was ſtill in Pittſburgh.—"Had I no regard for my life?" That others alſo, who had no apprehenſion of it, were in the like predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that 36 hours would make a great change in Pittſburgh. Thought I, my adverſaries have been more ſucceſsful, in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalling the preſumption of guilt in my caſe, than I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. I take it for granted, that I ſhall be arreſted, beyond all queſtion, now. However, I had compoſed my mind a good deal by this time, and thought I could have fortitude to bear all they could accompliſh; and if there was any chance of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice at all, I would finally triumph over them.</p>
               <p>Hearing that I had been conſidered as a leader of the inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, I thought I muſt endeavour to ſupport the appearance, as I would be a good deal looked at. And I had, juſt before this time, got a large cocked hat, and buff under dreſs, with a coat of military blue; and now and then occaſionally ſhewed myſelf in the ſtreet, imitating, as well as I could, the grave deportment, and ſtately gait of a general officer. A variety of detachments of horſe had come to town, and I found it was a matter of curioſity, to ſee the leader of the inſurgents. I would ſometimes hear it ſaid, when not ſuppoſed to hear it, "He has the appearance of a military man."</p>
               <p>In order to account for this, it was ſaid by ſome, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:028332_0190_0FD8999675E39BC8"/>
to know my hiſtory, that I had been an officer in the late war.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding it was known that I remained in Pittſburgh, yet it might be ſuppoſed, that as the danger approached, I might become more alarmed, and abſcond, if direction was given to take me in the day; and for that reaſon, and becauſe it would gratify my adverſaries, to accumulate humiliation upon me, I counted upon being arreſted in the night. I therefore lay all night upon a couch, without undreſſing, ready, at a moment, to obey the mandate, and go with the guard that ſhould call for me. I lay two nights in this manner, not ſleeping much, but conſoling myſelf with reading ſome of the lives of Plutarch. Reading that of Solon, I meditated upon his laws, making it death for a citizen, in a civil tumult, not to take a part; for by taking a part, on one ſide or the other, the moderate citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens will be divided, and mixing with the violent, will correct the fury, on both ſides, until an accommodation can be brought about. It was on that principle I had acted in the inſurrection; and by ſeeming to be of the inſurgents, had contributed to ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en all their meaſures, and finally prevent a civil war. But I ſaw that the law of Solon would apply chiefly to a ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, where the moderate men were known to each other, and could explain themſelves in the courſe of the gociation. I had been treading upon a precipice; making an experiment ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely dangerous. My intentions were laudable, but my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct hazardous. It is true, I had been called upon, in the firſt inſtance, by a public officer; and through the whole of the ſcene, was in confidence with men, that I had conceived would be unſuſpected. But I was at a great diſtance from the ſeat of government, and not in confidence with the firſt officers, and it might be ſaid, that I had deceived others. If the like ſcene ſhould happen again, I will not conduct myſelf on the principle of Solon's law. Let people that are to be expelled, get out of the country the beſt way they can, and let the executive and inſurgents ſettle their own negociations; I will have nothing to do with them.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the judiciary had come to Pittſburgh; and the commander in chief alſo. The deputy quarter maſter had taken my houſe for head quarters; not, I believe, becauſe it was my houſe, but becauſe it was a large one. I was pleaſed, in one reſpect, to ſee written upon my door, "The command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in chief's quarters," as it would ſecure from aſſaſſination <note n="*" place="bottom">There were ſtill threats to this effect.</note>.
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028332_0191_0FD89997AFC01730"/>
But, on the other hand, it would increaſe the ignominy, to be dragged hence under a guard.</p>
               <p>I had reduced myſelf, with my family, to one apartment of my houſe, where I meant to remain, and not ſee the general; but unexpectedly was informed, that ſome of the military had entered the outer door, and were aſking for me. Having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the arreſt in my mind, I compoſed myſelf a moment, and ſtepped out to ſurrender myſelf; thinking of ſome words to addreſs the officer of the guard, in order to conciliate, as far as was practicable, civility of treatment. I was appalled, at the addreſs of general Lee, who, with his ſuite, had juſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. I had known him, when a lad, at the academy, twenty years ago; and I had often, as being a ſenior ſcholar, aſſiſted him in his prelections, or in the ſtudy of the principles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and eloquence; and had never expected to ſee him the general of an army, arreſting me for an attempt to overthrow a government.</p>
               <p>The general diſcovered a pauſe in me to receive his advance, and to anſwer; and aſked, if he was miſtaken, in ſuppoſing that his quarters were to be at my houſe? I gave him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that there was no miſtake; and having ſhewed him into an apartment, withdrew. I confined myſelf to my apartment. The day after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> general Lee ſent a meſſage to me, ſignifying his expectation, that, as my houſe was taken up by his family, I would dine with him. It was extremely painful to me, but I could not make an apology, without explaining the delicacy of my ſituation; and it had been my ſyſtem, to be prepared for an arreſt, but not to diſcover that I expected it. I endeavoured to decline the invitation, upon common place grounds, but he inſiſted, and I dined with him.</p>
               <p>At dinner. I ſat next a general Chambers, whom I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen in my life before, yet I hated him. I had heard, that the day of the arreſt of the inhabitants from Pittſburgh, when the guard was removing them from the firſt ground to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, at ſome diſtance, the captain of the guard, Colhoun, of Chamber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>urgh, had lent his horſe to my neighbour, Andrew Watſon, who had fallen ſick, and was unable to walk; when general Chambers coming up, ordered him to diſmount, with opprobrious appellations. I conceived, from this incident, that the general had diſcipline, but not humanity. Perhaps, at the time, I did not make a ſufficient allowance, for that indignation which he felt, on ſeeing one, whom he muſt think a great cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prit, treated with indulgence. As ſoon as I could, to ſave ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:028332_0192_0FD8999D9B7FE2F0"/>
I withdrew from the table. My mind was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hurt; for though every perſon behaved with politeneſs to me, yet I conceived them to think me an inſurgent; and I felt, every moment, the abſurdity of dining in ſuch company this hour, and the next to be conducted, with ignominy, as a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal.</p>
               <p>Early next morning, a ſubpoena was read to me, from judge Peters, commanding me before him, at his chamber, to give teſtimony, touching all ſuch matters as ſhould be enquired of me. I conſidered this as, in fact, an examination touching my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and that, on the opinion formed from this, was to depend my being or not being arreſted.</p>
               <p>I attended the judge, and was referred by him to ſecretary Hamilton, for examination. I was received by Hamilton, with that countenance, which a man will have, when he ſees a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with regard to whom his humanity and his ſenſe of juſtice ſtruggles;—he would have him ſaved, but is afraid he muſt be hanged;—was willing to treat me with civility, but was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed with a ſenſe, that, in a ſhort time, I muſt probably ſtand in the predicament of a culprit, and be in irons. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, by aſking me ſome general queſtions, with regard to any ſyſtem or plan, within my knowledge, of overthrowing the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. I had known of nothing of the kind. After a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of general queſtions, to which I had to anſwer in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, I propoſed putting an end to that, by giving him a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of every thing I did know. It was agreed; and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to write. I gave him the outlines of the narrative I have given in this publication, until I came to that particular, where, after the burning Neville's houſe, I repreſented the people calling upon Bradford and Marſhall to come forward, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port what was done, under the pain of being treated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville himſelf had been. At this the ſecretary laid down his pen, and addreſſed himſelf to me; Mr. Brackenridge, ſaid he, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve one leading trait in your account, a diſpoſition to excuſe the principal actors; and before we go further, I muſt be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, and inform you of the delicate ſituation in which you ſtand; <hi>you are not within the amneſty; you have not ſigned upon the day;</hi> a thing we did not know until we came upon this ground, I mean into the weſtern country; and though the government may not be diſpoſed to proceed rigorouſly, yet it has you in its power; and it will depend upon the candour of your account, what your fate will be. My anſwer was, <hi>I am not within the amneſty,</hi> and am ſenſible of the extent of the power of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment;
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028332_0193_0FD8999E8F9C3F10"/>
but were the narrative to begin again, I would not change a ſingle word. I went on. Having paſſed through the circumſtances of the marſhal and Neville being privy to my giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my opinion to Black and Hamilton, on the effect of the writs of ſubpoena againſt delinquent diſtillers, and Neville requeſting me to go to the Mingo meeting-houſe, my examination was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed; Mr. Hamilton being called upon to dinner; and I was deſired to attend in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>I came home; but declined dining with general Lee that day, though preſſed by ſeveral meſſages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I could not bear to ſhew myſelf with that company, in the doubtful predicament in which I ſtood.</p>
               <p>At three o'clock I returned to my examination; Mr. Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton entering the room where I waited for him, appeared to have been reflecting, and ſaid, "Mr. Brackenridge your conduct has been horribly miſrepreſented." I ſaw that he never before heard the leaſt of my being ſolicited by Neville the younger, to go to the meeting at Mingo creek, but having juſt dined in company with Neville, at the houſe of major Craig, where I was then examined, he had aſked Neville, and he had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it. This is conjecture.</p>
               <p>I went on to give an account of the Mingo creek meeting. The ſecretary appeared not ſatisfied. "Mr. Brackenridge," ſaid he, "you muſt know we have teſtimony extremely unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to you, of ſpeeches made at this meeting; in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar your ridiculing of the executive." I ſaw that ſome fools had miſunderſtood, and had been giving account of what I had deduced from the lenity of the Preſident, in the caſe of the Preſqu'iſle eſtabliſhment, and my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>roducing general Knox and the Seneca Indian, Obeal, or Cornplanter, making ſpeeches. I was extremely hurt to think, that, after I had been called upon, in the manner I was to go forward on that occaſion, I ſhould be at the mercy of the accounts of perſons who did not underſtand me, and obliged to anſwer the pleaſantry I had found neceſſary to uſe, to carry off their minds, for a time, from the object they were upon, until I ſaw them better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to hear what I had farther to ſay. My anſwer was, "Five perſons were choſen to go with me to that meeting; for the expreſs purpoſe of bearing teſtimony of what I ſhould ſay; let theſe be called upon. Is it reaſonable I ſhould be at the mercy of the miſconceptions, or a voluntary miſrepreſentation of weak or prejudiced individuals?" He was ſilent. I went on giving an account of the town meeting of Pittſburgh. I ſtated
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:028332_0194_0FD899A00AAD8928"/>
it, as moved by me, that we ſhould march and affect to join the people at Braddock's fields. I ſaw the ſecretary pauſe at this, and ſink into a deep reflection. It ſtaggered him. Was it any more, ſaid I, than what Richard the ſecond did, when a mob of 100,000 men aſſembled on Blackheath? the young prince ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed them, put himſelf at their head, and ſaid, What do want, gentleman? I will lead you on.</p>
               <p>My narrative now continued. After ſome time the ſecretary obſerved, "My breaſt begins to ach, we will ſtop to night; we will reſume it to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock." I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, but was ſtruck with his laſt expreſſion. I was at a loſs to know whether his breaſt ached for my ſake, or from the writing; but diſpoſed to conſtrue every thing unfavourable, I ſuppoſed it was for my ſake, and that he ſaw I muſt be arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Next morning general Lee made an apology to Mrs. Brack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enridge, that for the ſake of retirement, and to be in a leſs central part of the town, he was about to withdraw to other quarters, with ſome part of his family. I conſidered this as owing to the delicacy of his feelings, that he wiſhed to be out of the way, and not a witneſs of the circumſtance of one with whom he had been acquainted in juvenile years, ſinking into a melancholy ſituation juſt under his eye. I had taken it for granted that he had received a hint from Mr. Hamilton, of what was to take place.</p>
               <p>Waiting on the ſecretary, at 9 o'clock, my examination re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commenced. In the courſe of the narrative, his countenance began to brighten, and having finiſhed the hiſtory, there was an end. "Mr. Brackenridge," ſaid he, "in the courſe of yeſterday I had uneaſy feelings, I was concerned for you as for a man of talents; my impreſſions were unfavourable; you may have obſerved it. I now think it my duty to inform you, that not a ſingle one remains. Had we liſtened to ſome people, I do not know what we might have done. There is a ſide to your account; your conduct has been horribly miſrepreſented, owing to miſconception. I will announce you in this point of view to governor Lee, who repreſents the executive. You are in no perſonal danger. You will not be troubled even by a ſimple inquiſition by the judge; what may be due to yourſelf with the public, is another queſtion."</p>
               <p>In ſo delicate a caſe, where life had been ſought by inſidious men; and where, what I felt with more ſenſibility, my hopes of eſtimation in the world, were likely to be blaſted, at leaſt for a
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:028332_0195_0FD899A1736E0FB8"/>
time, it may eaſily be ſuppoſed, that no word eſcaped me, or will ever be forgotten.</p>
               <p>My ſenſibility had been greatly wounded, when I waited on judge Peters with the narrative to ſign it, as directed by Mr. Hamilton. It was with difficulty, I could write my name. I curſed the circumſtance of having to write it five times, to the five different ſheets of paper, of which my narrative conſiſted. I returned to my houſe with different feelings from thoſe I had for a long time before.</p>

               <p>IN collecting teſtimony againſt me, there was no pains ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It had been the conſtant ſtudy and employment of my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the bar, for a long time before; with denunciations that he would have me hanged. In the examination of witneſſes, when brought forward, there was no boot, or other inſtrument of torture, in the hands of the examiners; but there was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly every addreſs to the fears of individuals, to extort from them, an acknowledgment of ſomething ſaid or done by me. I am unwilling to mark any thing as contrary to my ideas of propriety, but declaring, that in all I have ſeen or heard I have nothing elſe to mark, I take the liberty of ſtating as what was conſidered by me as improper, viz. the ſuggeſting to witneſſes, in the courſe of examination, that the enjoyment of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, which they claimed, would depend upon the candour with which they gave teſtimony againſt others; it will be recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected that it was ſuggeſted to me, by the ſecretary, what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to the ſame thing; that, though not under the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty in ſtrictneſs, yet candour in my own caſe, and that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, would determine the executive in giving a rigid or libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſtruction to my ſigning after the day. I felt the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with infinite ſenſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was humiliating enough to have it thought, for a moment, that I had any occaſion for an amneſty; or that if I had, I would purchaſe it, by giving teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt others, more liberally, than if ſafe. I ſaw that in the mind of the ſecretary, juſtice was not done to me. He knew not my pride, and the path of honour which I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued through life.

                  </gap>e to give teſtimony; no doubt of it; but better no teſtimony than falſe; and who could tell but that a timid wretch, under fear of being hanged, even though he had no teſtimony, would endeavour to make ſome, in order to eſcape the ſuſpicion of keeping back what he had. It is the general impreſſion of the country, and I aver it to be my own, that wrong has been done by perſons depoſing, under fear, againſt their neighbours more than was true. At the ſame time, there is no manner of queſtion, but that much more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently matters have been ſoftened in the relation; but there is no defalcation or ſetting off in this caſe; for it is better that ten guilty perſons eſcape, then one innocent perſon ſuffer.</p>
               <p>The judiciary were aware, but not ſufficiently, of the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of malice in ſome perſons againſt others, taking advantage of the occaſion, to exerciſe revenge. There was juſt as much danger of this now, on the one ſide, as there had been in Tom the Tinker's time, on the other. I have heard of a great deal of it. Why do I remark theſe things? of what uſe? I mean it as a memento, ſhould a like occaſion ariſe. I mean to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en that caution, with which teſtimony is to be received in all ſuch caſes; and which, I acknowledge, has been exerciſed by the judiciary on the late occaſion, in general, as far as, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering all circumſtances, could reaſonably be expected.</p>
               <p>I do not mean to queſtion the neceſſity, for nothing elſe could juſtify it, of making the arreſt in the night, and by ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons of horſe; but I only take notice, that, this being neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, it was the greater hardſhip for a man to be arreſted, who was a good citizen; for inſtead of being treated, as far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with confinement, with all the delicacy that a ſtill exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſumption of innocence demands, and which the mild ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of an arreſt, by a common civil officer, gives, he is ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the inſults, which may naturally be expected from thoſe who, having juſt before thought of fighting and killing, are diſpoſed now to have, at leaſt the ſatisfaction of curſing, or ſtarving, or otherwiſe abuſing the people.</p>
               <p>The 13th of November was a dreadful night through the weſtern country. Hundreds were arreſted; offenders and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſometimes together. Though the directions were to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh in the treatment, yet it could not always be done, in the firſt inſtance. There was danger of witneſſes abſconding, as well as of thoſe againſt whom teſtimony was to be given. The ſcene was diſagreeable. Men thrown into jail, kept in

cold barns, or out-houſes, or tied back to back in cellars. The officers charged with their cuſtody, in ſome caſes, behaved with mildneſs; in others, with wanton and unneceſſary ſeverity. Captain Dunlap, of Philadelphia, is ſaid to have conducted a number of priſoners from Waſhington to Pittſburgh, with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. A captain — is ſaid, on the other hand, to have driven a number, under his cuſtody, like cattle before him, at a trot, in muddy roads, through a water, the Chartiers, to the middle; and then impounded them in a wet ſtable, and inſulted them, by ordering to be thrown into the manger, dough and raw fleſh to eat. Paſſing to Waſhington, ſometime afterwards, I examined the ſtables, and collected theſe circumſtances.</p>
               <p>The judiciary were employed a conſiderable length of time, in examining the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

A claſs, ſtill leſs proper objects of puniſhment, either from alleviating circumſtances in their caſe, or from indigence or help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs of family, were ſent to governor Lee, to be admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, agreeably to inſtructions, and diſmiſſed. The ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary was humane; and pardonable frauds were practiſed upon it. It was no uncommon thing for girls, with pads, to ſave their lovers, by paſſing for married and pregnant women, with two or three children at home, calling for bread. Judge Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters could not be ſuppoſed to be a midwife, nor could the writ <hi>de ventre inſpiciendo</hi> iſſue, but from the court. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſary to admit the fact.</p>
               <p>Whether from a natural cunning, finding out what could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe or recommend, or taught by my adverſaries, a proper uſe was alſo made, eſpecially when remitted to the governor, of the prejudice that was ſuppoſed to exiſt againſt me. "It was Brackenridge that brought them into all their trouble." Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they would add Bradford.</p>
               <p>A part of governor Lee's family had remained ſtill in my houſe, and I came to underſtand the ground of his removal; it was owing to objections made to come to his table, or to the houſe on my account.

honeſt man, until I was declared other wiſe, by thoſe whom he had a right to know; that when preſented to his authority in the light of a criminal, to be treated as ſuch, he would know what to do. This was during my examination by ſecretary Hamilton. However, the clamour was ſo general, and great, that he found himſelf under the neceſſity of yielding, in the manner I have ſtated.</p>
               <p>My adverſaries were extremely enraged, at the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of not having me arreſted. I was diverted with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of old general Neville—"The moſt artful fellow that ever was on God Almighty's earth; he has deceived Roſs, he has put his finger in Bradford's eye, in Yates' eye <note n="*" place="bottom">The attorney general and commiſſioner Yates.

               <p>My brother of the bar expoſtulated very warmly with the judiciary, for the aſtoniſhing defect of official duty, in not ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me in irons to the capital. It is to be preſumed, they made proper apologies for acting agreeably to their own judgment, and contrary to his.</p>
               <p>Neville the younger had conducted himſelf with more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, but with more dangerous addreſs. I had been more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the effect of his influence, than that of the attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Having failed of a public proſecution, his object has been to eſtabliſh individual reſentment. I have heard of the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation he has given, with a view to make me enemies. When I am called upon, I will anſwer, as to the correctneſs of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation given.</p>
               <p>Talk of aſſaſſinating me had conſiderably ſubſided, in the mean time. A feint had been made one day, as I ſtood in the door. An officer preſented a piſtol, within a few ſteps. It was to intimidate; for on my not moving, but looking at him ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, he dropped it. He was a whimſical fellow; for return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the public houſe, he took part againſt another officer, who was abuſing me; and ſaid, I muſt be an honeſt man, for I ſtood firm when he preſented his piſtol. It came to a conteſt between them, and my champion diſarmed his adverſary.</p>
               <p>Governor Howell having been, by this time, a little better informed in my caſe, had the politeneſs to call upon me, and

                  </gap>ls; alledging, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, the impropriety of my addreſſing an army, by ſending writings into camp. I affected to acknowledge it to be an error of judgment in me: but I thought it an error of prejudice in him. However, I was greatly pleaſed with the ſoldier-like appearance, the frankneſs of manners, and the eloquence of the governor; and was very ſorry that, though my ſtanding was better than it had been, yet, even then, I could not feel myſelf eaſy in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting his troops, amongſt whom I had many academic acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, having been educated at the college of that ſtate.</p>
               <p>Arrangements had been made for the return of the army, and the diviſions had moved. Governor Lee give a dinner to the gentlemen of the village. I had no invitation. He was led to ſuppoſe, that it would give offence to the greateſt part. I ſmiled, to think how my adverſaries were reducing themſelves, and raiſing me.</p>
               <p>I had an invitation to dine with the governor next day, with his family alone. If this was not a greater compliment, it was certainly a greater pleaſure to me, than to have had an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with the croud. He did me the honour to requeſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, in private, the morning following, on the affairs of the country. It was a proof to me, that though he had given my adverſaries the compliment of ceremony, he gave me that of confidence.</p>
               <p>A dinner was now to be given to the governor, on the part of the citizens. A number of gentlemen, who had called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and expreſſed their indignation at the treatment I had received, ſolicited me to join in the ſubſcription to the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to be given to the governor.

               <p>ON a review, it muſt be evident, that the judicious and mild policy of the executive, in appointing commiſſioners, was what ſaved the country from a civil war. It gave the government a ſtrength which nothing could reſiſt. It ſilenced, at once, all clamour from below, and divided the people here. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of the propoſitions, left the refractory without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe; and brought forth the force of government with a warmth of heart, unchecked by an idea that all conciliatory means had not been tried. It may be thought ſlight; but, in my opinion, a great matter was effected. An early and effectual leſſon was given in our republican government. It would be too much, to ſay that a revolution was cruſhed in embryo; but I will ſay, with boldneſs, that what I was afraid might coſt an hundred thouſand lives, was repreſſed without the loſs of one. The phyſician who, by perfect ſkill in his art, reaches the diſeaſe, in its firſt principle, by a ſingle grain of medicine, the patient himſelf ſcarcely ſenſible of it, ſurely deſerves more praiſe, than him who, by the ſtrongeſt applications to the exterior of the ſyſtem, makes a greater ſhew of having done ſomething, but has done leſs; or, to take a ſimile from my own profeſſion, a ſingle wiſe word of counſel, in a cauſe, at the commencement, is worth an hour of the moſt maſterly oratory, at the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:028332_0201_0FD897FBFA323568"/>
in court. A client will ſometimes ſay, when his cauſe is gained, Why aſk ſo much, you had no trouble? He meaſures the ſervice, not by the effect, but by the appearance of labour his counſel had in accompliſhing it. He counts upon the buſtle of ſpeaking; whereat it has been the ſilence of thinking that has done the buſineſs. Thus it has been ſaid, that becauſe there has been no horrid battle, there was neceſſity for ſo ſtrong an army. But it was the diſplay of ſo ſtrong an army, that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered unneceſſary any thing but the diſplay of it.</p>
               <p>It ſtruck me greatly, to hear it obſerved, when the army was in the country and all was ſubmiſſion—"What an abject cowardly ſet theſe inſurgents are? was it worth while to make this parade for ſuch a ſet of poltroons? they have not given us the ſatisfaction of the ſlighteſt reſiſtance. Have we marched all this diſtance, to meet none of them in arms?" I have ſeen the waves, when they were calm, and I have wondered that they ever could be wrought into a ſtorm to ſhipwreck navies. Let my fellow citizens on the eaſt of the mountain, be as happy as I am, that they met with no reſiſtance. The rage of the foreſt would have been more awful than its ſolitude. Be not offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that I am partial to the ſpirit of theſe people; they are yourſelves; you have them for your compatriots againſt a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon foe; and I will pledge myſelf, they will not diſgrace you in any enterpriſe it may be neceſſary to undertake, for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our republic, however during and hazardous it may be.</p>

               <p>HAVING given this detail of incidents, during the heat of the inſurrection; I ſhall now revert a little, and take a view of the hiſtory of exciſe laws in the weſtern country, from their firſt exiſtence, down to the cataſtrophe that has late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken place.</p>
               <p>By an act of September 25th, 1756, under the then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Pennſylvania, a duty had been laid in the nature of an exciſe, on "all rum, brandy, or other ſpirits ſold, drawn, or bartered under the quantity of 70 gallons, and on all wine in like manner under one hogſhead." This duty was for the purpoſe of redeeming certain bills to the amount of 30,000l. iſſued on the credit of the province, and was to continue for the ſpace of ten years; but by other acts, and for other purpoſes, was from time to time continued. An act of March 21ſt, 1772, was for a like purpoſe of redeeming bills of credit, and was in force at the commencement of the revolution. By a clauſe of this act, "wine, rum, brandy, and other ſpirits made or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilled from the natural products of this province, for the private uſe of the owner, are excepted."</p>
               <p>By an act of February 18th, 1777, under the commonwealth, the duties payable under former acts are made recoverable, and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028332_0203_0FD8980432C3CDC8"/>
the collectors continued; and where no collection exiſted, it is directed that ſuch be appointed.</p>
               <p>Collectors were appointed in the weſtern country from time to time, but no attempt made by any of them, that I can trace, to collect the duties. It was thought to be an ignominious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; the name of an exciſe was odious. Whence the origin of this prejudice? Doubtleſs from the dominions of Great Britain. This country is peopled by emigrants from North Britain and Ireland. The exciſe duties of thoſe countries are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive, they embrace almoſt every object of conſumption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the people are in the habit of eluding them by every means poſſible. They hate exciſe officers, and conſider them as men having a diſtinct intereſt from that of the community. The government itſelf ſeems to conſider them in ſome degree in that point of view, for by ſtatutes <note n="*" place="bottom">14. George III. C. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Blackſtone. 176.</note>, and prohibited under the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of 100l. from intermedling in elections, by perſuading or diſſuading any voter <note n="‡" place="bottom">1. Blackſtone. 179.</note>. The law guards againſt them as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to liberty, not only from their numbers and influence, but from the intereſt which they have to increaſe the duties. Amongſt the common people there is a horror of them, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on account of the drawback which they make, but on account of the power which they have to enter houſes, to ſearch, and make ſeizures. The term gauger, is a term of reproach, and no perſon who can make out to live in a reputable way will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the office; the gauger and the hangman are generally coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in idea. The people from theſe countries brought theſe impreſſions with them, when they came to America; and attach the ſame odium to exciſe laws and exciſe officers here, which they were accuſtomed to entertain before their emigration. Independent of theſe abſtract prejudices, the people of the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern country not having a market for their grain, had recourſe to the diſtillation of it; and under the acts, all beyond what was for private uſe, was liable to the duties. Thus it became ſtill more an object to evade the law, or oppoſe it.</p>
               <p>The council of the ſtate finding that from the prevailing odium in the weſtern country, no perſon could be got to accept the office, or if appointed, would not offend their neighbours by any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry on the ſubject of the duties, commiſſioned in the year 1783.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028332_0204_0FD89805CEBBC638"/>
a certain William Graham, to be collector general on the weſt of the mountains. His neceſſitous circumſtances had induced him to accept the office. He had kept the king of Pruſſia tav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern in the city, but had fallen through, and was reduced to poverty. He entered upon his office in the weſtern country; and was treated with all poſſible indignity. He was not conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as company for any perſon of character. He was unable to carry the law into effect, but occaſionally got a little money to bear his expences, by compounding with individuals, who, rather than be troubled with him, were diſpoſed to give ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. With ſome he compounded for 40 ſhillings per annum; with others for leſs. The people had occaſionally amuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at his expence, ſingeing his wig, cutting the tail of his horſe, putting coals in his boots, and every other imaginable prank they could deviſe. In the year 1784, in the county of Weſtmoreland, at the time of the holding a court at that place, he was beſieged in a public houſe a whole night, by perſons who affected to be about to kill him, he had his piſtols with him, and kept the door, and hindered thoſe within getting out. In the morning theſe laſt pretended their horſes had gone off in the night, with their ſaddle-bags and money, and brought ſuits againſt the collector for falſe impriſonment and damages. He informed againſt thoſe who he conceived had been on the outſide of the houſe; and proſecutions were inſtituted, and removed into the ſupreme court. On trial in the year 1785, he was found to have been deceived by ſome of thoſe on the outſide paſſing themſelves for different perſons; ſo that having ſworn againſt individuals who were perſonated, but were not there, the <hi>alibi</hi> was proved, and his oath diſcredited with regard to others who really were preſent and active in the outrage.</p>
               <p>In the ſame year, 1784, after the riot, at the ſeat of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment in Weſtmoreland, advertiſements were publickly put up, offering a reward for his ſcalp. He was under the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of abandoning Weſtmoreland, and took refuge in the county of Waſhington. In the neighbourhood of Croſs creek, in that county, he was openly attacked by a mob of upwards of an hundred perſons, and was ſhaved, and had his hair cut off, and was conducted and put over the Monongahela into Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland, with threats of death if he returned to the Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſide of the river any more. At a court of oyer and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner held in the county, in the year 1785, bills of indictment having been found againſt 12 of the rioters, they were convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fined. Graham had been abſent from the country in the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028332_0205_0FD885596824B008"/>
mean time, but in order to give teſtimony at the trials, he had attended, and it was only by coming in company with the judges, that he could think himſelf ſafe. He now reſigned his office, and others were appointed, who made a jeſt of doing nothing. A juſtice of the peace, of the name of Craig, in Waſhington county, had accepted the office, in good earneſt, and made attempts to do ſomething, and became infamous.</p>
               <p>I am diſpoſed to believe the duty was not collected in a ſingle inſtance, on ſpirits diſtilled in the country. At Greenſburgh, the ſeat of juſtice of Weſtmoreland, I have heard of liquors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeized, that had been brought acroſs the mountain, the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners having neglected to take out permits, agreeably to law. But in that caſe one half of the liquors was forfeited to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former; this was the great ſpring of attention to the law, but theſe ſeizures were conſidered as ſavouring of rigour, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reputable.</p>
               <p>A ſeizure of a quantity of liquors was made in the town of Pittſburgh, in the year 1790, by a collector of the name of Hunter. I appeared for the owners, before the juſtices, to whom an appeal by law was given, and had the ſeizure deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be illegal, ſucceeding more perhaps on the odiouſneſs of the act itſelf, than of ſtrictneſs in law.</p>
               <p>An attempt was made by collector Hunter to carry the law into operation againſt the diſtillers of Allegheny county, who had not paid the duties on the ſpirits diſtilled; having advertiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his place of reſidence in Pittſburgh, and demanded a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the law, he directed a number of writs to be iſſued, to the amount of 70; theſe were ſerved, but the defendents appearing and employing counſel, had the writs craſhed, on the ground of improper proceſs, a capias having iſſued inſtead of a ſummons, whereas on a penal ſtatute, bail is not demandable. In this there might have been ſome queſtion, as the capias might have been iſſued with directions to accept appearance. However, the odiouſneſs of the law gave a favourable leaning to relieve from its rigour. The popular odium againſt the collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was ſo great, that he left the county, and reſigned his office, or ceaſed to exerciſe it. Prothonotary Briſon was ſuppoſed to have encouraged him in the attempt to carry the law into effect, and a degree of od<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To theſe reſolutions, carried by a majority of 36, there was a diſſent of 11 members; not on the principle of juſtifying an exciſe ſyſtem, but on that of the impropriety of the ſtate legiſlature interfering in the deliberations of the fed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral government.

Marſhall thought, that the people being in the habit of paying, would not be diſſatisfied at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of a light direct tax; and there were great public ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to be accompliſhed; opening roads, clearing rivers, &amp;c. I thought Marſhall right at the time, and Ryerſon, who differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him, wrong. But Ryerſon had the popular ſide, the keeping clear of paying of money, and he run Marſhall down; ſo that at the next election he was left out.</p>
               <p>When the vote of Ryerſon was announced, in the caſe of the reſolutions, Marſhall, in his turn, came forward againſt Ryer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. He became a leader in the oppoſition to the exciſe law. It may eaſily be ſuppoſed, that Ryerſon was left out at the next election.</p>

The reſolutions and the reaſons were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the Pittſburgh Gazette, of March 1791, and read and commented on at all public meetings and places.</p>
               <p>David Bradford, who had not, before this time, interfered in political affairs, came forward, in an open and direct man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to arraign the law. Whether for the ſake of popularity, or from a perſonal pique againſt Thomas Scott, the ſitting mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Congreſs, who had voted for the law, or againſt Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Addiſon, who, at this time, came forward, in the Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh Gazette, with a ſtrong publication in favour of it; or whether it was, that he conceived it would drain the country of circulating caſh, and injure the profeſſion of the law, or on general principle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, I declare myſelf at a loſs to ſay. But it would ſeem to me, that he had not reach of mind, nor infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſufficient, to entertain objections, on elementary princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, of its being a tax on domeſtic manufacture, and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as introducing that principle extendible to any length.</p>
               <p>William Findley, of Weſtmoreland, who had been ſeveral years in the legiſlature of Pennſylvania, and had meditated no blow at the exciſe law of Pennſylvania, was now of the houſe of repreſentatives in Congreſs, and ſaw great evils in that of

the United States. He fell back amongſt the people, with all his weight, to reprobate it.</p>
               <p>Smiley, of Fayette, alſo, then a member of the houſe of repreſentatives in Congreſs, and who alſo had been of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature of Pennſylvania ſeveral years, having voted with Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley in the oppoſition, returning to his county, added his influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to fix, if any thing was neceſſary, the rivets of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice more ſtrongly againſt the law.</p>
               <p>But if theſe had all been quieſcent, the prejudice was, of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, irreſiſtible. Had they attempted to reconcile the people to the law, they would have been inſtantly unpopular, and have deſcended to the level whence they roſe. It was not any thing celeſtial in the form or talents of theſe men, that made them popular; it was their ſtanding with a party, and conſulting the prejudices of the people. The moment they oppoſed the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the multitude, they were damned, with them, to a lower bed than thoſe whom they had never favoured. But it was not enough for them even to be ſilent; they were charged publicly, in the gazette, with their unpardonable inattention, while members of the legiſlature of Pennſylvania, in having ſuffered an exciſe law to exiſt in the government. They were under the neceſſity of acknowledging it to have been a great o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſight; to atone for which, they would have the ſtate exciſe taken away, and would redouble their diligence in having that of the United States repealed alſo. The ſtate exciſe law was repealed at the next ſeſſion of the legiſlature, the September following; and nothing now remained, but to have that of the United States repealed alſo. Findley and Smiley muſt do, at leaſt ſeem to be doing, ſomething, in order to keep their ſeats at the next election. Perhaps the men may have acted on the ſame principle with the people, viz. from an abſolute diſlike of it, and prejudice againſt it. I only ſtate grounds of conduct, which would be ſufficient with me, to account for their oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, independent of the abſtract principle, of any inconſiſtency in the law with equality of tax, or principles of liberty.</p>
               <p>Alexander Addiſon, who had come forward at an early peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, in defending, or at leaſt in apologizing for the law, though poſſeſſing an independent ſituation, yet was ſhortly obliged to take in his ſails, and ſlacken courſe. He would ſoon have ceaſed to have been regarded, in all he could ſay to a jury in his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and his perſon itſelf would have been inſecure, in his rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the circuit, had he perſiſted.</p>
               <p>Such had been the ſtate of things, and ſituation of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,

when general Neville, ſhortly after the paſſing the act, had accepted the office of inſpector, for the ſurvey compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the four Pennſylvania counties on the weſt of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and that of Bedford on the eaſt.</p>

But he had been a member of the legiſlature of Pennſylvania, when the reſolutions againſt the exciſe law were moved and carried. He had abſented himſelf from the houſe when the vote was taken; and this conduct was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards attributed, to his having previouſly looked forward to an appointment under the law. The circumſtance of a man, whom the people have ſent forward in a legiſlative capacity, looking out for a profitable office, that he may retire, has, at all times, an appearance of ſelfiſhneſs; and introduces the ſuſpicion, of having himſelf more in view than the public. If that man is already wealthy, and has no need of offices, as was the caſe with general Neville, it increaſes the charge of covetouſneſs, and accumulates the odium of his conduct. Had general Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville ſtood forward in the houſe, and, on the local ground of the unequal operation of the tax to the weſtern country, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the reſolutions of the houſe; (and I am clear, they had a right to inſtruct their ſenators, as immediately appointed by them); if he had, I ſay, acted this part, and, after the law had paſſed, had pointed out to the government, ſome firm and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable character, in the weſtern country, whom he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to accept the office, and have returned home, free from all ſuſpicion of intereſted motives, to recommend an acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to the law, and to ſupport the officer as far as he could individually, he would have acted the part of a patriot. As the caſe was, he contributed to fix the odium of the office more deeply in the minds of the people, by the circumſtances under which he took it.</p>

               <p>I HAD been employed as counſel in defending the rioters on the indictments, at the proſecution of Graham, the ſtate collector of exciſe. It is to be preſumed that I had been of the ſame opinion with my clients, that exciſe laws were odious, and that an honeſt fellow ought not to be ſeverely treated, who had done nothing more, than to ſhave the under hairs from the head of an exciſe man, who wore a wig at any rate. I had appeared for the ſeventy diſtillers that were ſued in Allegheny county, and in defending them, was led unavoidably to avail myſelf of arguments drawn from the odious nature of the exciſe laws, as a ground of ſtrict conſtruction againſt their operation. I was thought by the people to be ſtaunch againſt all exciſes. I did not like much to loſe my character in this reſpect, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed could I well afford it. I had been at the head of the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice at the bar in the year 1786, when, in order to accompliſh a particular purpoſe, the obtaining a new county, comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pittſburgh, I procured myſelf to be elected to the legiſlature of the ſtate; the members of the ſurrounding counties, out of which the new county muſt be taken, were of courſe oppoſed to a diſmemberment, and was under the neceſſity of making friends elſewhere. There were two parties at that time, in the houſe, known under the name of conſtitutional and anticonſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional. The w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

They were 9 to 1 againſt me; Findley was at the head of them, and I had thought to have defended myſelf by writing, but only made the matter worſe, for the people thought it impoſſible, that plain ſimple men could be wrong, and a profane lawyer right.</p>
               <p>Another circumſtance had taken place during the ſeſſion, which accumulated odium upon me; that was the calling a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention to new model the federal government. I ſupported that meaſure; and when the convention had ſat and publiſhed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,

My charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was totally gone with the populace. My practice was loſt; and James Roſs and David Bradford and others, whom I left at the bar juſt beginning, got it all.

It was the firſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I had ever had in life, of unpopularity, and I found it a thing more painful to ſuſtain, and more difficult to remove, than I had thought it to be. Had I poſſeſſed an independent fortune I would have cared leſs about it; but I had juſt laid the foundation of making ſomething, by the practice I had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and this was now taken from me. It is aſtoniſhing what an effect political character has upon profeſſional ſucceſs. It was not to be expected under theſe circumſtances, let my ſentiments have been what they might, that I would have come forward as the champion of government, in the caſe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe law. It would have been excuſable, had I taken ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the popular gale, having been ſo long becalmed or detained by head winds, where I lay.

It is true, that the exciſe paid by the country, would be that only on ſpirits conſumed in it. But even in the caſe of exports, the exciſe muſt be advanced, in the firſt inſtance, by the diſtiller, and this would prevent effectually, all the poorer par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028332_0212_0FD898111BA78F30"/>
a view to reach unſettled lands, which all around us have been purchaſed by ſpeculating men, who kept them up, in large bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and obſtructed the population of the country. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, I was ſhackled by my connections; the party to which I belonged in the legiſlature, and who had finally enabled us to ſucceed in obtaining a county, were rather on the ſide of the funding ſyſtem, and exciſe law. Thomas Scott of Waſhington, was a friend of mine, and he had voted for the law. Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Addiſon had ſupported it in the public paper, and he was a friend of mine. I had been upon ſuch terms with the Neville connection, that it was diſagreeable to me, to come forward ſtrongly in oppoſition to the law, when the head of that houſe was the officer for carrying the law into execution. Moreover, Findley, Smiley, and others, my political enemies, had come forward to reprobate the law. I did not like to be oſtenſibly in the ſame party with them; beſides in my gazette writings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Findley and others, I had treated with ſuch ridicule the arts of ſeeking popular favour, that I was afraid of being ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of that myſelf. Had it not been for theſe circumſtances, I am perſuaded I ſhould have come forward againſt the law more than I have done; and have given my adverſaries much greater preſumption of having contributed to the inſurrection, than exiſts, as things now are. If I had not been ſhackled by the terms on which I was with the Neville connection particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularly, it is not improbable that I might have exerciſed at leaſt attempts at wit, at the expence of the officer or the office; and exciſe duties might have been ſung here, as Wood's half pence in Ireland. And I know well that if any other had been the officer, there is no man would have enjoyed it more than gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Neville. But if I had written ever ſo much in the way of wit or invective, it would be abſurd to charge me with the acts of others; for the diſtinction is infinite between conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and unconſtitutional oppoſition. A man has a right to arraign the policy of a law as well after it is enacted, in order to procure a repeal, as before, in order to prevent the enacting it.</p>

               <p>Agreeably to the above reſolutions, diſtrict elections had tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en place through the greateſt part of the four counties, and the members from the diſtricts having met at the ſeat of juſtice, choſe deputies to meet in a general committee, on the firſt Tueſday of September, at Pittſburgh.</p>
               <p>At the meeting of the diſtrict members, in the town of Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, on the 23d of Auguſt, delegates were choſen to the general meeting, and certain reſolutions were adopted, of a violent nature, with regard to the law in queſtion <note n="*" place="bottom">Any perſon, who has accepted, or may accept an office under Congreſs, in order to carry it into effect, ſhall be conſidered as inimical to the intereſt of the country; and it is recommended to the citizens of Waſhington coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to treat every perſon who has accepted, or who may accept hereafter, any ſuch office, with contempt, and abſolutely to refuſe all kind of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or intercourſe with the officers, and to withhold from them all aid, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, or comfort.</note>.</p>
               <p>James Marſhall, whoſe firſt ſpring in this buſineſs, might, in ſome degree, have been his conteſt with Ryerſon, but who doubtleſs had the ſame general impreſſions with the others, had been at Pittſburgh occaſionally, having, at that time, a contract with the public, for the purchaſe of horſes for the waggons of the army, had converſed with me on the ſubject of the exciſe law; and finding my ſentiments in uniſon with his, not only with regard to the exciſe law, but the funding ſyſtem in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, expreſſed a wiſh that I would come forward, and get my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf elected a member from Allegheny county. I declined it, on the ground of having ſuffered in practice, not only from the obloquy againſt me, but the impreſſion the people had, that I made political ſubjects more the object of my attention than law. This was true; but the chief reaſons why I did not come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, were thoſe I have before aſſigned. Marſhall excuſed me; but thought I could have no objections to aſſiſt in drawing up the addreſſes propoſed to the public, or to the repreſentatives in Congreſs. L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>James Marſhall was a man for whom I had all along enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained reſpect. When I came to this country, in the year 1781, a ſtrong party exiſted in favour of the eſtabliſhment of a new ſtate, comprehending the Pennſylvania and Virginia counties. Marſhall was county lieutenant of Waſhington, and had exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf greatly in oppoſition to this meaſure. I was with him, in all endeavours to compoſe the country, and eſtabliſh
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028332_0215_0FD8981AB7899720"/>
the Pennſylvania juriſdiction. This produced an intimacy. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his lieutenancy he was ſheriff of the county, and diſcharged this office with general approbation, from the court, the bar, and the country. During my political debates with Findley, and others, he had leaned in my favour, to a certain extent; I had believed, from perſonal engagements. When a member of the convention, for the purpoſe of adopting the federal conſtitution, he was the moſt moderate of all the antifederaliſts, and refuſed to ſign the proteſt, as reaſons were alledged in it which did not weigh with him. I had flattered myſelf, with thinking that my opinion and repreſentations, in favour of the conſtitution, had contributed to make him moderate; for he is naturally a demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat, perhaps in the extreme. At the loweſt ebb of my popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, he was willing to ſerve me in my practice; and did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute conſiderably to reſtore it. In the difference between him and Ryerſon, I could not take part, becauſe I was friendly to both.</p>
               <p>I ſtate theſe things, in order to explain the ſtanding on which I was, at this time, with Marſhall.</p>
               <p>The committee met at Pittſburgh, on the 7th of September. Agreeably to my engagement to Marſhall, I had prepared a ſketch of reſolutions, and a draught of an addreſs to Congreſs; this laſt drawn with great care, and to the beſt of my ability. On the day, Marſhall came forward, with a rough draught of an addreſs to the people. Bradford alſo had drawn ſomething. Theſe were put into my hand, with a requeſt to new model them, and give them any poliſh that they might ſeem to want. I did ſo; and my addreſs to Congreſs was copied by Marſhall, and that to the people copied by Bradford. My ſketch of reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions was copied by a member of Weſtmo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>and.</p>
               <p>I was preſent, as a ſpectator, ſome time during the debates in the committee, until the papers, ſome of which I had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, had been committed to three perſons; my brother of the bar, who was then of the committee, David Bradford, and Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cook, chairman. I heard no more of them until the day after, when, being in the printing office, I ſaw the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with the printer, to be publiſhed; and I made this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to him, "The firſt draughts of ſome of theſe writings were by me, they are totally changed, rendered inconſiſtent and abſurd, and I diſclaim all reſponſibility." They had been new modelled in the committee. I underſtood my brother of the bar had alledged there were treaſonable expreſſions in the firſt draughts. I have heard of a ſentence he has quoted; all I can
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028332_0216_0FD8981C30105DF8"/>
ſay is, that he miſtook a figure for a threat, and had not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary taſte ſufficient to diſtinguiſh <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>A ſentence in the addreſs is as follows:—
<q>How ſhall we avoid it? (meaning the exciſe law)—By expreſſing our fear to the repreſentatives of the preſent Congreſs; in the mean time, by cultivating the idea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ourſelves, that exciſe offices ought not to be accepted. If there can be found virtue enough in the people, to refuſe ſuch commiſſions, the law cannot be carried into effect, and it will be the ſame as if it did not exiſt.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The above is to the ſame effect with the preceding intemperate reſolution of Waſhington. How will my brother of the bar account for the giving his ſanction to this?</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>A report of the ſecretary of the treaſury, on the exciſe law, was made to the Houſe of Repreſentatives, on the 6th of March, 1792. It begun to be publiſhed in the Pittſburgh Gazette of April 7th, 1792, and was continued through ſeveral papers. Strictures on it had been publiſhed in the National Gazette, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſignature of Sidney, ſaid to be written by William Findley. Theſe ſtrictures were copied into the Pittſburgh Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette, I have underſtood by requeſt. They were continued through ſeveral papers, at a conſiderable length; from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of May 19th, to that of November 3d, 1794.</p>
               <p>A great variety of publications had appeared, in the mean time, in the weſtern paper, on the ſubject of the exciſe; ſome of which were attributed to me, but in which I had no hand. A publication of conſiderable length, ſigned John Neville, had appeared in a pamphlet. The object was to reconcile the people with the law. It was anſwered, in a variety of publications, in the gazette. I was not the author of any. The addreſs was of no uſe. Profeſſions of diſintereſtedneſs were held out, which were thought to be abſurd, as it muſt have ſtruck every one, that in accepting the office, he could have no other object in view but the making money.</p>

                  </note>.</p>
               <p>I had been elected a delegate from Allegheny county, but declined ſerving. I recollect to have been aſked by ſome of the members whether the going ſo far could be conſtrued treaſon. I thought not. I was told by the member, that the ſame queſtion had been put to my brother of the bar, and that he was of opinion, that it did not amount to treaſon. It ſtruck me to be going to the utmoſt boundary of right reſerved by the people. On the principle of political virtue, nothing but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme neceſſity could juſtify it; it is the laſt ſtep ſhort of uſing actual force. It is a theſis I ſhould like to ſee well diſcuſſed. Gallatin in his ſpeech in the legiſlature of Pennſylvania, on the queſtion of the weſtern election, ſeems to have given it up, and calls it his "political ſin;" he would ſeem, on reflection, to have conſidered it, not, I preſume, as a miſdemeanor, cogniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the law, but as cenſurable, on the ground of abſtract pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itical virtue. I would certainly think it ſo, unleſs in the caſe ſtated, viz. as the laſt ſtep, before uſing force.</p>
               <p>In a republican government, I would wiſh to ſee an office of lucre, at all times conſidered as illiberal, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a competition for it, and to hinder men, rich enough already, to be graſping at it, while there are men in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028332_0218_0FD8982170AA4468"/>
equally qualified, who have large families, and have more need of it. When I ſay illiberal, I mean in the ſame point of view as ſervile employments, which a man of eaſy fortune may be above, and leave to others who muſt live by them; but it would be wrong to ſay, that I would not eat or drink with ſuch, though at the ſame time, I might keep up a diſtinction of ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Preſident Monteſquieu <note n="*" place="bottom">Book 13th. Chapter 10th.

His words are as follows: "All is loſt when the lucrative employment <hi>of a collector of the revenue</hi> comes to be alſo by its profits, an honourable employment. It may do in a deſpotic government, but not in a republic, and it was this very thing that deſtroyed that of Rome <note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>I think the reflection juſt. It marks a total loſs of public virtue; it ſaps the very principle, which is the love of character, and fixes in the heart the root of all that is evil, "the love of money. Surely to correct this, by attaching contempt to a legiſlator, deſcending to be a tax-gatherer, if Monteſquieu be be right, is nothing more than recurring to firſt principles, and reſtoring the republic.</p>
               <p>With regard to a different object, which was that of procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a repeal of the law, it is a different matter, and if at all juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiable, it muſt be as the laſt reſort.</p>

It would be difficult to ſay, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they inflamed the oppoſition; becauſe it would be difficult to add to the heat or flame of it. It has been ſeen what the force of it was, from the firſt. A breath in favour of the law, was ſufficient to ruin any man. It was conſidered as a badge of toryiſm. A clergyman was not thought orthodox in the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, unleſs againſt the law: a phyſician was not capable of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtering medicine, unleſs his principles were right in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: a lawyer could have got no practice, without at leaſt concealing his ſentiments, if for the law: a merchant, at a country ſtore, could not get cuſtom. On the contrary, to talk againſt the law, was the way to office and emolument. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be recommended to the government, as a juſtice of the peace, you muſt be againſt the law. To go to the Aſſembly, you muſt make a noiſe againſt it; and in order to go to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, for to keep in it, you muſt contrive, by ſome means, to be thought ſtaunch in this reſpect.—It was the <hi>ſhibboleth</hi> of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the ladder of ambition.</p>
               <p>The imagination of the people had preſented the exciſe in every ſhape, and on every ſubject. Riding through the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with a gentleman, lawyer Patterſon of Harriſburg, and coming to a houſe, he enquired of a woman, who ſhewed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the door, what quantity of land was in that farm? and who the owner was? She declined anſwering; informing him, as ſhe did not know him, he might be the exciſe officer. On another occaſion, I was amuſed with the fears of an honeſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was under great concern, from an account ſhe had heard, that the exciſe was to be put next upon the ſpinning-wheels. I told her that was nothing to what was talked of, the putting it upon night-caps. She had one on.</p>
               <p>It might be ſaid, with plauſibility, that the keeping the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the people to a conſtitutional redreſs, by reſolves of committees and addreſſes to repreſentatives, was calculated to reſtrain the people from that force which they were prone to uſe, and which otherwiſe might have ſooner broke out; but on this I ſhall hazard no opinion.</p>
               <p>An oppoſition to the law by actual force, ſhewed itſelf, at firſt, chiefly in maſked attacks upon deputy exciſe officers. The hiſtory of which has been traced by the ſecretary of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, in his report to the executive. Having no particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, relative to the incidents, I refer to that ſtatement.</p>

I muſt acknowledge this was a great error; nevertheleſs, I do not dwell upon it, as the feelings of theſe men have, in general, been ſufficiently hurt by what has taken place; ſo that if, on reflection, they are conſcious to themſelves, of having contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, in any manner, to the late convulſion, by the length to which they went, they muſt regret the not having uſed vigilance to inform the people, and reſtrain them from actual violence.</p>
               <p>There is one of theſe perſons, however, who is not hurt; but, on the contrary, affects to have been irreproachable in all things. I ſpeak of my brother of the bar. He was a leading member of the Pittſburgh committee. He was unqueſtionably a man, at leaſt in his own opinion, of great popular influence. In the fall of this very year 1791, he was a candidate for a ſeat in Congreſs, and in the diſtrict election ran againſt Findley. Two years after he ran againſt Thomas Scot. Where was he when actual violence began to ſhew itſelf? Probably ſo immerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſtudy, to fit himſelf for a ſeat in the legiſlature, that he never heard of them. He had juſt awakened from his books, time enough, when the judiciary came to this country, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them, that they ought to hang me. If I deſerved hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I leave it to the reader, whether he did not deſerve to be at leaſt choaked a little, for what he did in the Pittſburgh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee.</p>
               <p>It will be aſked, Was there no legal cognizance taken of the outrages, at an early period? As to what was done in maſk, it was impoſſible; becauſe the perpetrators were not known. No information could be made, or at leaſt was made. In one caſe, in Allegheny county, where an outrage was committed, cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance was taken, and the offenders brought to juſtice. It was in the caſe of an attack upon a certain Richmond, who had been aſſaulted, and detained by force, to prevent his coming to the court, to give teſtimony of an attack upon a certain Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who had been miſtaken for an exciſe officer. This Wilſon was a man ſomewhat deranged in his intellects, or at leaſt in a manner bordering on crazineſs, and either imagined himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and branded, tar and feathered, &amp;c. Richmond, who had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the perſons, had informed, and bills of indictment were found againſt them, on the oath of Richmond; but in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to keep him away, on a trial of the traverſe, he was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aſſaulted, and detained from the court, as has been ſaid. Seventeen concerned in the aſſault upon Richmond, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted on his information; and on trial, at September ſeſſion, 1792, the greater part were convicted, and fined. I have ſtated the above, in order to rebut the allegation, that the courts of juſtice have refuſed to take cognizance of outrages, in the caſe of the exciſe law <note n="*" place="bottom">I have heard the diſtrict judge cenſured, as diſpoſed rather to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

This is true; but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition reſpected nothing more, that I recollect, than the incidents, on the part of the inſpector general, in coming to the country; and as ſome alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation had taken place, between the inſpector and the judge, this laſt was diſpoſed to be amuſed, with a compoſition that reſpected the ground of it. I ſpoke to the printer, not to inſert it, as it might be attributed to me, as all paragraphs uſually were, by people at a diſtance.</note>.</p>

               <p>A Democratic ſociety was inſtituted in the town of Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in the month of April, 1794, on the ſame principles, and in correſpondence, as I have underſtood, with ſocieties of the ſame denomination, in New-York, Philadelphia, and elſewhere. I have traced no reſolutions, or proceedings, of this ſociety of Waſhington, with regard to the exciſe law.</p>
               <p>Prior to this, a ſociety, of a nature much more democratic, had been inſtituted in the neighbourhood of Mingo creek. The place of convening was uſually the meeting-houſe.</p>
               <p>Various principles combined to produce this ſociety. Some of the leaders in it, had been diſappointed in their wiſhes to be juſtices of the peace, or to be upon the bench, as aſſociate judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; others were harraſſed with ſuits from juſtices and courts, and wiſhed a leſs expenſive tribunal <note n="*" place="bottom">The ſociety was to have a cognizance of ſuits between the members, and they actually went on to determine in all caſes.</note>; others favoured it, as an engine of election for county offices, or for the ſtate legiſlature; others, from a deſire natural to men, of being conſpicuous. This ſociety was the cradle of the inſurrection. They did not, as a ſociety, project the firſt outrages, but they naturally ſprung from that licentiouſneſs of idea, with regard to law and liberty, which the articles of their inſtitution held out, or were calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to produce.</p>
               <p>A ſociety of a ſingular nature, was inſtituted in a part of the county of Allegheny, in April following. We have the firſt account of it in the gazette of April 26th, 1794 <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>At a meeting of the ſociety from the four counties, at the houſe of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Sinclair, at the mouth of Yough, April 15th, 1794.</p>
                     <p>Reſolve. That the following be propoſed, as a conſtitution for forming a republic, or ſociety, in each colonel's diſtrict, throughout the four coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>The articles of this ſociety are to the ſame effect with that of Mingo creek, and equally calculated to abſtract the public mind from the eſtabliſhed order of the laws<note n="‡" place="bottom">Art. 1ſt. Sect. 6th. "The preſident, council, or deputies, for any ſpeech or debates in the ſociety, ſhall not be queſtioned in any other place."</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:028332_0223_0FD89826001145E0"/>The account given me, by Mr. M'Donald, the ſecretary, or rather the apology made, for inſtituting this ſociety, was, that the people of the ſettlement were outragious to do ſomething, on account of the exciſe law, the coſts on the ſuits before juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, court expence, and ſalaries of officers; and were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to do ſomething, and had talked of breaking up general Neville, and burning Pittſburgh; and that the inſtituting a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, was thought of, by the more moderate, as a means of employing the people's minds, and to keep them deliberating inſtead of acting. Be this as it may, it does not ſeem to have had the effect, but rather to have accelerated the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of actual violence. It appears, that at the June court, at Waſhington, 1794, there was converſation, and by ſome of the members of that ſociety, of a nature with that mentioned by Mc'Donald, viz. the ſeizing Neville, and breaking up the office in Pittſburgh <note place="bottom">Art. 2d. Sect. 3d. "Nothing in this conſtitution, ſhall be ſo conſtrued, as to prejudice any claims of the United States."</note>.</p>
               <p>It was on the verge of Mingo creek ſettlement, that the marſhall was oppoſed in ſerving the firſt proceſs. He had ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed proceſs without moleſtation, in the counties of Bedford, Weſtmoreland, Waſhington, and Fayette; and in Fayette county a meeting of diſtillers had been called, at which Galla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin aſſiſted, and it had been determined to employ council at the federal court, to defend the ſuits. It was in ſerving the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining proceſs in the county of Allegheny, on the verge of the Mingo creek ſettlement, that the oppoſition broke out into actual hoſtility. The marſhall had ſerved ſeveral writs in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle neighbourhood, in the courſe of one morning. Thoſe, on whom he had ſerved the firſt, had collected and purſued him, while he was ſerving the laſt. The people left the harveſt fields, and took up arms. There was no pre-concert, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined object. It had nothing in it, but the eſſence of a mob. I attribute little to the circumſtance of general Neville being in company, or to that of a writ being ſerved in a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt field, amongſt a groupe of reapers; nor do I attribute much even to the circumſtance of a number of men being aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at a board of appeals, in caſe of fines for a neglect of militia duty, held that day by the inſpector of brigade, at Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin Parkinſon's. I reſolve it rather into the eſtabliſhed tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <note n="†" place="bottom">Teſtimony of Neville the younger in court.</note>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:028332_0224_0FD8982D3171E9C8"/>
of the country, than into accidental cauſes. Be this as it may, the inflammation ſpread rapidly. The quiting harveſt fields, a moſt urgent buſineſs with the farmer, was a ſtrong proof to me of the violence of the people. The whole ſettlement was in commotion ſuddenly. The firſt party that attacked Neville's houſe, were but a ſquad from the bulk that were behind, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, conſulting what meaſures to purſue. Holcroft, in his retreat was met at Couche's fort by numbers, who had come forward diſpoſed to violent purpoſe. Theſe returning, rouſed others, and in the courſe of one night the body was aſſembled to the amount of at leaſt 500 men, that met at Couche's fort. A committee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>as here choſen to direct the operations, and it was under their orders, occaſionally given, that the people marched. The flags paſſed and re-paſſed between them and thoſe that attempted to defend the houſe of the inſpector.</p>
               <p>From the preceeding ſtatement it will appear, that the idea of "an individual projecting the inſurrection," is without foundation. It originated on the broad baſis of popular preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. However, it may be that leading men, at home or, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, contributed by ſpeeches, or by writings to foſter, and ſupport that prejudice. I am perſuaded, that no digeſt was ever made in the minds of any one, to rouſe the people to an actual and general outrage.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <p>HAVING given the preceeding hiſtory of incidents which led to it, I addreſs myſelf to rebut thoſe preſumptions that I have heard alledged againſt myſelf, as projecting the diſturbance, or having a privacy with the counſels of thoſe who did. As to the grounds of my intimacy with Marſhal, or my ſuppoſed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy with his councils, I have ſtated every particular that is within the recollection of my mind. As to Bradford, I was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on terms of apparent intimacy; and of that I give the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing account:</p>
               <p>It is well known to gentlemen of the bar, that lawyers who reſide in a county, uſually bring the ſuits, and it reſts with them, in moſt caſes to recommend to clients, the aſſiſtants out of thoſe who ride the circuit, whom they may employ on the trial of the cauſe. Bradford, though not a great lawyer, was a popular one, and I had found it uſeful, at a time when I was ſtruggling to reſtore my practice, to ſtand well with him. I had found my account in it ſtill on, and the very advantage which I had derived, independent of any principle of philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, eſtabliſhed in my mind a good will for the man. But I was thought to have an intimacy with him, which I had not. It was in appearance conſiderable, but not much in fact; for he was not a man of much ſentiment, and my acquaintance with him went no further, that the intereſt which I had in ſharing buſineſs.</p>
               <p>I have heard it predicated loudly by thoſe, who wiſhed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve me in any prejudice that may exiſt againſt Findley, Smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Gallatin, &amp;c. that I had fallen in with them, and formed a conjunction on the weſt of the mountain. After an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed difference with Findley, I had come ſo far in the courſe of nine years, as to exchange a common ſalutation; but the firſt time I gave him my hand was at Brownſville, the morning I was going forward with Gallatin, to ſupport the propoſitions of the commiſſioners; I gave him my hand, and ſaid it was time to forget differences, and join in our endeavours to avert a civil war. With Smiley I never had any difference, except what was political, and abſtract; but I have not exchanged with him
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028332_0226_0FD8982FB6C1E220"/>
ſeven words, theſe ſeven years. With Gallatin, I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect that I ever exchanged a word, in my life, until in the courſe of our tranſactions in compoſing the diſturbance. With none of theſe have I ever correſponded; to none of theſe have I ever ſent a meſſage, nor they to me. I was never of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, or other meeting where any of them were preſent, or with which they had any thing to do. If I have not the credit of individual patronage, why ſhould I be ſubject to the odium?</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid, that diſappointment had ſoured my temper with the federal government, and that I was diſpoſed, if not to overthrow, at leaſt to embarraſs it. In proof of this, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that in my correſpondence with ſome gentlemen of Philadelphia, ſome years ago, I expreſſed chagrin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ith the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral party in the ſtate, and ſaid they would find he effect of having affronted me. It is true I was chagrined, and did write to this effect. Let me explain it. It has been ſeen that while a member of the legiſlature of Pennſylvania, in the year 1787, I had found it neceſſary to join myſelf to a party. This was diſtinguiſhed, at the time, by the name of anticontitutional, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thoſe oppoſed to the frame of government, which Pennſylvania had adopted. Having ſtood firmly in the houſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ith thoſe, on all queſtions, I had become obnoxious to the oppoſite. It was the anticonſtitionaliſts that brought forward the bill for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention to reviſe the federal government; the model framed by this convention was ſupported by the party in the houſe, to which I was attached. On my return from the legiſlature, I became the advocate for it in the weſtern country; I fought a hard battle in its favour, until it was adopted. The election for the firſt repreſentatives was to be general through the ſtate, and not by diſtricts. In order to frame a ticket, two diſtinct conventions were held at Lancaſter and Harriſburgh; that at Lancaſter was the federal, as it was called, or the intereſt to which I had been attached. Findley, who had been my adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, was to be taken up, as it was underſtood, by the Harris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, or antifederal ticket. It ſtruck me to have my name brought forward in the federal ticket, in oppoſition to him. I procured a delegation from the four counties of two gentlemen who attended at the Lancaſter convention, and preſented my name. It was rejected. I felt the indignity, and conſidered myſelf as abſolved from all engagement to the party, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed myſelf to this effect. But that had nothing to do either with my attachment to individuals, or to the government itſelf, that had been eſtabliſhed. My reſentment reſpected merely
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028332_0227_0FD89831461BFED0"/>
the party in the ſtate, and nothing elſe. It had been no object with me to be a repreſentative. I had cared nothing about it. But merely on a principle of oppoſition to my adverſaries, I had ſuffered my name to be carried forward; and that being the caſe, I was affronted to have it thrown aſide. I felt it with ſenſibility until I came to underſtand how it took place; viz. that it was not on the ground of perſonal diſreſpect to me, but on that Thomas Scott, whom they took in my place, being leſs exceptionable at the time, with their adverſaries; and of courſe his name vould ſerve the ticket more.</p>

               <p>General Morgan, with a corps of 800, enliſted out of the militia that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pport the laws, until every ſymptom of oppoſition had diſappeared. In addition to this body of troops, a corps of calvary was raiſed from the country itſelf. This body of men was ſtationed on the Monongehela, at the diſtance of 14 miles from Pittſburgh. Officers from this encampment were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in town. Unfavourable impreſſions ſtill exiſted amongſt them with regard to me. Threats of aſſaſſination were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently made; but I was under no apprehenſion now. They were not ſure that the government conſidered me as a man that might juſtifiably be murdered. Ideas, nevertheleſs, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with regard to the force of the civil authority; of courſe there was great licence of conduct in ſome of thoſe officers. They were noiſy in taverns—late in their patroles through the ſtreets; the cow of a man, that had but one, was ſtabbed—the horſe of another run through the body. Theſe acts could not be fixed upon individuals. A waggoner diſcovering an officer about his waggon, and aſking abruptly who he was, was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted. He was fortunate in warding off the blows of the cut-loſs, with his waggon ſcrew, until he got into the public houſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uſt by, where he alarmed his fellow waggoners, who made a
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028332_0228_0FD89832B33511E0"/>
ſhew of attacking the officer, and purſued him. The officer eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping to his quarters, at another public houſe, alarmed his fellow officers, who came out upon the waggoners, who ſlying in their turn, were purſued. One of theſe waggoners was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken; two or three ſlices were taken from his ſkull, and a finger was cut off. The man applied to me: I brought an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the treſpaſs. A compromiſe took place, favoured by me, conſidering the circumſtances, and the man received the ſum of 150 dollars. The name of the officer who gave the wounds, was M'Dermot. I heard a great deal ſaid after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of abuſive language amongſt the corps againſt me, for bringing this ſuit. M'Dermot threatened inſtant death, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſhould meet me. I gave it to be underſtood, that if I heard any more of it from M'Dermot, I would have him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted for the <hi>mayhem,</hi> which, by the law of our ſtate, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to hard labour and impriſonment. I heard no more of it.</p>
               <p>An atrocious outrage was committed on a certain Balt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoover, in the neighbourhood of the town: his houſe was entered, his locks broke, his property taken, and carried away. I brought a ſuit againſt an officer, who was ſaid to command on the occaſion; it was a captain Weezley of the Jerſies. But it is alledged there has been a miſtake of the perſon, and that he was not the man.</p>
               <p>A ſecond outrage was committed by M'Dermot in company with others, in the houſe of a certain Bayard, in Allegheny county. They demanded victuals—His wife was ſick—He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed himſelf—They inſiſted and threatened—The man made exertions, and got ſomething. After eating and drinking, they impriſoned him in his chamber, made ſtrokes at him with their ſwords—threw his bedding on the floor, danced upon it—broke his tables and chairs, and other furniture. He applied to me; I recommended to him to have his damages appraiſed, make out his bill liberally, go to the camp, and demand reparation; if not made, then to return to me. The bill was made out and paid, but with many imprecations againſt me, to whom it had been underſtood, he had made application.</p>
               <p>A violent treſpaſs was committed by a captain Randolph, on a farmer of the name of M'Clure, a man greatly reſpectable; he was impriſoned in his own houſe, and inſulted by opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous language. I directed an indictment againſt the captain which has not yet been determined.</p>
               <p>A troop of calvary encamped at the houſe of a certain Reed, out down ſhade trees before his houſe, wantonly. I brought
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028332_0229_0FD898344474BB58"/>
an action of treſpaſs againſt a captain Simeſon, who was ſaid to command on the occaſion. Treſpaſſes were committed in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, in the courſe of foraging in the country. I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended indictments in a number of theſe caſes. The temper of the country was greatly ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>led at theſe indignities; and the more ſo as they ſaw the force ſtationed to be parade, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more. It could have no effect to ſuppreſs an inſurrection, if any had been meditated; this was their idea, as they expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to me.</p>
               <p>Some of theſe outrages had taken place in the abſence of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Morgan, on a viſit to Virginia. On his return the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations made to him by his officers, were, doubtleſs, favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to themſelves. He was led to believe that the ſuits were ſtirred up by the inſurgent Brackenridge. The general himſelf could not be unwilling to admit other grounds than miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behaviour in his officers, for he had ſet the example, and was guilty of the firſt breach of the peace, in the country. It was on the perſon of a James M'Alliſter, the keeper of a public houſe. In the courſe of the winter this man applied to me, and gave his ſtory. It was when the army firſt came. The man had charged a quarter of a dollar for a quart of whiſkey to a ſoldier. The general knocked him down with the but of his whip, and abuſed him conſiderably. On the ſcore of the delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the time, alledging ſudden paſſion and other palliatives of the general's conduct, I diſſuaded him from the proſecution.</p>
               <p>On the advance of the army, a number who had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the inſurrection, and were not within the amneſty, or diſtruſted the faith of the government, had abſconded. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were occaſionally abſent. Theſe were included in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation by governor Lee, dated November 29, 1794. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe was David Bradford, who had eſcaped by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hio with conſiderable difficulty. A ſmall Kentucky boat had been prepared, which was to have received him at the mouth of Grave creek; but being purſued by a man, from whom he had liberated a negro under the abolition law of Pennſylvania, he was obliged to leave his horſe and take a canoe. Deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with this, and paſſing Galliopolis, he was purſued by a party of four men diſpatched from Galliopolis, by De Abecour, the commandant of the militia at that place. He had lain all night in his canoe at the mouth of Sandy creek, and had got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a coal boat, in the ſervice of the contractor, cold, wet, and hungry, about two hours before the party in purſuit of him came up. They entered the boat, demanded Bradford, and

took hold of his arm to drag him away. He made no reſiſtance; but a young lad of the name of — from Waſhington, ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a rifle, and ſingly defended him. He obliged the party to relinquiſh their intentions, and withdraw. This young lad had himſelf abſconded, under apprehenſion from having painted the device of a liberty pole. Bradford continuing his courſe, was purſued by a captain Joly as far as Red Bank, which he had paſſed two days before. He is ſaid to have gained the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh territory.</p>
               <p>A number who had abſconded, came in, and ſurrendered themſelves to general Morgan, who diſmiſſed them on parole, to appear at the federal court, at Philadelphia. There were but two of theſe did not appear.</p>
               <p>The perſons in whoſe caſe bail had been refuſed by the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary, 21 in number, were conducted to the jail of Philadelphia, by a detachment of dragoons, under general White. His treatment was humane and liberal. A circumſtance is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the conduct of the captain, who had the charge of them in entering the city, viz. the obliging them to wear, each, a badge of white paper in his hat, to diſtinguiſh them to the people.

               <p>During the winter I had been employed in arranging buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in my profeſſion, and occaſionally collecting vouchers from individuals of note, who had been privy to my ſentiments, and witneſſed my conduct in the courſe of the inſurrection. In the ſpring, being under a recognizance to attend the federal court, as a witneſs in the caſe of the priſoners ſent down, I went to Philadelphia.

               <p>THE ſeſſion of the federal court for the trial of the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers took place on the 4th of May, 1795. Patterſon, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, judges of the court. A motion had been made at the ſpring term, juſt before, by William Lewis, of council for the priſoners, to have the trials held more in the vicinage of the weſtern country. It was not judged adviſeable to grant it. The judicary ſyſtem requires an amendment in this reſpect. Every man is liable to be accuſed, and to be under the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of going 300 miles or farther, and ſending for his witneſſes to that diſtance, where his own private character is not impreſſed on the minds of the jury, and where the credibility of the witneſſes for and againſt him is not equally known and impreſſed, is a great evil. I felt this ſtrongly in my own caſe, when the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of an arreſt and trial was before me. But independent of the advantage to the priſoners, in point of ſafety, the expence of witneſſes, at ſuch a diſtance is intolerable; it will not do; it muſt be remedied; or the government will not exiſt in the affection of the people. If I could have had a trial in the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern country, even with a jury brought from Philadelphia, I ſhould have thought leſs of it; for I could have called five hundred witneſſes out of the boſom of the country, to facts that would have readily acquitted me. But to call the tenth of theſe to ſuch diſtance, was a weighty difficulty. On a retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect it will be ſeen, that a great variety of teſtimony would have been neceſſary in my caſe, to have done myſelf juſtice.</p>
               <p>I had heard a great deal before I left the weſtern country, of the obloquy that exiſted againſt me in the city. It had been fed, and improved with all poſſible induſtry by colonel Neville, and my brother of the bar, who had ſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> the winter in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Colonel Neville was of the legiſlature of the ſtate, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good deal in the beſt company, did me great damage. My brother of the bar not ſo much; he was too violent. People ſaw paſſion. But my impreſſions of prejudice and obloquy, which were before me, did not equal what I found to exiſt. I was ſhunned by every one. Perſons who had known me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028332_0232_0FD8983FA308FE80"/>
advancing in my way, would change their courſe, or affect to ſee ſome objects on the other ſide of the ſtreet, ſo as not to be under the neceſſity to meet my eye. I was as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to meet theirs, and would change my courſe alſo, and affect to ſee objects. I contemplated the buildings a good deal as I walked, caſting my eyes to the upper ſtories of the houſes. A ſtranger would have thought me a diſciple of Palladio, exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining the architecture.</p>
               <p>My brother of the bar had left the city, but colonel Neville was ſtill there. Shortly after my arrival, I heard of his ſhewing general orders which had been iſſued by his father-in-law, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Morgan, in which an alluſion had been made to "an evil diſpoſed and profeſſional character, ſtirring up ſuits againſt his officers <note n="*" place="bottom">

                                 <p>In taking one view of this ſubject, I cannot avoid a ſuſpicion, that ſome evil diſpoſed profeſſional character, and who is an enemy to the happineſs of this country, has been buſy in fomenting differences, and urging proſecutions of a vexatious kind, which otherwiſe, from the favourable opinion of the people in general, would not have exiſted.</p>

                  </note>." A day or two after, theſe orders appeared in the gazette. As the alluſion would undoubtedly be applied to me by the public mind, I was hurt by the inſinuation, and could not avoid taking notice of it. I did it by acknowledging, and at the ſame time juſtifying my having inſtituted ſuits, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected proſecutions againſt "unprincipled, wanton, marauding pandours of his corps." My cenſure could reſpect only thoſe againſt whom ſuit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> had been brought, or proſecutions directed. I have mentioned the names of thoſe officers in my narrative, that others may not be wounded by the epithets.</p>
               <p>There was ſaid to be in Philadelphia, ſome who had a warm ſide to the inſurrection, and I had ſuppoſed that ſome of theſe would have recognized me as a brother, and have given me the ſolace of a little company. But a report which had originated in miſtake, or had been propagated by my adverſaries, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me even with theſe. It was that I had ſaved my life by turning what is called ſtate evidence. That the commiſſioners on their arrival in the weſtern country, found they had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for me, and brought me off with a promiſe of indemnity, and left me as a ſpy upon the people, and that now I was come down to fulfil that dark engagement of giving teſtimony to hang others. On all ſides I ſtood in the moſt odious predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament. I knew the allegation would be found groundleſs,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028332_0233_0FD89841CB5805B0"/>
when I came to give my teſtimony; for I had known little or nothing of the acts of individuals, at leaſt of thoſe who were to take their trials. But it was painful, in the mean time, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under ſuch an imputation.</p>
               <p>I was in the city ſome days before the ſeſſion of the court; and had found private lodgings. But the miſtreſs of the houſe, who was a widow lady, underſtanding who I was, expreſſed great uneaſineſs. She took it for granted that I was to ſtand trial, and did not like the idea of having a man hanged out of the family. I prevailed upon her to ſuffer me to remain at leaſt until I was about to be put on my trial.</p>
               <p>Under the predicament in which I was, I did not think it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to attend the theatre, or to go to places of public reſort. I would ſubject myſelf to the indignity of looks, if not words. I attempted to amuſe myſelf a little in the ſhops of bookſellers; but even theſe were ſhy of me. They were afraid to have it thought that they were of the councils of inſurgents. My chief walks were about the dock-yards, looking at the ſhipping, or traverſing the environs of the city, viewing the improvements that had taken place. Sauntering one day to the large build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is carrying on by Robert Morris, a Scotchman who had ſome care of the materials, not knowing me, ſhewed me every thing with great civility? I was diſpoſed to pleaſe him, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that I ſuppoſed this was nothing to the houſes in Scotland. Na, ſaid he, they wad na tirn thir horſes into it. I queſtion, ſaid I, if they would make a cow houſe of it. Aye, ſaid he, they might make a cow houſe. But, ſaid I, it can be nothing to the duke of Argyle's houſe at Inverary. Na, ſaid he, nor the duke of Bucleugh's, or lord Haddington's.</p>
               <p>The ſeſſions of the court, began on the 4th of May. I had laid aſide all thoughts of appearing in defence of the priſoners. I knew my ſtanding with the court, eſpecially with judge Peters, was not favourable. I had heard that he conſidered me as blamable; and on my paſſing him once in the ſtreet, he turned away his eye. I wondered at this, if he had read my examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ſecretary Hamilton. Perhaps he had not. That being the caſe, his impreſſions were thoſe which had been made by the <hi>ex parte</hi> teſtimony taken againſt me, by the information and advertiſements of my adverſaries. Independent of the court, I knew that I muſt ſtand ill with the jury; and what I ſhould ſay would be conſidered as the pleading of one criminal for another. Beſides all this, I did not know that I would be permitted. If I had been involved in the inſurrection, a crime aggravated a

thouſand fold in the caſe of a man who knew the law, I muſt be conſidered as unworthy of appearing at any bar, in the light of a counſel for a client. It was not without heſitation that I ventured to take a ſeat at the bar; and when I did this, it was only juſt to ſhew myſelf and retire again. In the caſes of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners or others attending under recognizance, having given him, proof was procured to explain queſtionable circumſtances with regard to the ſignature of ſubmiſſion, and they were diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Bills of indictment were ſent up againſt others, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber found; ſome for treaſon, and ſome for miſdemeanors. I do not mean to give the hiſtory of the judiciary proceedings; underſtanding that a report will be made by a gentleman of the bar who attended. I was examined as a witneſs only on three occaſions, and this was with regard to the general hiſtory of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſcenes; for I know nothing of the acts of the individuals.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of the trial it became pretty clear that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions with regard to me, as having been involved in the inſurrection, were groundleſs; that on the contrary, I had merit in oppoſing it, and quieting the diſturbance. The people began to talk leſs of having me hanged inſtead of the accuſed, and the gentlemen of the bar became ſociable; and the court complaiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant.</p>

               <p>THE Epithets of "unprincipled, wanton, and marauding pandours," which I had applied to the officers of the corps of Morgan, in my anſwer to the inſinuation in his general orders, had given great offence to the general and his army.

I was impatient to ſet out for Pittſburg. As ſoon as diſmiſſed from the court, I was upon my way, and arrived at home ſpeedily. The ſcene had greatly changed; a difference had taken place in the camp itſelf. A cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Low had aſſaulted and beaten M'Dermot; general Morgan had been obliged to put Stephenſon under an arreſt, to keep him from killing Randolph. Simeſon having ſeen writs after writs ſerved in the camp, and the troops making no reſiſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> began to think there was ſomething forcible in law, and had gone to Waſhington to ſtudy it. There were a few ſtragglers ſtill at Pittſburg, that talked of killing me; but what was every body's buſineſs was nobody's buſineſs. The thing was who ſhould do it. No one diſturbed me; and I am alive at the very moment I am writing this narrative.</p>
               <p>It having been thought no longer neceſſary to continue a body of troops in the country, the civil authority appearing in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent operation, by orders from the ſecretary at war, they were diſmiſſed, and general Morgan took his leave of us, in an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate addreſs, dated at his camp, June 3, 1795.</p>
               <p>There was every reaſon to confide in the peaceful diſpoſition of the country, for thoſe, that had remained with him, were

chiefly weak and ſickly men, that were unable to recroſs the mountain; and a fever breaking out in the camp, affected them ſtill more, and rendered them unfit for ſervice; nevertheleſs the country made not the leaſt movement to diſturb them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding every poſſible provocation of abuſive words and inſulting actions. The four battallions of militia that had been raiſed from the country were the greater part of them inſurgents, and had been amongſt the moſt troubleſome. If joining in abuſe and inſult to the people, was a proof of ſincere converſion, it exiſted. So that all things conſidered, the diſmiſſing the army at this period, was a juſtifiable-meaſure.</p>

               <p>I HAVE now finiſhed the detail which I had in view. That my information may not have been correct in all caſes; that my memory may have led me into error; that my imagination may have coloured facts, is poſſible; but that I have deviated from the ſtrictneſs of truth, knowingly, is what I will not admit. That I have been under the painful neceſſity of giving touches which may affect the feelings of ſome perſons, is evident. But it has been with all the delicacy in my power, conſiſtent with doing juſtice to myſelf. If I have done them injuſtice, they have the ſame means with me in their power; an appeal to the public. This is the great and reſpectable tribunal at which I ſtand. For though I have not been arraigned at the bar of a court of juſtice, yet from the firſt moment of obloquy againſt me, I have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered myſelf an arreſted man, and put upon my country. From that day, the morning ſun ſhone to me leſs bright; the light of night has been more obſcure; the human countenance preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing but ſuſpicion. The voice of man hurt me; I almoſt hated life itſelf. For who can ſay that I have purſued riches? Who can ſay I have been a devotee of pleaſure? Who can ſay I do not love fame? What then have I, if I looſe the hope of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation? Was I a traitor to my country? Aſk me, Was I a traitor to that claſs of men with whom I am in grade of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Would I diſgrace the praiſe of ſcience, the advantage of an enlightened reading? Who am taught to know that virtue is glory; and benevolence and truth, that alone which can aſſimilate
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028332_0237_0FD8984C430CA3C0"/>
with the Divine nature. And what greater deviation than to diſturb the ſettled order of a government, while that government remains republican? Such owes it, and ſuch to be ſupported; and any man who touches it with any other views than to rub the wheels and ſprings, deſerves the anathema of the people.</p>
               <p>If ſtrictures are made in reply to my ſtatement, let it be with moderation equally, at leaſt, to that which has been ſhewn by me. For ſhould I be under the neceſſity of rejoining, it will be with more ſeverity. I have attributed a great deal to the miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any adverſaries, the Neville's eſpecially. But if I find that after this development of all tranſactions, they ſtill go on to repreſent me as criminal, I ſhall reſolve it into voluntary prejudice, and addreſs myſelf to explain the grounds of it. I had much rather he relieved from the neceſſity, by a ceſſation of hoſtilities.</p>

I have noted the above to ſhew the rigour of the common law, and the fluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the ſtatute law of England, in regard of the extent of treaſon.</p>
               <p>The table of treaſon in England at this preſent day, is that of 25th Edward III. By the treaſon law of the United States, this table is reduced to a ſingle item; viz. "that of levying war againſt the king in his realm, or being adherent to the

               <p>My deduction now is, 1. That an immenſe ſoftening has taken place in the law of England, from what it was by the common law, in regard of the extent of treaſon. 2. That by the treaſon law of the United States, it is ſoftened ſtill more as to the extent.</p>
               <p>It will be ſeen, in the ſecond place, what improvement there has been of the common law, in regard of trial. By the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law, no over of indictment was allowed before arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; no copy before trial; no council, except on point of law; no proceſs, to compel witneſſes for the defendant to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; not upon oath, when they gave their teſtimony; no lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation of the proſecution.</p>

               </p>
               <p>By the common law of the United States the proſecution is limited to three years. "A copy of the indictment, and a liſt of the jury, and witneſſes to be produced on the trial for prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid indictment, mentioning the names and places of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode of ſuch witneſſes and jurors, is to be delivered to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed at leaſt three entire days before he ſhall be tried for the ſame." He is allowed counſel to be employed by himſelf, or if not able himſelf to employ, counſel to be aſſigned by the court; he is entitled to compulſory proceſs to procure the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of witneſſes on his behalf; and thoſe witneſſes are heard upon oath.</p>
               <p>Thus the treaſon law of the United States, improves in ſome particulars, even the amelioration ſtatute of William III.</p>
               <p>Let us ſee, in the third place, what has been the change in the nature of the proof neceſſary to fix the crime of treaſon.</p>
               <p>By the common law one witneſs was ſufficient. By 1 Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward VI. chapter 12, two witneſſes are made neceſſary <note n="*" place="bottom">"Be accuſed by two ſufficient and lawful witneſſes, or ſhall willingly and without violence confeſs the ſame."—<hi>Stat.</hi> 686.</note>. 1
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028332_0240_0FD8985144D68A68"/>
and 6th Edward VI, chapter 3d: it is made neceſſary that the witneſſes be brought face to face with the accuſed <note n="*" place="bottom">"Be accuſed by two lawful accuſers; which ſaid accuſers, at the time of that arraignment of the party accuſed, if they be then living, ſhall be brought in perſon before the party accuſed, and avow and maintain that they have to ſay againſt the ſaid party, to prove him guilty of the treaſon or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences contained in the bill of indictment."—<hi>Stat.</hi> 686.</note>.</p>
               <p>By 13 Charles II, "Two lawful and credible witneſſes, upon oath, upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>While ſuch was the proceſs of legiſlative improvement in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of proof in caſe of treaſon, did the judges keep an equal pace in favour of humanity in the conſtruction of thoſe ſtatutes? No; their leaning conſtantly was againſt the accuſed; for near a century<note n="†" place="bottom">17. Foſter. 232.</note>, the ſtatute of 1 Edward VI. was little regarded, or it was rendered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ugatory; by the extraordinary reſolution, "that one witneſs of his own knowledge, and another by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, <hi>from him,</hi> though at third or fourth hand, made two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes or accuſers within the act." Even in caſes where the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed inſiſted ſtrongly or the benefit of this act, the counſel for the crown has gone or in the method formerly practiſed, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examinations and confeſſions of perſons ſuppoſed to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices; ſome living and ameſnable, others lately hanged for the ſame treaſon.</p>
               <p>In ſucceeding trials, the priſoners have been told that the ſtatutes of Edward VI, were repealed, particularly that which regards two witneſſes face to face; "that this law had been found dangerous to the crown."</p>
               <p>When the people of all ranks and parties in England had been learning moderation in the ſchool of adverſity, light began to dawn upon them. The judges were at length brought to attend to the ſtatute of Edward VI; but gave it a conſtruction unfavourable to the accuſed: viz. "that admitting two witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be neceſſary, yet one witneſs to one overt act, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to another overt act, of the ſame ſpecies of treaſon, are two ſufficient witneſſes within the act." The judges drew the legiſlature after them in this illiberal conſtruction of the ſtatute, and by 7 William II, it is ſanctioned by the clauſe, "on the oath or teſtimony of two lawful witneſſes, either both of them to the ſame overt act, or one of them to one, and the other of them to another overt act of the ſame treaſon." But at the ſame time, the illiberal conſtructions of the judges are rectified
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028332_0241_0FD898524669F7C0"/>
reſtrained in another very material particular; it is provided by ſection 4th, that where "two or more diſtinct treaſons of divers heads, or kinds, be alledged in one bill of indictment, one witneſs produced to prove one of the ſaid treaſons, and another witneſs produced to prove another of the ſaid treaſons, ſhall not be deemed or taken to be two witneſſes to the ſame trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>Another error in the deciſion of the judges is corrected, or at leaſt the conſtruction given by them, is ameliorated by 7 William, chapter 3d, ſection 8th, by which it is provided "that no evidence ſhall be admitted o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> given of any overt act, not expreſsly laid in the indictment."</p>
               <p>By the treaſon law of the United States, a great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has been gained on the ſtatute of 7 William. The proof demanded by o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> law is, "the teſtimony of two witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to the ſame overt act of treaſon, whereof indicted." And by our act, the conſtruction given by the judges, at ſome period in England, to the clauſe of the ſtatute of 1ſt Edward VI, is rectified. The "willingly and without violence confeſſing the ſame," had been conſtrued to be a confeſſion out of court, made however caſually: this is fixed to a confeſſion "in an open court."</p>
               <p>It will be ſeen that the deciſion of the Engliſh judges have oppoſed the improving mind of the legiſlature; they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it from time to time, contrary to the natural and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane meaning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by ſubtile and unreaſonable conſtruction. But in aſcertaining the neceſſary proof of treaſon, the law of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs has corrected all this, and fixed it on the baſis of reaſon and humanity.</p>
               <p>The only queſtion now to be conſidered, or at leaſt the only queſtion which I ſhall conſider, is, What ſhall be ſaid to be a "levying war?" I ſhall ſtate firſt what by the deciſion of the judges of England, has been conſtrued to be a levying war.</p>
               <p>It would ſtrike the common mind, that the taking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to dethrone the king, or to change the government, could alone amount to a levying war; that there muſt be not only an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in arms, but an <hi>animus ſubvertendi,</hi> or intention of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing in the caſe. But it has been carried much further by the judges. To explain this, I cannot ſerve the public better, than by tranſcribing a chapter from the moſt ſenſible writer on this ſubject; that is judge Foſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is chapter 2d, of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe 1ſt, of high treaſon, on the clauſe <hi>of l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vying war, and adhering the king's enemies.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:028332_0242_0FD89853C4EF3AB8"/>"Lord chief juſtice Hale ſpeaking of ſuch unlawful aſſemblies as may amount to a levying of war within the 25 E. 3, taketh a difference between thoſe inſurrections which have carried the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of an army formed under readers, and provided with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary weapons, and with drums, colours, &amp;c. and thoſe other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, tumultuous aſſemblies, which have been drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and conducted to purpoſes manifeſtly unlawful, but without any of the ſhew and apparatus of war before mentioned.</p>
               <p>I do not think any great ſtreſs can be laid on that diſtinction. It is true, that in caſe of levying war, the indictments generally charge that the defendents were armed and arrayed in a warlike manner; and where the caſe would admit of it, the other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of ſwords, guns, drums, colours, &amp;c. have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But I think the merits of the caſe have never turned ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on any of thoſe circumſtances.</p>
               <p>In the caſes of Damaree and Purchaſe, which are the laſt <hi>print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> caſes that have come in judgment on the point of conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive levying war, there was nothing <hi>given in evidence</hi> of the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al pageantry of war, no military weapons, no banners or drums, nor any regular conſultation previous to the riſing. And yet the want of theſe circumſtances weighed nothing with the court, though the priſoners counſel inſiſted much on that matter. The number of the inſurgents ſupplied the want of military weapons; and they were provided with axes, crows, and other tools of the like nature, proper for the miſchief they intended to effect.</p>
               <q>—Furor arma miniſtrat.</q>
               <p>Sect. 1. The true criterion therefore in all theſe caſes is, <hi>Quo animo</hi> did the parties aſſemble. For if the aſſembly be upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome <hi>private</hi> quarrel, or to take revenge on <hi>particular</hi> perſons, the ſtatute of treaſons hath already determined that point in favour of the ſubject.

Then immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth another clauſe which reacheth to the end of the ſtatute; and provideth that, if in ſuch caſe or <hi>other like</hi> the offence had thentofore been adjudged treaſon, whereby the lands of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders had come to the crown as forfeit; the lords of the fee ſhould notwithſtanding have the eſcheat of ſuch lands, ſaving to the crown the year, day, and waſt.</p>

The caſes of the earls of Glouceſter and Hereford, and many other caſes cited by Hale, ſome before the ſtatute of treaſons, and others after it, thoſe aſſemblies though attended many of them with bloodſhed and with the ordinary apparatus of war, were not held to be treaſonable aſſemblies. For they were not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of law, raiſed againſt the king or his royal majeſty, but for purpoſes of a private perſonal nature</p>
               <p>Sect. 2. Upon the ſame principle and within the reaſon and equity of the ſtatute, riſings to maintain a <hi>private</hi> claim of right, or to deſtroy <hi>particular</hi> incloſures, or to remove nuiſances which affected or were thought to affect in point <hi>of intereſt the parties aſſembled for thoſe purpoſes,</hi> or to break priſons in order to releaſe <hi>particular</hi> perſons without any other circumſtance of aggravation, have not been held to amount to levying war within the ſtatute.</p>
               <p>And upon the ſame principle and within the ſame equity of the ſtatute, I think it was very rightly held by five of the judges, that a riſing of the weavers in and about London to deſtroy all engine looms, a machine which enabled thoſe of the trade who made uſe of it to underſell thoſe who had it not did not amount to levying war within the ſtatute; though great outrages were committed on that occaſion not only in London but in the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent counties, and the magiſtrates and peace officers were reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and affronted.</p>
               <p>For thoſe judges conſidered the whole affair merely as a <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

quarrel between men of the ſame trade about the uſe of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular engine, which thoſe concerned in the riſing thought detrimental to them.</hi> Five of the judges indeed were of a different opinion. But the attorney general thought proper to proceed againſt the defendents as for a riot only.</p>
               <p>Sect. 3. But every inſurrection which in judgment of law is intended againſt the perſon of the king, be it to dethrone or impriſon him, or to oblige him to alter his meaſures of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to remove evil counſellors from about him, theſe riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings all amount to levying war within the ſtatute; whether at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the pomp a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And every conſpiracy to levy war for theſe purpoſes though not trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon within the clauſe of levying war, is yet an overt act within the other clauſe of compaſſing the king's death.

Inſurrections likewiſe for redreſſing <hi>national</hi> grievances, or for the expulſion of foreigners in general, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of any ſingle nation living here under the protection of the king, or for the reformation of real or imaginary evils <hi>of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic nature, and in which the inſurgents have no ſpecial intereſt,</hi> riſings to effect theſe ends by force and numbers, are by conſtruction of law within the clauſe of levying war. For they are levelled at the king's crown and royal dignity.</p>
               <p>Sect. 5. It was adjudged in the 16th Car. 1. a ſeaſon of great agitation, that going to Lambeth houſe in a warlike manner to ſurpriſe the archbiſhop, who was a privy counſellor, it being <hi>with drums</hi> and a multitude to the number of 300, was treaſon.</p>
               <p>This is a very imperfect account of an inſurrection, which hath found a place in the beſt hiſtories of that time. The tumult hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on Monday the 11th of May 1640 about midnight. On Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following the ſpecial commiſſion under which the judges ſat was opened and proceeded upon; and Benſtead a ringleader in the tumult was convicted, and within a very few days afterwards executed.</p>
               <p>It is not very eaſy from the ſhort note of the caſe given by the reporters, to collect the true grounds of this reſolution. But the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028332_0245_0FD8985C44654268"/>
hiſtory of the times will enable us to form a probable conjecture concerning them.</p>
               <p>On the fifth of May the parliament was diſſolved to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſſatisfaction of the nation. And, which greatly increaſed the ill humour of the people, the convocation was by a new commiſſion impowered to continue ſitting, notwithſtanding the diſſolution of the parliament. <hi>And the blame and odium of both theſe unpopular meaſures were laid upon the archbiſhop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On Saturday the ninth of that month, a paper was paſted up at the Exchange, exhorting the apprentices to riſe and ſack the archbiſhop's houſe on the Monday <hi>following.</hi> And accordingly on that very day an attempt was made upon Lambeth houſe by a rabble of ſome thouſands; with open profeſſion and proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>that they would tear the archbiſhop in pieces.</hi>
               </p>

                  </gap>et out: and alſo that we were informed what was the cry among the rabble at the time of the attempt, more than that they would tear the archbiſhop in pieces. Theſe circumſtances, could we come at them, would probably let us into the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and motives for the riſing, and conſequently into the reaſon and grounds of the opinion of the judges. For if it did appear by the libel, or by the cry of the rabble at Lambeth houſe, that the attempt was made on account of meaſures <hi>the king had taken or was then taking at the inſtigation as they imagined of the archbiſhop;</hi> that the rabble had deliberately and upon a public invitation at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted <hi>by numbers and open force, to take a ſevere revenge upon the privy-counſellor, for the meaſures the ſovereign had taken or was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing;</hi> if this may be ſuppoſed to be the caſe, I think the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is not very foreign, the grounds and reaſons of the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution would in my opinion be ſufficiently explained, without taking that little trifling circumſtance of the drum into the caſe. Upon ſuch a ſuppoſition, the caſe came within the reaſon of Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot's caſe, 17 R. 2, cited by Hale. And I think too within the rules laid down in the two preeeding ſections. But without the help of ſome ſuch ſuppoſition, I ſee nothing in the caſe as ſtated by the report, which can amount to high treaſon.</p>
               <p>Sect. 6. But a bare conſpiracy for effecting a riſing, for the purpoſes mentioned in the two preceeding ſections and in the next, is not an overt act of compaſſing the king's death. Nor will it come under any ſpecies of treaſon within the 25 Edward 3. <hi>unleſs the riſing be effected.</hi> And in that caſe the conſpirators as well as the actors will be all equally guilty.

               <p>It appeared upon the trial of theſe men, which I attended in the ſtudents gallery at the Old Bailey, that upon the 1ſt March 1709, during Dr. Sacheverell's trial, the rabble who had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the doctor from Weſtminſter to his lodgings in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, continued together a ſhort ſpace in the King's Bench walks, crying among other cries of the day, <hi>down with the Preſbyterians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At length it was propoſed, by whom it was not known, to pull down the meeting houſes, and thereupon the cry became general, <hi>down with the meeting houſes:</hi> and ſome thouſands imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately moved toward a meeting houſe of Mr. Burges, a Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant diſſenting miniſter; the defendant Damaree, a waterman in the queen's ſervice, and in her livery and badge, putting himſelf at the head of them, and crying, <hi>come on boys, I'll lead you, down with the meeting houſes.</hi> They ſoon demoliſhed Mr. Burges's, and burnt the pews, pulpit, and other materials in Lincoln's Inn Fields. After they had finiſhed at that place, they agreed to proceed to the <hi>reſt of the meeting houſes.</hi> And hearing that the guards were coming to diſperſe them, they agreed for <hi>the greater diſpatch to divide into ſeveral bodies, and to attack different houſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The priſoner Damaree put himſelf at the head of a party which drew off from Lincoln's-Inn fields and demoliſhed a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

houſe in Drury-Lane, and burnt the materials in the ſtreet; ſtill crying they would pull them <hi>all down that night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While the materials of this houſe were burning, the priſoner Purchaſe who had not, for aught appeared, been before concerned in the outrages of that night, came up to the fire very drunk; and with his drawn ſword in his hand, encouraged the rabble in what they were doing And incited them to reſiſt the guards who were juſt then come to the fire in order to diſperſe the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. He likewiſe aſſaulted the commanding officer with his drawn ſword, and ſtruck ſeveral of their horſes with the ſame weapon And then advancing towards the guards, cried ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Upon the trial of Damaree the caſes referred to before in Sect. 4. and 5. were cited at the bar, and all the judges preſent were of opinion that the priſoner was guilty of the high treaſon charged upon him in the indictment. For here was a riſing with an avowed intention to demoliſh <hi>all meeting houſes in general;</hi> and this intent they carried into execution as far as they were able<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If the meeting houſes of Proteſtant Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>emoliſhing <hi>all</hi> bawdy houſes. But ſince the meeting houſes of Proteſtant Diſſenters are by the toleration act taken under the protection of the law, the inſurrection in the preſent caſe was to be conſidered as a public declaration by the rabble againſt that act, and an attempt to render it ineffectual by <hi>numbers and open force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Accordingly Damaree was found guilty, and had judgment of death as in caſes of high treaſon.</p>
               <p>But he was pardoned and ſoon after reſtored to his badge and livery, which he wore to the death of the queen Her majeſty's new adviſers did not chooſe to have the dawn of their admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration ſtained with the blood of one of Dr. Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>With regard to the caſe of Purchaſe, there was ſome diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of opinion among the judges preſent at his trial: becauſe it did not appear upon the evidence, that he had any concern in the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

reſolved, that for the reaſons mentioned at Damaree's trial, he and the others concerned with him in the demoliſhing and rifl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meeting houſes, were guilty of high treaſon in levying war againſt the queen.</p>
               <p>As to the caſe of Purchaſe, chief juſtice Trevor, juſtice Powel, and baron Price were of opinion, that upon the facts found, he was not guilty of the charge in the indictment. But all the reſt of the judges differed from them. Becauſe the rabble was trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly aſſembled, and in the very act of levying war when Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe joined them, and encouraged them to proceed, and aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the guards, who were ſent to ſuppreſs them. All this being done in defence and ſupport of perſons engaged <hi>in the very act of rebellion,</hi> involved him in the guilt of that treaſon in which the others were engaged.</p>
               <p>This man likewiſe was pardoned. His caſe in point of law and of real guilt too, came far ſhort of Damaree's.</p>
               <p>Sect. 8 The joining with rebels in an act of rebellion, or with enemies in acts of hoſtility, will make a man a traitor: in the one caſe within the clauſe of levying war, in the other within that of adhering to the king's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But if this be done for fear of death, and while the party is under actual force, and he taketh the firſt opportunity that offereth to make his eſcape, this fear of compulſion will excuſe him. It is however incumbent on the party who maketh fear and compulſion his defence, to ſhew to the ſatisfaction of the court and jury, that the compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion continued during all the time he ſtaid with the rebels or enemies.</p>
               <p>I will not ſay that he is obliged to account for every day, week, or month. That perhaps would be impoſſible. And therefore if an original force be proved, and the priſoner can ſhew, that he in earneſt attempted to eſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if enemies or rebels come with a ſuperior force and exact contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions, or live upon the country at free quarter, ſubmiſſion in theſe caſes is not criminal.

               <p>And the bare ſending money or proviſions (except in the caſe juſt excepted) or ſending intelligence to rebels or enemies, which in moſt caſes is the moſt effectual aid that can be given them, will make a man a traitor, though the money or intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſhould happen to be intercepted. For the party in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing did all he could; the treaſon was complete <hi>on his part, though it had not the effect he intended</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">So ruled in the caſe of William Greg, and in the caſe of Dr. Henſey.</note>.</p>
               <p>The caſes cited in the margin did not in truth turn ſingly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rule here laid down, though I think the rule may be very well ſupported. For Greg was indicted for <hi>compaſſing the death</hi> of the queen, and alſo <hi>for adhering to her enemies</hi>; and Henſey's indictment was in the ſame form, and ſo was lord Preſton's cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the laſt chapter. And the writing and ſending the letters of intelligence, which in the caſes of Greg and Henſey <hi>were ſtopped at the poſt office,</hi> was laid as an overt act of both the ſpecies of treaſon. So that admitting for argument's ſake, which is by no means admitted, that it was not an overt act of <hi>adhering,</hi> ſince the letters never came to the enemies hands, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no <hi>aid o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> comfort</hi> was actually given, yet the bare writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſending them to the poſt office in order to be delivered to the enemy, was undoubtedly an overt act of the other ſpecies of treaſon. In Greg's caſe the judges did reſolve that it was an overt act of both the ſpecies of treaſon charged on him. And in Henſey's the court adopted that opinion, and cited it with approbation.</p>
               <p>Though the caſes of theſe men were in ſubſtance the ſame, the charge againſt them varied in one particular. Greg's indictment chargeth that the letters were ſent from the place where the <hi>venue</hi> is laid <hi>into</hi> parts beyond the ſeas (IN <hi>partes tranſmarinas</hi>) to be delivered to the enemy. Henſey's, with much greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and agreeable to the truth of the caſe, chargeth that the letters were ſent from the place where the <hi>venue</hi> is laid, <hi>to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in</hi> parts beyond the ſeas to the enemy. As the letters never went abroad, this was undoubtedly the ſafer way of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the charge.</p>
               <p>Sect. 9. An aſſembly armed and arrayed in a warlike manner for any treaſonable purpoſe is <hi>bellum levatum,</hi> though not <hi>bellum percuſſum.</hi> Liſting and marching are ſufficient overt acts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

coming to a battle or action. So cruiſing on the king's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects under a French commiſſion, France being then at war with us, was held to be adhering to the king's enemies, though no other act of hoſtility was laid or proved.</p>
               <p>Sect. 10. Attacking the king's forces <hi>in oppoſition to his authority</hi> upon a march or in quarters, is levying war againſt the king. But if upon a ſudden quarrel, from ſome affront given or taken, the neighbourhood ſhould riſe and drive the forces out of their quarters, that would be a great miſdemeanor, and if death ſhould enſue, it may be felony in the aſſailants: But it will not be treaſon, becauſe there was no intention againſt the king's perſon or government.</p>
               <p>Sect. 11. Holding a caſtle or fort againſt the king or his forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, if <hi>actual force be uſed in order to keep poſſeſſion,</hi> is levying war. But a bare detainer, as ſuppoſe by ſhutting the gates againſt the king or his forces, without any other force from within, Lord Hale conceiveth will not amount to treaſon. But if this be done in <hi>confederacy with enemies</hi> or rebels, that circumſtance will make it treaſon; in the one caſe under the clauſe of adhering to the king's enemies, in the other under that of levying war. So if a perſon having the cuſtody of a caſtle or fort deliver it up to the rebels or enemies, <hi>by treachery and in combination with them,</hi> this is high treaſon within the act: in the former caſe 'tis levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing war, in the latter it is adhering to the king's enemies. But mere cowardice or imprudence, though it might ſubject a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in ſuch caſe to death by the martial law, will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to treaſon.</p>
               <p>Sect. 12. States in actual hoſtility with us, though no war be ſolemnly declared, are enemies within the meaning of the act. And therefore in an indictment on the clauſe of adhering to the king's enemies, it is ſufficient to aver that the prince or ſtate adhered to <hi>is an enemy,</hi> without ſhowing any war proclaimed. And the fact, whether war or no, is triable by the jury; and public notoriety, is ſufficient evidence of the fact. And if the ſubject of a foreign prince in amity with us, invadeth the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom without commiſſion from his ſovereign, he is an enemy. And a ſubject of England adhering to him is a traitor, within this clauſe of the act. Or if an alien <hi>amy</hi> acteth in a hoſtile manner againſt us under a commiſſion from a prince or ſtate at enmity with us, he is an enemy within the act. And adhering to him is treaſon within this clauſe.</p>
               <p>So if a ſubject of England maketh actual war on the king's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies engaged with him againſt the common enemy, as was the caſe of the States General in our wars againſt France in the time of king William and the late queen, this is adhering to the king's enemies, though no act of hoſtility is committed againſt
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:028332_0251_0FD8986AF41BA920"/>
the king or his forces. For by this the common enemy is ſtrengthened, and the king's hands are weakened.</p>
               <p>Sect. 13. In proſecution for theſe treaſons, as well as for that of comparing the death of the king, an overt act of the treaſon muſt, as I have already obſerved, be charged in the indictment and proved. This rule is grounded on the words of the ſtatute, which being a declaratory act muſt ſtrictly be purſued. The words to this purpoſe are,
<q>Where a man doth compaſs, &amp;c.— or if a man doth levy war againſt our lord the king in his realm, or be adherent to the kfng's enemies in his realm, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them aid or comfort in his realm or elſewhere, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be [<hi>provablement,</hi> i. e. upon full proof] attainted of <hi>open</hi> deed.</q>
And therefore it will not be ſufficient to alledge ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally that the defendents did levy war or adhere. But in the former caſe it muſt be alledged that they did aſſemble with a multitude armed and arrayed in a warlike manner, and levied war. And in the latter, acts of adherence muſt be ſet forth.</p>
               <p>But the particular facts done by the defendants, or a detail of the evidence intended to be given, need not be ſet forth in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe. The common law, as I have already ſaid upon a like occaſion, never required this exactneſs: and the ſtatute of king William doth not make it neceſſary to charge particular facts, where it was not neceſſary before."</p>
               <p>The queſtion will now occur, Are we bound by theſe deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, founded in conſtructions given to the clauſe of "levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing war?" The deciſions of the judges are only evidence of law, not the law itſelf. Where the deciſion is unreaſonable, it cannot be the law. There is a higher evidence againſt it, than the opinion in its favour; viz. the general reaſon of the human mind. Yet deciſions ought to be regarded, as the judgments of wiſe men, <hi>reſponſa prudentum,</hi> and in ſome caſes, to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as undeviatingly as the law itſelf. For inſtance, where under a deciſion, that has taken place, a principle has been ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in the tenure of eſtates, by grant, deviſe, or in perſonal contracts, which muſt be ſuppoſed in view, at the time of the grant, deviſe, or contract. It would operate with an effect, <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> to depart from the deciſion. Nothing of this can exiſt in the caſe of a deciſion on the criminal code, where it is in favour of the accuſed. The court is, <hi>quo ad hoc</hi> the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a rigorous conſtruction does not bind. It may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax. But a liberal conſtruction given, concludes againſt a more rigorous one in future caſes. Becauſe every perſon is ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028332_0252_0FD8856267578880"/>
to know the deciſion, and to be told that in the cognizance of offences, hitherto the law will go, and no further.</p>
               <p>Are we then at liberty to depart from the conſtructions giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by the Engliſh judges to the clauſe of "levying war?" I have no doubt of it, nay think that purſuing the meliorating ſpirit of the conſtitution, and of our legiſlature, we are bound to depart from them in all caſes, warranted by reaſon.</p>
               <p>Are there any caſes where the deciſions appear unreaſonable? There are.</p>
               <p>In order illuſtrate this, I firſt obſerve that a "war levied" is of two ſorts, 1ſt. Expreſsly and directly, as raiſing war againſt the king, or his general and forces; or to ſurprize and injure the king's perſon, or to impriſon him, or to go to his preſence to enforce him to remove any of his miniſters or counſellers, and the like. 2d. Interpretatively and conſtructively, as when a war is levied to throw down encloſures generally, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance ſervants wages, or to alter religion eſtabliſhed by law, and many inſtances of like nature might be given. This has been reſolved to be a war againſt the king, and treaſon within this clauſe <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Hale. 137</note>. The firſt reſolution, ſays Sir Mathew Hale, that I find of this interpretative levying war, is a reſolution cited by my lord Coke, in the time of Henry VIII, for enhancing ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants wages; and the next in time was that of Burton, 39 E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth, for raiſing an armed force to pull down encloſures generally. This is now ſettled by theſe inſtances, and ſome of the like kind hereafter mentioned. The preceeding againſt Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and his companions, was not upon the ſtatute of 25 Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward III, which required that in new caſes, the Parliament ſhould be firſt conſulted; but upon the ſtatute of 13 Elizabeth; for conſpiring to levy war, which has not that clauſe of conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the parliament in new caſes, and therefore ſeems to leave a latitude to the judges, to make conſtructions greater than was left by the ſtatute or 25 Edward III.</p>
               <p>Theſe reſolutions being made and ſettled, we muſt acquieſce in them, <hi>but in my opinion, if new caſes happen for the future,</hi> that have not an expreſs reſolution in point, nor are expreſly within the words of 25 Edward III, though they may ſeem to have a parity of reaſon, it is the ſafeſt way, and moſt agreeable to the wiſdom of the great act of 25 Edward III, firſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Parliament, and have their declaration, and to be very wary in multiplying conſtructive and interpretative treaſons; for we know not where we will end <note place="bottom">Hale. 13<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There was a ſpecial verdict found at the Old Bailey, 20 Car. 11.

               <p>I conceive the queſtion fairly open for diſcuſſion; what ought to be the conſtruction of the clauſe of "levying war." I mean taking up the ſubject, as certainly we have a right to do, unſhackled by the deciſions of the Engliſh judges.</p>
               <p>Taking up the ſubject on firſt principles, it might be ſaid, that even a ſimple treſpaſs tends to the ſubverſion of the government; and every breach of the peace is ſaid to be againſt the peace and dignity of the commonwealth. But where the treſpaſs is with numbers, and with arms, it is arrayed more formally againſt the order of ſociety, and might be conſtrued treaſon. It was with a view to ſuch conſtruction that the ſtatute of 25 Edward III, provides that "if any man ride armed openly, or ſecretly with men of arms, againſt any other, to ſlay or to rob him, till he made fine for his deliverance, it is not the mind of the king, nor his council, that in ſuch a caſe it ſhall be judged treaſon; but it ſhall be judges felony or treſpaſs according to the law of the land, of old time uſed, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the caſe requireth."</p>
               <p>It was on this principle the boundary of conſtruction was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled by the judges generally; that, "riſings to maintain a private claim of right, or to deſtroy <hi>particular</hi> incloſures; or or to remove nuiſances, which affect, or were thought to affect <hi>in point of intereſt the parties aſſembled</hi> for thoſe purpoſes, or to break priſons in order to releaſe <hi>particular</hi> perſons, without any other circumſtance of aggravation, have not been holden to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to levying war, within the ſtatute."</p>
               <p>It muſt be therefore an inſurrection which in judgment of law is intended againſt the government, to overthrow it; as you would break a machine to pieces, or to ſtop the motion of it, by breaking or obſtructing ſome wheel or ſpring that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for its operation. Yet reſiſtance to an officer in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his proceſs, by the law of the land, is but an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated treſpaſs. With a view to ſuch conſtruction, our ſtatute has provided, "that if any perſon ſhall knowingly and wilfully obſtruct, reſiſt, or oppoſe any officer of the United States, in ſerving or attempting to ſerve, or execute an meſne proceſs, or warrant, or order of any of the courts of the United States, or any other legal or judicial writ, or proceſs whatſoever, or
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028332_0255_0FD88563E6EC8DC8"/>
ſhall aſſault, beat, or wound any officer, or other perſon duly authoriſed, in ſerving or executing any writ, rule, order, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, or warrant aforeſaid, every perſon ſo knowingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully offending in the premiſes, ſhall, on conviction thereof, be impriſoned not exceeding twelve months, and fined not exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three hundred dollars <note n="*" place="bottom">Laws of the United States</note>."</p>
               <p>I would in the firſt place lay aſide conſtructive treaſons alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and confine the law to a direct attack upon the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in the ſecond place I would confine it to an attack, <hi>animo ſubvertendi.</hi> Will it not be eaſy then to meditate the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowing the government, and go on to execute it by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to a law, and by riſings for indirect purpoſes, without a poſſibility of making proof of an <hi>animus ſubvertendi,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy to overthrow? Let it be left to the jury to preſume, or infer from the acts themſelves, what the intention was; but let it always be in view as the eſſence of the act, that there was a directly looking forward in the mind of the perſon, to a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the government, before it be conſtrued treaſon. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very outrage, without this eſſential expedent may be repreſſed, and puniſhed under the idea of a riot, ſubjecting to fine, pillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, impriſonment, and hard labour. This will be more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the common ſenſe and feelings of mankind, who muſt be ſtruck with a ſenſe that the outrage is a riot, but to whom it cannot be obvious, that it was meditated as an attempt upon the government itſelf, amounting to high treaſon. It is only by deduction and inference, that it becomes ſo.</p>
               <p>There will be no evidence, that any of thoſe concerned in the attack of the houſe of the inſpector of the revenue, general Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, ever thought of ſubverting the government, or had an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea that the act would be conſtrued treaſon. Whatever the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate views of theſe may have been, who projected the taking the magazine at Pittſburgh, certain it is, that the bulk had no looking forward of mind to more than a redreſs of what they called grievances, under the government. If the conſtruction therefore for which I have contended, is ſupportable, either of theſe acts will amount to a riot only.</p>
               <p>It will be ſaid that our legiſlature, in excerpting the very words of the clauſe from the ſtatute 25 Edward III, muſt be ſuppoſed at the time to have had an eye to the conſtruction given to this clauſe by the deciſions of the Engliſh courts; and by adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the terms, has ſanctioned the interpretation. The preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſtion admits a doubt. This being the caſe, it is contrary to the law maxims of humanity, to eſtabliſh the preſumption. The legiſlature intent upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining the treaſon law to a ſingle clauſe, may not at the ſame time, have purſued the conſtructions of that clauſe in their minds. It is not probable they did. It was not neceſſary. The judges had the power to conſtrue theſe words, on principle of reaſon, with the ſame licence as if they never had been in a treaſon table of England. The ultimate queſtion then will be, whether it be neceſſary for the preſervation of the government, that the treaſon law be carried ſo for as to make the circumſtances in the caſe of Neville's houſe, or the march to Braddock's fields, amount to that offence.</p>
               <p>I admit that by the deciſion of the Engliſh judges, the attack upon the houſe of the inſpector, is clearly treaſon. For though it was not deſtroying <hi>all</hi> inſpection offices, yet it was for <hi>a purpoſe of a public nature, and in which the inſurgents had no ſpecial or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual intereſt</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Foſter. 2.1.</note>, excluſively of the community.</p>
               <p>I alſo muſt admit that the march to Braddock's field, by the ſame conſtruction, muſt be treaſon; for though the expelling individuals would be but a violent treſpaſs in itſelf; yet connected, as it was, with a view to the operation of a law which theſe men were ſuppoſed to countenance and ſupport, it will be brought to the ſame thing. But the queſtion may be made, whether it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the preſervation of the government, that theſe or like caſes be adjudged treaſon, where no evidence is alledged of an avowed intention to bring about a revolution.</p>
               <p>Elementary writers, at the head of whom is the marquis de Beccaria, have with great plauſibility, queſtioned the right of ſociety to puniſh, by taking life at all. They ſtand on ſurer ground, who queſtion only the neceſſity. By the Ruſſian code, and that of Tuſcany, it has been reduced to an experiment; and capital puniſhment is found not neceſſary. The only uſe of this at preſent, is to enforce a leaning of the mind towards a conſtruction of the law, that will reſtrain it to the higheſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of treaſon, and what alone ought to bear the name; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy to overthrow the government.</p>
               <p>As our treaſon law ſtands, it is more the intereſt of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment in point of reparation from the offender, to have the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:028332_0257_0FD8987670AA09D0"/>
act conſidered in the light of an aggravated riot only, than to have it made treaſon; in which caſe there is no forfeiture of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty <note n="*" place="bottom">"No condition or judgment, for any of the offences aforeſaid, ſhall work corruption of blood, or any forfeiture of eſtate."
<bibl>Laws of United States, 151.</bibl>
                  </note>. Reaſons of policy would therefore lead to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the clauſe, for which I have contended.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be right that is contrary to the feelings of the human heart, and at that which the reaſon of the common mind revolts. Let it be told one of theſe accuſed, that the eſſence of the charge againſt him is an attempt to ſhake the foundations of the government to which he had ſworn allegiance, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturn, as far as in him lay, the exiſting order of ſociety, with all the advantages of ſecurity to perſon, property, and fame; and to bring about anarchy at firſt, and tyranny of one or a few in the end. He would ſay, I never had ſuch a thought. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will believe him; and they cannot feel an acquieſcence with the law that would by conſtruction fix this deſign upon him.</p>
               <p>In every other crime, it is known and contemplated to the extent, what the individual is about to perpetrate. In homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, he knows he is about to kill a man; in burglary, to break a houſe; in larceny, to ſteal an article. The fact in its nature and conſequences exiſts clearly to his mind. He is under no neceſſity of conſtruing and inferring, in order to know what he is about. It is the <hi>quo animo,</hi> the mind with which a thing is done, that is all at all times to be conſidered. And if it cannot be found that the mind meant the act, it cannot be conſidered as the act of the mind, which is the man.</p>
               <p>I would therefore underſtand our law, as having in view on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a fixed, formed, deliberate intention of ſubverting the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, as that offence which it will conſtrue high treaſon, and puniſh with the loſs of life itſelf. The accuſed h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The legiſlature of the United States contemplating preciſely ſuch a caſe as that of the inſurrection of the weſtern country, has provided for the ſuppreſſing it by an act of May 2d, 1790. "Whenever the laws of the United States, ſhall be oppoſed, or the execution thereof obſtructed in any ſtate, by combinations too powerful to be ſuppreſſed, by the ordinary courſe of judiciary
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:028332_0258_0FD89877B56EBDD0"/>
proceedings, or by the power veſted in the marſhall, by this act; the ſame being notified to the Preſident of the United States by an aſſociate juſtice, or the diſtrict judge, it ſhall be lawful for the Preſident of the United States to call forth the militia of ſuch ſtate, to ſuppreſs combinations, and ſhall cauſe the laws to be duly executed. And if the militia where ſuch combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations may happen, ſhall refuſe, or be inſufficient to ſuppreſs the ſame, it ſhall be lawful for the Preſident, if the legiſlature of the United States be not in ſeſſion, to call forth and employ ſuch numbers of the militia of any other ſtate or ſtates, moſt convenient thereto as may be neceſſary, until the expiration of thirty days, after commencement of the enſuing ſeſſion." The "oppoſing the laws, or obſtructing the execution," are the phraſes; not that of traiterouſly conſpiring to ſubvert the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. So that it would ſeem to have had in view, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection for a purpoſe of an inferior nature, and calls it, "an unlawful combination," which though tending in its conſequence to overthrow the government, yet had not that for its object in the contemplation of the actors. We are relieved, therefore, by this act, from an objection which might exiſt, that unleſs ſuch outrages as theſe were conſtrued treaſon, the power of the federal government could not move to ſuppreſs them. On the ground, therefore, of the preſervation of the union, I ſee no neceſſity to carry our conſtruction of the clauſe of "levying war," ſo far as to embrace the late acts in the weſtern country within the crime of treaſon.</p>
               <p>If, in any caſe, proof can be directly made, or if the jury, from the facts themſelves, cannot but preſume that a ſubverſion was intended, it may be ſo conſtrued, but not otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Let it be underſtood, that the above are the notes of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, I had projected in my mind, had I appeared in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the priſoners.</p>

               <head>On the <hi>Expediency</hi> of <hi>Pardoning</hi> in the preſent Inſtance.</head>
               <p>I HAVE heard of a brother of the bar, who was of the militia that marched to ſuppreſs the inſurrection, and though not actually borne upon men's ſhoulders in a palanquin, in the manner of the Aſiatics, yet was conducted with ſuch ſoftneſs in the meſs of a commanding officer, as to render it impoſſible to have ſuſtained any great fatigue, or to have ſuffered much from the campaign; yet is ſaid to have expreſſed himſelf with paſſion, on hearing, that in all probability, none of the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would ſuffer death. "What!" ſaid he, "after all that I have ſuffered, none of them be hanged!" He had ſuffered little elſe, but the pleaſure of a ride, in good company on the road, yet expreſſed chagrin at the proſpect of not having ſome hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I may be ſaid to have ſuffered a good deal, and to have a better ground of reſentment againſt thoſe who were the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cauſe of it; yet I have never wiſhed any of them hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. My expreſs object in theſe obſervations is to prevent it. Who has a better right to ſpeak? I have been a ſuppreſſer of the inſurrection. None of thoſe who marched to fight, or were here to council, in their individual capacity, have done more.</p>
               <p>I admit that of all who felt pain, the Preſident of the United States, muſt have felt moſt. He ſaw the glory of his acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at ſtake; for ſhake the foundation of the government, and where were the honours of having raiſed the fabric? To what uſe had his toils been applied? The labours and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of years, were about to periſh under his own adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I figured to myſelf often his ſolicitude, and could enter into his feelings fully. His pain muſt have been exquiſite. Yet I will venture to ſay, he had no abſtract wiſh that any of them ſhould be hanged; nor has he any wiſh now. The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly queſtion will be, How ſhall it be avoided?</p>
               <p>The Preſident by the conſtitution, has the power "to grant reprieves, and pardons, for offences againſt the United States." This ſuppoſes caſes, in which it will be his duty to grant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieves
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:028332_0260_0FD8987D7448B848"/>
or pardons. Let us examine if the late inſurrection be one. It will be conſidered, that it was difficult for the common mind of this country, to diſtinguiſh an attack upon the officers, appointed to carry a law, odious to them, into execution, from that oppoſition which the officers under the ſtamp act of Great-Britain had received, at a more early period. They could ſee no difference in the caſe of John Neville, and Zachariah Hood <note n="*" place="bottom">Stamp maſter-general.</note>. The law was ſaid to be grievous in both caſes; and that was all they knew about it. In the caſe of the tea duty alſo, an oppoſition by force, took place, which is celebrated to this day, amongſt the firſt acts of patriotiſm. Could you expect an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate conception of the diſtinction which exiſts; thoſe acts being againſt laws that were void, becauſe they were unconſtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and theſe being againſt a law, which though unequal, is conſtitutional? It aſtoniſhes them to this hour, why the authors of our revolution from Great Britain, ſhould be celebrated, and yet talk of hanging theſe that were doing nothing more than oppoſing what was wrong, amongſt ourſelves. I know, to uſe the expreſſion of one or them, "they thought that in taking up arms to oppoſe the exciſe laws, they were doing God's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice." The language of humanity, then would be, "forgive them, for they knew not what they did." It is a hard caſe to puniſh where the mind is not criminal. The gradual improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of education by public ſchools, may inform the maſs of the people, and correct a miſtake of principles. The example of the people of France, ruſhing to extremes, and theſe being the ſubject of the elogium of the day, have miſled the common people here, and forms in the mind of a reflecting perſon, a palliation of their exceſſes. They have ſeen things in a maſs, and have not developed principles.</p>

I was ſtruck with a proof of this, in an expreſſion of a rifleman, who came from the camp, as we called it, to our committee of battalions on Braddock's field, and being informed that we were deliberating apart; I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, ſaid he, this <hi>way of counſelling in myſtery.</hi> I ſaw that he had heard of the objections to the Senate keeping their doors ſhut, or of the Preſident of the United States keeping his negociations with foreign powers ſecret. Yet this man, whoſe

               <p>The long eſtabliſhed prejudices of the country againſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe law, forms a mitigation in the moral nature of the acts of individuals in oppoſition to it. By the contagion of opinion and example, it was thought to be virtue. The outrage were the offspring more of common miſunderſtanding, than of particular vice.

               <p>Taking into view what has been ſaid on the conſtruction of the clauſe of "levying war," it would ſeem that ſhould the judges conceive themſelves bound on principle of precedent, or reaſon by eſtabliſhed conſtruction, yet there would be a ground for the legiſlature to make another grade in treaſon, viz. a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of the higheſt ſpecies of "levying war," on a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy to effect a revolution; from that of a particular outrage tending to this end yet not projected with an ultimate view of that nature.

               <p>Has any one been heard to ſay that the government would be afraid to ſhed blood in the caſe of this inſurrection? has any one been heard to inſinuate, that the popular nature of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the prevailing temper of the people, will render it impolitic to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

it was ſuch ſuppoſitions as theſe that put a pardon out of all poſſibility with the executive in the caſe of Carliſle and Roberts, who were executed for high treaſon in Pennſylvania in the year 1778. The Britiſh at New-York, and the tor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>es, as they were called, in Philadelphia, were ſaid to have inſinuated that our gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment would not dare to execute theſe perſons. I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at paſſing ſentence on Carliſle. The overt act of treaſon of which he had been found guilty, was the accepting and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing ſome commiſſion of police, in or about the city, when the Britiſh had poſſeſſion of it. When aſked what he had to ſay, why ſentence ſhould not be pronounced upon him, I was ſtruck with the ſimple, natural, and apparently true language of the man; viz. "that what he had done was merely to ſave a little matter of property, and he recommended himſelf to the mercy of the government." I had at that time an acquaintance with ſome of the members of the executive, and had ſaid what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to induce a pardon for him. I was led to underſtand, that the Council had a favourable leaning in his caſe; but that theſe ideas of the enemy at home and abroad, rendered it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to eſtabliſh a conviction of our confidence in the event of our ſtruggle, by hanging traitors: which would be as much as to ſay, Do your worſt; we are not afraid that you will ever have it in your power to hang us.</p>
               <p>There was a farther reaſon in this caſe; it was <hi>pendente lite,</hi> during the conteſt, and might be neceſſary to ſave from all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of force to the enemy, by any voluntary act of ſervice, during the temporary occupation of a place. But in the caſe of this inſurrection, all is proſtrate before the government. There is not a germ of reſiſtance remaining. Why kill a thing, if I may uſe a catachreſis, after it is dead?</p>
               <p>Some one may turn to me and aſk, Does it not betray a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of having contributed to the error of theſe people, and the misfortune of their preſent ſituation, to manifeſt a zeal for their deliverance? Is it wrong to manifeſt it? do I not relieve myſelf at leaſt from the charge of "deſerting theſe people". That was the rythm of my brother of the bar. Morgan had taken it up, and in his addreſs to the country, when he took his leave, talked of "bringing the people into trouble, and then deſerting them". If I had any hand in bringing them into trouble, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly I have not deſerted them; I have ſtood by them; I have made no ſeparate peace; that was well ſeen from the great anxiety manifeſted by government to extract teſtimony againſt me. I was willing to have rendered ſervice as an advocate in the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:028332_0263_0FD89886C91750F8"/>
court, if I had conceived that it would have ſerved them. I have now made theſe obſervations for their ſake; is that deſerting them? But the fact is, I have not contributed to bring a ſingle individual into trouble. There is no one will accuſe me of it. On the contrary, there is no one who will not acquit me. It is therefore not a conſciouſneſs of having in ſome remote degree contributed to their misfortunes, that prompts me to relieve them; though even from this ſpring, my conduct would be lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. It is the ſame principle of abſtract humanity with that which led me to interfere in the caſe of Carliſle. This principle is aided, doubtleſs, by that local partiality which imperceptibly ariſes, from vicinage of reſidence; but this is not blamable.</p>
               <p>The fact is, that the two convicted at the court in May, are not worth hanging, on a charge of treaſon. I do not think that two more inſignificant creatures could be found in the weſtern country. As to others, that are in cuſtody, they are of more note, but of better character; and ſhould they be found guilty, my obſervations may be of uſe to induce the public to intereſt themſelves for their pardon.</p>

                  <p>BEFORE me, Adamſon Tannehill, eſq. one of the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of the peace, in and for the ſaid county, came Samuel E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valt, high ſheriff of Allegheny county, who being ſworn, ſaith, that on the day of the burning of Neville's houſe, he was aſked by colonel Preſly Neville, and major Lenox to go with them to judge Wilkins; went, and was aſked by judge Wilkins, wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er this deponent thought he could raiſe the poſſe of the county, to oppoſe the people coming to attack the houſe. <hi>This deponent thought it could not be done. Judge Wilkins thought ſo too;</hi> but propoſed to meet at M'Lean's public houſe, and conſult Mr. Brackenridge. Did meet at the place, with judge Gibſon and Judge M'Dowell, and Mr. Brackenridge, who was aſked what he thought of raiſing the poſſe. He thought it was not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, as the greater part of the people of the county were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpoſed to join them, than oppoſe them, and it might make the matter worſe; but propoſed <hi>our going ourſelves, to reaſon with them,</hi> which he thought would anſwer a better end than force, <hi>and offered to be one himſelf, that would go.</hi> It was agreed upon immediately that we ſhould go; and in a very ſhort ſpace of time, perhaps not fifteen minutes, Mr. Brackenridge had gone home, got his horſe, and was with us at the ferry to croſs the river. After we had croſſed the river, Mr. Bracken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge aſked the deponent, whether he did not know any way to the place where the people were ſaid to be, different from the public road, as he was afraid the main road might be guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by out parties, who might apprehend us, and delay or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our going forward to the main body. This deponent ſaid, that he knew the old path that uſed to be the road to Couche's fort, which was the place; and that there was little difference in the diſtance of the two ways. Mr. Brackenridge mentioned his apprehenſions to the company, and it was agreed to take the old road. We rode with all the haſte in our power: The ſun was not then more than an hour high, and we got within half
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:028332_0265_0FD8988C408577F8"/>
a mile of the place, which was about eight miles from Pittſburgh, a little before ſun ſet; we were there informed that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had gone to Neville's houſe; we rode on with haſte to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake them, until we came within a mile and a half of the houſe, when we met ſome that were returning, and told what had been done. Mr. Brackenridge thought it not prudent then to go further, as it could be of no uſe, and there might be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the people miſconſtruing what we came about; we all thought ſo, and returned home.</p>
                  <p>This deponent from that time, had frequent converſations with Mr Brackenridge, about the affairs that took place, to the end of the diſturbance, and always knew his ſentiments to be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any violation of the laws,</hi> and frequently ſaid, <hi>the authors will be brought to puniſhment.</hi> This deponent ſometime about the middle of the buſineſs, had been out in the country, and heard perſons ſay, ſpeaking of the people that had undertaken to oppoſe the law, that if they could get Mr. Brackenridge with them, he would be more to them than a thouſand men. This deponent mentioned this to Mr. Brackenridge in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation directly after. His anſwer was, that <hi>they would never get that; he had no idea of joining ſuch folly,</hi> or words to this effect. In his riding through the country as ſheriff, he knows it to be the ſenſe of the country, that Mr. Brackenridge had never any concern in the inſurrection, but all he did, was to prevent diſorders; and they applaud his knowledge and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the times, and the policy uſed by him in ſaving the town of Pittſburgh, and preventing the country from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in war.</p>
                  <p>This deponent thinks it juſt to acknowledge, that it was in a degree <hi>owing to Mr. Brackenridge's advice,</hi> that this deponent has kept himſelf ſo perfectly cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Before me, John Wilkins, jun. one of the aſſociate judges of the county of Allegheny, ſtate of Pennſylvania, came the ſubſcriber, who being ſworn, ſaith, that on the morning pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to the meeting of the committee, as they were ſaid to be, at a meeting houſe on Mingo creek, this deponent was called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028332_0266_0FD8988D7125C598"/>
by Mr. Brackenridge, and informed that he was about to go to that meeting, and wiſhed this deponent to acccompany him, which this deponent declined, conſidering the delicate ſituation of affairs, in conſequence of the violation of the laws, which had taken place. Mr. Brackenridge then ſaid, that he did not wiſh this deponent to take any part on the occaſion; but only to be <hi>a witneſs of the part he ſhould himſelf take;</hi> and that this depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent might be ſafe in going, as it was at <hi>the requeſt of col. Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Neville, that he himſelf was about to go.</hi> This deponent how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever declined.</p>
                  <p>About the 24th or 25th of July laſt, this deponent dined with Mr. Brackenridge at his own houſe, at which time Mr. Brack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enridge appeared to him, to be under conſiderable anxiety of mind, declaring that he never had been in ſo delicate a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, in the courſe of his life; expreſſing himſelf in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terms, or to this effect: "The people are all going to the devil; they have been guilty of rebellion, of treaſon, of arſon; and I am afraid the matter is not over yet." Mr. Brackenridge alſo ſaid, that individuals had taken his opinion as a lawyer, with reſpect to the nature and demerit of the conduct and crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inality of the perſons who had burnt and deſtroyed the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of general Neville; and that he had given it to this effect.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Brackenridge, ſpeaking of the delicacy of his own ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaid, that if he did not go with theſe people the lengths they wiſhed, he would be obnoxious, and in danger; and that if he did take part in their meaſures, he and they, would all be involved in common ruin, and go to the devil together. That he was oppoſed to the funding ſyſtem, that he conſidered it as a dropſical ſyſtem, calculated to ſwell mens fortunes to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable ſize, in the courſe of a ſingle hour, and that it would thereby produce a degree of inequality in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and ſituation of men, unfavourable to a republican government; that this ſyſtem was the <hi>tabeſcence</hi> of ſenility in our government. This deponent farther ſaith, that Mr. Brackenridge, in ſpeaking of the ſpirit of oppoſition that was likely to prevail, obſerved, that to oppoſe the government, or any particular law, however obnoxious, was not only criminal in general, but highly impolitic for this country, on four grounds, viz. the four weſtern counties, from the circumſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the boundaries, conſtitute a baſis too ſmall for a ſeparate government; the country is too poor to ſupport one; it has no ſea port; and can have no importation, independent of the eaſtern parts of the continent; and finally, theſe counties are deſtitute of reſources, both in point of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

of war. So that ſhould a conteſt enſue with the United States<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the diſproportion of ability was in all reſpects ſo great, that this country muſt be finally unſucceſsful.</p>
                  <p>In conſequence of theſe ideas, expreſſed by Mr. Bracken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge this deponent, had conſidered him as a friend to the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, though oppoſed to the preſent ſyſtem of taxation, and was of this opinion at the time he left the country, which was the morning before the aſſembling the people in Braddock's field. But afterwards this deponent, having heard when at Carliſle, in the ſtate of Pennſylvania, of a letter ſaid to be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, written by Mr. Brackenridge to Tench Coxe, eſq. in Philadelphia, and by ſaid Coxe brought forward to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This deponent began to doubt, and from the reports which generally prevailed, was led at length to conclude, that he muſt have been deceived. This deponent is of opinion, however, that if the conduct of Mr. Brackenridge, from the time of the meeting at Braddock's field, until the appearance of the patriotic militia, has been as fair and unimpeachable, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him prior to that time, it muſt be a fair concluſion to conſider the intentions of Mr. Brackenridge to have been upright, and his conduct not to be cenſured; that inſtead of meriting reproach, he has deſerved well of his country.</p>

                  <p>Before me, an aſſociate judge for the county of Allegheny, John Hollingſworth, ſworn, ſaith, that he arrived in Pittſburg on the 10th of July laſt, but had no converſation with Mr. Brackenridge concerning the oppoſition to the revenue law, which then began to appear in this country, until after the ſtopping of the mail. A few days after he heard of that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, he was at the houſe of Mr. Brackenridge, and ſpoke of it. Mr. Brackenridge declared his abhorrence of that ſhameful breach of the law, and common faith, and in general terms ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his diſapprobation of oppoſing laws by force. Converſing with him on the evening of the ſecond of Auguſt, Mr. Brack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enridge uſed this expreſſion, or to this effect, "<hi>the country is now involved, and lenient meaſures on the part of the government can alone ſave it.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>Before Mr. Brackenridge went to the meeting at Parkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's ferry, he informed this deponent of his plan of having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:028332_0268_0FD8989607DCF080"/>
ſent from that meeting to the executive of the United States; who ſhould give a true account of the inſurrection, and concert ſuch meaſures as might ſave the country from a civil war; ſhewed this deponent an addreſs which he had drawn up to the Preſident, to be offered at the meeting, and ſent, if approved; expreſſing himſelf to this effect, "<hi>I conſider this as my country, and I muſt aſſiſt to avert the calamities that are impending over it, to accompliſh which the combination formed againſt the laws muſt be ſapped; to oppoſe it openly at this time, would add ſtrength to it; and ruin thoſe who are well diſpoſed.</hi>" Theſe words left an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the mind of the deponent not eaſily to be effaced.</p>
                  <p>A few days after this converſation took place, this deponent attended the meeting at Parkinſon' ferry, where, as this depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent thinks, Mr. Brackenridge purſued that line of conduct which he had marked out, before he left Pittſburgh. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the commiſſioners of the United States, during the time of the meeting precluded the neceſſity of ſending perſons to the executive. From that time, until the middle of September, had many opportunities of obſerving his conduct, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſed with him, without obſerving any thing that induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this deponent to believe that he had ſwerved from that duty which he owed his country; during that time was ſo ſituated as to hear gentlemen high in office, and more capable of judging than himſelf, ſpeak of the conduct of Mr. Brackenridge during the troubles in this country, and always with reſpect.</p>

                  <p>That on the evening preceeding the meeting at Braddock's field, the inhabitants of Pittſburgh had generally aſſembled, to conſult on what meaſures were neceſſary to purſue on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.

Mr. Brackenridge not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it prudent that he ſhould be of the committee in going to Braddock's field, and might introduce a ſuſpicion of our ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in having him of the committee.

                  <p>The deponent was one of the committee to Braddock's field, and on the route there, Mr. Brackenridge expreſſed himſelf to the deponent to the following effect, that after all that had been done, he did not conſider it as perfectly certain, that we might not ſuffer violence from the fury of the people, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the prevailing odium againſt the town, knowing that however far we had carried the appearance of a union in ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the rioters, they would ſee through the maſk, and treat us ill on the firſt approach; under theſe impreſſions Mr. Brackenridge propoſed advancing with a flag. The deponent objected to it, and obſerved that it was beſt not to ſeem to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt. Mr. Brackenridge then declined it.</p>
                  <p>That during the whole of the inſurrection, ſo far as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent had knowledge, Mr Brackenridge conducted himſelf as a friend to the government, and ſhewed great anxiety to have peace and good order reſtored in the country.

                  <p>Before me, John Wilkins, eſq. an aſſociate judge for the county of Allegheny, came Peter Andrain, who being ſworn, ſays, that from the beginning of the late inſurrection in this country, until the end of it, this deponent had very frequent
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028332_0271_0FD89898D6029138"/>
converſations with Mr. Brackenridge, on the ſubject of the diſturbances, and always found him very anxious to undeceive the people, and bring them to order and obedience to the laws.</p>
                  <p>This deponent, the morning of the meeting at Mingo creek, was requeſted by Mr. Brackenridge to accompany him to that meeting; heſitating very much, but afterwards ſeeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>olonel Neville, was prevailed upon to go.</p>
                  <p>At that meeting, Mr. Brackenridge at the beginning of a ſpeech he made on that occaſion, ſaid that thoſe concerned in the burning of general Neville's houſe were guilty of treaſon; he powerfully oppoſed, and luckily defeated the reſolutions which was to ſupport the brave fellows who had attended at the burning general Neville's houſe; he <hi>adviſed to try by every poſſible means to make peace with the government, and get an act of oblivion, and offered to go himſelf to Philadelphia, if it was agreeable to the people. The turn he gave to the buſineſs, ſaved us from the moſt delicate ſituation that this deponent ever thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in;</hi> being apprehenſive that if the queſtion had been put, and we had voted againſt it, we would have been in perſonal danger; and voting for it, would involve us in a crime. After the ſpeech of Mr. Brackenridge there was a long ſilence, and moſt of the people went out. This deponent went out with the other perſons of Pittſburgh; and ſhortly after, on the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of Mr. Brackenridge, that ſome other delicate queſtions might be brought forward, it was judged beſt to get off as ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily as poſſible. We went away, and Mr. Brackenridge with us, as unobſervedly as we could. We came to the houſe, about half a mile, where we had left our horſes; having taken dinner, and ordered our horſes, which had taken up an hour or more, it was ſuggeſted by ſome one preſent, that we had come off ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubtly, and that a bad conſtruction might be put upon it, that we had been there as ſpies, it would be well for Mr. Bracken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge, at leaſt juſt to go back, and take leave; which he did, and returned to us in as ſhort a time as was neceſſary to go and come back.</p>
                  <p>At that meeting, this deponent did not ſee Mr. Brackenridge having private converſation with Marſhall or Bradford, or does he think it probable that he could have any, from the ſhortneſs of the time we were there before the opening of the meeting.</p>
                  <p>This deponent was one of the committee of twenty-one, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by a town-meeting of the inhabitants of Pittſburgh, to carry into effect ſeveral reſolutions, on the expelling certain perſons. With reſpect to theſe perſons in any act or language
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:028332_0272_0FD8989A43DF0338"/>
of Mr. Brackenridge, at that time or ſince, in all the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on this ſubject, this deponent did not diſcover the leaſt ground to lead him to believe, that Mr. Brackenridge <hi>had any ſatisfaction in the expelling them, or acted under any private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, whatever difference might exiſt with any of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This deponent was one of the delegates ſent by the people of Pittſburgh to Parkinſon's ferry, on the 14th of Auguſt. At that meeting, in all Mr. Brackenridge did or ſaid, his object appeared to be to conciliate to order, ſuggeſting the propriety of making terms with government, and obtain an act of oblivion.</p>
                  <p>In general this deponent can ſay, that in the affair of Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock's fields, Mr. Brackenridge acted, as far as this deponent knows, with good policy to ſave the town; and on other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>to get an indemnity for the people, and ſave them from a war with government.</hi>

                  <p>Before me, Alexander Addiſon, preſident of the court of common pleas, &amp;c. came George Robinſon, chief burgeſs of the borough of Pittſburgh, who being duly ſworn, depoſeth and ſaith, that at the requeſt of Mr. Brackenridge, he went to the meeting of Mingo creek. Mr. Brackenridge had informed him that it was at the requeſt of <hi>col. Preſly Neville, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was going.</hi> Mr. Brackenridge ſaid he wiſhed this deponent to go, as being a public officer, the chief burgeſs of the town, as he wiſhed to have ſome perſons <hi>to bear teſtimony of his conduct, as the ſituation might be delicate.</hi> This deponent found the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion delicate enough, when a motion was brought forward to ſupport what had been done at burning general Neville's houſe, and which was warmly ſupported. This deponent being much alarmed at the time, leſt the queſtion ſhould be put on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that by voting in the affirmative, we ſhould be drawn in as accomplices, and by voting againſt it we might be in perſonal danger. After an inflammatory ſpeech by a certain perſon, there was a ſilence for ſome time. During this time, the deponent was in great anxiety, leſt the queſtion ſhould be put, when Mr. Brackenridge addreſſed the meeting in a ſpeech of ſome length, and as appeared with great anxiety of mind. The ſpeech, in the opinion of this deponent, appeared to be calculated to parry the queſtion. He informed them, that we were not dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by the town to do any act for them, and therefore if we
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028332_0273_0FD8989BB16BB008"/>
gave any vote, it could only be as individuals. That as an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, he woud give his opinion. Here Mr. Brackenridge ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the nature and conſequences of what had been done; he plainly told them, that all concerned were guilty of treaſon, <hi>that it would be better not to draw any more in, as they could be of more uſe as mediators with the government, than as accomplices;</hi> that the well known lenity of the Preſident of the United States, gave reaſon to ſuppoſe that an accommodation might be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, before, he would proceed to extremities; that the preſent meeting was but an inconſiderable part of the four counties; that a larger meeting might be called, by delegates regularly appointed, and that commiſſioners might be ſent to the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, in order to bring about an accommodation; that tho' it would not be convenient for him to go at that time, yet if ſuch a meaſure was adopted, <hi>he was willing to go, and to render any ſervice in his power.</hi> This deponent does not recollect particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, but has ſome recollection of Mr. Brackenridge mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>that the damage done muſt be repaired.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After Mr. Brackenridge cloſed his ſpeech, there appeared to be an adjournment, without a motion made for that purpoſe. During this interval, Mr. Brackenridge urged us to get off as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcoveredly as poſſible, leſt we ſhoud be drawn further in. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time that we were out, after the ſpeech of Mr. Brack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enridge, there was a good deal of murmuring amongſt the people, and this deponent ſuppoſes this had given Mr. Brackenridge ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and he had informed this deponent ſince, that it was what alarmed him. We went away on this, and Mr. Brackenridge ſlipped after us. As we croſſed a finall run a ſhort diſtance from the meeting houſe, we were called after by ſome perſons to come back; but we hurried off as faſt as poſſible to the houſe where we had left our horſes. While there, it was ſuggeſted by ſome of the company, that as we had come off ſo abruptly, it might be well if Mr. Brackenridge, or ſome one, ſhould return and make ſome excuſe. Mr. Brackenridge took his horſe, and ſaid he would juſt ride over and make ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. He rode over, and came back in a very ſhort time, ſo that we wondered that he could have been there and come back, and ſaid he had found them juſt breaking up. In our way home, this deponent mentioning to Mr. Brackenridge the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate eſcape we had made, Mr. Brackenridge made uſe of this expreſſion "he had never been in ſo delicate a ſituation before in his life, <hi>and he would be damned if he would have been drawn in to be guilty of high treaſon, for ten thouſand pounds.</hi>" The depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent has been preſent at other meetings ſince, in the town of
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:028332_0274_0FD8989D42513B30"/>
Pittſburgh, and heard Mr. Brackenridge's ſentiments on various occaſions, and obſerved his conduct, and can ſay, to the beſt of his knowledge, that with reſpect to the people that were expelled from the town, and every thing elſe that was done, he <hi>acted from no ſelfiſh motive of reſentment or diſpoſition to hurt any man;</hi> but from motives of policy, to moderate matters and prevent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; and this deponent knows this to be the general ſentiment of the people of Pittſburg, and they conſider themſelves indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his policy in a great degree for the ſafety of the town in the affair of Braddock's field, when we were led to apprehend plunder and deſtruction from the fury of the people that had met there.</p>

Underſtoood from Hamilton, that he had conſented to go, in order to prevent the people coming in themſelves, and doing miſchief; for there was danger of their going in, at that time.

Hamilton explained his buſineſs, returning the piſtols, and required a fulfilment of what was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon; viz. that he would ſerve no further writs, and not return thoſe that were ſerved. The marſhall ſaid, he had not agreed not to return the writs. A query was then in the mind of Hamilton, what effect the returns would have. At his requeſt, I went to Mr. Brackenridge, to aſk his opinion as a lawyer. <hi>He ſaid it was a delicate point, and he would talk to the marſhall.</hi> On this he went out, and came in with <hi>the marſhall and colonel Neville.</hi> Upon that I went out, and after ſome time returned; and Mr. Brackenridge ſaid he was not much acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the practice of the federal courts, but would conſult, and give his opinion in the morning.</p>

                  <p>Before me came Robert Johnſton, late deputy revenue officer, who being duly ſworn, ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that on the 17th day of July, 1794, being the ſecond day after the deſtruction of general Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville's houſe, this deponent, being in Pittſburgh, was told by David Hamilton, that the committee was then ſitting at the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ground, to wit, general Neville's; and that if this deponent would ride out with him, and give a reſignation of his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the committee, that this deponent would be protected from any further violence.</p>
                  <p>This deponent went in company with Hamilton, John Black, and Mr. Brackenridge. After riding a conſiderable part of the road, was ſurprized to hear Robert Shochan's made mention of as the place where the committee was ſitting; I believe by Mr. Brackenridge; which occaſioned this deponent to aſk Hamilton, where the committee was ſitting. He ſaid they were not then ſitting any where; but would meet ſome way towards Pigeon creek, to hear the report that he would make of his adventure; viz. the demanding general Neville's commiſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

David Hamilton in his converſation at this time, mentioned as the cauſe of his coming that way, that one of the men was miſſing, that had been at the attack at Neville's houſe; that he was going to ſee if he could be found; that he thought it probable he was killed. Coming to the ground where general Neville's houſe had ſtood, riding round it, looking for the man ſuppoſed to be killed, and not finding him, and being about to come away, Hamilton or Black aſked Mr. Brackenridge if he would not go further with them. He ſaid not; and then we parted, Hamilton and Black for Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eon creek, and Brackenridge and this deponent for Pittſburgh. M. Brackenridge and this deponent, went from the ferry at Pittſburgh, and returned together, without being any time apart.</p>

                  <p>At a meeting at my houſe, in Waſhington, on the evening of the 30th of July laſt, Mr. Bradford being there, ſaid he wiſhed he could get ſome ſafe hand to take the mail hat had been intercepted to Pittſburgh, and deliver it to the poſt-maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; as he ſaid there were letters in it, that had money incloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them to certain perſons. Colonel Gabriel Blakeney ſaid, he had that evening received a letter from doctor Wilkins, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting to ſee him in Pittſburgh, the next day, and that he would take charge of it, and deliver it ſafe to the poſt-maſter, if any perſon would go in company with him. I offered my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as well as did doctor Band. Mr. Bradford delivered the mail the next morning to colonel Blakeney and myſelf, there being ſome letters taken out, which was not to be delivered to the poſt-maſter, but ſhewn to ſome people in the town of Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, and brought on to Braddock's fields the next day. We accordingly went on to Pittſburgh, when we arrived there, a number of people came to the houſe where we put up, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, of us if we knew what object the people had in view, that were to aſſemble at Braddock's fields? We informed them that it was in conſequence of letters that had been found in the mail, written by ſeveral perſons in that place to government, miſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their conduct (as they termed it), and that the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them to be very obnoxious characters; particularly major Kirkpatrick, Mr. Briſon, and Mr. Day, and it was our opinion that if ſome of thoſe that had written the letters, did not leave the town, that it was in danger of being deſtroyed from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent rage of the people. The ſame evening there was a town-meeting of the inhabitants of the place, as we underſtood to take into conſideration what was beſt to be done, for their own ſafety. On hearing that we had come to town, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a committee, conſiſting of Mr. Brackenridge, doctor Wilkins, and judge Wallace, to confer with us, and to have our opinion on the ſubject. We produced to them the letters that had been taken out of the mail, viz. major Butler to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Knox; general Gibſon to governor Mifflin; Mr. Briſon to the ſame; colonel Neville to general Morgan; and one other, without any ſignature, to the ſecretary of treaſury, ſaid to be hand writing of Edward Day; which were read in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. They aſked us what we thought was the intention of the people, that were to aſſemble at Braddock's fields the next day. We gave it as our opinion, <hi>that the town was in eminent danger of being deſtroyed, if ſome of the obnoxious characters were not ſent away, for that we ourſelves had been inſulted on the road,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028332_0280_0FD898ADB49E8CF0"/>
coming there, by ſome of the people, when they underſtood we were going into Pittſburgh; for they ſaid we were going there as ſpies, to tell the people to get out of the way, and that we ought to be taken priſoners, and they actually raiſed a party to follow us for that purpoſe,</hi> as we were afterwards informed. Mr. Bracken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge aſked us, who we thought appeared to be the principal objects of the people's rage. We gave it as our opinion from what we had diſcovered from them, that major Butler, major Kirkpatrick, Mr. Briſon, and Mr. Day, were the characters that the populace appeared to be the moſt enraged at. Mr. Brackenridge replied, As to major Butler, it was out of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have any think to do with him; he being a federal offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and entirely unconnected with the citizens. After receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this information from us, they returned to the town-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gave the information to them they had received from us; in conſequence of which they entered into reſolutions to expel certain perſons, as will appear from the hand-bills pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed immediately after. We went on the nex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> morning, to Braddock's fields, with great numbers of people from Pittſburgh in company. When we came there, I diſcovered a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people much diſſatisfied, on the account that <hi>general Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and colonel Neville</hi> were not alſo expelled. I was choſen a member of the committee, which did not meet until the next morning; when Mr. Bradford produced the letters that had been kept out of the mail, and read them before the committee himſelf. He appeared much diſſatisfied that general Gibſon and colonel Neville were not ſent away; for he ſaid they were as obnoxious to the people as any of them that were gone, and that they ought not to be ſuffered to remain in the country; for they were enemies to the people, and muſt be ſent off. It was motioned for them to be ſuffered to remain until the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that was to be at Parkinſon's ferry, on the 14th of Auguſt, and for them to come forward to the meeting, and endeavour to exculpate themſelves from the charges that were againſt them; but it was over ruled. Mr. Brackenridge ſpoke partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularly againſt the <hi>expulſion of general Gibſon, by obſerving that he was a man advanced in years, and that he always had conceived him to be a man who could do little harm, and therefore thought he might be ſuffered to remain, as he was far from being a dangerous man, in his opinion. Mr. Brackenridge, in my opinion, ſeemed to have a ſtrong deſire, that the expulſion of both general Gibſon and colonel Neville, ſhould at leaſt be poſtponed until the meeting above alluded to, in order to give them an opportunity to acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:028332_0281_0FD898B0CA008FE8"/>
of the charges, that the people had advanced againſt them.</hi> It was all over ruled, and I believe chiefly through the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Mr. Bradford. Mr. Brackenridge, to the beſt of my recollection, ſpoke much in favour of allowing them ſome time to prepare themſelves to move away, upon which it was agreed to give them ten days.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Bradford then ſpoke concerning the expulſion of major Craig; for he ſaid he had been informed that major Craig ſhould have ſaid (immediately after the burning of gen. Neville's houſe) that he would let the damned raſcals ſee that the exciſe law ſhould be inforced, for that he would open an office of inſpection in his own houſe. <hi>Mr. Bradford was requeſted to give his author; he replied that he could not recollect, but that he heard it mentioned among the people.</hi> It was then referred to the gentlemen on the committee that repreſented the people of Pittſburgh, viz. Dr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, Mr. John M'Maſters, and <hi>Mr. Brackenridge. It appeared that neither of them could give any information on this ſubject.</hi> Mr. Brackenridge further ſaid, that he had but very little converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with major Craig; for he did not recollect of any ſince the burning of general Neville's houſe, except what happened a day or two before coming to Braddock's fields, when he mentioned that meeting major Craig in the ſtreet of Pittſburg, Craig ſays, Mr. Brackenridge, what can be the intention of the people col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting at Braddock's field? Brackenridge replied, he knew of no other intention they could have, but that they conceived that Braddock at his defeat ſunk ſome pieces of artillery in the river, and that they intended to raiſe them, and come and attack the garriſon at Pittſburg; which was all the conception he had at that time of the ſubject. It was then <hi>motioned, either by Mr. Brackenridge, or ſeconded by him, that if major Craig was to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately expelled, it would tend in all probability to defeat the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of government in their operation againſt the Indians; for major Craig having charge of the whole of the quarter maſter's ſtores then at Pittſburgh, that if he was then ſent away and nobody there to ſupply his place, it might be attended with very bad conſequences to the community. Mr. Brackenridge farther ſaid, that it would be much better to ſuſpend the expulſion of major Craig at this time, and wait for an opportunity of applying to the Preſident of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States to have him removed from office, and have ſome other perſon appointed in his place.</hi> No objection was made to the propoſition, by any of the members of the committee, and after doing ſome trifling buſineſs more, the committee roſe. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

When we arrived at Jacob Friggly's houſe, near the meeting houſe, in the courſe of various converſations, a tall man there, with red hair, frequently expreſſed a warmth of affection for Preſly Neville; ſeemingly commiſerated his ſituation, and took ſome credit to himſelf in reſcuing him when he was made a priſoner the night aforeſaid; but at the ſame time was ſtill making ſome

ſarcaſtic obſervations on his father. I found the temper of the people were wound up to a very high pitch, and I took this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opportunity of delivering colonel Neville's letter to him, after finding that his name was Parkinſon, and that he had conſiderable influence; telling him that the colonel had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to deliver his letter to him in caſe I could find him, and requeſted he would deliver it to the chairman. He readily took it; and it was the firſt thing brought upon the carpet, at the meeting. The ſecretary read the letter; but no obſervations followed. After ſome ſilence, a perſon ſtood up, and made a motion, that the burning of general Neville's houſe, and thoſe concerned in it, ſhould be juſtified and ſupported. I could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the people of the meeting conſiderably agitated; colonel Marſhall, of Waſhington, was the firſt who ventured to oppoſe this motion; and he ſeemed to do ſo both with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. After this ſpeech was over, David Bradford, eſq. aroſe and beckoned to Mr. Benjamin Parkinſon (as captain Joſiah Tannehill informed me, who had mixed with the croud, and happened to ſit down on the forms in the middle of the church cloſe by him), aſked him if the relation which colonel Neville had given in his letter, was true. To which queſtion Mr. Parkinſon putting his hand to his breaſt anſwered, it is too true. Mr. Bradford then dropping the ſubject of the letter, began a moſt violent and inflammatory oration in ſupport of the firſt motion. I obſerved Mr. Brackenridge in the courſe of this oration, who being ſeated at the weſt end of the church, and oppoſite to the principal part of the Pittſburghers, who had ſeated themſelves at the eaſt corner by themſelves, in great ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation, often throwing his head down on his hand, in the atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſtudy. At length Mr. Bradford's ſpeech being ended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. Brackenridge advanced nearly to the middle of the houſe, and about oppoſite the chairman, and began his ſpeech; ſlowly irregular; for the current of the people's prejudice ſeemed to be ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ngly againſt him. He firſt opened the reaſons why the few <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

He took various methods of diverting the attention of the audience from the ſpeech that preceeded his.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes he would give a ſarcaſtical ſtroke at the exciſe, and the inventors of it; and then tell ſome droll ſtory thereto relating; in order, as I apprehend, to unbend the audience's minds from the ſerious tone to which they had been wrought
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:028332_0284_0FD898BA86917908"/>
up. He viewed the ſubject before him in various lights; and then entered warmly on his main argument, which was to diſſuade the audience from the firſt propoſition. He told them in direct words, "that he hoped they would not involve the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in a crime which could not be called leſs than high treaſon; that this would certainly bring the reſentment of the general government on us, and there would be none left to intercede."</p>
                  <p>The audience ſeemed petrified, thunderſtruck with ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations; and when he had done, not a perſon ſeemed deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of renewing the arguments. Silence enſued for ſome time, and then the company broke up, and ſome went to drink at the ſpring, and others in little knots or clubs were diſperſed over the green. Thoſe who came from Pittſburgh, finding that the audience was to be called to the church once more, took this opportunity of making the beſt of their way to Mr. Jacob Friggly's. The company met again; but I know not that they did any buſineſs of conſequence; for Mr. Brackenridge was ſoon with us, and we took our horſes, and rode to Pittſburgh.</p>
                  <p>I was alſo at the meeting of Parkinſon's ferry, where Mr. Brackenridge did not ſeem to be a principal among the ſpeakers. I remember to have heard him make two or three humorous obſervations, which ſet the people a laughing <note n="*" place="bottom">I have repreſented myſelf as a principal ſpeaker; and the fact is, that I was; but ſpeaking only at critical moments, and that in a few words, I did not ſeem to be a principal, on the occaſion.</note>.</p>

                  <p>Before me, Adamſon Tannehill, eſq. one of the juſtices of the peace, in and for ſaid county, came James Clow, town clerk of the borough of Pittſburgh, ſworn, ſaith, that he, this depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, was a member of the committee of twenty-one, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the meeting of the inhabitants of Pittſburgh, general John Gibſon in the chair, the evening before the aſſembling at Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock's fields.</p>
                  <p>At a meeting of this committee, ſometime after the day of Braddock's fields, it was explained to the committee by Mr. Brackenridge, that the two gentlemen, general John Gibſon, and colonel Preſly Neville, who were to leave the town by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the committee of battalions, of Braddock's fields, and which the committee of Pittſburgh had undertaken to ſee carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into effect, (as this deponent underſtood), wiſhed that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to appoint perſons to go with them on their way, as a guard, until they ſhould be at ſuch a diſtance as to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſafe, and alſo to furniſh them with paſſports.</p>
                  <p>At the opening of the meeting of the committee, John Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, eſq. was firſt in the chair, but leaving it to attend ſome buſineſs, this deponent was appointed to the chair, but had ſome heſitation, as not knowing but it might bring him into trouble. On which Mr. Brackenridge ſaid, that it was at the requeſt of the gentlemen themſelves, that the committee met, to give a guard and paſſports, and that it was for their ſervice, and not their injury, ſo there need be no apprehenſion of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offence; and that if this deponent did not take the chair, and ſign the paſſports, he himſelf was willing (if choſen) to do it.</p>

General John Gibſon was taken down as one of the committee of twenty-one, and his name afterwards erazed, in conſequence of Mr. Brackenridge ſpeaking in a low voice to general Gibſon, in words to this effect, you muſt not be on this committee; I have reaſons for it which I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to you hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, the ſame evening, this deponent was preſent when the committee of twenty-one drew up certain reſolves, to be ſent to the people at Braddock's fields, it was perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:028332_0287_0FD8856DC24E7058"/>
that theſe reſolves were not ſerious, but for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the uſing the expreſſion "the common cauſe," in one of the reſolves, produced a general laugh. In general, this deponent can ſay, that the whole buſineſs of Braddock's fields, as far as reſpects the town of Pittſburgh, was a maſk, and the expelling certain perſons, was for their own ſakes, as well as for the ſafety of the town. This deponent was preſent at the meeting of the committee of twenty-one, who were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon to furniſh general John Gibſon and colonel Neville with paſſports and a guard, when they left the town of Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh. That double paſſports were made out for them, dictat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this deponent by Mr. Brackenridge; a private, and a public one; a public one for the ſake of the country, through which they had to paſs, and a private one for the people elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, in order to ſhew the real cauſe of their going away. In all, <hi>this deponent could diſcover nothing in Mr. Brackenridge but good will, and a diſpoſition to ſerve theſe gentlemen.</hi>

This deponent can ſay, that he has obſerved all that has been ſaid or done by Mr. Brackenridge, in the courſe of the diſturbance to have been for peace, and not at all favouring any oppoſition to government, ſo far as this deponent had an opportunity of obſerving. This deponent was a member of the committee of twenty-one, and was preſent at their deliberations, and never obſerved any appearance of ill will in Mr. Brackenridge to the perſons that were ſent away, but a diſpoſition to ſave them, and the town.

                  <p>Before me, Adamſon Tannehill, a juſtice of the peace in and for ſaid county, came William Henry Beaumont, of the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough of Pittſburgh, who being ſworn, ſaith, that ſometime early laſt ſpring, or, in the laſt of the winter, this deponent began to be employed occaſionally by Mr. Brackenridge to write for him in his office, and continued to be ſo thro' the whole of the late inſurrection in this country. That Mr. Brackenridge uſually dictated his letters of correſpondence to this deponent; that during the whole of the inſurrection, but two letters were dictated by Mr. Brackenridge to this deponent that had the leaſt reference to any political ſubject; nor does this deponent know of any written or ſent by Mr. Brackenridge to any perſons on any political ſubject whatever, except theſe two letters which were to Tench Coxe, of Philadelphia, both dictated to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, viz. one of the 8th of Auguſt, 1794, and the other of the 15th September, following.</p>
                  <p>At the time of the dictating and writing the firſt, this depon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſuggeſted to Mr. Brackenridge, that it was neceſſary to be cautious how he expreſſed himſelf with regard to the country at that moment, as it was probable the mail might again be rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and he might be rendered obnoxious to the people. His anſwer was as nearly as this deponent can recollect, in words to this effect, That he had taken care of that; that he meant to give government a real ſtatement of the ferment the country was in, but at the ſame time, had put in ſome things that would ſave him from the people, ſhould the letter fall into their hands. This deponent underſtood at the time, that Mr. Brackenridge was apprehenſive the government might be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by wrong information <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eſpecting the magnitude of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the extent of the inſurrection, and it was his wiſh that the danger might be viewed in the light it appeared to himſelf, great and momentuous, not trifling and inſignificant; that meaſures might be taken accordingly. That this deponent had that impreſſion from the expreſſions of Mr. Brackenridge
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028332_0290_0FD898C777F7E568"/>
at that time, as he expreſſed his apprehenſions that a juſt ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would not be given by the proſcribed perſons who were ſent away. This deponent did not underſtand Mr. Bracken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge as queſtioning the veracity of thoſe perſons, <hi>but as ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the temper of their minds, that they would not ſee things in a proper view, being under the influence of chagrin.</hi> That at the time Mr. Brackenridge dictated the ſecond letter to this deponent, he expreſſed with ſome warmth and irrit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ion of mind, that his firſt letter ſhould have been miſunderſtood by the government, as he was informed it was; that he wrote this ſecond letter to explain it<note n="*" place="bottom">I believe this was not publiſhed.</note>.</p>
                  <p>That this deponent was one of thoſe who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>companied Mr. Brackenridge to the meeting at Mingo creek, that it was at the requeſt of Mr. Brackenridge that this deponent went, in order to vouch for his conduct on that occaſion, and bear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of what ſhould be ſaid or done by him, conſidering the ſituation as delicate.</p>
                  <p>This deponent found the ſituation ſufficiently delicate; and on a motion being brought forward early in the meeting, and ſtrongly ſupported, this deponent was greatly alarmed, being apprehenſive of being brought in to give a vote on a queſtion of that nature, which was to pledge ourſelves to ſupport what had been done; which as this deponent underſtood, was the violence and outrage that had juſt before taken place. This deponent was alarmed, becauſe to go away might expoſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and perſonal danger, as he underſtood the people of Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh were conſidered in an unfavourable point of view by the people of the country; and to vote againſt the queſtion would be equally dangerous, or more ſo; and to vote for it, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent could not think of, as it would involve in the criminality.</p>
                  <p>In a ſpeech of conſiderable length made at this juncture by Mr. Brackenridge, he appeared to have the ſame impreſſions; and with all the art and addreſs that was in his power, wiſhed to parry the queſtion, without rendering himſelf obnoxious to the multitude. The obſervations made by Mr. Brackenridge in the courſe of the ſpeech, were, as nearly as this deponent can recollect, to the following purport: Thoſe firſt made were of a nature to conciliate them (the perſons preſent) to the people of Pittſburgh, that they (the people of of Pittſburgh) were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors of the exciſe more than other people, nor did they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to ſupport exciſe officers more than other people; they left theſe matters to the government. But at the ſame time it
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028332_0291_0FD898C8F556F3F8"/>
was a very different matter, not to ſupport, and to oppoſe; that be this as it might, we did not come as delegates from the town, but as individuals, and it would be of no uſe for us to join in ſuch a propoſition, for it would not bind, as we repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented nobody. That he, M. Brackenridge, had no objection to give his own opinion in theſe matters; that what was done, would be conſtrued treaſon; it might be morally right, but it was legally wrong, and would ſubject thoſe concerned to pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, unleſs they had force enough to ſupport an oppoſition to the laws; the matter muſt terminate in a revolution, or a rebellion; if they had not ſtrength to make it a revolution, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſt be a rebellion; that that part of the country was but a ſmall part to undertake ſuch an object, that they had not even the four weſtern counties, or neighbouring counties of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lvania, nor the three counties of Virginia, nor Kentucky, if that could be of any uſe; and that the undertaking affords no rational proſpect of ſucceſs. That the caſe was not deſperate; an accommodation might be brought about with government, and that it would be much better for thoſe not involved, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſo, as they would have more weight in their repreſentations as advocates, than if involved themſelves; and could with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety come forward as a mediating party between government and them. That there was reaſon to conceive government would not be raſh in taking vigourous meaſures; that the militia muſt be drafted; that there would be a reluctance in the militia of Pennſylvania to ſerve, and perhaps of the neighbouring ſtates; that the Preſident would reflect on this, and be diſpoſed to an accommodation; that taking into view the diſpoſition of the Preſident, from what we had ſeen in the caſe of the Britiſh ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, it was a natural concluſion that he would not wiſh to involve the country in war; and his conduct alſo with reſpect to the Indian tribes in treating with them, to a degree that has been blamed, when war had been thought better, gave reaſon to ſuppoſe that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>planter had put a ſtop, manifeſted the ſame thing. Here Mr. Brackenridge indulged ſome pleaſantry on the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of government in this caſe, and created a laugh. In this and ſeveral parts of the ſpeech, where Mr. Brackenridge indulged a vein of pleaſantry and humour, this deponent ſaw through it, and thought that it manifeſted a great degree of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement and addreſs, to play with the fancy of the people, and
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:028332_0292_0FD898CA349FDCE0"/>
divert them from that intentneſs, in having the propoſition car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, which he was endeavouring to parry. The reſult was, Mr. Brackenridge ſeemed to <hi>wiſh that all things ſhould remain as they were, and be put in a train of negociation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. Brackenridge's ſpeech ended; a pauſe enſued; moſt of the members of the meeting left the meeting houſe for a ſhort period of time. On being deſired to reſume their ſeats, we thought it moſt prudent to retreat, Mr. Brackenridge telling us, "we had better get off as ſoon as we can, or they will bring us into ſome other diſagreeable predicament."</p>
                  <p>This deponent went with Mr. Brackenridge, came away with him, had an opportunity of ſeeing him through the whole of the time, and did not obſerve him to have any private converſation with any perſon there preſent.</p>
                  <p>This deponent further ſaith, that from the nature of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement with Mr. Brackenridge, he had almoſt daily oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of hearing his ſentiments on the ſtate of affairs in the country. That his ſentiments were perfectly oppoſed to the violations of the law, and his great object ſeemed to be, <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore order, get an indemnity for the people, and at the ſame time ſerve the government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this deponent knew it to be Mr. Brackenridge's inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if order could not be reſtored, and a war muſt enſue, to leave the country; and at a time, when war appeared to be inevitable, juſt before the meeting at Red ſtone, Mr. Brackenridge employed this deponent to go to the country, to collect money for the purpoſe of leaving the country, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his family with him. <hi>That before this time on other occaſions, he had heard Mr. Brackenridge talk of having the country, to get quit of the troubles, and that the place he meant to retire to, was Philadelphia. That he thought thoſe people peculiarly fortunate who had been ſent away, and wiſhed himſelf in their ſituation. Mr. Brackenridge expreſſed himſelf to this deponent to this effect, before colonel Preſly Neville went away, and wondered at his being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied at being ſent away, as he ought rather to conſider it as a fortunate circumſtance to be clear of the difficulties of the times;</hi> for if a man went of himſelf, he would be conſidered as a deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and his property deſtroyed, or perhaps himſelf apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in going away, and brought back to puniſhment. Whereas when ſent away, it was the act of the people themſelves, and they could not blame the perſon for going. At the meeting at Mingo creek, this deponent recollects that a letter was read from colonel Preſly Neville, but does not recollect the contents
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028332_0293_0FD898CBF139F590"/>
preciſely; but to the beſt of this deponent's recollection, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to general Neville, major Kirkpatrick, major Craig, and colonel Neville himſelf, with a view of placing their conduct in a favourable light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſtion</hi> to the deponent by Mr. Brackenridge. What do you mean when you ſay that I was apprehenſive the perſons ſent away, would not from the temper of their minds ſee things in a proper point of view, being under the influence of chagrin? being under the influence of paſſion, they would be diſpoſed to ſtate things more ſtrongly on that account, explain this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> In the courſe of the converſation at that time, this deponent underſtood M. Brackenridge, that it would be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for theſe perſons to wiſh a force ſent at all events, and as it might alarm the government to be under the neceſſity of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a large force, they would be diſpoſed to repreſent it as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible by a ſmall force. Whereas in Mr. Brackenridge's o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, the policy would be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> accommodation in the firſt place, and if that ſhould ſail, an efficient force; his obſervations were to that effect.</p>
                  <p>At the meeting at Mingo creek, this deponent recollects that at the time Mr. Brackenridge was expreſſing himſelf with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the probability of an accommodation with government, he declared <hi>that he himſelf would be willing to be one to go to the executive, for the purpoſe of obtaining terms.</hi>

                  <p>I received yours of 13th inſtant, requeſting me to ſend you a ſtatement of what paſſed at Pittſburgh, between the committee that waited upon colonel Baird, Mr. Meetkirk, and myſelf, at the time we took over the mail which was intercepted on the road to Philadelphia.</p>
                  <p>For your ſatisfaction, I ſhall ſtate to you the whole of the buſineſs as preciſely as I can recollect, which is as follows, viz. On the 29th or 30th July laſt I came home to my houſe, after being out on the frontiers about ten days. I had ſcarcely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, before a meſſenger waited on me from the court-houſe, informing me to attend at a meeting of a large number of the people there aſſembled. I attended, and found Mr. James Roſs reading ſome letters which had been taken out of the mail, which had been intercepted going to Philadelphia. I was there informed that previous to the meeting, there had been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or letters ſent among the people to attend at Braddock's field, but for what purpoſe I could not then tell; but the order or letters being countermanded by the perſons that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded them, which I believe was attending at the meeting, they made every effect to diſſuade the people to attend, but to no effect; they got the alarm, and wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> determined to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward next day. The ſame evening, I believe, I was at Mr. Meetkirk's, when I told I had juſt received a letter from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Wilkins, requeſting me to be be open next day. Mr. Bradford being preſent, requeſted me take over part of the intercepted mail, my reply was that I would not; if I received the whole I would take charge of it. He told me the part I had to take was of conſequence, as there was money in ſome of the letters; and the part remaining was only ſome letters which were conſidered to be obnoxious, as the writers were conceived to be enemies to this country. I refuſed taking them in part. The next morning colonel James Marſhall met me in the ſtreet, and requeſted me to take the mail. I conſented; we went to Mr. Bradford's, and received it. Mr. Meetkirk
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028332_0295_0FD898D22FB21158"/>
received the looſe letters. He, Baird, and myſelf, volunteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this buſineſs; we then ſtarted to Pittſburgh, in company with Mr. Henry Purviance, and Mr. Hollingſworth, who brought me the letter alluded to from general Wilkins, the evening before. On the way where the road turns off to Braddock's field from the Pittſburgh road, about eleven miles from this town, we were aſked, which way? as we there had to move forward, and they took the right, we anſwered, To Pittſburgh. We were threatened by a Mr. Lock to have us ſtopped, but we treated him with comtempt, and went on. When we arrived at Pittſburgh, by the time we were diſmounted, we were encircled by number of the inhabitants, aſking the news; among the reſt was Mr. Edward Day; he enquired if the mail was ſafe. I told him I believed it was, and that I had it in my ſaddle bags. He ſaid there was a letter of his to Baltimore, of conſequence, I anſwered I did not know. But there was one directed to Mr. Alexander Hamilton, ſecretary of the treaſury, without a ſignature to it, which was one of the obnoxious let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and I believed to be his hand writing. We then turned off without any more queſtions. By this time the landlord took our horſes, and we went up ſtairs. Shortly afterwards, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Wilkins, George Wallace, eſq. and yourſelf came in, and introduced yourſelves to us, as a committee appointed by the town meeting, which was then ſitting, to have the news; at the ſame time telling us, that there was at that time a town meeting, in conſequence of news they had received from the country, viz. the meeting at Braddock's fields next day. We produced the letters which were conſidered to be obnoxious. They were read, and this committee were told by us to make what uſe they might think proper of them, until to morrow, as we had engaged to have them at Braddock's field next day. Your committee returned, as I underſtood, to the town meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and made report. Your committee waited on us ſoon afterwards, wiſhing us to point out in writing the characters that muſt be expelled. The names was given by us, which was a very delicate thing with us. But to ſave your town from deſtruction, we gave in writing the perſons names, which ought to be expelled for the ſafety of the place, viz. major Kirkpatrick, Mr. Briſon, and Mr. Day. I remember to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your committee, that we had no real buſineſs at that time, but to ſave your town. And if you did not comply with what was related, by the Lord, <hi>your town, as I believed, would be laid in aſhes, and thoſe perſons probably maſſacred.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

                     </gap>h and ſays, that on the 12th or 13th day of laſt July, being lately returned home from a voyage he had undertaken to the Illinois country, Hugh Henry Brackenridge, attorney at law, living in Pittſburgh, Allegheny county, ſtate of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:028332_0302_0FD8978CF53FDDD0"/>
came to his houſe, being one day or two before the firſt riot had taken place at general Neville's houſe; and as it was the firſt time this deponent had ſeen Mr. Brackenridge ſince his arrival, a miſcellany of news reciprocally given, ſoon became the whole topic of their converſation. This deponent perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remembers, that amongſt other things, he mentioned to Mr. Brackenridge, that while he was paſſing through Kentucky, he had heard that numbers of people in that ſtate was diſpleaſed at the conduct of the federal government towards them; that ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral committees had been held there, and had already went to a great length; that this ſaid deponent had read a printed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, paſted up at a public place in Kentucky, containing ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al reſolves of a committee, and eſpecially one by which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Kentucky, were invited at large to meet, and take in conſideration the circumſtances of the country; that ſome talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a ſeparation from the union, others thought of other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to be adopted. Upon which account ſo given by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent to Mr. Brackenridge, he appeared to this deponent to be highly diſpleaſed, and aſking this deponent who might be the leaders in that ſyſtem of reform. This deponent ſays he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, that he, this ſaid deponent, had been told that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral lawyers were amongſt the leaders; to which Mr. Brack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enridge replied, he ſuppoſed <hi>theſe lawyers muſt be trivial ones, probably ſhifting in that manner to obtain ſome notice from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic.</hi> This deponent further ſays, that he told Mr. Brackenridge he had heard of ſeveral lawyers, diſtinguiſhed by their talents, who were at the head of theſe committees, and many other perſons of good ſtanding in Kentucky; which Mr. Brackenridge appeared to wonder at greatly, and ſeeming to ſink into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with great concern in a deep reflection for a little while, this deponent ſays, he ſoon expreſſed himſelf in the following manner, "<hi>I cannot perceive what advantage the people of Kentuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky could obtain by diſturbing the union. But ſhould they ſeparate, our ſituation in this part of the country, would become very critical. On the one hand, the people of Kentucky would not fail to interrupt our trade on the Ohio, ſhould we refuſe to join with them; and ſhould we join them, we would immediately loſe the great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages we derive from the union.</hi>" This deponent declares, that the firſt opportunity he had of perceiving the diſpoſition of Mr. Brackenridge in the laſt diſturbances, was a few days after the committee held at Mingo meeting houſe, when Mr. Bracken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge ſaid to this deponent, that on his going to meet with the committee at Mingo meeting houſe, he fairly expected he would
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:028332_0303_0FD8978E74A9B850"/>
be able to defeat any violent meaſures that could be propoſed there; but to his aſtoniſhment, he had met with a numerous aſſembly of men, reſpectable by their property, their abilities, and the popularity great many of them enjoyed; that things ſeemed going to take a more ſerious turn than he expected; and added, only <hi>that the condition of an emigrant was but a ſorry one, that for his part, he did not like to emigrate.</hi> The deponent ſays, that the next opportunity he had after, of perceiving the diſpoſition of Mr. Brackenridge in the laſt diſturbances, was on the 14th of Auguſt laſt, at Parkinſon's ferry, where the ſaid Mr. Brackenridge gave him to read (a little before the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee was formed) <hi>a piece of writing intended to be, an addreſs to the Preſident of the United States, in behalf of the people of the weſtern part of Pennſylvania;</hi> which writing Mr. Brackenridge told to this deponent, he would preſent to the then committee, and would exert himſelf to make it be adopted. The deponent further ſays, that the object of that draft, was to ſolicit from the executive to ſuſpend its activity in putting the exciſe law in force, until the next ſeſſion of Congreſs, upon the ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe from the people of the fourth ſurvey, to obey and continue to keep in force among them, without any interruption, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laws, both of the federal and ſtate government. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent ſays, that Mr. Brackenridge told him ſince, that he had not thought proper to preſent the ſaid draft of addreſs to the committee, upon his hearing during the time the committee was holding, that commiſſioners from the executive were arrived on the ſpot. This deponent ſays alſo, that the third circumſtance that drew his attention to the conduct of Mr. Brackenridge, took place on the 21ſt day of Auguſt, when the committee of twelve went to confer at Pittſburgh, with the commiſſioners in behalf of the executive. The nine deputies from Weſtmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Waſhington, and Allegheny counties met together, and while they were <hi>waiting for the three deputies from Fayette, who was not yet arrived, Mr. Brackenridge opened the converſation on the momentous ſubject of reſiſting or acquieſcing in the laws of the United States; and this deponent, who was one of the three deputies from Allegheny county, ſays, he witneſſed Mr. Bracken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge ſaying openly, before any body had given his opinion, that he thought that ſubmiſſion was the beſt ſtep to be taken; that for his part, he was fully determined to ſubmit to the laws. The deponent ſays, that amongſt the many that were wiſhing ſecretly to ſee the people returning to obedience to the laws, Mr. Brackenridge is the firſt man he did hear ſpeaking of ſubmiſſion after the inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     <pb n="107" facs="unknown:028332_0304_0FD897943689C6D8"/>
The deponent further ſays, that he went the beſt part of the way from Pittſburgh to attend the committee of Redſtone, held on the 28th and 29th days of laſt Auguſt; and as they were going along, the deponent ſaw in Mr. Brackenridge all the tokens of diſtreſs, at the appearance of ſo many liberty poles raiſed through the country, and ſo little correſponding with the pacific views he (Mr. Brackenridge) was going with his other colleagues to propagate and ſupport, before the ſtanding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee at Redſtone.</p>
                  <p>This deponent ſays likewiſe, that after the report of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference held on the 21ſt, was made on the 28th, to the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing committee, and the ſaid commitee having adjourned to meet on the morrow, 29th, Mr. Gallatin came to Mr. Brackenridge in the ſtreet, and in preſence of this deponent Mr. Gallatin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Mr. Brackenridge to open the matter on the following day, which Mr. Brackenridge declined, devolving the taſk on Mr. Gallatin, with promiſe he would ſupport him with all his might. This deponent ſays, that he went that night to lodge at a neighbouring farm with Mr. Brackenridge, that the ſaid Brackenridge gave to him the deponent during the whole even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the moſt perſuaſive tokens of anxiety and diſſatisfaction, expreſſing repeatedly, how <hi>unwell the good of the country appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be underſtood by many members of the ſtanding committee.</hi> This deponent ſays, that on the day following he attended the committee as a member of it, and heard Mr. Brackenridge echoing there in his own language, the cogent and powerful arguments firſt made uſe of by Mr. Gallatin, and adding new ones of his own; all to the purpoſe of diſpoſing the committee to ſubmit to the laws, and propagate that diſpoſition among their conſtituents.</p>
                  <p>This deponent recollects, that not long after the beginning of the late diſturbances, Mr. Brackenridge read to him a letter he had received from a gentleman of Philadelphia, in anſwer to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother one he had written firſt to that gentleman, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents Mr. Brackenridge had mentioned in ſubſtance to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, who remembers that, amongſt other things, Mr. Brack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enridge told him, he had written to this ſaid gentleman of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia (which he told me ſince was of the name of Tench Coxe) to wit, that government had perhaps as much reaſon of <hi>being afraid of the weſtern people, as the weſtern people had of fearing government; that ſhould a few hundreds of the weſtern in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurgents attempt to paſs over the mountains, thouſands greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at the funding ſyſtem and its effects, would immediately
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:028332_0305_0FD89795324FAF38"/>
flock with the former ones, and like a torrent would increaſe more and more, in their rapid courſe towards the ſeat of government.</hi> This deponent declares, that this idea ſo ſuggeſted by Mr. Brackenridge, ſeemed to him rather grounded upon exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at the early period Mr. Brackenridge mentioned to him the contents of this letter to Mr. Tench Coxe; but having been informed ſince by the moſt undoubtful reports; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content that had pervailed through the minds of a conſiderable number of people, in the counties of Bedford, Cumberland, Franklin, Northumberland, and in ſome parts of Maryland, &amp;c. this deponent is at preſent fully perſuaded, had the leaders of the inſurgents thought of ſuch meaſures, and given execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, that what ſeemed to him an exaggeration at the firſt, might have been literally a fact, and conſiders that the <hi>hint Mr. Brackenridge had ſo juſtly given of the impending danger, to a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman near government, muſt have been of a great uſe to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive, if juſtly appreciated.</hi> The deponent ſays, that Mr. Tench Coxe by his anſwer to the one of Mr. Brackenridge, Mr. Brackenridge did repeatedly ſay to this deponent, that Mr. Tench Coxe had not underſtood him upon many things he had expreſſed to Mr. Tench Coxe, to ſecure himſelf in caſe his letter had been intercepted on this ſide the mountain. Laſtly, the deponent declares, that he knows Mr. Brackenridge ſince more than ten years; that during that period of time he has cultivated his acquaintance without interruption, as a literary and a philoſophic man. That although he ſpoke ſeldom with him on political ſubjects, nevertheleſs from ſome converſations he had with him relating to politics, and from other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the ſaid deponent has been and is ſtrongly impreſſed with the idea, that Mr. Brackenridge is <hi>a warm and a zealous ſupporter of the preſent federal conſtitution, a real friend to the union</hi>; and from ſome former inſtances, the deponent further ſays, that he thinks Mr. Brackenridge is even an admirer of the federal conſtitution, or at the leaſt has been ſo perhaps in a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree, than many other perſons from this part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who bare very deſervedly in the opinion of this deponent the name of good citizens.</p>

                  <p>The day before the meeting at Braddock's fields, I was in the office of Mr. Brackenridge on ſome buſineſs, who aſked what news.

I underſtood Mr. Brackenridge, (and charged my memory particularly with it) <hi>as diſapproving of ſuch proceedings. I took particular notice of this, as wiſhing to hear the ſentiments of perſons who might know the nature of things better than myſelf.</hi> Speaking of what had been done, the burning of Neville's houſe, and ſo on, Mr. Brackenridge ſeemed to have underſtood that I had been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed with an unuſual number of hands in making guns, and and aſking me about this, I was alarmed at this report, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>You deſire me to detail the circumſtances which led to the expulſion of the citizens from Pittſburgh, by the committee of battalions on Braddock's fields. As far as it came within my knowledge, I ſhall do it with pleaſure: David Bradford, who ſeemed to have all the power, and to exerciſe it in a very ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical manner, opened the buſineſs by relating the preceeding conduct of the people, the robbing of the mail, and read and commented on the moſt obnoxious letters. He charged the writers with having miſtated the facts, and to have miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his conduct, and the conduct of the people to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He was warmly ſupported by many preſent, who were calling out for liberty, whilſt they were violently diſpoſed to exerciſe great tyranny againſt thoſe who thought differently from themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The writers of the letters had moſt of them mentioned Mr. Bradford's name in an unfavourable manner, which was the cauſe of his immediate reſentment; and their baniſhment was the conſequence. The popular fury was ſure to be directed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any man who offended him, during his reign. A motion was made to expel general Gibſon, and colonel Neville, whoſe letters had been intercepted in the mail, againſt whom Bradford had previouſly declaimed with great vehemence. It was thought by many people preſent, friendly to theſe two gentlemen, that they might be ſaved by the queſtion of their baniſhment being poſtponed, until the meeting which was to be ſoon after, at Parkinſon's ferry.</p>
                  <p>To accompliſh this object, a motion was made to refer the caſe of general Gibson to that place. This motion was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by you; but oppoſed and over-ruled by Bradford and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. David Bradford moved in addition to theſe two, that major Craig ſhould be expelled, ſaying it was reported, that he had offered his houſe for an office of inſpection, ſhould another not be found. Bradford called on the Pittſburgh members, to know if this was true. You anſwered it was not true; and

Previous to the riſing of the committee, ſome of the moſt violent exclaimed that major Kirkpatrick, Mr. Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Mr. Day had not gone away; or if they had, it was only for a day or two, and that they would return. The Pittſburgh members, alarmed leſt this ſuſpicion might induce the mob, when they came to town, to ſearch for theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, not knowing what, the conſequence of ſuch a ſearch might he, pledged themſelves that they were gone, and would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>

                  <p>Perſonally came before me, Alexander Addiſon, eſq. preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the court of common pleas in the fifth diſtrict of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, David Reddick eſq. prothonotory of the county of Waſhington, and being ſworn on the holy Evangeliſts of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, ſaith, that during the late inſurrection he converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Mr. Brackenridge on the ſubject of the then prevailing oppoſition to the laws, and that Mr. Brackenridge on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions diſcovered to him both his diſapprobation, and deteſtation thereof. Among other things, he recollects Mr. Brackenridge ſaying, that he conſidered it as ſound policy, to appear to be with the people, in order to preſerve a ſufficient influence to bring them back, when they ſhould cool down to a certain point, or words to this effect. He further ſaith, that ſome time before the late general election of October laſt, he (the deponent) ſpoke both to David Bradford eſq. and alſo to colonel James Marſhall, on the ſubject of electing Mr. Brackenridge to ſerve in Congreſs; each of theſe gentlemen declared poſitively they would not vote for him; and as the deponent had known them both to be remarkably well affected to Mr. Brackenridge early in the ſummer preceeding (at the June court in Pittſburgh), he enquired of them ſeverally, why they had changed their minds. Their anſwers were nearly alike, their words are not preciſely recollected, but the purport was, that they <hi>were diſobliged with him for the part he had taken in the then late affairs of the country.</hi> The deponent afterwards when mentioning to Mr. Bracken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge, that Meſſrs. Bradford and Marſhall, had altered their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination reſpecting his election, ſince the time they had ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited him to conſent to be elected, Mr. Brackenridge replied to the deponent to the following effect. <hi>That he did not wonder at Mr. Bradford being enraged at him, as he conſidered him as a weak man; but that he was much ſurpriſed that colonel Marſhall, who was a man of good ſenſe, could have ever for a moment believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him (Mr. Brackenridge) to be diſpoſed to uſe force againſt the government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, this deponent recollects, that on the morning that colonel Blackeney, doctor Baird, and William Meetkirk, eſq. ſet out for Pittſburgh with the intercepted mail, he know that all thoſe gentlemen of Pittſburgh, whoſe letters had been found in the mail, unfavourable to what was then commonly called <hi>the cauſe</hi> were marked for vengeance. He remembers to have heard by ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> perſon (who it was with certainty he cannot ſay) that Mr. Scull the printer was a good man, that his letter to
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:028332_0310_0FD88549D0DE9698"/>
the governor was favourable, but that the others ought not to be permitted to live in the country, or to ſuch effect. That he recollects well, that he was ſo anxious at the time for the ſafety of general Gibſon, (whoſe letter was inoffenſive even if the country cauſe had been a good one), and alſo for young Neville, whoſe letter was a private one to his father-in-law; that he ſpoke to doctor Baird on the ſtreet, and he believes to colonel Blackeney alſo, deſiring them by all means to go to Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh (with the mail) and <hi>warn the gentlemen who were thus in danger, of their perilous ſituation, as well as that of the town, which was in danger on their account.</hi> The deponent recollects further, in the converſation with colonel Marſhall, after the colonel's return from Mingo creek meeting, that he told the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent of a letter <hi>which colonel Preſly Neville had written to that meeting, and ſpoke of it as an inſult to the people.</hi> Further at preſent he recollects not, but can ſay that he never <hi>heard ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>, a diſſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction, not without ſymptoms of violence, exiſted on account of the compromiſe; and a ſtrong party was formed, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared deſign was to prevent the compromiſe taking effect, by eſtabliſhing a ſtate of our own (as it was termed) independent of both Virginia and Pennſylvania. To this propoſition in all its parts and poſſible conſequences, I know you were oppoſed in word and deed, nor do I doubt my having a correct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of your ſentiments on this occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Again on the publication of the federal conſtitution, the part you took was, in my eſtimation, decidedly favourable to its adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor have I had any reaſon from that day to this, to change this opinion. I believe it is correct.</p>
                  <p>To the third query, my opportunities of knowing your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, ſince the adoption of the federal conſtitution, have been a continuance of the acquaintance and good degree of inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy that had long before exiſted between us. I have often heard you ſpeak on the ſubject, not only publicly but private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and confidentially. I have obſerved your actions to correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond with your words; and upon the whole, have never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a diſpoſition on your part, to diſturb or overthrow the government of the United States; far otherways; nor has common fame, properly ſo called, ever expreſſed ſuch an opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of you in my hearing, altho' ſome individuals have <note n="*" place="bottom">No individual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Laſtly, It is true, I was an inhabitant of the town of Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, during the whole of the late diſturbance, and ſeldom went out of it. I was not an inattentive ſpectator of what

                  <p>I take the liberty of making to you a few queries relative to myſelf, in the tranſaction of the late inſurrection in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, your anſwer to which will oblige me.</p>
                  <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> Were you not in the town of Waſhington at the time of the return of individuals to that place who had been at the meeting at Mingo creek; and what was the impreſſion which ſeemed to have been made on their minds with reſpect to what was ſaid by me at that meeting was it that of having ſupported or evaded the propoſition of Bradford, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures propoſed by the more violent?</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>d.</hi> At what point of the buſineſs did you come forward, and was preſent in the committee of battallions on Braddock's field; and what was the impreſſion on your mind with reſpect to my conduct in the caſe of Neville, Gibſon, and Craig; and what do you recollect, or is your impreſſion with reſpect to our engagement, I mean thoſe of the committee from Pittſburgh, with regard to Abraham Kirkpatrick, and others that had been ſent away; did we not pledge our perſons for theirs, that they had gone and would not return; and did not this ſtipulation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you to be the reſult of neceſſity at that juncture, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the rage of the people againſt the town, on account of thoſe perſons?</p>
                  <p n="3">3<hi>d.</hi> Shortly after the day of Braddock's field, do you recollect my ſtating to you the delicacy of my ſituation, and wiſh to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate myſelf from it; that I had thought of procuring myſelf
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:028332_0314_0FD897AA15945E48"/>
to be ſent to the executive, on behalf of the people of Pittſburg, to repreſent their ſituation, and the motives of their conduct; and having done this, not to return; that with this view I wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you to found ſome principal perſons, and ſee whither it would ſeem that I could be ſo appointed; and did you not give me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation afterwards, that you had founded, and found an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs that I ſhould leave the town or the country, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remain, in order to aſſiſt in ways of our general ſafety?</p>
                  <p n="4">4<hi>th.</hi> Before the election of delegates for the town of Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh to the meeting at Parkinſon's ferry, did I not expreſs to you my determination of not ſuffering my name to be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a delegate, recollecting with what difficulty I had extricat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf at the Mingo meeting houſe; that it would be better, in order to ſave appearances on the part of the town, to let ſome perſon go forward who would not be expected to ſpeak, or take any conſpicuous part in the buſineſs: Was it not rather your opinion, that it was a turning point of the buſineſs to get for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as many as poſſible of moderation, addreſs, ability, and influence, in order to parry the deſperate meaſures that might be propoſed; and did you not undertake to go to Waſhington, and accompliſh, as far as in your power, the procuring perſons to be elected of that deſcription; and was it not upon this ground that I acquieſced, and changed my determination?</p>
                  <p n="5">5<hi>th.</hi> At the meeting of Parkinſon's ferry, did I not explain to you the plan I had deviſed, which was that of ſending com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to the executive; and did not I ſhew you an addreſs I had prepared to the Preſident, ſuch as I thought the people would be willing to ſend; but the commiſſioners ſent would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the real ſtate of the country, and deviſe meaſures for the pacification of it; and did not I ſuggeſt to you, that the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an amneſty for what was done, would be the means; thoſe that were deſperate, from a ſenſe of the violation of the law, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then a proſpect of ſafety, or a way of getting out; and did you not, with my conſent, take this addreſs to read over, and ſhew it to the commiſſioners; as it would give them the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation which was intended for the Preſident?</p>
                  <p n="6">6<hi>th.</hi> At Parkinſon's ferry, towards the cloſe of the buſineſs, at what was conſidered a delicate criſis, when it was agitated whether the commiſſioners who had been announced as having arrived, ſhould come forward to the people there preſent, or a delegation be made of perſons to confer with them at a ſepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate place; and was it not conſidered by us, that the coming forward there would be fatal, as whatever propoſitions were
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:028332_0315_0FD897AB11D8D900"/>
brought forward, would probably at this inſtant be rejected by the multitude; and when ſeveral ſpeakers of the moderate deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription ſeemed to have failed in advocating a ſeparate confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, was I not called upon by you, and addreſſed in theſe words, "This is the turning point; you muſt now ſpeak." I had a conſiderable time before that left the circle, and was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at ſome diſtance from the croud. Did I not inform you, that I deſpaired of it, ſo many others having ſpoke in vain; you ſaid, I could do it. Did I not then come forward, and with great difficulty accompliſh it, and returning to you from the croud ſay, "The point is now gained; there is a ground whereon to eſtabliſh peace?"</p>
                  <p n="7">7<hi>thly.</hi> What, in general, is your impreſſion of my zeal and fidelity, in accompliſhing the point which I had in view, of ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people by ſaving them with the government; and at the ſame time ſerving the government with them.</p>

                  <p>Want of time before you leave this place, prevents my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering your queries of this day ſo fully as I could wiſh, but I ſhall endeavour to ſtate as conciſely as poſſible, my recollection of the facts to which they are pointed.</p>
                  <p>I lived in Waſhington at the time general Neville's houſe was deſtroyed, and during the time of the late diſturbances. On the return of the Waſhington gentlemen from the Mingo creek meeting, I underſtood from them that a propoſal had been made in the meeting, that thoſe guilty of the outrage ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by force againſt all attempts to puniſh them, and that this had been warmly advocated by ſome of our Waſhington people; but <hi>that you were of a different opinion, and had ſtated, that in all probability the government might be induced to forgive it, and that a combination of this ſort would involve the whole country, and oblige government to take notice of thoſe who had tranſgreſſed.</hi> This meeting ended by a propoſal to have a more general one
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:028332_0316_0FD897AC7751D5B0"/>
from the four counties weſt of the mountains in Pennſylvania, and, as I underſtood, the weſtern counties of Virginia, were to be notified to attend on the 14th of Auguſt at Parkinſon's fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Before this day arrived, the mail was robbed, ſeveral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious letters were found in it; a project for taking the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic arms, ammunition and ſtores at Pittſburgh, was ſet on foot; this plan alſo embraced the ſeizing and puniſhing in an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary manner, the writers of thoſe letters, who were called traitors to their country; and the militia were called to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at Braddock's field, and to march from thence to Pittſburgh.</p>
                  <p>The names of thoſe publickly denounced in Waſhington, in preſence of the troops (who were heſitating whether they would march, or not) were Thomas Butler, Abraham Kirkpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick, John Gibſon, James Briſon, and Edward Day. When the troops were aſſembled at Braddock's field, a large commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee was appointed to conſider and ſettle what ſhould be done. This committee ſat a long time, and the ſoldiers became clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for a march to Pittſburgh. At this time I came to the committee, who were at ſome diſtance from the main body. I then learned that the deſign of attacking the fort was abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that the committee had reſolved to petition the Preſident for the removal of colonel Butler from the command of the fort; that they had ordered the baniſhment of major Kirkpatrick, Mr. Briſon, and Mr. Day; and they were taking the queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther colonel Neville, and general Gibſon ſhould not be baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. John Wilkins and you, made a propoſal to poſtpone their baniſhment until the meeting of the 14th Auguſt; but this was negatived. I am not certain whether this propoſal was confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to theſe laſt named gentlemen, or extended to all, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think Neville and Gibſon only included. One of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee then denounced major Craig, for having ſaid he would keep an inſpection office in his own houſe, rather than the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe law ſhould be defeated. A good deal was ſaid on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; his expulſion was at laſt prevented by a propoſal of yours, that a petition ſhould be ſent to general Knox for his removal. It being very queſtionable whether Butler would not protect him in the fort, as belonging to the army; and at all events the public buſineſs would ſuffer from the want of a proper offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer to take care of the military ſtores. This was agreed to. The time within which the bani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hed men muſt depart was fixed, and paſſports allowed them. <hi>The Pittſburgh committee men were called upon to pledge themſelves for the full execution of the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they did; but whether their own perſons were pledged
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:028332_0317_0FD897ADF4EEACA8"/>
or not, I do not recollect.</hi> After this was ſettled, one of the Waſhington members roſe, and propoſed that the troops ſhould march home through Pittſburgh, and that they ſhould all go in a body; profeſſing his belief that they would do no harm, and ſtating, that the news of five thouſand men having marched through that place, would ſtrike terror into the minds of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, who might dream of puniſhing any thing that had been done. From the firſt of the meeting at Braddock's field until this time, it had been my opinion, that we could prevail with the troops to go home from thence; but finding a great major<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the committee for marching to town, I doubted of the practicability of preventing them, and it was evidently the beſt policy to carry the well diſpoſed along with the violent, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to controul them.</p>
                  <p>This was the opinion of all the well diſpoſed part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple aſſembled there, and accordingly the unarmed, as well as the armed, were put in the ranks and proceeded to Pittſburgh. Theſe expulſions, and this march, were the reſult of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Braddock's field; and <hi>nothing but the apparent conſent of the Pittſburgh people to all theſe meaſures, could have ſaved their property from utter deſtruction.</hi> Almoſt all the inhabitants of the town were at the field, and expreſſed to me their deſpair of ſaving the town, provided the inſurgents marched into it. You exerted yourſelf, amongſt others, to the utmoſt, in order to prevent this meaſure. But when it was reſolved on, in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, no perſon who wiſhed the ſafety of the place, would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have oppoſed the march by force, or ſent home the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able well diſpoſed part of the militia.</p>
                  <p>The facts mentioned in your third, fourth, fifth, and ſixth queries, are, to the beſt of my recollection, correctly ſtated. I may forget words; but the impreſſions made on me, and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments expreſſed by you, are ſubſtantially as there ſtated; and it would be only a waſte of time to repeat the ſeveral ſubjects there alluded to. <hi>I ſaw many alarmed, and anxious for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their country, for the re-eſtabliſhment of the government,</hi> and who expreſſed an abhorence of all that was doing. I thought none of them more ſeriouſly ſo than yourſelf; and when you came as a committee man to ſettle the terms of ſubmiſſion, I am perſuaded there is none will deny that you exerted yourſelf to get every reaſonable conceſſion on the part of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in favour of your conſtituents.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Sir, <hi>there is no impreſſion on my mind, from any part of your conduct in the late diſturbances, which I have ſeen, nor
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:028332_0318_0FD897B321189C48"/>

                  <p>In anſwer to certain queries propoſed to me by Hugh Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Brackenrldge, eſq. I can certify, and were it neceſſary at this time, could depoſe, as follows:</p>
                  <p>I reſided at Waſhington during the diſturbances which late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took place in the four weſtern counties of Pennſylvania, but was occaſionally at ſome of the public meetings, which were held in different parts of the ſame, in conſequence of thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbances. I have had frequent opportunities of obſerving the conduct of thoſe who were moſt conſpicuous in exciting the commotions, but never had the leaſt reaſon to ſuſpect him of any <hi>privity or concert with thoſe leaders.</hi> On the contrary, from the period of my firſt converſation with him on the ſubject, which was on the evening that the intercepted mail was carried from Waſhington to Pittſburgh, throughout the whole of the tranſactions, he expreſſed uniformly to me ſentiments in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the violence and outrages which were taking place. My communications with him were frequent; and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded with the moſt perfect confidence and ſincerity on his part. Some were made in company with James Roſs, eſq. and others without the preſence of any third perſon; but in either ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, was that of a ſtrong diſapprobation of the madneſs and folly which had taken place.</p>
                  <p>On the morning that the intercepted mail was brought to Waſhington, immediately on hearing of it I went to Mr. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's houſe, and in a few words requeſted him to explain to me the meaning of what I had heard. His reply to me was, "We have diſcovered that there are traitors and ariſtocrats (this I think was the language, for it made a ſtrong impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on me) who are forming ſchemes to trample upon the liberties of the people;" and other converſation to that effect, immaterial to be related. I aſked him who they were, and what had been diſcovered. He anſwered, that there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Mr. Day, and a certain Mr. Briſon, alſo a certain general Gibſon, who did not ſtand very fair, and that Preſly Neville had not behaved very well. I may err as to the preciſe words,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:028332_0319_0FD897B3F849FD08"/>
but am pretty certain as to the ſubſtance, and as to the perſons above mentioned. The letters were not ſhewn to me by Mr. Bradford, nor did he proceed to detail to me, what the partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulars of the diſcovery were. The letters were read the ſame day at a town-meeting in Waſhington; and alſo the next day, and the writers of them denounced as ariſtocrats, and deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>When I went in company with thoſe who carried the mail from Waſhington to Pittſburgh, which was the day previous to the aſſemblage of the people at Braddock's fields, I certainly apprehended <hi>great danger of miſchief to the town, and alſo to the perſons whoſe letters had occaſioned the ſummoning of the people to Braddock's field.</hi> My opinion was, that the beſt mode of avert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this danger was, for thoſe people themſelves to retire. General Gibſon and colonel Neville can perhaps remember my communicating to them my ſentiments to this effect. Tho' I felt all its harſhneſs with reſpect to the individual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> themſelves, who were this obliged to relinquiſh their families and country, I compared it with what appeared to me the very probable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequences, which were to reſult <hi>to the perſons, and property of thoſe perſons,</hi> and of the inhabitants of Pittſburgh, from their omitting to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>I was preſent at the conference between the gentlemen who took the intercepted mail to Pittſburgh, and the delegates from the town-meeting of that place, then ſitting. As well as I can recollect, colonel Neville was there, if not all the time, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a part of it, and while the buſineſs on which the former had come was explained, which was done in a few words, and the letters which have been mentioned were ſhewn.</p>
                  <p>The gentlemen from Waſhington at this conference, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omitted to mention the names of general Gibſon and colon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Neville, as perſons obnoxious on account of their letters, as being in perſonal danger; or that their removal was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the ſafety of the town. My reaſon for remembering this is, <hi>that I was aſtoniſhed at the omiſſion;</hi> and felt the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt apprehenſions for theſe two gentlemen, and conſidered them as in danger if they ſhould be kept ignorant of their real ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I alſo was alarmed for the ſafety of the town, if the meaſure recommended by the gentlemen who carried the mail, and by myſelf alſo, viz. "That thoſe whoſe letters had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them obnoxious ſhould retire," was not adopted as to the whole of them.</p>
                  <p>I refrained with ſome difficulty from mentioning it to colonel
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:028332_0320_0FD897B637B89660"/>
Neville, and was perſuaded <hi>that a very dangerous delicacy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> had the cuſtody of the mail, and was not conſidered as one to whom the buſineſs was in any degree committed. My uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs however increaſed ſo much during the evening, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to interfere for what I conceived to be the ſafety of the town, as well as of <hi>general Gibſon and colonel Neville. I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon Mr. Brackenridge at near</hi> 12 <hi>o'clock that ſame night;</hi> told him of the omiſſion, and my opinion of its conſequences. He immediately proceeded to call together as many of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the town committee as could be procured. This was done. They met at his houſe in perhaps an hour and a half; and I then communicated to them what I have above ſtated to have been omitted, <hi>and I think that I alſo mentioned major Craig as one in ſimiliar circumſtances with the other two gentlemen,</hi> and told them my opinion of the conſequences. It is my belief that it was ſolely in conſequence of my interfering in this manner, that thoſe gentlemen firſt came to know that they were conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as in danger, and that general Gibſon and colonel Neville were informed of their being conſidered as obnoxious. What took place at Braddock's fields the next day in the committee, confirmed my opinion of the night before, with reſpect to them.</p>
                  <p>I certainly did not obſerve in Mr. Brackenridge at any time during the buſineſs, the <hi>leaſt ſymptom of ill will, or a malignant diſpoſition towards thoſe two gentlemen laſt mentioned.</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhortly after the above tranſaction, ſomething like the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing to have taken place between Mr. Brackenridge and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: I mentioned to him (in conſequence of my having frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard that he was on bad terms, if not with colonel Neville, <hi>with ſome of the connections of the family</hi>) that it was probable the baniſhment of colonel Neville, and perhaps I might have mentioned the burning of general Neville's property, would by ſome be attributed to his means. He replied, that he ſuppoſed it might be ſo, but that it would be a great miſtake; for if <hi>he had meant to ſerve them, he could not do it more effectually than by ſuch conduct; that it would make their fortunes, as the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would certainly pay them well for all loſs or injury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My opinion of his conduct in public at the Redſtone meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the terms of accommodation propoſed by the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners were diſcuſſed, was, that it was influenced by the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cereſt
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:028332_0321_0FD897B7D0EE07B8"/>
deſire to procure the acceſſion of that committee to the terms propoſed; and his ſpeech on that occaſion, contained the moſt unequivocal declarations of his ſenſe of the propriety and neceſſity of accepting them.</p>
                  <p>In private I do not recollect to have had any communication with him at that time, or to have made any remarks upon his conduct or converſation out of the committee.</p>
                  <p>At Braddock's field, as at Redſtone, I had little communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Mr. Brackenridge. He was engaged as a member of the committee, and of courſe principally taken up with thoſe who were moſt immediately concerned in the tranſactions of the day. I rode in company with him from Pittſburgh to Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock's field, on the day that the inhabitants of the town went to meet the people there aſſembled, and had ſome converſation with him on the road relative to the buſineſs; in which conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation his mind appeared to me ſtrongly <hi>impreſſed with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming ſituation of this country, and his ſentiments and intentions to be ſuch as I wiſhed to find them.</hi> My opinion of his conduct on that day, formed partly from my ſubſequent converſation with himſelf on the various tranſactions of it, and partly from converſation with James Roſs, eſq. and others there preſent, reſpecting the ſame is, that it had for its object, the averting danger from the town of Pittſburgh.</p>
                  <p>My opinion of the whole of his conduct throughout the inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in this country, I ſhall give without reſerve: It appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me to have two objects; <hi>to arreſt the progreſs of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent violence; and to procure an amneſty for that already commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thus prevent the flame from ſpreading beyond that country in which it originated.</hi> Though in ſome inſtances during the tranſactions, my opinion differed from his, with reſpect to the meaſures adopted for the accompliſhment of particular points, I never entertained any doubt of the propriety of the principle which actuated him.</p>
                  <p>Whatever may be the ſolidity or juſtneſs of this, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion I have here given of Mr. Brackenridge's conduct and principles, in the diſturbances of the weſtern country, I can with ſafety vouch for the ſincerity with which it is given, and he is at liberty to make any uſe either public or private, of theſe ſentiments in reply to his queries.</p>

                  <p>I have received your letter, deſiring me to ſtate to you "my knowledge of your ſentiments and conduct, reſpecting the adoption of the federal conſtitution; and of your diſpoſition to ſupport it ſince its adoption; and to ſtate alſo whether I have diſcovered from you, any idea of overthrowing it; or have any reaſon to believe that you adviſed or countenanced any ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal oppoſition to the exciſe law; or had any concern in exciting or ſupporting the late diſturbances."</p>
                  <p>In making this ſtatement as ſincerely and candidly as I can, I ſhall ſpeak from my obſervation of your conduct in an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of more than nine years, and in your company in ſocial and familiar converſation at the courts of this circuit, within al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole of that time; from my confidence that your converſation on political ſubjects is frank and ſincere; and from my opportunity of learning the opinions entertained of you by the judges my aſſociates, and other reſpectable citizens in the ſeveral counties of this circuit.</p>
                  <p>Your approbation of the federal conſtitution from its publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and your exertions to conciliate the minds of the people towards it, and promote its adoption, are notorious. Since its adoption, I believe that you have conſtantly retained your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and attachment to it; and I know nothing to induce any ſuſpicion of your conceiving an idea of overthrowing it.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible for me, without erazing all my impreſſions of your character and conduct, to ſuppoſe that <hi>you ever adviſed or countenanced any illegal oppoſition to the exciſe law;</hi> I think your ſenſe of civil duty ſtrong and accurate, and believe you incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuggeſting or approving any unlawful act.</p>
                  <p>During the diſturbances here, until the firſt conference with the commiſſioners at Pittſburgh, I was abſent from this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. At the time of that conference you there expreſſed to me the utmoſt diſapprobation of the preceeding acts of violence, and regret for their effects; your perfect ſatisfaction with the terms propoſed by the commiſſioners, as the beſt that could be offered, and your reſolution to exert every endeavour to induce the people to accept of them; and, <hi>if you ſhould fail, to leave this country.</hi> I am perſuaded that you ſpoke your mind, all your ſubſequent conduct, ſo far as I ever underſtood (and I knew much of it) uniformly correſponded with thoſe declarations; and I believe you contributed greatly to the reſtoration of peace and civil ſubmiſſion in this country. It muſt be ſuppoſed, that the outrages which had been committed, would be frequent ſubject

                  </p>

                  <p>I received your letter of the 13th inſtant, and have no doubt but that you are entitled, at leaſt, to a full ſtatement by letter, of your expreſſions to me in Pittſburgh; but I much doubt the propriety of voluntarily going before a magiſtrate, and making a depoſition on the ſubject. And as it is an extrajudicial buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I preſume no magiſtrate will call upon me by ſubpoena, for the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>I know well you have enemies, and believe they are my friends. I reſpect them, and regard you. It is not for me, therefore, on the one hand, by a voluntary act of mine, to loſe my friends, or wound their feelings, even though they be your enemies; nor on the other hand, to retain their friendſhip, by
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:028332_0324_0FD897BE8BD772C8"/>
withholding an act of juſtice from you. I have therefore deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to do no more on either ſide than ſtrict juſtice, which will be effected by anſwering your letter. If any man doubts my words, I preſume he would not reſpect my oath; and I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf, that all who know me will doubt neither.</p>
                  <p>I recollect perfectly, that on the day I think previous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference being opened in Pittſburgh, between the commiſſioners on the part of the United States, and the committee appointed by the deluded people, I entered without reſerve into a ſhort converſation with you, relative to the ſituation of the weſtern country. Your ſentiments I recollect fully coincided with mine on that occaſion. One ſentiment of yours ſtruck me, as ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly characteriſtic of your opinion, which was, "<hi>that if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of individuals, or the obſtinacy of the multitude, ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſubmiſſion to the government, you were determined to leave the country; that the conſequent ſacrifice of your property ſhould not influence you; that the ſacrifice would probably be but tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for that obedience would, and ought to be inforced; that gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment had the power, and no doubt would exert it on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>" One of us mentioned the neceſſity of inducing Mr. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to comply with the terms which might be propoſed by the commiſſioners. I ſuggeſted the propriety of the uſe of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence with him. You doubted whether you had any; and ſaid, "<hi>the only way you ever could manage him, was by pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to anticipate his opinions; and thus perſuade him to come into meaſures as his own, than which nothing could be more foreign to his thoughts;</hi> but that you would leave no means uneſſayed, to effect a change of his mind."</p>
                  <p>It cannot be expected that I ſhould now give the words of our converſation on that occaſion; but I am perſuaded I have given the ideas. The belief that you were directly or indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned in the late inſurrection can only be entertained by thoſe, <hi>who from their diſtance from the ſcene of action have been impoſed upon by miſrepreſentations, and have therefore formed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions upon ill founded premiſes; or by y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The dangerous and unpopular part I took in the late inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and the deteſtation I entertain for all thoſe defamatory ſocieties, who have for their object the diſſemination of jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies againſt the government; and who, I have no doubt, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted greatly, (perhaps undeſignedly), to the late diſhonorable inſurrection, are, I hope, ſufficient pledges of the truth of this ſtatement, even when it is made in favour of you, who, unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately

                  <p>I have received no papers from you; your letter by the poſt is the firſt I have heard from you. I take the opportunity to give you, in return, a ſummary of the preſent ſtate of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with reſpect to the oppoſition that exiſts to the exciſe law. It has its origin not in any antifederal ſpirit, I aſſure you. It is chiefly the principles and operation of the law itſelf, that renders it obnoxious. Be this as it may, the facts are theſe:</p>
                  <p>The oppoſition, which for ſome time ſhewed itſelf in reſolves of committtees, in repreſentations to government, in maſked attacks on inſignificant deputy exciſe officers, for only ſuch would accept the appointment—did at length, on the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the marſhal in this country to ſerve proceſs, break out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> an open and direct attack on the inſpector of the revenue himſelf, general Neville. Theſe circumſtances you will by this
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:028332_0326_0FD8854B2A3A0730"/>
time have heard, from the general himſelf, and from the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall, major Lenox.</p>
                  <p>Subſequent to their departure from the country, notice was given of a meeting on the Monongahela river, about eighteen miles from the town of Pittſburgh. Six delegates, of whom I was one, were ſent from this town. Nothing material was done at this meeting, but the meaſure agreed upon of a more general meeting, on the 14th of Auguſt, near the ſame place, to take into view the preſent ſtate of affairs of the country.</p>
                  <p>Subſequent to this, the mail was intercepted, characters in Pittſburgh became obnoxious by letters found, in which ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments conſtrued to evince a bias in favour of the exciſe law, were diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>In conſequence of this, it was thought neceſſary to demand of the town that thoſe perſons ſhould be delivered up, or expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or any other obnoxious character that might reſide there: alſo, that the exciſe office ſtill kept in Pittſburgh, or ſaid to be kept there, ſhould be pulled down; the houſe of Abraham Kirkpatrick, burnt or pulled down; other houſes alſo, that were the property of perſons unfavourable to the cauſe. For this purpoſe, circular letters were ſent to the battalions of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, detachments from which met on Braddock's field, to the amount of at leaſt five thouſand men, on the 2d of the month. It was dreaded, on the part of the town, that from the rage of the people involving the town in the general odium of abetting the exciſe law, it would be laid in aſhes. And I aver that it would have been the caſe, had it not been for the prompt and deciſive reſolutions of the town, to march out and meet them as brethren, and comply with all demands. This had the effect, and the battalions marched into town on the 3d, and during their delay there, and cantonment in the neighbourhood, with a trifling exception of a ſlight damage done to the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Abraham Kirkpatrick, in the poſſeſſion of his tenant, which was afterwards compenſated <note n="*" place="bottom">In this I was miſtaken; it had it been propoſed to compenſate, but ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The town of Pittſburgh will ſend delegates to the meeting of the 14th inſtant—what the reſult will be, I know not. I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf, nothing more than to ſend commiſſioners to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:028332_0327_0FD897C5F36F2128"/>
with an addreſs, propoſing that he ſhall delay any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſuppreſs this inſurrection, as it will be ſtiled, until the meeting of Congreſs. This will be the object, ſimply and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, with all that labour to avert a civil war. On the part of the government, I would earneſtly pray a delay until ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and commiſſioners may come forward. This is my object in writing you this letter, which I deſire you to communicate either by the Gazette, or otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>It will be ſaid, this inſurrection can be eaſily ſuppreſſed—it is but that of a part of four counties. Be aſſured, it is that of the greater part—and I am induced to believe, the three Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia counties, on this ſide the mountain, will fall in. The firſt meaſure then will be, the organization of a new govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, comprehending the three Virginia counties, and thoſe of Pennſylvania, to the weſtward, to what extent I know not. This event, which I contemplate with great pain, will be the reſult of the neceſſity of ſelf-defence. For this reaſon, I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and anxiouſly wiſh that delay on the part of government may give time to bring about, if practicable, good order and ſubordination. By the time the Congreſs meets, there may be a favourable iſſue to the negociation, with regard to the naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Miſſiſſippi, the weſtern poſts, &amp;c. A ſuſpenſion of the exciſe law, during the Indian war, a meaſure I propoſed in a publication three years ago, in Philadelphia, may, perhaps, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Being then on an equal footing with other parts of the union, if they ſubmitted to the law, this country might alſo.</p>
                  <p>I anticipate all that can be ſaid with regard to example, &amp;c. I may be miſtaken, but I am deciſive in opinion that the United States cannot effect the operation of the law in this country. It is univerſally odious in the neighbouring parts of all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſtates, and the militia under the law, in the hands of the Preſident cannot be called out to reduce an oppoſition. The midland counties, I am perſuaded, will not even ſuffer the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of more diſtant parts of the union, to paſs through them.</p>
                  <p>But the exciſe law is a branch of the funding ſyſtem, deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and abhorred by all the philoſophic men, and the yeomanry of America, thoſe who hold certificates excepted. There is a growling, lurking diſcontent at this ſyſtem, that is ready to burſt out and diſcover itſelf every where. I candidly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidedly tell you, the chariot of government has been driven Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu-like as to the finances; like that of Phaeton, it has deſcended from the middle path, and is likely to burn up the American earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="unknown:028332_0328_0FD8854E281A4FC8"/>Should an attempt be made to ſuppreſs theſe people, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid the queſtion will not be, whether you will march to Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, but whether they will march to Philadelphia, accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating in their courſe, and ſwelling over the banks of the Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quehanna like a torrent, irreſiſtible, and devouring in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. There can be no equality of conteſt, between the rage of a foreſt, and the abundance, indolence, and opulence of a city. If the Preſident has evinced a prudent and approved de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay in the caſe of the Britiſh ſpoilations, in the caſe of the Indian tribes; much more humane and politic will it be to conſult the internal peace of the government, by avoiding force until every means of accommodation are found unavailing.

                  <p>"SATURDAY before the 14th Auguſt, five perſons for Mif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flin townſhip appointed as delegates to Parkinſon's ferry; thought neceſſary to inſtruct them; ſeven perſons appointed to draw up inſtructions; propoſed to inſtruct, that a remonſtrance ſhould be drawn up to the Preſident, requiring him to ſuſpend the execution of the exciſe law; oppoſed with great violence; I. S. <hi>got up in a great paſſion; ſaid he would not ſit with any fellow that would propoſe a petition or remonſtrance;</hi> that they had frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly petitioned and remonſtrated; always thrown under the table, and nothing done.</p>
                  <p>Some people looking in at the window, and hearing the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made, broke in at the window, and were going to lay on; ſlipped out of the houſe, got on my horſe, and was going away; was forced to return. When I came in again, I. S. propoſed that a declaration ſhould be drawn up, ſtating, <hi>that we did not wiſh to be ſtruck off from the government, but would ſupport it; and at the ſame time would never ſubmit to the exciſe law; but would defend our lives and liberties with our fortunes; this I ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; nothing elſe could be done then; read this to the people; gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally pleaſed with it.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>I have extracted the above as an inſtance, and a proof, of the violence of the people at that period.</p>

A paper was produced for every man to put his mark that oppoſed the exciſe law; one pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per went through two or three companies; ſaw, or heard of no man who refuſed ſigning it, but one; the people much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with him; he was threatened; ſpeeches made againſt the exciſe law; ſaid the power of Congreſs was ſuch they did

not know where it would end; they had made a ſupplement to the former law, that there ſhould be but one office in each coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that they had lately erected an office in Waſhington county, but found they could not ſupport it; that in their opinion they ſhould not ſubmit to the law at all; that it was better to take up arms againſt it; urged the people in ſtrong terms to hold out, and not ſubmit to it; aſked a gentlemen, whom I thought a friend, what was beſt for me to do, as the people had thrown out threats againſt me; ſaid, he had been my friend; but it was time for me to ſay ſomething for myſelf; that the criſis was come when they would have no ſuch people, and I muſt be one way or the other.</p>
                  <p>A few days before this meeting, major — mentioned to me, that it would not be long before I would hear of a party of 400 or 500 who would join to ſuppreſs the exciſe office in the county, and that they would march to general Neville's.

               <head>Reviſionary Notes.</head>
               <p>WHEN I ſay reviſionary, I do not mean, that after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finiſhed this narrative, I have reviſed, at mature leiſure, what has been written: that was not in my power. I ſent it to the preſs, at the diſtance of 300 miles, by the poſt, weekly, as I wrote it. It is reviſionary only by recollection.</p>
               <p>I recollect to have mentioned judge Addiſon, as coming for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, at an early period, with a ſtrong publication, in favour of the exciſe law. It was not ſo much in vindication of the principles of the law, as conciliating the public mind to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence with it. I have repreſented him, as being under the neceſſity "of taking in his ſails, and ſlacking courſe." By that I do not mean any dereliction of duty, but neceſſary prudence in not continuing an evangeliſt of the law. For it muſt be acknowledged, that he did not fail to reprehend, in his charges to the grand juries, the maſked attacks upon exciſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and to recommend a ſtrict cognizance of the offences. In fact, the like ſentiments with thoſe in his late charge publiſhed, were delivered years ago in the courſe of his circuits. I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion theſe things the more minutely; becauſe his reputation has been attacked by inſinuations, as not having acted with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient firmneſs; or as winking at the outrages in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement; and having made uſe of a voucher from him, it concerns me to have his conduct underſtood.</p>
               <p>I have given it, as my opinion, that the inſurrection was not projected by any one. It may ſeem ſtrange with ſome, that this could be the caſe. It ſeems ſtrange to me that any one could ſuppoſe it otherwiſe. Are there any traces of pre-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert? any evidence of conſpiracy to ſubvert the government? has any foreign correſpondence been diſcovered? any ways and means deviſed of ſupplying with arms and ammunition? they muſt have been weak men indeed, that could project a revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and think of effecting it by committee meetings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have always felt great indignation at the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, that it was projected by me; not only becauſe I was unwilling to have it thought that I was capable of deviſing ſo great an evil, but becauſe I diſdained the idea of having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:028332_0338_0FD897DCC995BC40"/>
a thing without, at the ſame time, projecting proper means of accompliſhing it. If it had been with a view of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the government, I would have had ſome correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or intercourſe of communication with the diſcontented elſewhere. If a ſeparation of this country, from the union, had been intended, it would have been adviſable to have found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Britiſh and Spaniards on the ſubject. It might have been well to have been at London, before John Jay was. What could we have offered to the Britiſh? the poſts and a part of the weſtern lands; what to the Spaniards? a guarantee of Louiſiana from ourſelves. My mind would have run in ſome train of this nature; I would not have depended on the efforts of a mob, without a ſyſtem to give them efficacy and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. I ſhould have had no idea of making myſelf a Wat Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or a Jack Cade.</p>
               <p>Did it not appear abſurd to hear the Britiſh politicians, in the courſe of laſt war, talk of our projecting independence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the commencement of the revolution? The deſtruction of the tea, &amp;c. and, finally, the non-importation agreement, might have convinced them of the contrary. Common ſenſe, with that project in view, would have led us to ſupply ourſelves, with all articles as faſt as poſſible, previous to a conteſt. It appears equally abſurd to us in the weſtern country to hear people talk of any one projecting the inſurrection. It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by people that never had a thought beyond driving the exciſe officer out of his diſtrict, and keeping the marſhal from ſerving or returning his proceſs. The ſubſequent acts were with a veiw to ſhield the firſt. Yet theſe ſubſequent acts would naturally have led to others to ſhield them, and thus the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors would have gone on to the utmoſt extremes, without thinking of the ſecond ſtep, before they took the firſt. The rage which had at firſt burſt forth, had given way to deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This inſtinctively had catched hold of others not invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, dragged them along to ſhare their danger, and increaſe their force. The ſucceſs, ſurpaſſing expectation, gave way to ambition, and the idea of reform began to embrace an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſcope. This is the natural hiſtory of the tranſaction. But there is a propenſity in the human mind to reſolve all phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena in phyſics, metaphyſics, politics, &amp;c. into ſome great cauſe that produces them, inſtead of ten thouſand that have contributed. Juſt as one looking at the mouth of a river, would ſuppoſe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to have originated from a large lake, inſtead of ſmall ſprings fed by extractions from the ocean.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="unknown:028332_0339_0FD897DDF4AA8F28"/>I was amuſed with the firſt account I had of the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Nevilles reſpecting me; that I was a man of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ingenuity, great ſubtility, infinite addreſs, and verſabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; the moſt dangerous man in the weſtern country. Gallatin and Finley were nothing to me. Like an evil ſpirit in the winds, I could move a tempeſt without being ſeen myſelf; this was all preparatory to the having me arreſted on ſuſpicion, and hanged without proof. It will be aſked; how is it poſſible that this connection ſhould appear to have had a ſtronger prejudice againſt me, than even againſt Bradford or Marſhall, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurgents concerned in burning the houſe? I anſwer this by aſking a queſtion. Whom do you ſuppoſe, did the emigrant nobility at Coblentz, hate moſt, of all thoſe whom they left in France? doubtleſs the Marquis de la Fayette, becauſe he was attached to the people to a certain extent, and was unwilling to go with Monſieur and the count de Arto's all lengths; and this offended their pride more than if he had been againſt them altogether. Juſt ſo with the Nevilles family in my caſe. They might ſuppoſe me to diſapprove of the outrages com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or at leaſt to have no concern in them; yet were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, becauſe I was reluctant to expoſe myſelf with them to an equal odium in popular opinion; or becauſe I had adviſed yielding meaſures, at the firſt, when they, in the pride of their paſſion, were for the moſt violent. I deduce one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that, let an inſurrection happen when it will, an implicit confidence ought not to be placed in the repreſentation of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants. It will generally be againſt the beſt men, who were thoſe who had counſelled moderate meaſures, and wiſe, becauſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, that they will bear the moſt unfavourable teſtimony.</p>
               <p>But independent of this principle, there was a miſconception of my ſituation and intentions; and antecedent to all this, they had reſolved certain acts of mine, in my profeſſional capacity, into a ſpirit of malignity, and were prediſpoſed to unfavoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſtructions of all I could do or ſay.</p>
               <p>I have ſtated ſome things from a certain Miller relative to language of general Neville, on the ſubject of Graham, the collector under the exciſe law. My object was to ſhew, that general Neville uſed to talk like other people againſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe law; or if the relation of Miller is not true, it will prove that ſpeeches can be attributed to men that were never made.</p>
               <p>I have introduced an incident of a certain Gaſton, my cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; it was to ſhew how eaſily an argument to the man, or
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:028332_0340_0FD897E001EFFCA8"/>
the people, the <hi>quo animo</hi> not being underſtood, may be made evidence againſt a perſon.</p>
               <p>I have mentioned the ſenſibility with which I felt an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the attorney general, commiſſioner Bradford. It was becauſe I had expected no diſtruſt from him. I was ſome years with him at the ſame college, and ſome part of the time, of the ſame chamber; and had maintained a friendſhip ever ſince. I had ſaid that I had not been involved in the inſurrection, but came forward to negociate for thoſe who were. I thought he ought to have given an implicit credit to my declaration. For my idea was, that all who knew me, muſt know, that if involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I would have had the ſpirit to have avowed it, and juſtified it. My impreſſions were removed in the manner I have ſtated. The poſt of yeſterday has announced the death of that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which I ſincerely regret, and ſubſcribe to that eulogium which the public gives of his virtues and talents.</p>
               <p>I have given ſome idea of the unfavourable impreſſions of the people of Philadelphia, with regard to me, when in that city; there were inſtances of individuals, no doubt, who had been better informed, and who were not averſe; but it was my choice to be at a diſtance from all, until my ſituation generally was underſtood.</p>
               <p>It will be aſked me, How comes it that my brother of the bar and the Neville connection ſtand well, notwithſtanding the part taken by him in the firſt committee? His procuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be elected in that committee, was with a view to an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching election, at which he was a candidate againſt Findley for the Congreſs. He was violent againſt the exciſe law, but meant nothing more than to gain a momentary popularity. The Nevilles knew this, and excuſed him; more eſpecially as he pretended to them, that he had ſoftened matters in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee from what they would otherwiſe have been. In addition to this, he has been the family lawyer, in caſes in which I have found myſelf under the painful neceſſity of preſſing ſome branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the connection. There has alſo taken place a conjunction of intereſt in certain co-purchaſes at ſheriff's ſales. Theſe cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es may ſufficiently account for a good underſtanding between them; more eſpecially when it is underſtood, that having ſailed in his ſtroke at popularity, by attacking the exciſe law, he had thrown himſelf back into the bed of government, as haſtily as poſſible. Nevertheleſs, as he had got his eye to Congreſs once more, I am inclined to believe, that had he been in the country at the beginning of the inſurrection, he would have made a ſtroke at popularity, and been with the inſurgents. Even at
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:028332_0341_0FD8855143239AA8"/>
the late point of the game at which he came forward, I have no judgment of mankind, if it was not a matter of heſitation with him, which part he ſhould take. He was in balance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he ſaw the game was up, by an acquieſcence of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part, with the terms of the commiſſioners.</p>
               <p>It will be queried, How does it conſiſt with my repreſentation of the general odium of the exciſe law, and the neceſſity of at leaſt concealing favourable ſentiments with regard to an acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence under it, that Neville, the ſon of the inſpector, has been elected to the legiſlature from the county of Allegheny, at three ſucceſſive elections, and probably before this book appears, will have been elected a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> a fourth? I anſwer, he is thought to be a man of judgment, and poſſeſſes conciliating manners; inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of this, he has been ſeveral years ſurveyor of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and has had it in his power to ſerve many perſons. He has been alſo brigade inſpector, holding appeals in the caſe of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia duties. He has had other occaſional offices, ſuch as the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of patroles for the frontiers, &amp;c. His brother-in-law quarter-maſter, and commiſſary at Pittſburgh, and in that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, having the employment of great numbers of people in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical trades, in contracts of a various nature, for public pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, has influence. The office of inſpector itſelf, in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of general Neville, though generally odious, yet by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, or hope, is ſtill able to attract intereſt. In addition to this, the young man had the addreſs at firſt, to have it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that he was againſt the exciſe law, and diſapproved of his father's accepting the office; at leaſt there were perſons who propagated this in his favour; and there were of the populace, weak enough to believe it. The rumour was, that he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to have the law repealed. At the ſame time he was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Wilkins family, ſtrong alſo in influence of office, and there being no conſiderable perſon that had yet ſprung up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people of this country, on whom they could fix, he was ſuffered to be elected, and to continue. At the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the inſurrection, and ever ſince, fear has done a great deal for him. The more ignorant people do not know, but it may be conſtrued high treaſon to vote againſt him. In due time they will recover a ſedate, and correct ſenſe of rights and duties, and will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ap republican principles, by ſuffering ſo great an evil, as ſo many offices, with a legiſlative appointment, to meet in one man, however reſpectable. As an individual, I have found myſelf reſtrained in a conſiderable degree hitherto, from bearing that public teſtimony againſt the evil, that might
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:028332_0342_0FD897E1213167F0"/>
be thought due from me; at firſt, from the terms of good will on which I thought myſelf with the candidate; and of late, leſt it ſhould be reſolved into malice againſt him. I have given my opinion againſt his eligibility, but no more. The fact is, I have never heard any thing againſt him or his father, but that avidity of office, which ſeems to poſſeſs them, as if there were no perſons out of their family, capable of holding offices; or who ought to have the honour, or emoluments <note n="*" place="bottom">Major Craig at preſent is deputy quarter-maſter of the ſtate; deputy quarter maſter-general, under the United States; deputy commiſſary-gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, under the United States; commiſſary of the military ſtores, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary-public, &amp;c.</note>.

               <p>In the courſe of the narrative, other particulars may occur to the reader, which may ſeem to require explanation; but confident that I have drawn from nature and the truth, in the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation I have made, I am perſuaded there is nothing which, on the moſt minute examination, will not be found conſiſtent and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I have ſtated, that at the meeting at Parkinſon's, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ſending delegates to the Preſident, I favoured the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of David Reddick rather than of Albert Gallatin, and thus in accommodation to Bradford. But the principal ground of preference was, that Gallatin had been with John Cannon of the obnoxious committees; and Reddick not of any. I was ſtruck at the time with the bad policy of nominating ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gallatin or Findley; but did not chuſe to make any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as it might be thought I had a wiſh to go myſelf. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley was obnoxious with the government, and conſidered as one of thoſe who had laid the foundation of the oppoſition to the exciſe law, and therefore by no means a proper perſon to ſend forward on that occaſion. I nominated general Wilkins, but he declined ſerving.</p>
               <p>Captain Simeſon late of the army, but now a ſtudent of the law, was introduced to me at our laſt court, and appears to be a modeſt, well behaved young man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and diſcovered no diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to kill, according to former threats reported to me.</p>

               <p>Page 12. Vol. II.—I have given it as my opinion, that the aſſembly of the ſtate had a right to inſtruct the ſenators from the ſtate in the ſenate of the United States. This will be queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. But it all turns upon what is to be underſtood by <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing.</hi> I underſtand no more by it than <hi>informing</hi> them, or communicating wiſhes, and views. I have no idea that inſtructions ought to bind; as in the caſe of an officer to his ſubordinate. The member from a county, is a member for the ſtate when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; and inſtructions from the whole ſtate only, can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to bind; and not even in that caſe, am I clear that they ought to bind; becauſe the delegate is the conſtituted authority to think for the occaſion. He is ſent upon deck; he is put at the helm; it is his to ſteer; but others upon deck or in the hold have a right to talk; and expreſs their ideas with regard to the ſteering. As to the <hi>expediency,</hi> that is another queſtion. I ſay only that conſtituents have a right to inſtruct; that is, <hi>to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form or furniſh with intelligence.</hi> I add alſo, that I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſtate aſſemblies to be the conſtituents of the ſtate ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, in the ſenate of the United States. They are the organ of conſtituting; but when conſtituted, the people of the ſtate are the conſtituents.</p>

ſin,</hi> as "a theſis I ſhould like to ſee diſcuſſed." It may be queried whether it amounted to a miſdemeanor cognizable by law. I do not ſee that an indictment on this ground could be ſupported. I might publiſh with impunity, that I would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change no office of civility with one that would refuſe a challenge; yet there is a law prohibiting the giving or accepting a challenge. But on the ground of abſtract political virtue, there is greater ground of operation. It is an attempt to defeat a law by <hi>non uſer.</hi> Now, if an individual is warrantable in ſuch a reſolution, all are; and if with regard to one law, with regard to all. It is the act of an individual determining to hold his breath, or refuſe food. It is ſuicide as certainly, though not ſo ſpeedily, as by the poſitive act of diſpatching by a piſtol ball. If one part of a community may reſolve to defeat one law, another part may reſolve to defeat another by the force of opinion, and the body politic may die. I know I ſhall be encountered by a greater authority than that of the reſolves of the Pittſburgh committee. It is that of John Dickinſon, James Wilſon, and others, the primores of Pennſylvania, at the adoption of the ſtate conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in 1776. I do not know that it was reſolved formally by them in committee to accept no appointment under the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and to frown upon thoſe who did; but certainly it was underſtood to be their determination, and their conduct. But I think the conduct wrong. It became them to have reverenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the people, and ſubmitted <hi>to the general will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Page 21. Vol. II.—On reflection, I am not perfectly ſatisfied with the opinion of Monteſquieu, if it is as I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood him, that the office of <hi>a collector of the revenue,</hi> in a republic ought not to be conſidered as an office of honour; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I make a diſtinction between an office of honour, and an honourable office. The revenue is the ſpring of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the collection of it ought to be conſidered as a ſacred duty; and he ought to be a man of property who ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the poſſeſſion of the public money. The only ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent which I can with confidence entertain on this ſubject, is, that though no contempt ought to be attached to the office of collector, yet certainly ſuperior honour to that of a legiſlator. For any honeſt man that can keep accounts is qualified for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue officer; but it requires extenſive knowledge, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed judgment, to fit for the making laws: and a man that has once had the honour from the people of being made their ſovereign for a period, ought to be forever above a mercenary employment, unleſs the narrowneſs of his circumſtances ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

it impoſſible. It muſt be the meaning of Monteſquieu, that when the love of money prevails above the love of fame, and when the public mind ceaſes to make a wide diſtinction in the grade of eſtimation between an honorary and a mercenary office, <hi>virtue is loſt in a republic.</hi>

               <head>Remarks.</head>
               <p>I REPRESENT Bradford and Marſhall as brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and urged by the people. I mean in the early ſtage of the buſineſs. The affair of the mail, and of Braddock's field, was their own act; but it was done with a view to cover what had been done, by making <hi>the oppoſition formidable to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> I had the ſame idea alſo; but contemplated a different mode, which was <hi>mediating with the government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have ſeen a gentleman from New-Orleans (Mr. Hollingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth) who had converſed with Bradford, who averred to him, that this had been <hi>his ultimate object;</hi> and that James Marſhall knew it to be ſo. He was aſked then by this gentleman, why it was that having obtained terms from the commiſſioners, for <hi>the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and himſelf,</hi> he pronounced an inflammatory ſpeech at Brownſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville againſt the accepting them. He acknowledged it was <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaw the fur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the people againſt the accepting, and was afraid to have it t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ought that he was for ſubmitting.</hi> This proves what I have ſaid; that he <hi>wanted fortitude, as well as good ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Hollingſworth alſo mentioned at this time the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bradford, acknowledging that he had no <hi>confidential intimacy with me, by letter or otherwiſe, in the courſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</hi> I deſired Mr. Hollingſworth to give me a certificate of this, which he did by letter, and which I have inſerted. It was in the hurry of the court buſineſs at Pittſburgh, and I had the opportunity of but a few ſeconds converſation with Mr. Hollingſworth, in the few days that he detained at that place. James Roſs and general Wilkins had more, and I am informed by them ſince, that Mr. Hollingſworth mentioned to them, that Bradford acknowledged to him, <hi>that ſhortly after my addreſs to him at Parkinſon's ferry meeting, in the caſe of the exiles, Briſon and others,</hi> he diſcovered that I was <hi>managing him,</hi> and that though I ſuggeſted difficulties, and abuſed the men, my real ſcope was to carry a reſolution for their recal. Mr. Hollingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth had deſcended the river before I had the information, or I would have requeſted him ſpecially to have certified this, in the letter which he had promiſed to leave for me. For it would
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:028332_0348_0FD897EE71EFB100"/>
ſupport my ſtatement of my management of Bradford, and which otherwiſe ſome might think was <hi>more plauſible than true.</hi> But it is well known in the weſtern country, that before this time, I had managed him in the ſame manner, and prevailed with him to do what was right, of which I could give many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Sometimes I have failed, even in a point of <hi>honour and intereſt for himſelf,</hi> of which I could give one very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary example.—It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>The outrages on the revenue officers, in the inſurrection, always ſtruck me <hi>in bulk,</hi> as, by the deciſions of the judges of the Engliſh courts, amounting to the crime of <hi>high treaſon.</hi> In the firſt trials of the priſoners at Philadelphia, I underſtood this to be admitted <hi>by the council,</hi> and <hi>ſo directed by the court.</hi> In the laſt trials at York, there was no pleading<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and no direction by the court. The evidence was ſubmitted to the jury. But after the cloſe of the teſtimony in the laſt caſe, William Lewis, of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel for the priſoners, expreſſed himſelf to me, <hi>that on a view of all the facts,</hi> now fully come out in evidence, he had no heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in aſſerting, that <hi>no treaſon had been committed in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi> and that had an argument with the jury taken place, he had been prepared to ſhew this.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen him ſince in Philadelphia, and he has expreſſed himſelf with confidence to the ſame effect, and that on the trials of the indictment for miſdemeanors, which are laid, as in aid of this treaſon, he will be prepared to contend, <hi>that no treaſon had been committed,</hi> in aid of which any thing could have been done or ſaid. If it ſhould ſo appear, let it be conſidered that it has been no object of my publication to diſcuſs this queſtion. Nor could I have done it without having that teſtimony with the moſt perfect exactneſs, which <hi>has been obtained in court.</hi> But I preſume i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have not mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his opinion of the homicide committed by the inſpector at the firſt attack upon his houſe, whether <hi>juſtifiable,</hi> or in ſtrictneſs of law, criminal; but with regard to this, he expreſſed himſelf with the ſame confidence. This may come into view <hi>indirectly,</hi> on the queſtion of treaſon. All I chuſe to ſay in general is, that if the inſpector of the revenue had, in the firſt advance of the rioters to his houſe, acted <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

had Kirkpatrick yielded with good policy, for the moment, to what the mob requeſted, <hi>there would have been no in ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;</hi> and I know that any man then engaged in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, would have yielded, when the fury had ſubſided, to the civil authority of the country; and I am confident, that this would have been competent to preſerve the peace. After the country had became generally involved in deſperate acts, the civil authority would not have been competent. I ſaw all this fully, when I gave my advice to Neville the younger, to parry the tempeſt, by adviſing his father <hi>to ſurrender the paper,</hi> which the mob had it in view to demand. I do not arrogate to myſelf a ſuperior judgment to theſe men; but my mind was cool, theirs was inflamed, and <hi>pride oppoſed the acting judiciouſly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the inſtant, deciſive, and humane interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of general Morgan in favour of my life, when his dragoons were within <hi>a few ſeconds</hi> of diſpatching me, yet he had no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the having me conducted out of this troubleſome world in a <hi>legal way.</hi> Some time in the winter ſucceeding the inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, coming into Pittſburgh he communicated it as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſecret, that he was in poſſeſſion of what would ſettle the buſineſs with me, a <hi>treaſonable correſpondence with Daniel Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton.</hi> It is not poſſible, ſaid the perſon; I have the papers, ſaid the general, in my poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>The fact was, that a number of the refugees, or thoſe who had abſconded, at the coming of the army, had returned, and ſurrendered themſelves to him. His reception of them was not barely civil, but hoſpitable; and it appeared to be a leading ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to diſcover ſomething from them againſt me. Daniel Hamilton who was one of theſe, and frequently at his table, perceiving this wiſh of the general, actually palmed upon him ſome papers, as my hand writing; but which on being laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the board at Pittſburgh, I preſume were found not to be genuine; and recollecting the <hi>foux pas,</hi> in the caſe of a letter addreſſed to William Bradford, it was thought proper to bury the circumſtance. Daniel Hamilton, however, alarmed at the detection thought proper to abſcond a ſecond time, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
               <p>But let the motive have been what it might, I perfectly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate the conduct of the general, in the caſe of the aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion meditated upon me; and I wiſh it to have all the praiſe that humanity deſerves.</p>

               <p>At the trials of the indictments for the miſdemeanor of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking the commiſſioners at Greenſburgh, it came out in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the rioters had been at firſt at a loſs for a leader; no one wiſhing to take upon him ſo oſtenſible, and, of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſo reſponſible a part; at length, a certain Spangler came forward and accepted it. "I will undertake it," ſaid he, "I have nothing to loſe."</p>
               <p>A man in the weſtern country, lately applied to me for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the caſe of a ſurveyor, who wiſhed to run a line within his ſurvey on an adverſe warrant. I thought he might hinder him as a treſpaſſer. "Ah!" ſaid he, "but will not that <hi>bring the militia upon us?</hi>" I relate this to ſhew the proſtrate ſtate of the public mind. Ignorance is arrogant on falſe appearances, and abject when reduced.</p>
               <p>Another inſtance of this nature I had laſt winter, when I had given an opinion with regard to the eligibility of Neville the younger for the ſtate legiſlature, and which was, that he was ineligible, holding the office of ſurveyor, &amp;c. which, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, diſqualified him. This opinion was publiſhed. A friend of mine, a mechanic, came to me, "Oh!" ſaid he, "you will be ruined now. Can't they make that out treaſon?" No, no, ſaid I; I know what is treaſon, and what is not. "It is well for you," ſaid he, "that you do; for our part that do not, we are afraid to ſay any thing." This is a proof that licentiouſneſs leads to the loſs of liberty.</p>
