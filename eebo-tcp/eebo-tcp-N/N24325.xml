            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A FEW OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Much Reſpected and Worthy Fellow Citizens of all the United States,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THOSE who call to mind the diſmal, gloomy ſtate of deſpondency we were all in at the very time (and for a year or two before) our deputies were fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our now conſtitution; the then very ſmall hopes, from a variety of ſymptoms, that when met, any would be fixed upon, ſo as to be generally agree to; the very long and warm diſputes and oppoſite opinions that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened amongſt themſelves upon that moſt important oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; the turn, notwithſtanding, as it were <hi>all at once,</hi> of all the ſtates preſent, <hi>unanimouſly</hi> to conſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the federal form we have; that the ſtates alſo ſhould <hi>ſeparately</hi> debate as warmly on the acceptance of this form; that at laſt all the ſtates of the union ſhould <hi>univerſally</hi> adopt it; and <hi>above all,</hi> that this form ſhould contain in itſelf, extracted from the democratical, the ariſtocratical, and the abſolute ſyſtems, whatever is worth having from each, clear of, and guarded from, all the ſhocking and pernicious tendencies each of thoſe ſyſtems are expoſed to, and have at times been woefully felt by the ſubjects of either: I ſay, thoſe who weigh theſe occurrences alone, (many more as extraordinary might be adduced) and do not perceive a kind foſtering hand of Providence leading the United States to the formation and <hi>univerſal</hi> adoption at laſt, of our therefore excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and let me add, almoſt miraculouſly-made conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, muſt, I think, be looked upon, if poſſible, as
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032168_0003_0FF167AEB0BD62F0"/>great unbelievers as Mr. Paine ſeems to make himſelf to be. And here let me notice, <hi>en paſſant,</hi> a clauſe in a letter of this Mr. Paine to our Preſident, dated at Paris <hi>but in July laſt,</hi> in which he ſtyles himſelf an Anti-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutionaliſt, not wiſhing to be called an Anti-Federaliſt— <q>It was only (ſays he) the abſolute neceſſity of ſome federal authority extending equally over all the ſtates, that an inſtrument ſo inconſiſtent as the federal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is, obtained a ſuffrage.</q> By this, 'tis plain, he ſeems to think our conſtitution ought now to be kicked out, being <hi>in itſelf</hi> ſo <hi>"inconſiſtent"</hi> and not worth "a ſuffrage." Whatever may have been Mr. Paine's private thoughts, as he well knew what was brewed and brewing in July laſt in Paris againſt us, this paſſage carries more the appearance of the malevolence of an inſidious enemy wiſhing to ſtir up diviſions amongſt us to favour the views of France, than any glimpſe of the feeling, ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing affection of a cordial citizen, <hi>what he affects ſtill to call himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An idea of perfection ſeems to be implanted in our nature, far beyond what the beſt man can attain to in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: our works are like ourſelves; in the moſt correct, imperfections may be ſpied.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"Whoever thinks a faultleſs piece to ſee,</l>
               <l>"Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er ſhall be."</l>
               <bibl>POPE.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>Some men of a ſtrange turn, fond of laying hold of the leaſt ſlips, even in the beſt plans, to overſet them, ſeem always for pulling down whatever may be propoſed, without ever attempting, themſelves, to ſubſtitute any thing in its place, however abſolutely neceſſary that ſomething ſhould be done. Mr. Paine ſeems to be one of theſe pull-down politicians. His Common Senſe is a capital work of this caſt, acknowledged to have been well-timed, and of very great ſervice to us all in our ſtruggle with Great-Britain; but, ſtill, not ſo neceſſary by any means, that we ſhould not have ſucceeded <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it:</hi> however, for this we were much obliged to his
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032168_0004_0FF167B05DE4B5C0"/>pull-down qualities. But has he not now entirely can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled all this obligation, by endeavouring to pull down our conſtitution, and by that means throw us back again into the ſame gloomy, deſponding ſtate we were in before it exiſted? Happy for us, he was not here to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the <hi>building</hi> it, his talents not laying that way. <hi>Pulling down</hi> is his forte; <hi>here,</hi> in my opinion, while he kept to <hi>quid valeant humeri,</hi> his true <hi>political</hi> line, none exceeded him: but his Age of Reaſon has run his bark bump aſhore, and made him appear in as odd a charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there, as the bear in the boat, turned ſailor.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I ſhould be glad to ſee ſomething <hi>built up</hi> by a man ſo long employed only in <hi>pulling down:</hi> it muſt, I think, be a curioſity indeed: any ſtrong arm, with (I had almoſt ſaid <hi>without</hi>) <hi>any</hi> head, may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to pull down a fine building; but, to erect a tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erably convenient one, that may be indiſpenſably neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, in its room, a nice hand, guided by a head furniſhed with many data in the <hi>building way,</hi> that Mr. Paine has never hitherto appeared poſſeſſed of, ſeems not to be diſpenſed with.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, in Mr. Paine's various political works of pulling down, he has offered reaſons; but his bare <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> he ſeems to think ſufficient to make us aſhamed of our conſtitution. But my worthy fellow citizens, under this <hi>"ſo inconſiſtent"</hi> a conſtitution, not worth "a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage," according to Mr. Paine, we have been more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and flouriſhing ſince its exiſtence, now eight years, than any of the beſt and moſt tranquil powers in Europe have been for ten times as long. Let us, therefore, be thankful for it; and <hi>ſuch as it is,</hi> a work made by men, not by angels, be contented with it, and join ſhoulder to ſhoulder in its ſupport: not doubting that the ſame over-ruling Providence that has favoured us under it hitherto, will not fail us in future, if we do not fail ourſelves.</p>
            <p>The cloſer, my friends, you keep to this our heaven-beſtowed conſtitution, (for, let Mr. Paine think what he
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032168_0005_0FF167B234E9CAA8"/>will, I confeſs I think it ſo) and the more you watch over it, the better and ſafer ſituation will you and your poſterity find yourſelves in.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"Still <hi>with itſelf compar'd,</hi> its text peruſe,</l>
               <l>"And let your comment be—</l>
            </q>
            <p>The farewell legacy of our long tried, true and truſty friend Preſident Waſhington. For, be perſuaded, you will find his fatherly recommendation as good a comment to our conſtitution, as "The Mantuan Muſe," ſo much recommended by Pope, can be to old Homer.</p>
            <p>This intruſion, my friends, on your patience, is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by three late public occurrences appearing to me much to affect our conſtitution, and, if not properly and timely noticed, their conſequences may be very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing, if not fatal. That I might not appear a party man, I kept deſignedly ſilent till all our elections were over.</p>
            <p>They are, firſt, an aſſertion in the laſt ſeſſion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, very pertinaciouſly maintained by a number of members, that congreſs had no right "to enquire into the merits of a foreign treaty."</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The manner our laſt election for a chief magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate has been carried on.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The attempt of a foreign miniſter to appeal to the people at large.</p>
            <p>With regard to the firſt of theſe, it will be fully ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, in my opinion, to <hi>contraſt</hi> the power given by the conſtitution to the preſident and ſenate united, with the general power, given by the ſame conſtitution, to the congreſs, (of which the repreſentatives are a part) to ſee, not only the danger, but the weak foundation of that aſſertion. However, a few remarks ſhall be added.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The preſident ſhall have power, by and with the conſent of the ſenate, to make treaties; provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 2-3ds of the ſenate preſent concur.</p>
            </q>
            <q>
               <p>The congreſs ſhall have power to provide for the general welfare of the United States.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:032168_0006_0FF167B6361F06B8"/>
Nothing appears to me eaſier than that each of theſe powers may do the duty enjoined, without claſhing or interfering in the leaſt with each other. Let the preſident and ſenate <hi>make</hi> a treaty <hi>as directed,</hi> without the congreſs interfering. Let the congreſs, when a treaty <hi>is made,</hi> provide for it, if they think it not contrary to the welfare of the United States. Here we find the congreſs have nothing to do with the <hi>making</hi> of a treaty, (and very rightly, from the delay and variety of obſtructions that would probably happen in ſo numerous a body) but, <hi>when made</hi> by the preſident and ſenate, and application is had to them to provide for it, can any perſon <hi>then</hi> think his buſineſs <hi>excluded entirely</hi> from the direction given them, "to provide for the general welfare of the United States;" but that they are <hi>ſtill obliged</hi> to make ſuch proviſion, even if they are perſuaded that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely dangerous to, if not deſtructive of <hi>that general welfare?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many good reaſons may be given for their not being concerned in the <hi>making</hi> of a treaty; but not one, I imagine, that <hi>when made,</hi> at all events, whether they think it for, or not, for the general welfare of the United States, they ought ſtill to provide for it. This appears to me ſo plain a caſe, that there does not ſeem occaſion to call in the ſpirit of our conſtitution as an arbitrator; but yet let us call it in, in ſettling this point, allowed to be of the <hi>utmoſt importance.</hi> We are all made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the three departments of our government, are mutual checks on each other, and that in thoſe checks lies our great ſecurity. This is what I call <hi>the ſpirit</hi> of our conſtitution, and accordingly, even in this buſineſs of treaty-making, the ſenate is a check on the preſident. But where is the check upon the preſident and ſenate <hi>united,</hi> ſhould they combine and act treacherouſly, if this <hi>new</hi> doctrine ſhould take place? Is there no danger here? No need for any <hi>father</hi> check? A treaty, <hi>when made,</hi> is a <hi>ſupreme</hi> law of the land. Some trading na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would very probably, to bring about a treaty to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032168_0007_0FF167BA1F8D1660"/>their liking with the United States, give very large dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceurs. I hope our preſident and ſenate will always be an uncorruptible body; but hiſtory tells us that conſuls and ſenates have had clammy fingers: what has been, may be again. Thank heaven, our conſtitution does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert us even here. We muſt be <hi>all</hi> rogues, <hi>all</hi> rotten, before we can be ruined: when that indeed is the caſe, there is no help for us; the body politic, like the natural body, muſt be ſoon after entirely diſſolved. They are both paſt cure.</p>
            <p>Here let me declare my concern, that the congreſs ſent for the papers relative to <hi>the making</hi> of the Britiſh treaty. This ſtep appears to me to have been <hi>unneceſſary,</hi> as the treaty itſelf was before them, a ſufficient ground to form their judgment upon. But the aſtoniſhment to hear it aſſerted, that they had no right to enquire into its merits, muſt have irritated many. Heat begets heat; and one part overſtretching one way, often fires the other to do the like their way. This is human nature collectively, as well as individually.</p>
            <p>I confeſs myſelf one, though no favourer of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh treaty while pending, made very happy, at hearing that ſo many members, who had expreſſed themſelves againſt it in the houſe, had ſacrificed their private opinions to the peace of the public. But, indeed, I never at any time thought that treaty of ſuch moment, that it ſhould be refuſed to be provided for by our repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atives.</p>
            <p>Farther, what is here ſaid, is intended to prove the conſtitutional right the congreſs have to conſider the merits of a treaty; not by any means to inſinuate, that upon every bad bargain, they ſhould deny to provide for a treaty. No! But upon the moſt glaring, trying oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, like the Britiſh parliament <hi>(fas eſt et ab hoſte doceri)</hi> to exerciſe that right: this cauſes no interruption amongſt them in making their treaties with foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who know they claim ſuch a right, and will exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it when they find it abſolutely neceſſary. What
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032168_0008_0FF167BBC4933420"/>reaſonable objection can they then have to our doing it only on ſuch occaſions?</p>
            <p>I am aware that foreign nations, as well as bad pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents and ſenates, would wiſh to ſee no poſſibility of any <hi>after</hi> reckoning; but that the repreſentatives of the people ſhould be obliged to provide for any treaty laid before them, whatever may be its merits, duration or tendency. But our conſtitution provides an ample re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in ſuch caſes, if the people but do their parts. Send honeſt, firm men, of good ſound common ſenſe, that can judge when it will be abſolutely neceſſary to apply that remedy; when not.</p>
            <p>Still pardon me, my worthy friends, for thinking the manner of carrying on the laſt election for our chief magiſtrate, very objectionable, and, if continued, ſeems in its tendency, not only calculated to foment and keep up heats and animoſities amongſt us, but in no long time, I am afraid, to overſet our union, or ſplit and ſhiver us into many different governments; and if we once begin to divide, no one can foreſee the end of it.</p>
            <p>Our conſtitution ſays, <q>Each ſtate ſhall appoint, in ſuch manner as the legiſlature thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of ſenators and repreſentatives to which the ſtate may be entitled in the congreſs: <hi>but no ſenator, or repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative, or perſon holding an office of truſt or profit under the United States, ſhall be appointed an elector.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>The electors <hi>ſhall</hi> meet in their reſpective ſtates, and <hi>[ſhall]</hi> vote by ballot for <hi>two perſons,</hi> one of whom, at leaſt, ſhall not be an inhabitant of the ſame ſtate with themſelves; and they ſhall make a liſt of all the perſons voted for, and of the number of votes for each; which liſt they ſhall ſign and certify, and tranſmit, ſealed, to the ſeat of the government of the United States, directed to the preſident of the ſenate. The preſident of the ſenate ſhall, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the ſenate and houſe of repreſentatives, open all the certificates, and the votes ſhall then be
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032168_0009_0FF167BE9C3FE348"/>counted. The perſon having the greateſt number of votes ſhall be the preſident, if ſuch number be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the whole number of electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority, and have an equal number of votes, then the houſe of repreſentatives ſhall immediately chuſe, by ballot, one of them for preſident; and if no perſon have a majority, <hi>then, from the five higheſt on the liſt,</hi> the ſaid houſe ſhall, in like manner, chuſe the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. But in chuſing the preſident, the votes ſhall be taken by ſtates, the repreſentatives from each ſtate having one vote; a quorum for this purpoſe ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of a member or members from two-thirds of the ſtates: and a majority of all the ſtates ſhall be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to a choice. In every caſe, after the choice of the preſident, the perſon having the greateſt number of votes of the electors, ſhall be the vice-preſident; but if there ſhould remain two or more, who have equal votes, the ſenate ſhall chuſe from them, by ballot, the vice-preſident.</p>
               <p>The congreſs may determine the time of chuſing the electors, and the day on which they ſhall give their votes; which day ſhall be THE SAME throughout the United States.</p>
               <p>No perſon, except a natural born citizen, or a citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of the United States at the time of the adoption of this conſtitution, ſhall be eligible to the office of preſident; neither ſhall any perſon be eligible to that office, who ſhall not have attained the age of thirty-five years, and been fourteen years a reſident within the United States.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Now, my fellow citizens, ſuppoſe we read the latter part of the firſt of theſe clauſes, thus: <q>But NO PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON holding an office of truſt or profit under the United States, ſhall be appointed an elector.</q> Do not the words, "no perſon," <hi>in themſelves,</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly include the ſenator and repreſentative, without their being particularly named, as with? Therefore, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032168_0010_0FF167C4F6657210"/>theſe words, <hi>"ſenator or repreſentative,"</hi> are taken diſtinctly and ſeparately, as the characteriſtic of a legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative capacity, they are altogether nugatory and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. Whoever attends to the ſtyle of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will, I believe, find no where elſe in it, ſuch an <hi>unnecessary</hi> redundancy. Therefore, as it appears to me, ſenator and repreſentative being to be underſtood in the legiſlative character of each, and ONLY ſo, they are both excluded, by the intention of the conſtitution itſelf, from being electors; for, had it been deſigned that any aſſembly ſhould have appointed the electors from among themſelves, preciſion required that the words <hi>from among themſelves,</hi> or others of like ſignification, ſhould have been inſerted: as no ſuch are, when they ſeem ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, no claim, eſpecially one of ſuch moment, ought to be aſſumed from an, <hi>at leaſt, equivocal expreſſion.</hi> Beſides, to a public body appointed to fix upon another public body, upon a buſineſs of the greateſt importance, ſurely it muſt ſeem awkward and indelicate, for the firſt public body to chuſe out of themſelves, the whole, or 7-8ths of the other, upon an authority ſo doubtful and diſputable, as not preciſely and clearly giving them leave to appoint <hi>a ſingle one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again; the electors for a preſident being equal, in every ſtate, to all the members in each of thoſe ſtates, (ſenators and repreſentatives) taken together, the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſeem to be left to be appointed by the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ONLY, (they being <hi>peculiarly</hi> the public's vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents) in order that our three departments of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the preſident, ſenate, and repreſentative, might be ALL of a piece, ALL the choice of the people; and, therefore, ſuch electors, when thus choſen to fix upon a preſident, ought to be as free, unſhackled, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, as the members of the aſſemblies themſelves, who are choſen in each ſtate, to repreſent their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive citizens at large. This, I think, cannot be denied; and, therefore, the elector, who, antecedent to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, has engaged to vote for any particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032168_0011_0FF167C695B236E8"/>ſins, in my opinion, againſt the <hi>ſpirit and vitals</hi> of the conſtitution; and, as far as in him lies, is ſapping it, and introducing precedents of the moſt peſtilential na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; preventing the choice of <hi>the chief magiſtrate</hi> from being as free, and as <hi>equally</hi> the people's choice, as that of the ſenate and repreſentatives, when they ought, <hi>all the three departments,</hi> to be ſo, as nearly as the peace and ſafety of the whole United States will admit. If, in any ſtate, it has unavoidably happened, through acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, their aſſembly's meeting, or other unpremeditated circumſtances, that they have been obliged to ſtrain upon the meaning of the conſtitution, and to chuſe electors from among themſelves; ſuch obſtacles ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved againſt the next election, that ſo dangerous a practice may not be ſanctioned by cuſtom; and any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſtate, not wiſhing to be ſuſpected as unfriendly to the union, will chearfully conform its actions, ſo as, if poſſible, not to interfere with the expectations of the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Mankind are, generally, ſo unwilling to ſubmit to reſtraints or rules, that even ſuch as are made by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are ſtrangely perverted, to gratify the preſent moment; or eſſential parts of them often neglected, through mere lazineſs, or inattention: for inſtance, the conſtitution plainly expects a number of candidates for the preſident's place; or why the following injunction? <q>If no perſon have a majority, <hi>then,</hi> from THE FIVE HIGHEST on the liſt, the ſaid houſe, ſhall, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, chuſe the preſident.</q> Or why permit each ſtate to take one of the two perſons to be choſen, from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? It is owing to mere lazineſs, perverſeneſs, or the arts of intriguing, deſigning men, played upon you, that you have been diverted from attending to, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing this excellent, ſalutary proviſion? Are you infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated to your own deſtruction? I wiſh with all my heart, no ſtate of the union would ever, in future, neglect complying with this important <hi>conſtitutional</hi> right. Had they done this, in the laſt election, there would have
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032168_0012_0FF167C8328B25E0"/>been ſixteen candidates from among themſelves; and, if each ſtate had, beſides, choſen the other citizen a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent one from the choice of any of the other ſtates, there would have been at leaſt ſixteen more: What then? We ſhould have mortified the ſly emiſſaries, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the ſcenes,</hi> foreign and domeſtic, to ſee their <hi>deep</hi> plan, to ſet us all by the ears with one another, effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually defeated. But our deluſion this year, (I cannot help calling it ſo) may have been permitted, my friends, to happen ſo early in our national career, as a warning to us in future preſidential elections, to be more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and tenacious of ſticking as cloſe as poſſible to the plain meaning and expectation of our conſtitution, and not take upon us again, to be wiſe above what is written. Such a true republican procedure, will not occaſion, in my opinion, much, if any more trouble to congreſs, or to any particular ſtate. But ſuppoſing it does; let us not <hi>again</hi> be perſuaded <hi>out of our ſenſes,</hi> to ſhrink from it. Our happineſs, our independence, our exiſtence as a nation, depends greatly on our peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but firm, <hi>collective</hi> exertions in this reſpect, for the time to come.</p>
            <p>Some of the good effects probably will be,</p>
            <p>Firſt, greatly to diminiſh, if not to baniſh entirely, that too prevailing ſpirit of jealouſy and party, from among us: thoſe moſt formidable weapons, which we have ſo madly put into our enemies hands againſt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and dexterouſly do they know, we clearly ſee, when and how to wield them againſt us, to their own advantage. How diſtreſſing is it to perceive a number of our back citizens, too unhappily poſſeſſed with an opinion, that the citizens on the ſea coaſt, or near it, having the opportunity, from their ſituation, to be ſooneſt and beſt informed, take advantage of them, to deceive and blind them into the choice of men beſt ſuitable to themſelves, and their purpoſes of trade and ſpeculation. Whilſt too many of theſe, on the other hand, as weakly and groundleſsly, ſeem to diſtreſs themſelves that the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032168_0013_0FF167CB0C24BBF0"/>back country want to cram down their throats, by their numbers, whatever meaſures of government they may think proper. To baniſh this dreadful daemon, by taking the ſting, if poſſible, out of thoſe ſly, ambitious, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief-making go-betweens, of <hi>both town and country,</hi> that raiſe and foment theſe jealouſies, is the ardent wiſh of the writer of this paper. 'Tis a neceſſary, but Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culean taſk; and without your ſtrong exertions, my friends, cannot be effectually done. For theſe men, deficient in no arts of effrontery or cajolement, can tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves, occaſionally, into any characters; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling up and down, backwards and forwards, like Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, ſeeking whom they may deceive and pervert, to aid their treacherous or ambitious purpoſes. What miſchief have they done in almoſt every ſtate! But ſo far, happy for us, one wholeſome, ſkilfully applied ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicon, will operate alike in all the ſtates, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly effect a radical cure. 'Tis this—Only let us all reſolve to entertain no ungenerous ſentiments of each other, (at leaſt, not ſo as to affect the public at large) remembering that we are all citizens of one and the ſame great government; have one great COMMON inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and that nothing but ſuch unnatural, ſhocking, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic miſtruſts among one another, can keep us from being as great a government as ever the ſun ſhined on. Away, then, with theſe jealouſies among ourſelves; turn all your reſentment, my fellow citizens, againſt theſe ſly, political, pretending, bettering gents; theſe ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious zealots for reformation; theſe miſchievous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagators of innovation! It warms me beyond meaſure, when I think of their impoſitions; eſpecially, when I ſee how eaſily you ſwallow them. Can you avoid ſeeing how theſe gents ſtart themſelves into conſequence, merely by ſtriving, underhandedly, to ſet us all in a flame? Their firſt ſtep, after feeling their power of deluſion, is generally to riggle themſelves into our ſtate aſſemblies: ſucceſs here, prompts them, by means of their fluent tongues and pliant conſciences, aſſiſted by your own
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032168_0014_0FF167D01C035F18"/>moſt unaccountable infatuation, to look up to a ſeat in congreſs; and often do they gain their ends. After ſo many inſtances of their treading the ſame <hi>beaten</hi> path, one after another, is it not aſtoniſhing that you <hi>ſtill</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to countenance the breed? At leaſt, if poſſible, in future, prevent their going to congreſs to ſpread their miſchief there. That body hitherto, upon the whole, has given great ſatisfaction; too many of theſe ambitious dividers among them, will, if not prevented in time, probably overſet us all. Here act like true, generous federaliſts; prefer the general, to your particular good, and keep them at home, though you diſlike their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, if you can do no better, by all the means in your power. If each ſtate would only ſo far baulk ſuch ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical citizens in their ambitious career, we ſhould ſoon not only get rid of them, but demonſtrate to all the world, that for a man to riſe in the United States, was only by noble, manly, virtuous means; by ſincerely and ſteadily promoting the general welfare; by overlooking ſmall inconveniences; by treating ſmall errors with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and by diſintereſtedly endeavouring to heal thoſe of conſequence, by fair, friendly and candid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. But reaſoning will have no effect upon the men juſt hinted at; they are callous to every noble, generous, tender feeling; <hi>ſelf is their all.</hi> But our keeping cloſe to the expectations of the conſtitution, will much leſſen even their power of doing miſchief, in many reſpects.</p>
            <p>Another advantage is this: that no foreign nation would hardly attempt, <hi>again,</hi> to interfere in our elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from the little proſpect of ſucceſs in corrupting ſixteen ſtates, chuſing their chief magiſtrate <hi>at one and the ſame time.</hi> And ſuppoſe the found means to tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with three or four, the reſt would be fully ſufficient to ſhelter us from the bad effects of their corruption. But, could our enemies, themſelves, have wiſhed for a finer opportunity, than that given them at our laſt elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to chuſe a chief magiſtrate for us; having then to manoeuvre with the parties of only two men, pitted
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032168_0015_0FF167D1B5878D60"/>againſt one another <hi>by ourſelves.</hi> This certainly was making fine ſport for, and coſting them leſs daubing, and leſs trouble.</p>
            <p>Again; out of the thirty-two citizens to be choſen by the electors of the ſixteen ſtates, only two, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, could be approved. This, far from occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any heart-burnings to the other thirty citizens, they would rather think it an honour (as it certainly would be) to have been <hi>ſo far</hi> diſtinguiſhed by their fellow citizens in their different ſtates, and held up as worthy of the moſt important offices; and though kept back for the preſent, would be like a corps of reſerve againſt the next election, with this advantage to the public in general, that in the interim, we may all grow better acquainted with the real merit of each; and if elected again by their own citizens, it would be a high ſign of their fixed reputation.</p>
            <p>Another advantage of this ſtrict adherence to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, would be, that the nation in general, the United States themſelves, could not be reflected on, as carrying even the appearance of countenancing parties; whereas, in the laſt election, the nation ſeemed to ſplit itſelf into two parties, through <hi>predilection</hi> for two citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; a long noted, dreadful rock, a Caeſar and Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey, a Scylla and Charybdis. We ought to have <hi>no predilection</hi> for any citizen. 'Tis of no conſequence to the nation, what citizen, <hi>from one end of it to the other,</hi> is at our head, ſo that he is rightly choſen; an honeſt man, a ſteady, firm federaliſt, no party man, of good ſound common ſenſe, and otherwiſe conſtitutionally qualified. And here, I hope, I ſhall be pardoned for ſaying, I always looked upon thoſe as very weak friends, or artful, inſidious, undermining enemies, who made the execution of our preſident's office ſo difficult, as requiring ſuch extraordinary, uncommon talents. Plain failing ſuits our conſtitution beſt: tricks, twiſtings, joſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and deep laid, equivocal ſubterfuges in treaty-making, let European powers divert each other with,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032168_0016_0FF167D3569812A8"/>and welcome. Our thouſand league diſtance from theſe cunning, double refined politicians, (with whom, the leſs we have to do, the better) is not among the leaſt of the bleſſings we have to thank a kind Providence for— Capitulations or treaties, with either Great-Britain or France, we have experienced already, mean any thing, every thing, or nothing, at times, as may ſuit either. But let us mind our own buſineſs; take as much care as we can of ourſelves; be a party in none of their wars; what treaties we may find it neceſſary to make with them, let them not be of long duration, and let us, on our parts, keep them faithfully. Honeſty is the beſt and trueſt policy—I think we have hitherto obſerved this rule, and hope we ſhall always. Our preſident, in treaty making, has the ſenate to conſult; without two-thirds of the members preſent, agreeing and adviſing him to make a treaty, he cannot do it. What great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty then, can ariſe to an honeſt man, qualified as juſt mentioned, with ſuch aſſiſtance, that he can ſcruple to encounter?</p>
            <p>No ſtate, or number of ſtates ſhould, in my opinion, give the leaſt reaſon to ſuſpect, that they wiſh to ſet up or name, upon theſe occaſions, <hi>directly or indirectly,</hi> any man or men, in a manner that may carry the moſt diſtant reaſon to ſuſpect they wiſh to puſh him or them through the reſt of the ſtates; the more delicacy ſhewn, the better; let every ſtate be left <hi>entirely</hi> to itſelf. Such a cautious, <hi>unmeddling</hi> behaviour in each ſtate, will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally promote harmony, and diſcard every degree of ſuſpicion and jealouſy amongſt ourſelves as ſeparate ſtates. Now, added to this, if men, ready at their pen, wedded to the conſtitution, of true, <hi>vital</hi> philanthropy, would, from the time the election notice to chuſe another preſident is given out, 'till the very day of election ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, be as preſſing as their powers of language will permit them, to enforce to the conſtitutional electors of each ſtate, the importance and duty of their appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the great dependence the public had on their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032168_0017_0FF167D64B999EA8"/>(without predilection, favour or affection)diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their truſt, he himſelf not mentioning a ſingle name, this might be of the greateſt importance, and convince the erranteſt ſceptic, that the republicans of the United States had nothing more at heart, than to find out and obtain, in the moſt direct and peaceable manner, the man (no matter of what particular ſtate) for their presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the majority of the people at large had, by their conſtitutional electors, made choice of.</p>
            <p>Finding that the import of the few minutes I had made, with regard to the inſulting appeal of the French miniſter to the people at large, has been laid before you by much better pens, in the public prints; I ſhall now content myſelf with obſerving, that a ſtranger phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non has hardly been hard of in the political world, than that an abſolute monarch over one and the ſame people, ſhould, for the manifeſt intereſt of that nation, aſſiſt another people to recover their liberties, and become republicans; that that very nation, but a few years there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhould guillotine that monarch, in order to become republicans themſelves; and, when hardly fixed as ſuch, ſhould, regardleſs of a ſolemn treaty with the people they had aſſiſted, like free-booters, ſuddenly and unjuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiably fall upon their trade, and intermeddle with their government, in a manner they, themſelves, have ſhewn all the world they would not ſuffer the leaſt glimpſe of an attempt. What can this proceed from, but a roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic giddineſs of a reſtleſs power, ſetting itſelf <hi>no bounds;</hi> or, not unlikely, prompted beſides, by a jealouſy of our riſing importance among the trading nations of the world, and wiſhing to check it? And here, by the bye, we ſhall much deceive ourſelves, if we imagine the other trading nations of Europe, are without the like jealouſy; for, however they may differ in other reſpects, they ſeem not far from being unanimous in this. I only wiſh we were as firmly agreed, in purſuing our own common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and ſupporting our conſtitution and government; harbouring no miſtruſts of either of its departments;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032168_0018_0FF167DB6959C8F0"/>Their management, for eight years paſt, having ſhewn them, upon the whole, not unworthy or incapable of their truſt. We had it not in our power to ſend angels; as men, they have acquitted themſelves to the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the world. Any political differences that may ariſe in <hi>particular</hi> ſtates, ſhould, like <hi>family variances,</hi> be kept <hi>within</hi> thoſe ſtates. Congreſs ought not to be affected by them; and, indeed, will not, I think, if our elections are managed ſtrictly, according to the letter and ſpirit of the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>No foreign miniſter whatever, I think, has a right to make appeals to the people at large; but the French miniſter has done this. On ſuch occaſions <hi>particularly,</hi> my friends, every reſpectful mark of confidential affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ought to be ſhewn to all our three departments of government, that it may be ſeen how ready the people are to give them every ſupport in their power; and all fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign miniſters be convinced, that any little, indirect ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices of that ſort, only ſerve to unite the people, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, more firmly among themſelves, to oppoſe all ſuch attempts, and to ſhew, in the ſtrongeſt manner, their ſtrict attention to their own rulers.</p>
            <p>I cannot laugh at my fellow citizens, I am ſure, for their zealous, uncommon attachment to the French na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on account of their aid in our ſtruggle with Great-Britain; for, I believe, few have been more ſo than myſelf. That their intereſt, as a nation, induced them to exert themſelves to make the diverſion they did, I never had the leaſt doubt of: their not doing it <hi>before</hi> Burgoyne's defeat, that <hi>capital</hi> turn of the war in our favour, ſhewed their <hi>cautious</hi> reſolve to be on the <hi>ſure</hi> ſide. Yet, ſtill, they had a right to our gratitude, but, not that we ſhould involve ourſelves in ruin, or neglect our own preſſing affairs as a nation. But now, my friends, we muſt have eyes ſurely that ſee not, if their <hi>very great love and friendſhip</hi> do not appear to us in their <hi>genuine</hi> colours, every atom, ſelf-intereſted <hi>to the extreme;</hi> craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily intended to make us merely their puppets; to move
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032168_0019_0FF167DE3613CBB8"/>by, and <hi>only</hi> by their wire. But, my fellow citizens, be afraid of only <hi>their intrigues,</hi> againſt which, by what we have <hi>already ſeen,</hi> we muſt be well aſſured, we cannot be too much on our guard; their long, well-train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed emiſſaries are but <hi>every where</hi> amongſt us. Quiet reſignation to the reſolves of the government <hi>we, our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> have ſet up, is my <hi>uppermoſt political maxim.</hi> But, excluſive of this, I never thought I ſhould have been brought to like the Britiſh treaty, half ſo well as I do now: Providence ſeems to have thrown it in our way, as the means to bring about our being weaned, <hi>in time,</hi> from our over-ardent, too rapturous French love-ſit. But do not, my friends, ſurmiſe from hence, that I mean, indirectly, to perſuade you to a relapſe to your former flame; by no means: we cannot but, by this time, know them both right well; to divide you is equally their aim. Corruption, we all know, is the moſt powerful wedge of diviſion: watch, therefore, all thoſe ſubjects which ſeem to have a crack ready to receive this wedge; keep a ſtrict look out here, and your political peace and happineſs will, in all probability, be laſtingly ſecured. On our ſea coaſts they may ſcratch us; but not much, even there, if our country and other friends are alert to aſſiſt us. But, in the end, I am fully perſuaded, they will deeply wound themſelves. For what can the French, THEMSELVES ALONE, bring very formidable againſt the United States? In what a number of ſhips and tranſports? And, <hi>while bringing,</hi> to how many accidents expoſed, in croſſing the Atlantic? And for what national purpoſe to them, <hi>cui bono?</hi> We have been obliged to fight, and though all of us deprecate being reduced to that <hi>unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> neceſſity again; yet, if compelled, there is not the leaſt doubt that our citizens, from one end of the union to the other, will turn out again with the <hi>like</hi> ſpirit, and advantaged by <hi>ſome</hi> experience, againſt any invaders, however giddily and romanticly impelled; relying on the ſame providential aſſiſtance that has never failed us hitherto.</p>

Numbers freely allow, theoretically at leaſt, that all governmental power ought to ſpring from the people at large. But moſt of theſe very men again ſay, that prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, they, the people, have from all ages ſhewn, that they know not how to uſe power when they have it, or to be contented <hi>long,</hi> under conſtitutions that have ſprung <hi>entirely</hi> from themſelves. Our's is of this ſort, in the ampleſt manner: it has not only ſprung, but, IN EVERY STEP, proceeded <hi>under</hi> the people's auſpices; and, at laſt, has ſolemnly received their conſent.</p>
            <p>You may, perhaps, think me, my fellow citizens, a very great enthuſiaſt to our conſtitution, when I give it as my ſincere opinion, that the world never had ſo good a one manufactured by man. Let all of us, therefore, join heart and hand to make it as laſting as poſſible, and have the honour to ſuperannuate ſuch aſſertions, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely derogatory, diſgraceful and mortifying to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature. To countenance no tamperers with it, will much forward ſuch an animating reſolution. As the Iſraelites were ordered to have the words which Moſes commanded them, in their hearts, and to write them on the poſts of their houſes, and on their gates; ſo let us imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate this injunction with our conſtitution, that excellent, (I think) heavenly gift <hi>alſo,</hi> by having it hung up in the moſt conſpicuous places in our houſes; and, if the fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well legacy of our worthy friend, Preſident Waſhington, was joined with it, our riſing generation, in my opinion, would want nothing farther, compleatly to underſtand, admire and love it. I always was, and very early, in congreſs, ſhewed myſelf againſt any irregular predilec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a citizen to any office whatever; but, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly elected, and he has ſerved with reputation to himſelf, and done the public every ſervice that could be expected from him in his ſtation; we thus have had va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue received, and ought, in our turn, from gratitude, as good policy, to ſhew him, in his retirement, all the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and honour we can, ſuitable to the ſtation he has held. The thus joining Preſident Waſhington's farewell
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032168_0021_0FF167E2BABF3710"/>addreſs, to our conſtitution, which he hath ſo long, ſo honeſtly, and firmly ſupported, will have a <hi>particular</hi> propriety in it, and, I think, be a greater mark of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him, than if his ſtatue was ſet up in every ſtate.</p>
            <p>Like true republicans, my friends, whatever is once conſtitutionally carried, whether by a ſingle, or number of votes, the very nature, the foundation-ſpring of our conſtitution, call upon you to ſubmit quietly to, and to ſupport it, if neceſſary; otherwiſe, as far as is with you, you ſeem to turn tyrants, determined to carry, at all events, your own opinion, joined with <hi>the feweſt,</hi> againſt the conſtitutional reſolve, though attended with <hi>the greateſt</hi> number of votes. Is not this a ſtrong imitation of the <hi>ſic volo, ſic jubeo,</hi> of a tyrant? Will you not, by thus acting, <hi>leſſen</hi> your right of being a republic? And, if you ſtill indulge ſuch an overbearing ſpirit, can it be long before you <hi>loſe it altogether?</hi> The congreſs, unleſs an extreme bad choice is made, if wrong, will ſoon rectify their error themſelves. Publications in the papers too, decently managed, often have, and may again, by giving uſeful hints, be of great ſervice; but, tumultuous oppoſition anſwers no end, but to diſgrace the promoters, to cauſe us to be laughed at by anti-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans, to create confuſion, and to make ill-blood amongſt ourſelves.</p>
            <p>The calling conventions of the people, on general governmental affairs, I confeſs, I am now no friend to. During our ſtruggle with Great-Britain, they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times unavoidable. The leaſt objectionable inſtance, ſeems to me, is, when the preſident, after having duly conſulted the ſenate about a treaty, <hi>ſtill</hi> appears to be (as it were) at bay, and therefore defers putting his fiat thereto, as if wiſhing to know the general opinion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; here, if conducted with propriety and decency, they may, perhaps, be ſometimes of uſe.</p>
            <p>Members, ſent from each particular ſtate, when met in congreſs, belong, certainly, <hi>to the whole nation at
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032168_0022_0FF167E6B7727540"/>large,</hi> to conſult for their general welfare, <hi>as one body.</hi> They ought, therefore, to go unfettered. That mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber who will ſuffer himſelf to be fettered, in my opinion, is not worthy of his ſeat. He cannot be a true, firm, ſtaunch federaliſt at heart: for, as the poet ſays, truly,
<q>
                  <l>"Man, like the gen'rous vine, SUPPORTED lives,</l>
                  <l>"The ſtrength he gains, is from TH' EMBRACE he gives.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So a ſingle ſtate, the more ſtrongly it <hi>embraces</hi> the whole general intereſt united, the more it will find, in the end, its own real importance promoted and <hi>ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened,</hi> and on the moſt ſolid baſis. And the particular member, who <hi>uniformly</hi> acts on this principle, will find his own reputation, not only in the ſtate that ſent him, among men of true worth, fixed upon the moſt reput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and laſting footing; but, among the reſt of the ſtates, he will always be mentioned with the higheſt eſteem.</p>
            <p>No man has more heart-felt joy than myſelf, to find our young nation, but of yeſterday, already become the aſylum from tyranny, wherever ſhewing itſelf. Let our fellow men come and welcome, from any where and in any numbers, we have room enough for them all. The only dread to be apprehended <hi>to them, as well as to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> is the miſchievous uſe, artful, wicked men, (and too many ſuch we have) may make of the long fixed habits and biaſes they may bring with them; by cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly playing and practiſing upon them theſe habits, to pervert them to their own diabolical purpoſes, before we have time to get thoroughly acquainted with each other.</p>
            <p>Men devoted to particular, ancient families, having had famous names, from their infancy, ſounded in their ears, and applauded like demi-gods, in the ſports and ſongs of their native country; I ſay, men of this caſt, are too apt to be taken in by deſigning, watchful way-layers. In the beginning of our ſtruggle with Great-Britain, we had a formidable number of Scotch, in
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032168_0023_0FF167E855A0F8D8"/>North-Carolina, ſo infatuated to the race of Stuart, as to cauſe much trouble to themſelves and us. From ſome items, not very long ſince in the papers, with regard to ſuſpect, there may be ſome duſt attempted to be kicked up amongſt thoſe of that nation, to put them upon that, or ſome other family track. But, my Iriſh friends, be on your guard: I take the liberty to give you this hint, as being of Iriſh extract myſelf, by the mother's ſide, whoſe father was a native of Ireland, whom I am named after.</p>
            <p>Your open, manly, generous, unſuſpecting ſpirit, is well known; ſo is the tincture of credulity, naturally ſpringing therefrom, as well known. Here you have <hi>often</hi> been, here you will ſtill <hi>often</hi> be played upon, and your greateſt caution is neceſſary to prevent it. Your diſtreſſes in Ireland, we have heard of; have felt and ſympathized with you on that occaſion. We are happy to know our country can relieve you; and you will ſoon find yourſelves, in all probability, actually relieved, if you do not ſuffer yourſelves to be cajoled into parties to diſtreſs us, and, in the end, diſtreſs and diſappoint yourſelves of that aſſiſtance you wiſh for. You are now in a land, that with half the induſtry and prudence you were obliged to uſe Ireland, you may gain a landed property, all <hi>really your own,</hi> ſufficient to ſupport your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and families decently and independently. Let this very heart-chearing proſpect add ſpurs to your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; ſtrive to riſe gradually, peaceably and honeſtly, and pay no attention to foreign emiſſaries, emissaries, or to reſtleſs, deſigning, ambitious men, amongſt ourſelves, wiſhing to come country or family over you, or, in ſome other artful manner, to draw our now COMMON country into confuſion, for their <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> ends. Take this in good part, my worthy, unſuſpicious friends, however imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and officious you may think it; in whatever light it may appear, or be made to appear to you, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious it comes from an undeſigning breaſt, that loves
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032168_0024_0FF167E9FA65CC70"/>you, and wiſhes for nothing more than to ſee peace, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and univerſal philanthropy promoted, not only from one end of the United States, but from one end of the world to the other.</p>
            <p>I am perſuaded, from what I have ſeen, that more than half the misfortunes of any conſequence, that have happened amongſt us, has been cauſed from the precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of honeſt men, not aware of, or giving themſelves <hi>time</hi> to guard againſt the ſecret, deep-laid, round-about ambuſhes of crafty knaves, indefatigably labouring to have no body credited but themſelves; and moſt of theſe men, ſo deceived, have been convinced too late, as well for their's, as the public's peace, of their own haſty, infatuated credulity, being the ſole occaſion of all the miſchief.</p>
            <p>My reader, ſtill permit an old man one ſmall digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Little things, mere names and ſounds, have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conſiderable effects. I have often wiſhed the name of our nation was Columbia; and, more than once, took, when I had a right, ſome pains to have it ſo. One of our citizens calling himſelf a Columbian, would ſound, I confeſs, more <hi>honeſtly</hi> in my ear, than now, as in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, calling himſelf an American, and, I am ſure, more harmoniouſly than <hi>an United States man;</hi> or than, by an awkward periphraſe, (that few, if any, can bring themſelves to) <hi>a man of the United States.</hi> From hence, it ſeems to me, the word <hi>American,</hi> is ſo, continually, by foreigners as well as by ourſelves, applied to our perſons, trade, cuſtoms, &amp;c. as, the American trade, an American ſhip, &amp;c. ſcarcely ever, I believe, <hi>an United States ſhip,</hi> &amp;c. Again; the word American, (citizen being <hi>underſtood,</hi> ſeldom <hi>expreſſed</hi>) ſtands alone, which, every time I hear it named, methinks I hear the ſhade of the great Columbus reproaching us for abetting and continuing the cheat upon him, who, though like Horace, he might ſay <hi>exegi monumentum oere perennius;</hi> yet, that republicans ſeem to wiſh, and even to take pains to deſtroy it: for, is it not full as eaſy for one of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032168_0025_0FF167ECE6604F70"/>our citizens to ſay abroad, I am a Columbian; which, too, if adopted, would be peculiar and preciſe, than to ſay, as they do, <hi>indiſtinctly,</hi> I am an American; merely to avoid, as it ſeems to me, this uncouth expreſſion, I am <hi>a United States man;</hi> or, this round-about one, <hi>I am a citizen of the United States.</hi> This ſhews what pains is taken amongſt us, and how much out of the common road, to countenance injuſtice. Pardon this ſenſibility in favour of the fame of a man, dead ſeveral hundred years ſince.</p>
            <p>The writer of this paper is an old public ſervant. No citizen, high or low, in or out of office, from one end of the United States to the other, was earlier than he, in the Britiſh ſtruggle. He, like the widow with her mite, put his all into that cauſe, his perſon; his ſervices to the utmoſt of his power; his property of town and country, were all, from the firſt to the laſt of that ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, at the public ſervice, and made by them, at times, very free with, for which he never demanded, or wiſhed to demand, one farthing compenſation; excepting in the three firſt congreſſes, to which he had the honour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solicited, to be called out by his fellow citizens; of the proviſion for that ſervice, he partook.</p>
            <p>Beſides, indeed, when his country property was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtered, and his town, though under protection of a capitulation, taken from him, was in very little better ſituation; himſelf ſent and made a cloſe priſoner at Auguſtine; his family ſhipped off to Philadelphia, and in diſtreſs there; he then ſhared part of ſome public aſſiſtance, which he afterwards <hi>repaid</hi> to our public treaſurer, with intereſt. Not improbably, it may be ſaid, vanity is the impulſe here; be it ſo, my reader. But I intreat you to believe it forced out from a wiſh to procure attention to the VERY IMPORTANT HINTS in this paper, as coming from a well-known, independent, friendly fellow citizen, devoted to our conſtitutional union, and therefore,</p>
