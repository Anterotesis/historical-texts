            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Much Re≈øpected and Worthy Fellow Citizens of all the United States,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THOSE who call to mind the di≈ømal, gloomy ≈øtate of de≈øpondency we were all in at the very time (and for a year or two before) our deputies were fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our now con≈øtitution; the then very ≈ømall hopes, from a variety of ≈øymptoms, that when met, any would be fixed upon, ≈øo as to be generally agree to; the very long and warm di≈øputes and oppo≈øite opinions that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened among≈øt them≈øelves upon that mo≈øt important oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion; the turn, notwith≈øtanding, as it were <hi>all at once,</hi> of all the ≈øtates pre≈øent, <hi>unanimou≈øly</hi> to con≈øent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the federal form we have; that the ≈øtates al≈øo ≈øhould <hi>≈øeparately</hi> debate as warmly on the acceptance of this form; that at la≈øt all the ≈øtates of the union ≈øhould <hi>univer≈øally</hi> adopt it; and <hi>above all,</hi> that this form ≈øhould contain in it≈øelf, extracted from the democratical, the ari≈øtocratical, and the ab≈øolute ≈øy≈øtems, whatever is worth having from each, clear of, and guarded from, all the ≈øhocking and pernicious tendencies each of tho≈øe ≈øy≈øtems are expo≈øed to, and have at times been woefully felt by the ≈øubjects of either: I ≈øay, tho≈øe who weigh the≈øe occurrences alone, (many more as extraordinary might be adduced) and do not perceive a kind fo≈øtering hand of Providence leading the United States to the formation and <hi>univer≈øal</hi> adoption at la≈øt, of our therefore excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and let me add, almo≈øt miraculou≈øly-made con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, mu≈øt, I think, be looked upon, if po≈ø≈øible, as
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032168_0003_0FF167AEB0BD62F0"/>great unbelievers as Mr. Paine ≈øeems to make him≈øelf to be. And here let me notice, <hi>en pa≈ø≈øant,</hi> a clau≈øe in a letter of this Mr. Paine to our Pre≈øident, dated at Paris <hi>but in July la≈øt,</hi> in which he ≈øtyles him≈øelf an Anti-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitutionali≈øt, not wi≈øhing to be called an Anti-Federali≈øt‚Äî <q>It was only (≈øays he) the ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity of ≈øome federal authority extending equally over all the ≈øtates, that an in≈øtrument ≈øo incon≈øi≈øtent as the federal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution is, obtained a ≈øuffrage.</q> By this, 'tis plain, he ≈øeems to think our con≈øtitution ought now to be kicked out, being <hi>in it≈øelf</hi> ≈øo <hi>"incon≈øi≈øtent"</hi> and not worth "a ≈øuffrage." Whatever may have been Mr. Paine's private thoughts, as he well knew what was brewed and brewing in July la≈øt in Paris again≈øt us, this pa≈ø≈øage carries more the appearance of the malevolence of an in≈øidious enemy wi≈øhing to ≈øtir up divi≈øions among≈øt us to favour the views of France, than any glimp≈øe of the feeling, ≈øympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing affection of a cordial citizen, <hi>what he affects ≈øtill to call him≈øelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An idea of perfection ≈øeems to be implanted in our nature, far beyond what the be≈øt man can attain to in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: our works are like our≈øelves; in the mo≈øt correct, imperfections may be ≈øpied.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"Whoever thinks a faultle≈øs piece to ≈øee,</l>
               <l>"Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er ≈øhall be."</l>
               <bibl>POPE.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>Some men of a ≈øtrange turn, fond of laying hold of the lea≈øt ≈ølips, even in the be≈øt plans, to over≈øet them, ≈øeem always for pulling down whatever may be propo≈øed, without ever attempting, them≈øelves, to ≈øub≈øtitute any thing in its place, however ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary that ≈øomething ≈øhould be done. Mr. Paine ≈øeems to be one of the≈øe pull-down politicians. His Common Sen≈øe is a capital work of this ca≈øt, acknowledged to have been well-timed, and of very great ≈øervice to us all in our ≈øtruggle with Great-Britain; but, ≈øtill, not ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary by any means, that we ≈øhould not have ≈øucceeded <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it:</hi> however, for this we were much obliged to his
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032168_0004_0FF167B05DE4B5C0"/>pull-down qualities. But has he not now entirely can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled all this obligation, by endeavouring to pull down our con≈øtitution, and by that means throw us back again into the ≈øame gloomy, de≈øponding ≈øtate we were in before it exi≈øted? Happy for us, he was not here to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the <hi>building</hi> it, his talents not laying that way. <hi>Pulling down</hi> is his forte; <hi>here,</hi> in my opinion, while he kept to <hi>quid valeant humeri,</hi> his true <hi>political</hi> line, none exceeded him: but his Age of Rea≈øon has run his bark bump a≈øhore, and made him appear in as odd a charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there, as the bear in the boat, turned ≈øailor.</p>
            <p>I confe≈øs I ≈øhould be glad to ≈øee ≈øomething <hi>built up</hi> by a man ≈øo long employed only in <hi>pulling down:</hi> it mu≈øt, I think, be a curio≈øity indeed: any ≈øtrong arm, with (I had almo≈øt ≈øaid <hi>without</hi>) <hi>any</hi> head, may be ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to pull down a fine building; but, to erect a tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erably convenient one, that may be indi≈øpen≈øably nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary, in its room, a nice hand, guided by a head furni≈øhed with many data in the <hi>building way,</hi> that Mr. Paine has never hitherto appeared po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of, ≈øeems not to be di≈øpen≈øed with.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, in Mr. Paine's various political works of pulling down, he has offered rea≈øons; but his bare <hi>ip≈øe dixit</hi> he ≈øeems to think ≈øufficient to make us a≈øhamed of our con≈øtitution. But my worthy fellow citizens, under this <hi>"≈øo incon≈øi≈øtent"</hi> a con≈øtitution, not worth "a ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage," according to Mr. Paine, we have been more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and flouri≈øhing ≈øince its exi≈øtence, now eight years, than any of the be≈øt and mo≈øt tranquil powers in Europe have been for ten times as long. Let us, therefore, be thankful for it; and <hi>≈øuch as it is,</hi> a work made by men, not by angels, be contented with it, and join ≈øhoulder to ≈øhoulder in its ≈øupport: not doubting that the ≈øame over-ruling Providence that has favoured us under it hitherto, will not fail us in future, if we do not fail our≈øelves.</p>
            <p>The clo≈øer, my friends, you keep to this our heaven-be≈øtowed con≈øtitution, (for, let Mr. Paine think what he
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032168_0005_0FF167B234E9CAA8"/>will, I confe≈øs I think it ≈øo) and the more you watch over it, the better and ≈øafer ≈øituation will you and your po≈øterity find your≈øelves in.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"Still <hi>with it≈øelf compar'd,</hi> its text peru≈øe,</l>
               <l>"And let your comment be‚Äî</l>
            </q>
            <p>The farewell legacy of our long tried, true and tru≈øty friend Pre≈øident Wa≈øhington. For, be per≈øuaded, you will find his fatherly recommendation as good a comment to our con≈øtitution, as "The Mantuan Mu≈øe," ≈øo much recommended by Pope, can be to old Homer.</p>
            <p>This intru≈øion, my friends, on your patience, is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øioned by three late public occurrences appearing to me much to affect our con≈øtitution, and, if not properly and timely noticed, their con≈øequences may be very di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre≈ø≈øing, if not fatal. That I might not appear a party man, I kept de≈øignedly ≈øilent till all our elections were over.</p>
            <p>They are, fir≈øt, an a≈ø≈øertion in the la≈øt ≈øe≈ø≈øion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs, very pertinaciou≈øly maintained by a number of members, that congre≈øs had no right "to enquire into the merits of a foreign treaty."</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The manner our la≈øt election for a chief magi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate has been carried on.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The attempt of a foreign mini≈øter to appeal to the people at large.</p>
            <p>With regard to the fir≈øt of the≈øe, it will be fully ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, in my opinion, to <hi>contra≈øt</hi> the power given by the con≈øtitution to the pre≈øident and ≈øenate united, with the general power, given by the ≈øame con≈øtitution, to the congre≈øs, (of which the repre≈øentatives are a part) to ≈øee, not only the danger, but the weak foundation of that a≈ø≈øertion. However, a few remarks ≈øhall be added.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The pre≈øident ≈øhall have power, by and with the con≈øent of the ≈øenate, to make treaties; provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 2-3ds of the ≈øenate pre≈øent concur.</p>
            </q>
            <q>
               <p>The congre≈øs ≈øhall have power to provide for the general welfare of the United States.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:032168_0006_0FF167B6361F06B8"/>
Nothing appears to me ea≈øier than that each of the≈øe powers may do the duty enjoined, without cla≈øhing or interfering in the lea≈øt with each other. Let the pre≈øident and ≈øenate <hi>make</hi> a treaty <hi>as directed,</hi> without the congre≈øs interfering. Let the congre≈øs, when a treaty <hi>is made,</hi> provide for it, if they think it not contrary to the welfare of the United States. Here we find the congre≈øs have nothing to do with the <hi>making</hi> of a treaty, (and very rightly, from the delay and variety of ob≈øtructions that would probably happen in ≈øo numerous a body) but, <hi>when made</hi> by the pre≈øident and ≈øenate, and application is had to them to provide for it, can any per≈øon <hi>then</hi> think his bu≈øine≈øs <hi>excluded entirely</hi> from the direction given them, "to provide for the general welfare of the United States;" but that they are <hi>≈øtill obliged</hi> to make ≈øuch provi≈øion, even if they are per≈øuaded that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely dangerous to, if not de≈øtructive of <hi>that general welfare?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many good rea≈øons may be given for their not being concerned in the <hi>making</hi> of a treaty; but not one, I imagine, that <hi>when made,</hi> at all events, whether they think it for, or not, for the general welfare of the United States, they ought ≈øtill to provide for it. This appears to me ≈øo plain a ca≈øe, that there does not ≈øeem occa≈øion to call in the ≈øpirit of our con≈øtitution as an arbitrator; but yet let us call it in, in ≈øettling this point, allowed to be of the <hi>utmo≈øt importance.</hi> We are all made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the three departments of our government, are mutual checks on each other, and that in tho≈øe checks lies our great ≈øecurity. This is what I call <hi>the ≈øpirit</hi> of our con≈øtitution, and accordingly, even in this bu≈øine≈øs of treaty-making, the ≈øenate is a check on the pre≈øident. But where is the check upon the pre≈øident and ≈øenate <hi>united,</hi> ≈øhould they combine and act treacherou≈øly, if this <hi>new</hi> doctrine ≈øhould take place? Is there no danger here? No need for any <hi>father</hi> check? A treaty, <hi>when made,</hi> is a <hi>≈øupreme</hi> law of the land. Some trading na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would very probably, to bring about a treaty to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032168_0007_0FF167BA1F8D1660"/>their liking with the United States, give very large dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceurs. I hope our pre≈øident and ≈øenate will always be an uncorruptible body; but hi≈øtory tells us that con≈øuls and ≈øenates have had clammy fingers: what has been, may be again. Thank heaven, our con≈øtitution does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øert us even here. We mu≈øt be <hi>all</hi> rogues, <hi>all</hi> rotten, before we can be ruined: when that indeed is the ca≈øe, there is no help for us; the body politic, like the natural body, mu≈øt be ≈øoon after entirely di≈ø≈øolved. They are both pa≈øt cure.</p>
            <p>Here let me declare my concern, that the congre≈øs ≈øent for the papers relative to <hi>the making</hi> of the Briti≈øh treaty. This ≈øtep appears to me to have been <hi>unnece≈ø≈øary,</hi> as the treaty it≈øelf was before them, a ≈øufficient ground to form their judgment upon. But the a≈øtoni≈øhment to hear it a≈ø≈øerted, that they had no right to enquire into its merits, mu≈øt have irritated many. Heat begets heat; and one part over≈øtretching one way, often fires the other to do the like their way. This is human nature collectively, as well as individually.</p>
            <p>I confe≈øs my≈øelf one, though no favourer of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øh treaty while pending, made very happy, at hearing that ≈øo many members, who had expre≈ø≈øed them≈øelves again≈øt it in the hou≈øe, had ≈øacrificed their private opinions to the peace of the public. But, indeed, I never at any time thought that treaty of ≈øuch moment, that it ≈øhould be refu≈øed to be provided for by our repre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atives.</p>
            <p>Farther, what is here ≈øaid, is intended to prove the con≈øtitutional right the congre≈øs have to con≈øider the merits of a treaty; not by any means to in≈øinuate, that upon every bad bargain, they ≈øhould deny to provide for a treaty. No! But upon the mo≈øt glaring, trying oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øions, like the Briti≈øh parliament <hi>(fas e≈øt et ab ho≈øte doceri)</hi> to exerci≈øe that right: this cau≈øes no interruption among≈øt them in making their treaties with foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who know they claim ≈øuch a right, and will exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øe it when they find it ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary. What
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032168_0008_0FF167BBC4933420"/>rea≈øonable objection can they then have to our doing it only on ≈øuch occa≈øions?</p>
            <p>I am aware that foreign nations, as well as bad pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidents and ≈øenates, would wi≈øh to ≈øee no po≈ø≈øibility of any <hi>after</hi> reckoning; but that the repre≈øentatives of the people ≈øhould be obliged to provide for any treaty laid before them, whatever may be its merits, duration or tendency. But our con≈øtitution provides an ample re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in ≈øuch ca≈øes, if the people but do their parts. Send hone≈øt, firm men, of good ≈øound common ≈øen≈øe, that can judge when it will be ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to apply that remedy; when not.</p>
            <p>Still pardon me, my worthy friends, for thinking the manner of carrying on the la≈øt election for our chief magi≈øtrate, very objectionable, and, if continued, ≈øeems in its tendency, not only calculated to foment and keep up heats and animo≈øities among≈øt us, but in no long time, I am afraid, to over≈øet our union, or ≈øplit and ≈øhiver us into many different governments; and if we once begin to divide, no one can fore≈øee the end of it.</p>
            <p>Our con≈øtitution ≈øays, <q>Each ≈øtate ≈øhall appoint, in ≈øuch manner as the legi≈ølature thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of ≈øenators and repre≈øentatives to which the ≈øtate may be entitled in the congre≈øs: <hi>but no ≈øenator, or repre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative, or per≈øon holding an office of tru≈øt or profit under the United States, ≈øhall be appointed an elector.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>The electors <hi>≈øhall</hi> meet in their re≈øpective ≈øtates, and <hi>[≈øhall]</hi> vote by ballot for <hi>two per≈øons,</hi> one of whom, at lea≈øt, ≈øhall not be an inhabitant of the ≈øame ≈øtate with them≈øelves; and they ≈øhall make a li≈øt of all the per≈øons voted for, and of the number of votes for each; which li≈øt they ≈øhall ≈øign and certify, and tran≈ømit, ≈øealed, to the ≈øeat of the government of the United States, directed to the pre≈øident of the ≈øenate. The pre≈øident of the ≈øenate ≈øhall, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of the ≈øenate and hou≈øe of repre≈øentatives, open all the certificates, and the votes ≈øhall then be
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032168_0009_0FF167BE9C3FE348"/>counted. The per≈øon having the greate≈øt number of votes ≈øhall be the pre≈øident, if ≈øuch number be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the whole number of electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have ≈øuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority, and have an equal number of votes, then the hou≈øe of repre≈øentatives ≈øhall immediately chu≈øe, by ballot, one of them for pre≈øident; and if no per≈øon have a majority, <hi>then, from the five highe≈øt on the li≈øt,</hi> the ≈øaid hou≈øe ≈øhall, in like manner, chu≈øe the pre≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. But in chu≈øing the pre≈øident, the votes ≈øhall be taken by ≈øtates, the repre≈øentatives from each ≈øtate having one vote; a quorum for this purpo≈øe ≈øhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt of a member or members from two-thirds of the ≈øtates: and a majority of all the ≈øtates ≈øhall be nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary to a choice. In every ca≈øe, after the choice of the pre≈øident, the per≈øon having the greate≈øt number of votes of the electors, ≈øhall be the vice-pre≈øident; but if there ≈øhould remain two or more, who have equal votes, the ≈øenate ≈øhall chu≈øe from them, by ballot, the vice-pre≈øident.</p>
               <p>The congre≈øs may determine the time of chu≈øing the electors, and the day on which they ≈øhall give their votes; which day ≈øhall be THE SAME throughout the United States.</p>
               <p>No per≈øon, except a natural born citizen, or a citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of the United States at the time of the adoption of this con≈øtitution, ≈øhall be eligible to the office of pre≈øident; neither ≈øhall any per≈øon be eligible to that office, who ≈øhall not have attained the age of thirty-five years, and been fourteen years a re≈øident within the United States.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Now, my fellow citizens, ≈øuppo≈øe we read the latter part of the fir≈øt of the≈øe clau≈øes, thus: <q>But NO PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON holding an office of tru≈øt or profit under the United States, ≈øhall be appointed an elector.</q> Do not the words, "no per≈øon," <hi>in them≈øelves,</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly include the ≈øenator and repre≈øentative, without their being particularly named, as with? Therefore, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032168_0010_0FF167C4F6657210"/>the≈øe words, <hi>"≈øenator or repre≈øentative,"</hi> are taken di≈øtinctly and ≈øeparately, as the characteri≈øtic of a legi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative capacity, they are altogether nugatory and ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. Whoever attends to the ≈øtyle of the con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will, I believe, find no where el≈øe in it, ≈øuch an <hi>unnecessary</hi> redundancy. Therefore, as it appears to me, ≈øenator and repre≈øentative being to be under≈øtood in the legi≈ølative character of each, and ONLY ≈øo, they are both excluded, by the intention of the con≈øtitution it≈øelf, from being electors; for, had it been de≈øigned that any a≈ø≈øembly ≈øhould have appointed the electors from among them≈øelves, preci≈øion required that the words <hi>from among them≈øelves,</hi> or others of like ≈øignification, ≈øhould have been in≈øerted: as no ≈øuch are, when they ≈øeem ≈øo nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary, no claim, e≈øpecially one of ≈øuch moment, ought to be a≈ø≈øumed from an, <hi>at lea≈øt, equivocal expre≈ø≈øion.</hi> Be≈øides, to a public body appointed to fix upon another public body, upon a bu≈øine≈øs of the greate≈øt importance, ≈øurely it mu≈øt ≈øeem awkward and indelicate, for the fir≈øt public body to chu≈øe out of them≈øelves, the whole, or 7-8ths of the other, upon an authority ≈øo doubtful and di≈øputable, as not preci≈øely and clearly giving them leave to appoint <hi>a ≈øingle one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again; the electors for a pre≈øident being equal, in every ≈øtate, to all the members in each of tho≈øe ≈øtates, (≈øenators and repre≈øentatives) taken together, the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ≈øeem to be left to be appointed by the repre≈øenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ONLY, (they being <hi>peculiarly</hi> the public's vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents) in order that our three departments of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the pre≈øident, ≈øenate, and repre≈øentative, might be ALL of a piece, ALL the choice of the people; and, therefore, ≈øuch electors, when thus cho≈øen to fix upon a pre≈øident, ought to be as free, un≈øhackled, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, as the members of the a≈ø≈øemblies them≈øelves, who are cho≈øen in each ≈øtate, to repre≈øent their re≈øpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive citizens at large. This, I think, cannot be denied; and, therefore, the elector, who, antecedent to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, has engaged to vote for any particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032168_0011_0FF167C695B236E8"/>≈øins, in my opinion, again≈øt the <hi>≈øpirit and vitals</hi> of the con≈øtitution; and, as far as in him lies, is ≈øapping it, and introducing precedents of the mo≈øt pe≈øtilential na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; preventing the choice of <hi>the chief magi≈øtrate</hi> from being as free, and as <hi>equally</hi> the people's choice, as that of the ≈øenate and repre≈øentatives, when they ought, <hi>all the three departments,</hi> to be ≈øo, as nearly as the peace and ≈øafety of the whole United States will admit. If, in any ≈øtate, it has unavoidably happened, through acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, their a≈ø≈øembly's meeting, or other unpremeditated circum≈øtances, that they have been obliged to ≈øtrain upon the meaning of the con≈øtitution, and to chu≈øe electors from among them≈øelves; ≈øuch ob≈øtacles ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved again≈øt the next election, that ≈øo dangerous a practice may not be ≈øanctioned by cu≈øtom; and any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ≈øtate, not wi≈øhing to be ≈øu≈øpected as unfriendly to the union, will chearfully conform its actions, ≈øo as, if po≈ø≈øible, not to interfere with the expectations of the con≈øtitution.</p>
            <p>Mankind are, generally, ≈øo unwilling to ≈øubmit to re≈øtraints or rules, that even ≈øuch as are made by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, are ≈øtrangely perverted, to gratify the pre≈øent moment; or e≈ø≈øential parts of them often neglected, through mere lazine≈øs, or inattention: for in≈øtance, the con≈øtitution plainly expects a number of candidates for the pre≈øident's place; or why the following injunction? <q>If no per≈øon have a majority, <hi>then,</hi> from THE FIVE HIGHEST on the li≈øt, the ≈øaid hou≈øe, ≈øhall, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, chu≈øe the pre≈øident.</q> Or why permit each ≈øtate to take one of the two per≈øons to be cho≈øen, from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves? It is owing to mere lazine≈øs, perver≈øene≈øs, or the arts of intriguing, de≈øigning men, played upon you, that you have been diverted from attending to, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuing this excellent, ≈øalutary provi≈øion? Are you infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated to your own de≈øtruction? I wi≈øh with all my heart, no ≈øtate of the union would ever, in future, neglect complying with this important <hi>con≈øtitutional</hi> right. Had they done this, in the la≈øt election, there would have
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032168_0012_0FF167C8328B25E0"/>been ≈øixteen candidates from among them≈øelves; and, if each ≈øtate had, be≈øides, cho≈øen the other citizen a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent one from the choice of any of the other ≈øtates, there would have been at lea≈øt ≈øixteen more: What then? We ≈øhould have mortified the ≈øly emi≈ø≈øaries, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the ≈øcenes,</hi> foreign and dome≈øtic, to ≈øee their <hi>deep</hi> plan, to ≈øet us all by the ears with one another, effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually defeated. But our delu≈øion this year, (I cannot help calling it ≈øo) may have been permitted, my friends, to happen ≈øo early in our national career, as a warning to us in future pre≈øidential elections, to be more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and tenacious of ≈øticking as clo≈øe as po≈ø≈øible to the plain meaning and expectation of our con≈øtitution, and not take upon us again, to be wi≈øe above what is written. Such a true republican procedure, will not occa≈øion, in my opinion, much, if any more trouble to congre≈øs, or to any particular ≈øtate. But ≈øuppo≈øing it does; let us not <hi>again</hi> be per≈øuaded <hi>out of our ≈øen≈øes,</hi> to ≈øhrink from it. Our happine≈øs, our independence, our exi≈øtence as a nation, depends greatly on our peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but firm, <hi>collective</hi> exertions in this re≈øpect, for the time to come.</p>
            <p>Some of the good effects probably will be,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, greatly to dimini≈øh, if not to bani≈øh entirely, that too prevailing ≈øpirit of jealou≈øy and party, from among us: tho≈øe mo≈øt formidable weapons, which we have ≈øo madly put into our enemies hands again≈øt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves; and dexterou≈øly do they know, we clearly ≈øee, when and how to wield them again≈øt us, to their own advantage. How di≈øtre≈ø≈øing is it to perceive a number of our back citizens, too unhappily po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed with an opinion, that the citizens on the ≈øea coa≈øt, or near it, having the opportunity, from their ≈øituation, to be ≈øoone≈øt and be≈øt informed, take advantage of them, to deceive and blind them into the choice of men be≈øt ≈øuitable to them≈øelves, and their purpo≈øes of trade and ≈øpeculation. Whil≈øt too many of the≈øe, on the other hand, as weakly and groundle≈øsly, ≈øeem to di≈øtre≈øs them≈øelves that the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032168_0013_0FF167CB0C24BBF0"/>back country want to cram down their throats, by their numbers, whatever mea≈øures of government they may think proper. To bani≈øh this dreadful daemon, by taking the ≈øting, if po≈ø≈øible, out of tho≈øe ≈øly, ambitious, mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief-making go-betweens, of <hi>both town and country,</hi> that rai≈øe and foment the≈øe jealou≈øies, is the ardent wi≈øh of the writer of this paper. 'Tis a nece≈ø≈øary, but Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culean ta≈øk; and without your ≈øtrong exertions, my friends, cannot be effectually done. For the≈øe men, deficient in no arts of effrontery or cajolement, can tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them≈øelves, occa≈øionally, into any characters; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling up and down, backwards and forwards, like Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, ≈øeeking whom they may deceive and pervert, to aid their treacherous or ambitious purpo≈øes. What mi≈øchief have they done in almo≈øt every ≈øtate! But ≈øo far, happy for us, one whole≈øome, ≈økilfully applied ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicon, will operate alike in all the ≈øtates, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly effect a radical cure. 'Tis this‚ÄîOnly let us all re≈øolve to entertain no ungenerous ≈øentiments of each other, (at lea≈øt, not ≈øo as to affect the public at large) remembering that we are all citizens of one and the ≈øame great government; have one great COMMON inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt, and that nothing but ≈øuch unnatural, ≈øhocking, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic mi≈øtru≈øts among one another, can keep us from being as great a government as ever the ≈øun ≈øhined on. Away, then, with the≈øe jealou≈øies among our≈øelves; turn all your re≈øentment, my fellow citizens, again≈øt the≈øe ≈øly, political, pretending, bettering gents; the≈øe ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious zealots for reformation; the≈øe mi≈øchievous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagators of innovation! It warms me beyond mea≈øure, when I think of their impo≈øitions; e≈øpecially, when I ≈øee how ea≈øily you ≈øwallow them. Can you avoid ≈øeeing how the≈øe gents ≈øtart them≈øelves into con≈øequence, merely by ≈øtriving, underhandedly, to ≈øet us all in a flame? Their fir≈øt ≈øtep, after feeling their power of delu≈øion, is generally to riggle them≈øelves into our ≈øtate a≈ø≈øemblies: ≈øucce≈øs here, prompts them, by means of their fluent tongues and pliant con≈øciences, a≈ø≈øi≈øted by your own
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032168_0014_0FF167D01C035F18"/>mo≈øt unaccountable infatuation, to look up to a ≈øeat in congre≈øs; and often do they gain their ends. After ≈øo many in≈øtances of their treading the ≈øame <hi>beaten</hi> path, one after another, is it not a≈øtoni≈øhing that you <hi>≈øtill</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to countenance the breed? At lea≈øt, if po≈ø≈øible, in future, prevent their going to congre≈øs to ≈øpread their mi≈øchief there. That body hitherto, upon the whole, has given great ≈øatisfaction; too many of the≈øe ambitious dividers among them, will, if not prevented in time, probably over≈øet us all. Here act like true, generous federali≈øts; prefer the general, to your particular good, and keep them at home, though you di≈ølike their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, if you can do no better, by all the means in your power. If each ≈øtate would only ≈øo far baulk ≈øuch ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical citizens in their ambitious career, we ≈øhould ≈øoon not only get rid of them, but demon≈øtrate to all the world, that for a man to ri≈øe in the United States, was only by noble, manly, virtuous means; by ≈øincerely and ≈øteadily promoting the general welfare; by overlooking ≈ømall inconveniences; by treating ≈ømall errors with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne≈øs, and by di≈øintere≈øtedly endeavouring to heal tho≈øe of con≈øequence, by fair, friendly and candid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoning. But rea≈øoning will have no effect upon the men ju≈øt hinted at; they are callous to every noble, generous, tender feeling; <hi>≈øelf is their all.</hi> But our keeping clo≈øe to the expectations of the con≈øtitution, will much le≈ø≈øen even their power of doing mi≈øchief, in many re≈øpects.</p>
            <p>Another advantage is this: that no foreign nation would hardly attempt, <hi>again,</hi> to interfere in our elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from the little pro≈øpect of ≈øucce≈øs in corrupting ≈øixteen ≈øtates, chu≈øing their chief magi≈øtrate <hi>at one and the ≈øame time.</hi> And ≈øuppo≈øe the found means to tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with three or four, the re≈øt would be fully ≈øufficient to ≈øhelter us from the bad effects of their corruption. But, could our enemies, them≈øelves, have wi≈øhed for a finer opportunity, than that given them at our la≈øt elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to chu≈øe a chief magi≈øtrate for us; having then to manoeuvre with the parties of only two men, pitted
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032168_0015_0FF167D1B5878D60"/>again≈øt one another <hi>by our≈øelves.</hi> This certainly was making fine ≈øport for, and co≈øting them le≈øs daubing, and le≈øs trouble.</p>
            <p>Again; out of the thirty-two citizens to be cho≈øen by the electors of the ≈øixteen ≈øtates, only two, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution, could be approved. This, far from occa≈øion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any heart-burnings to the other thirty citizens, they would rather think it an honour (as it certainly would be) to have been <hi>≈øo far</hi> di≈øtingui≈øhed by their fellow citizens in their different ≈øtates, and held up as worthy of the mo≈øt important offices; and though kept back for the pre≈øent, would be like a corps of re≈øerve again≈øt the next election, with this advantage to the public in general, that in the interim, we may all grow better acquainted with the real merit of each; and if elected again by their own citizens, it would be a high ≈øign of their fixed reputation.</p>
            <p>Another advantage of this ≈øtrict adherence to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution, would be, that the nation in general, the United States them≈øelves, could not be reflected on, as carrying even the appearance of countenancing parties; whereas, in the la≈øt election, the nation ≈øeemed to ≈øplit it≈øelf into two parties, through <hi>predilection</hi> for two citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; a long noted, dreadful rock, a Cae≈øar and Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey, a Scylla and Charybdis. We ought to have <hi>no predilection</hi> for any citizen. 'Tis of no con≈øequence to the nation, what citizen, <hi>from one end of it to the other,</hi> is at our head, ≈øo that he is rightly cho≈øen; an hone≈øt man, a ≈øteady, firm federali≈øt, no party man, of good ≈øound common ≈øen≈øe, and otherwi≈øe con≈øtitutionally qualified. And here, I hope, I ≈øhall be pardoned for ≈øaying, I always looked upon tho≈øe as very weak friends, or artful, in≈øidious, undermining enemies, who made the execution of our pre≈øident's office ≈øo difficult, as requiring ≈øuch extraordinary, uncommon talents. Plain failing ≈øuits our con≈øtitution be≈øt: tricks, twi≈øtings, jo≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and deep laid, equivocal ≈øubterfuges in treaty-making, let European powers divert each other with,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032168_0016_0FF167D3569812A8"/>and welcome. Our thou≈øand league di≈øtance from the≈øe cunning, double refined politicians, (with whom, the le≈øs we have to do, the better) is not among the lea≈øt of the ble≈ø≈øings we have to thank a kind Providence for‚Äî Capitulations or treaties, with either Great-Britain or France, we have experienced already, mean any thing, every thing, or nothing, at times, as may ≈øuit either. But let us mind our own bu≈øine≈øs; take as much care as we can of our≈øelves; be a party in none of their wars; what treaties we may find it nece≈ø≈øary to make with them, let them not be of long duration, and let us, on our parts, keep them faithfully. Hone≈øty is the be≈øt and true≈øt policy‚ÄîI think we have hitherto ob≈øerved this rule, and hope we ≈øhall always. Our pre≈øident, in treaty making, has the ≈øenate to con≈øult; without two-thirds of the members pre≈øent, agreeing and advi≈øing him to make a treaty, he cannot do it. What great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty then, can ari≈øe to an hone≈øt man, qualified as ju≈øt mentioned, with ≈øuch a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, that he can ≈øcruple to encounter?</p>
            <p>No ≈øtate, or number of ≈øtates ≈øhould, in my opinion, give the lea≈øt rea≈øon to ≈øu≈øpect, that they wi≈øh to ≈øet up or name, upon the≈øe occa≈øions, <hi>directly or indirectly,</hi> any man or men, in a manner that may carry the mo≈øt di≈øtant rea≈øon to ≈øu≈øpect they wi≈øh to pu≈øh him or them through the re≈øt of the ≈øtates; the more delicacy ≈øhewn, the better; let every ≈øtate be left <hi>entirely</hi> to it≈øelf. Such a cautious, <hi>unmeddling</hi> behaviour in each ≈øtate, will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally promote harmony, and di≈øcard every degree of ≈øu≈øpicion and jealou≈øy among≈øt our≈øelves as ≈øeparate ≈øtates.

            <p>Finding that the import of the few minutes I had made, with regard to the in≈øulting appeal of the French mini≈øter to the people at large, has been laid before you by much better pens, in the public prints; I ≈øhall now content my≈øelf with ob≈øerving, that a ≈øtranger phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non has hardly been hard of in the political world, than that an ab≈øolute monarch over one and the ≈øame people, ≈øhould, for the manife≈øt intere≈øt of that nation, a≈ø≈øi≈øt another people to recover their liberties, and become republicans; that that very nation, but a few years there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ≈øhould guillotine that monarch, in order to become republicans them≈øelves; and, when hardly fixed as ≈øuch, ≈øhould, regardle≈øs of a ≈øolemn treaty with the people they had a≈ø≈øi≈øted, like free-booters, ≈øuddenly and unju≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiably fall upon their trade, and intermeddle with their government, in a manner they, them≈øelves, have ≈øhewn all the world they would not ≈øuffer the lea≈øt glimp≈øe of an attempt. What can this proceed from, but a roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic giddine≈øs of a re≈øtle≈øs power, ≈øetting it≈øelf <hi>no bounds;</hi> or, not unlikely, prompted be≈øides, by a jealou≈øy of our ri≈øing importance among the trading nations of the world, and wi≈øhing to check it? And here, by the bye, we ≈øhall much deceive our≈øelves, if we imagine the other trading nations of Europe, are without the like jealou≈øy; for, however they may differ in other re≈øpects, they ≈øeem not far from being unanimous in this. I only wi≈øh we were as firmly agreed, in pur≈øuing our own common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt and ≈øupporting our con≈øtitution and government; harbouring no mi≈øtru≈øts of either of its departments;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032168_0018_0FF167DB6959C8F0"/>Their management, for eight years pa≈øt, having ≈øhewn them, upon the whole, not unworthy or incapable of their tru≈øt. We had it not in our power to ≈øend angels; as men, they have acquitted them≈øelves to the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the world. Any political differences that may ari≈øe in <hi>particular</hi> ≈øtates, ≈øhould, like <hi>family variances,</hi> be kept <hi>within</hi> tho≈øe ≈øtates. Congre≈øs ought not to be affected by them; and, indeed, will not, I think, if our elections are managed ≈øtrictly, according to the letter and ≈øpirit of the con≈øtitution.</p>
            <p>No foreign mini≈øter whatever, I think, has a right to make appeals to the people at large; but the French mini≈øter has done this. On ≈øuch occa≈øions <hi>particularly,</hi> my friends, every re≈øpectful mark of confidential affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ought to be ≈øhewn to all our three departments of government, that it may be ≈øeen how ready the people are to give them every ≈øupport in their power; and all fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign mini≈øters be convinced, that any little, indirect ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices of that ≈øort, only ≈øerve to unite the people, if po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible, more firmly among them≈øelves, to oppo≈øe all ≈øuch attempts, and to ≈øhew, in the ≈øtronge≈øt manner, their ≈øtrict attention to their own rulers.</p>
            <p>I cannot laugh at my fellow citizens, I am ≈øure, for their zealous, uncommon attachment to the French na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on account of their aid in our ≈øtruggle with Great-Britain; for, I believe, few have been more ≈øo than my≈øelf. That their intere≈øt, as a nation, induced them to exert them≈øelves to make the diver≈øion they did, I never had the lea≈øt doubt of: their not doing it <hi>before</hi> Burgoyne's defeat, that <hi>capital</hi> turn of the war in our favour, ≈øhewed their <hi>cautious</hi> re≈øolve to be on the <hi>≈øure</hi> ≈øide. Yet, ≈øtill, they had a right to our gratitude, but, not that we ≈øhould involve our≈øelves in ruin, or neglect our own pre≈ø≈øing affairs as a nation. But now, my friends, we mu≈øt have eyes ≈øurely that ≈øee not, if their <hi>very great love and friend≈øhip</hi> do not appear to us in their <hi>genuine</hi> colours, every atom, ≈øelf-intere≈øted <hi>to the extreme;</hi> craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily intended to make us merely their puppets; to move
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032168_0019_0FF167DE3613CBB8"/>by, and <hi>only</hi> by their wire. But, my fellow citizens, be afraid of only <hi>their intrigues,</hi> again≈øt which, by what we have <hi>already ≈øeen,</hi> we mu≈øt be well a≈ø≈øured, we cannot be too much on our guard; their long, well-train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed emi≈ø≈øaries are but <hi>every where</hi> among≈øt us. Quiet re≈øignation to the re≈øolves of the government <hi>we, our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves,</hi> have ≈øet up, is my <hi>uppermo≈øt political maxim.</hi> But, exclu≈øive of this, I never thought I ≈øhould have been brought to like the Briti≈øh treaty, half ≈øo well as I do now: Providence ≈øeems to have thrown it in our way, as the means to bring about our being weaned, <hi>in time,</hi> from our over-ardent, too rapturous French love-≈øit. But do not, my friends, ≈øurmi≈øe from hence, that I mean, indirectly, to per≈øuade you to a relap≈øe to your former flame; by no means: we cannot but, by this time, know them both right well; to divide you is equally their aim. Corruption, we all know, is the mo≈øt powerful wedge of divi≈øion: watch, therefore, all tho≈øe ≈øubjects which ≈øeem to have a crack ready to receive this wedge; keep a ≈øtrict look out here, and your political peace and happine≈øs will, in all probability, be la≈øtingly ≈øecured. On our ≈øea coa≈øts they may ≈øcratch us; but not much, even there, if our country and other friends are alert to a≈ø≈øi≈øt us. But, in the end, I am fully per≈øuaded, they will deeply wound them≈øelves. For what can the French, THEMSELVES ALONE, bring very formidable again≈øt the United States? In what a number of ≈øhips and tran≈øports? And, <hi>while bringing,</hi> to how many accidents expo≈øed, in cro≈ø≈øing the Atlantic? And for what national purpo≈øe to them, <hi>cui bono?</hi> We have been obliged to fight, and though all of us deprecate being reduced to that <hi>unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> nece≈ø≈øity again; yet, if compelled, there is not the lea≈øt doubt that our citizens, from one end of the union to the other, will turn out again with the <hi>like</hi> ≈øpirit, and advantaged by <hi>≈øome</hi> experience, again≈øt any invaders, however giddily and romanticly impelled; relying on the ≈øame providential a≈ø≈øi≈øtance that has never failed us hitherto.</p>

Numbers freely allow, theoretically at lea≈øt, that all governmental power ought to ≈øpring from the people at large. But mo≈øt of the≈øe very men again ≈øay, that prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, they, the people, have from all ages ≈øhewn, that they know not how to u≈øe power when they have it, or to be contented <hi>long,</hi> under con≈øtitutions that have ≈øprung <hi>entirely</hi> from them≈øelves. Our's is of this ≈øort, in the ample≈øt manner: it has not only ≈øprung, but, IN EVERY STEP, proceeded <hi>under</hi> the people's au≈øpices; and, at la≈øt, has ≈øolemnly received their con≈øent.</p>
            <p>You may, perhaps, think me, my fellow citizens, a very great enthu≈øia≈øt to our con≈øtitution, when I give it as my ≈øincere opinion, that the world never had ≈øo good a one manufactured by man. Let all of us, therefore, join heart and hand to make it as la≈øting as po≈ø≈øible, and have the honour to ≈øuperannuate ≈øuch a≈ø≈øertions, ≈øo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely derogatory, di≈øgraceful and mortifying to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature. To countenance no tamperers with it, will much forward ≈øuch an animating re≈øolution. As the I≈øraelites were ordered to have the words which Mo≈øes commanded them, in their hearts, and to write them on the po≈øts of their hou≈øes, and on their gates; ≈øo let us imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate this injunction with our con≈øtitution, that excellent, (I think) heavenly gift <hi>al≈øo,</hi> by having it hung up in the mo≈øt con≈øpicuous places in our hou≈øes; and, if the fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well legacy of our worthy friend, Pre≈øident Wa≈øhington, was joined with it, our ri≈øing generation, in my opinion, would want nothing farther, compleatly to under≈øtand, admire and love it. I always was, and very early, in congre≈øs, ≈øhewed my≈øelf again≈øt any irregular predilec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a citizen to any office whatever; but, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly elected, and he has ≈øerved with reputation to him≈øelf, and done the public every ≈øervice that could be expected from him in his ≈øtation; we thus have had va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue received, and ought, in our turn, from gratitude, as good policy, to ≈øhew him, in his retirement, all the re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and honour we can, ≈øuitable to the ≈øtation he has held. The thus joining Pre≈øident Wa≈øhington's farewell
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032168_0021_0FF167E2BABF3710"/>addre≈øs, to our con≈øtitution, which he hath ≈øo long, ≈øo hone≈øtly, and firmly ≈øupported, will have a <hi>particular</hi> propriety in it, and, I think, be a greater mark of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him, than if his ≈øtatue was ≈øet up in every ≈øtate.</p>
            <p>Like true republicans, my friends, whatever is once con≈øtitutionally carried, whether by a ≈øingle, or number of votes, the very nature, the foundation-≈øpring of our con≈øtitution, call upon you to ≈øubmit quietly to, and to ≈øupport it, if nece≈ø≈øary; otherwi≈øe, as far as is with you, you ≈øeem to turn tyrants, determined to carry, at all events, your own opinion, joined with <hi>the fewe≈øt,</hi> again≈øt the con≈øtitutional re≈øolve, though attended with <hi>the greate≈øt</hi> number of votes. Is not this a ≈øtrong imitation of the <hi>≈øic volo, ≈øic jubeo,</hi> of a tyrant? Will you not, by thus acting, <hi>le≈ø≈øen</hi> your right of being a republic? And, if you ≈øtill indulge ≈øuch an overbearing ≈øpirit, can it be long before you <hi>lo≈øe it altogether?</hi> The congre≈øs, unle≈øs an extreme bad choice is made, if wrong, will ≈øoon rectify their error them≈øelves. Publications in the papers too, decently managed, often have, and may again, by giving u≈øeful hints, be of great ≈øervice; but, tumultuous oppo≈øition an≈øwers no end, but to di≈øgrace the promoters, to cau≈øe us to be laughed at by anti-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans, to create confu≈øion, and to make ill-blood among≈øt our≈øelves.</p>
            <p>The calling conventions of the people, on general governmental affairs, I confe≈øs, I am now no friend to. During our ≈øtruggle with Great-Britain, they were ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times unavoidable. The lea≈øt objectionable in≈øtance, ≈øeems to me, is, when the pre≈øident, after having duly con≈øulted the ≈øenate about a treaty, <hi>≈øtill</hi> appears to be (as it were) at bay, and therefore defers putting his fiat thereto, as if wi≈øhing to know the general opinion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; here, if conducted with propriety and decency, they may, perhaps, be ≈øometimes of u≈øe.</p>
            <p>Members, ≈øent from each particular ≈øtate, when met in congre≈øs, belong, certainly, <hi>to the whole nation at
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032168_0022_0FF167E6B7727540"/>large,</hi> to con≈øult for their general welfare, <hi>as one body.</hi> They ought, therefore, to go unfettered. That mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber who will ≈øuffer him≈øelf to be fettered, in my opinion, is not worthy of his ≈øeat. He cannot be a true, firm, ≈øtaunch federali≈øt at heart: for, as the poet ≈øays, truly,
<q>
                  <l>"Man, like the gen'rous vine, SUPPORTED lives,</l>
                  <l>"The ≈øtrength he gains, is from TH' EMBRACE he gives.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So a ≈øingle ≈øtate, the more ≈øtrongly it <hi>embraces</hi> the whole general intere≈øt united, the more it will find, in the end, its own real importance promoted and <hi>≈øtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened,</hi> and on the mo≈øt ≈øolid ba≈øis. And the particular member, who <hi>uniformly</hi> acts on this principle, will find his own reputation, not only in the ≈øtate that ≈øent him, among men of true worth, fixed upon the mo≈øt reput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and la≈øting footing; but, among the re≈øt of the ≈øtates, he will always be mentioned with the highe≈øt e≈øteem.</p>
            <p>No man has more heart-felt joy than my≈øelf, to find our young nation, but of ye≈øterday, already become the a≈øylum from tyranny, wherever ≈øhewing it≈øelf. Let our fellow men come and welcome, from any where and in any numbers, we have room enough for them all. The only dread to be apprehended <hi>to them, as well as to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves,</hi> is the mi≈øchievous u≈øe, artful, wicked men, (and too many ≈øuch we have) may make of the long fixed habits and bia≈øes they may bring with them; by cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly playing and practi≈øing upon them the≈øe habits, to pervert them to their own diabolical purpo≈øes, before we have time to get thoroughly acquainted with each other.</p>
            <p>Men devoted to particular, ancient families, having had famous names, from their infancy, ≈øounded in their ears, and applauded like demi-gods, in the ≈øports and ≈øongs of their native country; I ≈øay, men of this ca≈øt, are too apt to be taken in by de≈øigning, watchful way-layers. In the beginning of our ≈øtruggle with Great-Britain, we had a formidable number of Scotch, in
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032168_0023_0FF167E855A0F8D8"/>North-Carolina, ≈øo infatuated to the race of Stuart, as to cau≈øe much trouble to them≈øelves and us. From ≈øome items, not very long ≈øince in the papers, with regard to ≈øu≈øpect, there may be ≈øome du≈øt attempted to be kicked up among≈øt tho≈øe of that nation, to put them upon that, or ≈øome other family track. But, my Iri≈øh friends, be on your guard: I take the liberty to give you this hint, as being of Iri≈øh extract my≈øelf, by the mother's ≈øide, who≈øe father was a native of Ireland, whom I am named after.</p>
            <p>Your open, manly, generous, un≈øu≈øpecting ≈øpirit, is well known; ≈øo is the tincture of credulity, naturally ≈øpringing therefrom, as well known. Here you have <hi>often</hi> been, here you will ≈øtill <hi>often</hi> be played upon, and your greate≈øt caution is nece≈ø≈øary to prevent it. Your di≈øtre≈ø≈øes in Ireland, we have heard of; have felt and ≈øympathized with you on that occa≈øion. We are happy to know our country can relieve you; and you will ≈øoon find your≈øelves, in all probability, actually relieved, if you do not ≈øuffer your≈øelves to be cajoled into parties to di≈øtre≈øs us, and, in the end, di≈øtre≈øs and di≈øappoint your≈øelves of that a≈ø≈øi≈øtance you wi≈øh for. You are now in a land, that with half the indu≈øtry and prudence you were obliged to u≈øe Ireland, you may gain a landed property, all <hi>really your own,</hi> ≈øufficient to ≈øupport your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves and families decently and independently. Let this very heart-chearing pro≈øpect add ≈øpurs to your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du≈øtry; ≈øtrive to ri≈øe gradually, peaceably and hone≈øtly, and pay no attention to foreign emi≈ø≈øaries, emissaries, or to re≈øtle≈øs, de≈øigning, ambitious men, among≈øt our≈øelves, wi≈øhing to come country or family over you, or, in ≈øome other artful manner, to draw our now COMMON country into confu≈øion, for their <hi>≈øelfi≈øh</hi> ends. Take this in good part, my worthy, un≈øu≈øpicious friends, however imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and officious you may think it; in whatever light it may appear, or be made to appear to you, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcious it comes from an unde≈øigning brea≈øt, that loves
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032168_0024_0FF167E9FA65CC70"/>you, and wi≈øhes for nothing more than to ≈øee peace, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and univer≈øal philanthropy promoted, not only from one end of the United States, but from one end of the world to the other.</p>
            <p>I am per≈øuaded, from what I have ≈øeen, that more than half the misfortunes of any con≈øequence, that have happened among≈øt us, has been cau≈øed from the precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of hone≈øt men, not aware of, or giving them≈øelves <hi>time</hi> to guard again≈øt the ≈øecret, deep-laid, round-about ambu≈øhes of crafty knaves, indefatigably labouring to have no body credited but them≈øelves; and mo≈øt of the≈øe men, ≈øo deceived, have been convinced too late, as well for their's, as the public's peace, of their own ha≈øty, infatuated credulity, being the ≈øole occa≈øion of all the mi≈øchief.</p>
            <p>My reader, ≈øtill permit an old man one ≈ømall digre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion. Little things, mere names and ≈øounds, have ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times con≈øiderable effects. I have often wi≈øhed the name of our nation was Columbia; and, more than once, took, when I had a right, ≈øome pains to have it ≈øo. One of our citizens calling him≈øelf a Columbian, would ≈øound, I confe≈øs, more <hi>hone≈øtly</hi> in my ear, than now, as in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, calling him≈øelf an American, and, I am ≈øure, more harmoniou≈øly than <hi>an United States man;</hi> or than, by an awkward periphra≈øe, (that few, if any, can bring them≈øelves to) <hi>a man of the United States.</hi> From hence, it ≈øeems to me, the word <hi>American,</hi> is ≈øo, continually, by foreigners as well as by our≈øelves, applied to our per≈øons, trade, cu≈øtoms, &amp;c. as, the American trade, an American ≈øhip, &amp;c. ≈øcarcely ever, I believe, <hi>an United States ≈øhip,</hi> &amp;c. Again; the word American, (citizen being <hi>under≈øtood,</hi> ≈øeldom <hi>expre≈ø≈øed</hi>) ≈øtands alone, which, every time I hear it named, methinks I hear the ≈øhade of the great Columbus reproaching us for abetting and continuing the cheat upon him, who, though like Horace, he might ≈øay <hi>exegi monumentum oere perennius;</hi> yet, that republicans ≈øeem to wi≈øh, and even to take pains to de≈øtroy it: for, is it not full as ea≈øy for one of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032168_0025_0FF167ECE6604F70"/>our citizens to ≈øay abroad, I am a Columbian; which, too, if adopted, would be peculiar and preci≈øe, than to ≈øay, as they do, <hi>indi≈øtinctly,</hi> I am an American; merely to avoid, as it ≈øeems to me, this uncouth expre≈ø≈øion, I am <hi>a United States man;</hi> or, this round-about one, <hi>I am a citizen of the United States.</hi> This ≈øhews what pains is taken among≈øt us, and how much out of the common road, to countenance inju≈øtice. Pardon this ≈øen≈øibility in favour of the fame of a man, dead ≈øeveral hundred years ≈øince.</p>
            <p>The writer of this paper is an old public ≈øervant. No citizen, high or low, in or out of office, from one end of the United States to the other, was earlier than he, in the Briti≈øh ≈øtruggle. He, like the widow with her mite, put his all into that cau≈øe, his per≈øon; his ≈øervices to the utmo≈øt of his power; his property of town and country, were all, from the fir≈øt to the la≈øt of that ≈øtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, at the public ≈øervice, and made by them, at times, very free with, for which he never demanded, or wi≈øhed to demand, one farthing compen≈øation; excepting in the three fir≈øt congre≈ø≈øes, to which he had the honour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solicited, to be called out by his fellow citizens; of the provi≈øion for that ≈øervice, he partook.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides, indeed, when his country property was ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øtered, and his town, though under protection of a capitulation, taken from him, was in very little better ≈øituation; him≈øelf ≈øent and made a clo≈øe pri≈øoner at Augu≈øtine; his family ≈øhipped off to Philadelphia, and in di≈øtre≈øs there; he then ≈øhared part of ≈øome public a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, which he afterwards <hi>repaid</hi> to our public trea≈øurer, with intere≈øt. Not improbably, it may be ≈øaid, vanity is the impul≈øe here; be it ≈øo, my reader. But I intreat you to believe it forced out from a wi≈øh to procure attention to the VERY IMPORTANT HINTS in this paper, as coming from a well-known, independent, friendly fellow citizen, devoted to our con≈øtitutional union, and therefore,</p>
