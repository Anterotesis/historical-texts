            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>SUndry Judicious and Learned (in both <hi>Englands</hi>) upon the perusal of the following <hi>Sermons,</hi> have professed that the <hi>Author</hi> hath therein done like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and (according to the wisdome given unto him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> God) comprehended in a little room, the Substance of what is to be said, in <hi>Defence</hi> of that <hi>Cause,</hi> which in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ast Age hath been so abundantly confirmed, both by Words and Sufferings of many of the Lords faithfull Servants. I have known some in that City where these <hi>Sermons</hi> were Preached, who although by reason of their adherence to <hi>Hierarchical Principles,</hi> they esteemed the Author as one of their greatest Opposites, yet would say of him, That for a Scriptural, Logical, Methodical Preacher, they never knew his equall.</p>
            <p>It hath been the <hi>Fate</hi> (may we use that word) attending the Posthumous Works of many Learned men, that they have come forth with a <hi>Caetera desiderantur,</hi> as is to be seen in sundry of our great <hi>Rainold</hi> his Praelections <hi>de libr. Apocr.</hi> (not to mention others) And so it is here: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, this Copy is perfect so far as it goeth, having been, not onely perused by the <hi>Author</hi> himself, but a great part of it written with his own hand, (who saw cause to enlarge the <hi>Second Sermon</hi> especially, after it was Preached) from whom I received it some yeares ago, we being then both of us in the same Land; but we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained


<pb facs="unknown:000151_0003_0FA2B7D8CBA80628"/>
to part, before he could cause all his Meditations and Collections on this Subject to be Transcribed. That defect notwithstanding, it hath been conceived, that if what is here presented, should be in this way brought into publick light, it would conduce very much towards the establishment of many in <hi>the present Truth,</hi> both in the Land where these Sermons were Preached, and amongst us also, who are <hi>Exiles</hi> for the same Cause, should any number of Copies (as after Printed, 'tis hoped there may) happen to be dispersed amongst us they are therefore Transmitted for the Press.</p>
            <p>The most specious Reason, which our Opposites seem to have for the impleaded <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> is the <hi>pretended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency</hi> of them. Were that so, yet considering that the <hi>Imposition</hi> of them is attended with <hi>Scandal</hi> to many <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi> who embrace these <hi>Superstitions</hi> with relucting Consciences, yea with <hi>Scandal</hi> to <hi>Papists,</hi> who are thereby <hi>hardened</hi> in their Idolatries; since as one well saith, <hi>The Ceremonies are Monuments of Popery, the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of Antichrist, and the Reliques of</hi> Romes <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Bravery,</hi> they therefore ought to be called <hi>Nehushtan.</hi> I wish that some who are much taken with that <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anizing,</hi> and at last <hi>Papizing,</hi> and most corrupt Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> (who is extremely followed by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Praelatical men admired Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> who in his <hi>Notes</hi> on the <hi>Nevv Testament,</hi> hath shewed all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible favour to Antichrist; which things I am the rather willing to mention, not to detract any thing from the worth or deserved praise of those Authors, in respect of their great Learning, but that young Students may be Cautioned against sucking in poison from their Writings; I say, I wish such) would remember <hi>Grotius</hi> his Note on the Text which is in the following Discourses largely and elaborately discussed, <hi>Egregium (inquit) documentum Regibus, ut quamvis

                  </gap>, malè usurpantur, è conspectu tollant, ne ponant ostendiculum caecis.</hi> But besides that Argument (which yet is not easily answered) the <hi>ensuing Discourses</hi> demonstrate, That to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Popish,</hi> or any <hi>Non-instituted Ceremonies,</hi> a <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious state</hi> and use in the Worship of God, is absolutely sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as being a direct <hi>violation</hi> of the <hi>Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confess there are other large and elaborate Tractates on the Subjects here treated on, which as yet remain unanswered, such as Mr. <hi>Parker of the Cross,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> his <hi>Fresh Suit against Ceremonies,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gelaspy</hi>'s <hi>Dispute against English Popish Ceremonies.</hi> Indeed some have glanced at less materiall Passages in the Books mentioned, but never any (that I could hear of) did strike at their whole Frame, or undertake (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) to answer them, or any one of them. Nevertheless, the Publication of the Sermons here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with emitted, hath not been thought unnecessary, because they are in a Method suited to vulgar Capacities, and contain in few Pages the strength and substance of what others have voluminously expressed. Nor can those other Tractates be easily obtained, or digested by the ordinary sort of Readers, as these may. And who knoweth, but the Lord may bless what is here made publick, for the Enlightening and Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of <hi>the Rising Generation,</hi> that they also having their Mindes well informed, and girt about with Truth, may be able to suffer, rather then comply with <hi>Prelatick Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions,</hi> (or with <hi>Erastianism</hi>) for <hi>non-conformity</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, our blessed Fathers suffered many things, and not in vain? I will likewise confess, that the remembrance of the awful Saying of that Ancient, had some impression upon my spirit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to this Publication, <hi>Non solùm ille proditor verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis est qui palàm mendacium pro veritate loquitur, sed etiam ille qui non liberè pronuntiat veritatem.</hi>

               <pb facs="unknown:000151_0005_0FA2B7DA3B7C9F58"/>Now the same Spirit that breathed mightily in the Preacher, when <hi>(vivâ voce)</hi> delivering what is here Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, go along with his Truth, that the Lords Name may be glorified, and his People edified thereby. Which is the Prayer of him, who hath still an earnest desire to be found not onely amongst <hi>Witnesses,</hi> but (if the will of God be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him) amongst <hi>Sufferers,</hi> on that account of <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying against the Superstitions and Corruptions of the Times.</hi>

Observe. <hi>That it is a thing very right and pleasing in the sight of God, when the sin of Idolatry and all the monuments of it, all the remembrances, and remainders of it are quite destroyed, and rooted up from amongst his people.</hi> For thus <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> did, and it is said in the third verse, he did that wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. Whereas it is noted of him, that he trusted in the Lord God of Israel, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. Observe from hence. <hi>That nothing will carry a man through in the work of Reformation, but trusting, and relying upon God by Faith.</hi> For so did this good King: A man may begin, reforme a little, and doe something in the work of God as <hi>Jehu</hi> did, for his own ends, but he never went through with it, because he trusted not in the Lord God of Israel, but in his own carnal policy; therefore he left the calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> removing some Idols, but leaving others: but to goe through with the work, requires a Spirit plainly Heroical, a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Faith, and firm relyance, and dependance upon God. There be so many, and to the eye of carnal reason, such insuperable difficulties and impediments in the work of Reformation, That a man shall never be able to surmount and get above them without an Almighty assistance from the Lord: <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here were sad reproaches, and discouragements from men, but his hope was in the Lord, he trusted in the Lord God of Israel.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From his preheminence in Piety above all his Predecessors and Successors; Observe. <hi>That a reforming Spirit in Magistrates as it is very excel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that these three, <hi>David, Hezekiah, Iosiah,</hi> were the three great Reformers, and therefore when it is said, there was none like <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> the expression is a little Hyperbolical, and but a little, for there was but two more amongst all the Kings of Judah: The meaning therefore is not <hi>prorsus nemo,</hi> but <hi>fère nemo,</hi> as <hi>Piscator</hi> well expounds it. For it is the Hebrew phrase of Speech to use a Negative, when it intends a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative. There is a parallel expression in <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.<hi>19. None that goe to her return again,</hi> that is, very, very few, <hi>not one of a thousand,</hi> but some there are; as <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> out of whom Christ did cast seven unclean Devils, but where will you finde such another?

            <p>It is true, there were some other reforming Kings in <hi>Iudah</hi>; but none like these who were <hi>the first three,</hi> for the rest had great blemishes. <hi>Asa</hi> was a reforming King, but there is one black mark upon him, for he persecuted the Prophet <hi>Hanani,</hi> for reproving him; and he oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed some of the people at the same time, whereby his Sun did set under such a Cloud that some have questioned whether he was a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man; <hi>2 Chron. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Iehosaphat</hi> did Reforme Religion, but he entred into a sinfull League with that great Idolater <hi>Ahab,</hi> and though the Prophet <hi>Iehu</hi> reproved him for it, 2 <hi>Chron. 19.2.</hi> and though we do not finde that he was so exceeding vile as to persecute the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet for it, yet he fell into the same sin again with <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> for which God destroyed his Navy, and broke his Fleet of Ships that should have gone to <hi>Tarshish,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron. 20. ult.</hi> King <hi>Vzziah</hi> likewise was true to Gods worship in the beginning of his Reign, but afterwards, his pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity puft him up, and he invaded the Priests Office to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 26 4, <hi>16.</hi> And if you look into our own Histories of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> how few shall you finde!

            <p n="4">4. Here is <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his cleaving to the Lord, and to his Word, <hi>ver.</hi> 6 For he clave to the Lord, and departed not from after him, but kept his Commandments, which the Lord commanded <hi>Moses.</hi> Hence


<pb facs="unknown:000151_0009_0FA2B7DD418E02A0"/>
the fourth Doctrine is this. <hi>That the Rule of Reformation in Religion, is the will and Word of God:</hi> He that will reform aright, must reduce, and bring all things back to that Rule: when <hi>Iohn</hi> was to measure the Temple, and to reform the Church, there was a Reed given unto him like a Rod, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.1. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>.15. The new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is measured with a golden Reed. It is spoken with allusion to <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Vision, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. which <hi>measuring Reed,</hi> can be no other but <hi>the Word of God.</hi> Hence we call the Scriptures <hi>Canonical,</hi> because they are the Rule of all Religion. It is not the wills and lusts of men, but what the Lord hath Commanded us by <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets, and by Christ and his Apostles.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The last particular is, The prospering presence of God with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Magistrate, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. And the Lord was with him, and he pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered whithersoever he went forth. Hence observe, 5. <hi>That a through Reformation of Religion according to the Word of God, to the rooting up of all Idolatry, is the way to obtain the prospering presence of God with us in whatsoever we take in hand.</hi> Let <hi>Hezekiah</hi> turn himself which way he will, the Lord went with him. It is promised, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.3. <hi>He that delights in the Law of the Lord, whatsoever he doth shall prosper,</hi> and the same thing is noted concerning other reforming Kings, as King <hi>Vzziah,</hi> 2 Chron. 26.5. <hi>As long as he sought the Lord, God made him to prosper, and he did great things.</hi> Men are apt to think it will cause trouble, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb all things, and bring Heaven and Earth together, but it is indeed the way to prosper.</p>
            <p>Thus you see the principal Truths, and points of Doctrine, that are contained in the words. I shall resume and prosecute a little more fully the first of them, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Observ. <hi>That it is a thing very pleasing in the sight of God, when the sin of Idolatry, and all the monuments, all the remembrances &amp; remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of it are quite destroyed, and rooted out from amongst his people.</hi> For <hi>Hezekiah</hi> here made through work of it, he removed the High places, and brake the Images, and cut down the Groves, and brake in pieces the brazen Serpent, he spared nothing that had the Devils stamp upon it; If he had spared any thing, it would have been the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, for the honour of the first Founder, for it was <hi>Moses</hi> that made it, and that by Gods appointment; but yet being now abused to Idolatry he brake it in pieces, and calls it <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There it was denominated both from the Form and matter, but here from the matter only. There it was called a Serpent of brass, but now he calls it <hi>a meer piece of brass,</hi> the stamp of Institution being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and the thing having been horribly abused to Idolatry, or as some have not unfitly rendered it, <hi>that base piece of brass.</hi> For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of this Doctrine, four things are necessary to be spoken to; (1) what is meant by Idolatry? (2) what by the monuments of it? (3) How it may appear that the Lord will have them to be rooted up. (4) The reasons of this Severity of God against this Sin?</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is meant by Idolatry?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. Idolatry</hi> in general, <hi>is the worshiping of Images or Idols.</hi> Now there be two sorts of Images, and therefore two sorts of Idolatry. First, <hi>against the Object of worship, in the first Commandment.</hi> Secondly, <hi>against the means of worship in the Second.</hi> The Idolatry forbidden in the first Commandment is, <hi>when the worship is terminated upon a false Object,</hi> and not upon the True God that made Heaven and Earth. But the Idolatry forbidden in the second Commandment is, <hi>when the worship</hi> is directed to the True God, but <hi>by false wayes and means,</hi> which he had never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and which never came into his heart: we commonly call it for distinction sake, <hi>Superstition,</hi> which is as much as to say, <hi>Cultus supra statutum,</hi> a worship beside, and beyond the Rule. The Scripture calls it Idolatry, or the worshipping of Idols, and Superstition, and <hi>will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> Col. 2. <hi>ult.</hi> Acts 7 41. and <hi>Acts 17.16, 22.</hi>

            <p>The Idolatry against which the Prophets are so frequently, and almost continually thundring forth the wrath of God throughout the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, and which is so much condemned also in the New, and which the People were chiefly guilty of.

But yet they were <hi>Idolaters</hi> in the sight of God, and are charged with this guilt every where throughout the Scripture.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is not meant of Images for Civil use, but for worship; thou shalt not bow down to them, nor serve them.</hi> For the Civil use of Images is lawful for the representation and remembrance of a person absent, for honour and Civil worship to any worthy person, as also for ornament, but the scope of the Command is against Images in State and use religious.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither yet is it meant of all Images for religious use, but only <hi>Images of their own devising,</hi> for God doth not forbid his own Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but only our inventions, and therefore one saith both wittily and wisely, <hi>Non Imago, non simulachrum prohibetur, sed non facies tibi.</hi> The <hi>Emphasis</hi> lies here, <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy self</hi>; For there were Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by Gods Appointment in the Church of the Jews, for the making whereof the Lord sitted <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiah</hi> with his Spirit, and with skill in all manner of workmanship, <hi>Exod. 31.3, 4, 5.</hi> and it is the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches complaint against the Enemy. <hi>Psal.</hi>

For it is not enough, to worship the True God, but we must worship him in the right way, and <hi>seek him in the right order,</hi> as <hi>1 Chron. 15.13.</hi> For the neglect whereof, he made that Breach upon <hi>Vzziah.</hi> It is not enough to eschew false Objects of worship, but we must also take heed of false means of worship. Hence the people are blamed for <hi>Sacrificing in the High places, though to the Lord their God Onely.</hi> 2 Chron. 33.17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Although none but the grossest kinde of Idolatry, <hi>viz graven Images</hi> are expressly mentioned, yet, <hi>under this one Instance is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all other sins of the same kinde, all other Inventions of men are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and comprehended under this.</hi> For it is a general rule observed by all Judicious Expositors upon the Ten Commandments, that they must be opened by <hi>Synecdoches and Metonymies; Synecdoches</hi> to comprehend all sins of the like kinde, and all the Degrees thereof; and <hi>Metonymies</hi> to comprehend all the Causes and means, and occasions thereof. And Christ himself teacheth us so to Interpret them. As in the sixth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> this forbids all rash anger, even passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate words, and thoughts. <hi>Mat. 5.21, 22.</hi> and in the Seventh Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though Adultery only is named, yet by the like <hi>Synecdoche</hi> all other kinds, and Degrees of uncleanness are included, and intended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that, even filthy thoughts. <hi>Mat. 5.28.</hi> Therefore, so are all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Inventions under graven Images.

            <p>Quest. 2. <hi>What is ment by the Monuments of Idolatry?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. Such things as being indifferent in their own Nature, have been abused, and polluted with Idolatry.</hi> This is evident from the Instance of the <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> in the Text, of which you may observe a threefold state. 1. Religious. 2. Indifferent. 3. Sinful.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Religious,</hi> and necessary. For the first Original of it was not Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, but Divine. It was once a Type of Christ, and spiritual Healing through him, as Christ himself expounds it, Joh. 3.14, 15. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was then a spiritual and a blessed Ordinance of God. But this necessary, and commanded use of the Serpent, was (as Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> observs) <note n="c" place="margin">Mr. Cart. rest of 2d. reply pag 262</note> 
               <hi>but for the time, wherein it was a means to heal those that were bitten.</hi> This use therefore Ceased, and the Stamp of Institution was taken off, when the fiery Serpents Ceased, when they came out of the Wilderness.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>After this, it was retained, and set up as it seemeth upon the Walls of the Temple, as a Monument of that miraculous mercy and healing, which they had formerly received by it</hi> in the Wilderness. and <hi>this use of it was not Instituted, but only indifferent,</hi> and it seems to be of the same nature with the laying up of <hi>Goliahs</hi> Sword at <hi>No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and a kind of Immobility in Gods Service; The like may be said concerning the brasen Serpent. And in this use it had continued amongst them, as some have computed, no less then seven hundred years, so <hi>

               <hi>he would have you advisedly to mark; From hence we conclude, that the painted and carved Images of Christ himself may not be adored, and if they be, they may be removed, though they were delivered even by the Apostles, as yours were not.</hi> For when the people went a step further to burn incense to this brasen Serpent, then <hi>Hezekiah</hi> throws it away as a defiled monument, it was no longer indifferent, but sinful, and this was the third state of it.</p>
            <p>Now this explication cuts off those Objections, If all the monuments of Idolatry must be destroyed, then so must Baptism, and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, say some; because they have been abused by the Papists. <hi>Answ.</hi> It followeth not, for the brasen Serpent was not an Ordinance at this time, when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> brake it in pieces, it was only an indifferent thing abused. But the <hi>Sacraments</hi> are <hi>standing Ordinances,</hi> and the Ordinances of Christ cannot be looked upon as monuments of Idolatry, for they are <hi>not indifferent</hi> things abused, but duties Commanded and appointed by the Lord Jesus. Therefore the abuse of them must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and rectified, but the right use retained and continued. As when the Vessels of the Temple had been polluted and abused in Babylon, where they became <hi>Belshazzars</hi> quaffing bowls, they were not therefore laid aside by the people of God in their return out of Babylon, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored and brought back to their former right use in the Temple: So when it is Objected, that then publick meeting places for worship must be pulled down, and the use of Cups and Vessels in the Sacrament laid aside, because the Papists have abused them. I Answer still as before, that these things are not monuments of Idolatry, for though they be not Ordinances, yet they are <hi>necessary appurtenances to them.</hi> For when God appoints any Ordinance, the Institution thereof implies and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with it an <hi>Implicite Warrant</hi>

               </gap> the use of all such things as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the celebration of it. As when Christ appoints us to drink wine in the Lords Supp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

by two plain Instances. Those <hi>love feasts</hi> in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> were indifferent things, hence when abused, they were abolished out of the Church. But the Sun is of necessary use, and therefore we need not go abovt to pluck it out of the Firmament, but may freely make use of it, though it hath been abused and worshipped by Idolaters.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This had need be spoken to, for men are apt to make light of these sins, to think that Ministers are more zealous then wise, to preach against them, and that the Lord himself will not be so severe to punish them, nay, which is some what strange, they hope to please God by them, and are apt to alledge their Idolatry as an excuse, and to hold it up as a Shield of defence, when reproved for other sins.

            <p n="1">1. In the nature of this sin, there be four things that make it very odious in the sight of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Because it is a sin of high Rebellion against the will of God.</hi> The worship required in the First Commandment is called Natural worship, because it ariseth from the very nature of God, and the Creature. Hence to withdraw that inward Homage and worship of Faith, Hope, and Love, and the actings thereof, in Conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the second Commandment which Contains the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted worship of God, floweth from the will of God, and therefore for men to resist this, is to set up their own wills, above, and against Gods, as it is excellently set forth by the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> The Lord saith by his Prophets, <hi>oh, do not this abominable thing which</hi> I <hi>hate,</hi> but the People say, <hi>we will not hearken unto th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is a sin of much reproach to the wisdome of God, for men to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God in their own wayes.</hi> It is as charging God with folly, as if the Infinite bless<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Because they will be wiser then God, he makes them more foolish then men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It is a sin of Whoredome against that spiritual Chastity that the Lord requires of his people</hi>: There is nothing more frequent in the Scripture then to express Idolatry under the name of Whoredome and Adultery, for it is a breach of the Marriage-Covenant, and a yielding that honour to another, to a Creature, to an Idol, which is due to none, but God. <hi>Lev.</hi> 17.7. <hi>They shall no more offer their Sacrifices unto Devils, after whom they have gone a whoring</hi>; Gideons <hi>Ephod,</hi> Judges 8.27. <hi>they went a whoring after it.</hi> With their Idols have they Committed Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, <hi>Ezek. 23.37.</hi> and throughout that Chapter. The two Idolatrous Cities, <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> are compared to two adulterous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>Aholah,</hi> and <hi>Aholihah. They have Committed Adultery with Stocks and Stones.</hi> Jer. 3.9. that is, because they made them <hi>media Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> Hence <hi>Rome</hi> is called <hi>the Mother of Harlots,</hi> Rev 17.5. And <hi>pure Worshippers,</hi> who follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth, are <hi>called Virgins,</hi> Rev. 14.4. Hence the Lord professeth in the Sanction of the second Commandment, <hi>I am a jealous God</hi>; now the Object of jealou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sie is <hi>Conjugal Chastity,</hi> and as jealousie is the rage of a man, so the jea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lousie of God is the highest wrath of God.</p>

Hence, that Objection vanishes, what? Can we honour God too much? no, I confess you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, His name is above and beyond all praise.

            <p n="2">2 <hi>Look at the Causes of it,</hi> from whence it comes. and here we must not give heed to what men pretend, nor yet to what they think. For men do not know their own hearts, nor the springs and principles of their own actions, but the Lord he knows, and the Scripture discovers, and searcheth the deepest corners and Secrets of the Heart. Therefore let us see what the Scripture saith to it. We must be very circumspect herein to speak nothing, but what the Scripture saith. For to speak without the Scripture is Censoriousness, but to speak plainly according to it, is Faithfulness. <hi>Isai.</hi> 58.1. <hi>Cry aloud &amp; spare not,</hi> saih the Lord, but <hi>lift up thy voice like Trumpet, shew my People their Transgressions, &amp; the House of Iacob their sins.</hi> It was <hi>Ierusalems</hi> Calamity and ruine, <hi>that her Prophets did see vain and foolish things for her, and did not discover her iniquity, to turn away her Captivity</hi>: Lam. 2.14. Now the Scripture takes notice of many distempers and Corruptions in the hearts of men, whereby they are inclined to this sin of Idolatry and Superstition, and in some respects more propense and prone to it, then to open profaneness.

               </gap>ll In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in six particulars, whereby you will see that it must needs be evil and bitter fruit, that hath such bitter Roots and Causes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Forgetfulness of God,</hi> Hos. 8.14. <hi>Israel hath forgotten his Maker,

                  </gap>06.19, 20, 21.</hi> This will seem very strange to carnal reason, for men are apt to think, they do it out of very good devotion, because they do, or would remember, and put themselves in mind of their duty towards God, as when men bow to a Crucifix, or to the name of Jesus, or the like, surely they remember Christ one would think, but let them pretend what they will, the Text is clear, <hi>they forget God their Saviour,</hi> it is because they forget the Lord Jesus, they do not remember him with any true and right affection. Hence we see it in daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that <hi>the same persons who are most prophane, are usually most Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious,</hi> they that forget God most in moral duties, are most devout in wayes of Superstition, so that prophaneness is one Cause of Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It comes from pride,</hi> Col. 2.18. <hi>Let no man beguile you by volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry humility, being vainly puft up in his fleshly mind.</hi> And this accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with deep hypocrisie, <hi>for neither they themselves who are circumeised keep the Law, but desire to have you Circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</hi> Gal. 6.13. that they may boast amongst the Jews, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny followers and Proselytes they have gained, it was their ambition and desire of applause that acted them. Profaneness is a discredit amongst men, and therefore though many are, and will be prophane, yet there be few that would seem so; now the best and likeliest way to hide this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness, is to cover it with the fig-leaves of Superstition. <hi>Iezabel,</hi> therefore, when she intended murther, proclaims a Fast. The <hi>Pharisees devour Widows Houses, but for a pretence they made long prayers.</hi> So that here was pride mixt with Hypocrisie, but God loves Truth in the inward parts, and he delights to abase the Sons of Pride<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For it is an easy thing to walk in their own wayes, and to follow their own devises. What an easy thing is it to nod and bow to an Altar? but it is hard to mortify a lust. It was an easy thing to the Pharisees to Tyth Mint and Cummin, and to wash their Cups and Platters, but it is a great and difficult work to cleanse and wash the heart from filthiness. So that Superstition though it seems to be overbusy, yet it is indeed but a lazy thing, and suits that distemper of spiritual Sloth; A mans Conscience would torment and tear him in pieces, Hell from beneath would rise up for him, if he should have no Religion at all: but the power and life of godliness is difficult, Hence men rest in shadows, and sit down with Superstitious empty Forms and shews of Devotion, by which Conscience being charmed, they think God is pacified, and all is clear above head. 2. <hi>They hope to secure themselves by it, as to this World.</hi> This made <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to set up the Idolatry at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> and <hi>Jehu</hi> to continue it, <hi>for he said in his heart, if this people go up to Ierusalem to do Sacrifice in the House of the Lord at Ierusalem, the Kingdom will return to the House of</hi> David. <hi>1 Kin. 12.26, 27,</hi> And upon the like account <hi>Ahaz</hi> made sundry changes to the prejudice of Gods worship, because of the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> that is for fear of him, and that he might please him. <hi>And he Sacrificed to the Gods of</hi> Damascus, <hi>which smote him, saying</hi> in his foolish, carnal wisdom, <hi>because the Gods of the Kings of</hi> Syria <hi>help them, therefore will I Sacrifice to them, that they may help me, but they were the ruine of Him, and of all Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> 2 Chron. 28.23.<note place="margin">

Instead of making Pagans turn Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians by it, they did transform Christian Churches into Anti-Christian, It was this fleshly wisdom that was the means to conjure up those two venemous Beasts, the Church, and Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> Rev. 13.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It proceeds from a Spirit of folly and delusion.</hi> For a mans own wisdom is folly, such things indeed have a shew of wisdom, <hi>Col. 2.</hi> last.

So that all the Zeal and affection men have in a Superstitious way is but blind Devotion, and zeal without knowledge. Thou blind Pharisee, every man is bruitish in his knowledge, every Founder is confounded by the graven Image, For his molten Image is falshood, and there is no breath in them, they are vanity, and the work of errors, in the time of their visitation they shall perish. <hi>Ier. 10.14, 15.</hi> and you have the same words again repeated, <hi>Ier. 51.17, 18.</hi> Hence dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and a sad eclspse, and decay of light and knowledge in the Church, was the Immediate forerunner of Anti-Christ, with all his Idolatryes and Superstitions.

He that could not burn at a Stake for the Truth, was burnt to death in his own House; but it had been better to burn in the Cause of God, then in the way of his judgements. Now if this be one Cause of Idolatry and Superstition, It must needs be a very great sin. When men shall fear men more then God, and those that can but kill the body, more then him that is able to destroy both Soul and body in Hell. Who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall dye, and of the Son of man that shall be made as grass, and forgettest the Lord thy Maker, that hath stretched forth the Heavens, and laid the Foundations of the Earth, and best feared continually every day because of the fury of the Oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the Oppressor, <hi>Isai. 51.12, 13.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Lastly, <hi>It proceeds from secret enmity and hatred of the blessed God.</hi> For as it is assign of love to God, to love his Ordinances, so on the contrary, for men to cast the second Commandment behind their backs, it is a sign they hate Him. Hence the Lord there threatens <hi>I will visit the sin of them that Hate mee, and shew mercy to thousands of them that love mee.</hi> So in <hi>Hos. 9.7.</hi> He threatens to visit them <hi>for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their iniquity and the great hatred.</hi> It is true, in times of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and darkness good men may be carried away in many things with the stream of the times for want of better light But <hi>to be zealous for the grossest Superstitions in times of light, is an ill sign</hi> that the heart is full of poyson, full of Hatred, and Enmity against the Lord, &amp; against his blessed

wayes. And it is the worse, because that Superstitious persons pretend much love and devotion, as though they thought nothing too dear, nor too much for God, when there is the poyson of Asps underneath. No wonder therefore, if the Lord abhorrs them. For there is nothing more odious both to God and men, then hatred masked over with pretences of love. And thus you see from the Causes of this sin, how great a sin it is.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Consider also the Cursed effects and Fruits of it,</hi> the bitter Fruits that grow upon this root of bitterness, These will yet further discover the evil of it. Men are apt to think their own Inventions are of much use in the worship of God, though they call them sometimes <hi>Indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent things,</hi> yet they think them very good and necessary. But the Lord hath said the <hi>graven Image is profitable,</hi> or good <hi>for nothing.</hi> Isai. 44.10. no good comes of it, but much hurt and mischief every way.

And <hi>the molten Image a teacher of lyes,</hi> Heb. 2.18. <hi>for their Idols have spoken vanity, and their Diviners have seen a lye,</hi> Zech. <hi>10.2.</hi> The Scripture is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and copious in this Argument, because men are very apt to value their own Inventions and Additions to the worship of God at a high rate, and to admire and applaud themselves therein; as if they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed not a little to the Majesty, and to the Splendour of it, by their Great wisdom and prudential power, as they call it; when it is indeed <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential folly,</hi> their glory is their shame, <hi>they are mad upon their Idols,</hi> Jer. <hi>50.38.

And though there be a whole Sea of worship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Ordinances, that all should be but like the blood of a dead man; as <hi>Rev. 8.8.</hi> and <hi>16.</hi>3.

            <p n="4">4. <hi>A mans Repentance is never true till it be proportionable to the nature of his Sins.</hi> It is not enough for men to leave these Sins, but they must also loath themselves in their own sight for all their abominations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that I am broken with their whorish hearts, which go a whoring after their Idols, as the Lord there speaks,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezek. 6.9.</hi>
               </note> but how hard is it to get such a self-loathing, self-abhorring frame of Spirit, not only to see that it is a Sin, but to see the exceeding vileness of it, and to loath it as God loaths it, to hate it as God hates it. I have Insisted the longer upon the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the point, that you may see the hainous nature of this Sin, that <hi>it is no light thing to break the second Commandment.</hi> These are the Reasons of the point, I conclude with a few words of Use.</p>
            <p>Use I. <hi>This Doctrine Condemns and cashieres at once all the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and whatever other Inventions of men have been introduced into the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God by the Spirit of Anti-Christ, and reteined, and continued by some reforming Magistrates, who have made but incompleat and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Reformations.</hi> As who knows not, that almost all the Ordinances of Christ have been polluted and corrupted by them. The Gospel might not be preached without a Surplice,<note place="margin">See the second Sermon</note> nor Baptisme administred without the sign of the Cross, So likewise kneeling at the Sacrament, bowing to the Altar, and to the name Jesus, Popish holy dayes, holiness of places, Organs and Cathedral Musick, The Books of Common prayer, Prelacy or Church Government by Bishops. These things are no better then this brazen Serpent was. And therefore if this was a <hi>Nehushtan,</hi> so are all these. They are nothing else but <hi>reliques of Popery</hi> and <hi>remnants of</hi> Baal, and therefore when the Kingdome of Christ is come, they shall perish from off the Earth, and from under these Heavens.</p>
            <p>Vse II. <hi>Direction to Rulers and Magistrates, and to you all in your prayers for them,</hi> Let Magistrates imitate this Example of <hi>Hezekiab.</hi> It should awaken them to their Duty. <hi>Be wise now therefore, O ye Rulers, be instructed O ye judges of the Earth, and</hi> know, that it is your duty to


<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000151_0031_0FA2B7F778F329A0"/>
promote the purity of Gods worship, and to protect his people and Messengers, It is a thing impossible to keep in with both sides, both with Persecutors and Sufferers, but therefore it will be your wisdom, and the best and safest way to be on Gods side, and let <hi>Baal plead for himself.</hi> But because I see but few of them here, I shall direct my speech only to the people of God here present, you may see from hence, what Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to make, and what Requests to put up for those whom God by his Providence hath set in Authority over you, pray that God would give them reforming Spirits; and for the King, that God would make Him another <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to remove the High places, and to cut off the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of <hi>Baal,</hi> that he may trust in the Lord, and keep close to his Word; and that the Lord would be with him, and prosper him whithersoever he goeth, as he will certainly do in this way of Integrity to Religion, and to the work of Reformation.</p>
            <p>Use III. <hi>I Conclude with that word of Exhortation wherewith the Apostle John concludes his first Epistle, Little Children keep your selves from Idols, Amen.</hi> 1 Joh. 5. <hi>ult.</hi> And it is <hi>Pauls</hi> Exhortation also, <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 10.14. <hi>wherefore my dearly Beloved, flee from Idolatry.</hi> Remember what you heard in the Reasons of the point concerning the greatness of this Sin, and how jealous, and severe the Lord is against these violations of the Second Commandment, and Consider also these four words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It hath been the great design of Satan in all times, and Ages, to destroy and to corrupt the worship of God.</hi> And if he cannot perswade men to be down right Athiests, he labours then to drive them into the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream of Superstition, if he cannot prevail with them to cast of all the worship of God altogether, then he tempts them to worship him in a wrong way, to worship the true God Superstitiously. What was the great sin amongst the Jews? was it not this? so likewise amongst the old Heathens and Pagans, and amongst the Papists at this day. And what is the great design and work of Christ at this day? but to bring forth his worship into purity, that the new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> may come down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; This therefore Satan is most industrious to countermine and fight against, Therefore be sober, be vigilant against this Sin, because your Adversary the Devil is so watchful to insnare you.</p>

For he hath made it his buisiness, ever since the time of <hi>Constantine</hi> to revive the old Heathenish Idolarry under other names, that whereas before they worshipped the Devil under the names of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Apollo,</hi> now they commit the same Idolatry, &amp; worship the same Devil still, but under the names of Popish Saints; now it is not <hi>Jupiter and Apollo</hi> any more, but <hi>Saint Peter, and the Virgin Mary,</hi> and the <hi>Vicar of Christ,</hi> &amp; the <hi>holy Catholick Church of</hi> Rome. Thus doth that Harlot paint her face: So the <hi>Prelatick Superstitions</hi> at this day are painted over with those glozing pretences of <hi>Antiquity, Fathers, Councils, Order, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, Edification, the peace of the Church,</hi> and such like.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>If once you begin in a way of Superstition, you will never know where to stop or stay,</hi> nor where to make an end, but you will multiply your Idols, and increase your Altars, and grow worse and worse.

               </note> when men are given up to that lust, they are insatiable, and work all uncleanness with greediness, so it is in this sin of spiritual Whoredome, it is an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less sin. If you do but wear a Surplice for peace sake, why not as well admit the sign of the Cross in Baptism, or bow to an Altar, and in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time you will find that the same Reason is as strong for bowing to an Image, to a Crucifix, and why not as well say Mass too, for the peace of the Church, and then at last swallow down every thing, Submit to the Pope, worship the Beast, and so be damned and go to Hell, and all for the peace of the Church. Oh! there is no end here, when a man is once going down the Hill in a way of Carnal Complyance and Superstition, he will never cease; but like a man that is tumbling down a steep Hill, cannot stop, till he come to the bottom, to the very bottom of the pit of Popery. All the abominations of Anti-Christ came in by degrees, the four first trumpets were so many steps or degrees of the rise of Anti-Christ, and then in the fifth, he appears upon his Throne with open face, as the Angel of the bottomless pit, and as an <hi>Abaddon,</hi> as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer and Son of perdition, with all his <hi>Frogs and locusts</hi> about him, with all that Anti-Christian <hi>Popish Clergy,</hi> acting under him and for him, <hi>Rev. Chap. 8. Chap. 9.</hi> It is observed in the Histories of the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Kings of Israel, that those in succeeding Times were worse then their wicked Predecessours: <hi>Ieroboam</hi> he that made <hi>Israel</hi> to sin, He did but <hi>set up the two Calves at Dan and Bethel,</hi> but <hi>Omri</hi> went beyond him,

               </hi> was worse then He, for as <hi>if it had been a light thing for Him to walk in the Sins of</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>he did set up all the worship of</hi> Baal, <hi>1 King. 16 30, 31, 32, 33.</hi> Hence the faithful Servants of the Lord have been exceeding wary and watchful against the least appearances and beginnings of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. One of the Ancients (<hi>Basil</hi> as I remember) when the Heathen Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters had put Incense into his Hand, and offered to spare his life, if he would but throw it in, or let it fall into the Censer, he chose rather to burn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Hand and loose his life, then to Commit that seeming little sin; which brings me to a fourth Consideration.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Remember this for ever, that it is better to suffer then to sin.</hi> A man had better suffer, better dye, then sin. And therefore if Superstition be a Sin, be wise for your selves, and choose the greatest affliction, rather then the least Sin. Thou that sayest in thy heart, life is sweet, and thou art loth to suffer, loth to dye; I tell thee, It were better for thee to be cast into prison, into the deepest-darkest-Dungeon.

Let all things be done decently and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> but to wear <hi>a fools Coat</hi> is not decent, but ridiculous; therefore it is a sin to do it in the worship of God, and much more to wear <hi>a Surplice,</hi>

which is fitly called a fools Coat indeed, being as bad, yea, worse. For a fools Coat is only a breach of the rule of decency, but a Surplice is both ridiculous and Superstitious too, It is both a breach of the rule of decency and of the second Commandment, and therefore it is worse then a fools Coat. But we are not to break the least Command for the greatest good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And such Ministers as are silenced upon this account, it is not they that do forsake their Ministry, as is most unchristianly and reproachfully said by some, but they are forced from it, and are driven into Corners by plain force and violence. For if men will not suffer us to preach but upon such hard Conditions, that we must break Rules, and Sin against our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences if we will preach, it is all one as if they should absolutely hinder, for we must not purchase the liberty of our Ministry at such a dear price, though it be such a precious Ordinance, and so great a mercy to enjoy it. <hi>A man had better never preach a Sermon all his dayes then part with a good Conscience for it.</hi>

And there is another Text also, that may strike Terrour into the hearts of these Idolaters, if they have any Conscience, if they have any sence or feeling left, I mean that threatning, that dreadful and direful Imprecation, in Isai. 2.9. <hi>the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself, therefore forgive them not.</hi> So that this Idolatrous bowing, though it be not properly the sin against the holy Ghost, yet it is such a sin as God seldome pardons, <hi>therefore forgive them not.</hi>

But Christ the Lord of Time, and the Lord of the Sabbath, hath san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and instituted the first day of the week, whereon he arose from the dead, for the Commemoration of the great work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by him.

Sober mirth, and the moderate use of the good Creatures of God, is lawful at any time of the year, and there never was any Minister that Preached or spake against that; but to have better Cheer upon a Popish Holy-day, then at another time, meerly upon this account, because forsooth it is an <hi>Holy-day,</hi> this is superstitious: and the Revelling, and Rioting, and Luxury which is usual at those times, is every way an hinderance to Hospitality, and not a furtherance to it, that which might and ought to be bestowed in a way of Liberality to the Poor, being mis-spent and lavished away in vain Prodigality and Luxury.</p>

                  <head>VII. Holiness of Places, or Consecrating of Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </head>
                  <p>TO discover the vanity of this <hi>Superstition,</hi> consider, that <hi>inherent Holiness</hi> which is in Persons, is a thing which Places are no way capable of: but the onely holiness that is or can be pretended for them, is a <hi>Relative Holiness,</hi> upon the account of some thing without them, in respect and relation whereto, they are denominated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted holy. Hence one that writes for it hath described it thus, <hi>A state of Relation of Peculiarity to Godwards.</hi> Now in the time of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> we finde two sorts of holy Places upon this account of Relation to the holy God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Where God was pleased to afford the visible and extraordinary Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances and Manifestations of his Glory to the very eyes of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, such Places were Holy during the time of those Manifestations.</hi> As when the Lord appeared to <hi>Moses</hi> in the burning Bush, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.5. <hi>The place whereon thou standest is holy ground.</hi> So to <hi>Joshua, Chap.</hi> 5.15. Hence Mount Sinai <hi>might not be touched,</hi> Exod. 19. And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Mount where Christ was transfigured is called the <hi>Holy Mount,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.18. but this Holiness continued onely while that <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Presence</hi> continued, there is no more Holiness in <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> or in <hi>Mount Tabor</hi> now, then there is in any other place, therefore the Apostle so calls it from what it was, not that it is so still; neither is any other place in these times priviledged with such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary visible Presence and Appearance of God: and therefore this neither is nor can be pretended for our Meeting-places. But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>There was a stated Holiness in the time of the Law in some Places.</hi> And thus some have observed, that we finde but three Places that were holy in this respect, <hi>The Land of Canaan,</hi> called <hi>the holy Land,</hi> Zech. 2.12. the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> called <hi>the holy City,</hi> Mat. 5.4. &amp; 27.53. and <hi>the Temple,</hi> frequently therefore called <hi>the holy Temple,</hi> Jonah 2.4. And these places were perpetually holy, as long as the Old Testament dispensation continued. But if we enquire into the nature, and into the grounds and reasons of this Holiness, we shall finde that it is wholly ceased in these Gospel-times, and that no place is holy now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any such account. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>These Places were holy, because in them were the standing Signs and Symbols of Gods Presence,</hi> which is therefore called his <hi>Symbolical


<pb n="61" facs="unknown:000151_0066_0FA2B815932A2C78"/>
Presence,</hi> to distinguish it from his <hi>Extraordinary Presence</hi> before-mentioned, and from his <hi>Spiritual Presence,</hi> which is not tyed to any place. Hence he is said to choose <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> and the <hi>Temple,</hi> to dwell there, and to put his Name there, <hi>Psal.</hi> 76.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 87<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. and to dwell between the Cherubims, <hi>Psal.</hi> 80.1. The Temple it self was a Sign of his Presence, and the Altar, the Ark, the Mercy-seat, Cherubims, Sacrifices, and almost all the Ordinances of those times were affixed by Gods appointment unto those places, to be observed and celebrated there, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and in <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> but there is no place that is now priviledged with this Symbolical Presence. There are no such standing Signs and tokens of his Presence annexed unto any place. God hath given his Ordinances to his Church, but he hath not tyed them to any place, <hi>He dwells not in Temples made with hands,</hi> Acts 17.24.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>These places under the Law were holy, by reason of their Typical respect to Christ, and the good things that were to come by him. Canaan</hi> the holy Land was a Type of the Church on Earth, and of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven, the heavenly <hi>Canaan: They sought another Country, a better Country, that is, an heavenly,</hi> Heb. 11.14, 16. <hi>Thine eyes shall see the land that is very far off,</hi> Isa. 33.17. <hi>Jerusalem</hi> also was a Type of the Church, and of <hi>Jerusalem above,</hi> Gal. 4.26. Rev. 21.2. and so the Temple, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15.1. and it was a Type also of Christs Body, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. Hence some have well observed, That <hi>the more nearly and lively that any of these Places did typifie Christ, so the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and degree of holiness did arise</hi>; as the Temple was more holy, because it typified the Body of Christ, in whom the Godhead dwelt bodily, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.9. as God did dwell Symbolically in the Temple. But Christ the Substance being come, and all the Types and Shadows therefore done away, there are not, there cannot be typical Places, or typical Holiness in Places in these times.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Those Places of old were holy by virtue of Gods Institution, who did appoint and sanctifie them to be parts of his Worship, and Ordinances of a very high nature</hi>; for the Lord appointed them to be the wayes and means of Communion between himself and his people: <hi>There will I meet thee, and I will commune with thee from above the Mercy-seat, from between the two Cherubims, which are upon the Ark of the Testimony,</hi> Exod. 25.22. Numb. 7.89. And they did sanctifie both the Worshippers, and the Worship performed in them, the Altar sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the gift, the Temple sanctified the gold, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.18, 19. in so much that the Places were principal, and the Duties less princ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="62" facs="unknown:000151_0067_0FA2B8185E564BE0"/>
Divines observe. The Temple and the Altar being Types of Christ, were of an higher worth and excellency then the Services and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices offered in them, and did bring acceptance to them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were to pray towards the Temple, to offer upon the Altar, <hi>&amp;c. Deut</hi> 12.5, 6. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.29. <hi>There will I accept them,</hi> Ezek 20.40. And it was a profaning of the Temple to use it for Civil Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, being consecrated and appropriated by God to holy uses: and therefore Christ would not suffer them to buy or sell, or to carry vessels through it, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.15, 16.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>there is no word of Institution in the New Testament to sanctifie any one Place more then another,</hi> but on the contrary it layes all places level in regard of Holiness. When the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> pleaded, <hi>Our fathers worshipped in this Mountain, but ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship; Jesus said unto her, Woman, believe me, The hour cometh, and now is, when ye shall neither in this Mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem worship the Father, but the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers shall worship him in spirit and in truth,</hi> Joh. 4.21, 23. He turns her eyes and thoughts away from the difference of Places, to look at the spirituality of the worship: for as God is no <hi>respecter of persons,</hi> so he is no <hi>respecter of places</hi>; but wheresoever, for that indefinite [<hi>where</hi>] is equivalent to an universal, <hi>Wheresoever two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midst of them,</hi> Matth. 18.20. <hi>I will that men pray every where, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Our publick Meeting-places</hi> for Worship in these Gospel-times, do not succeed in the stead of the Jewish Tabernacle or Temple, because they are not priviledged with that extraordinary visible Presence of God in them, which was in the Temple at some times, neither have they that Symbolical Presence, and residence of God in them, which was in the Temple at all times, neither have they that typical respect to Christ, neither hath God sanctified them, and set them apart to himself as his own peculiar: but they <hi>are of the same nature with the Jewish Synagogues,</hi> which were the places of the publick Moral Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God in those times, and were without question every whit as holy as our Churches, but yet we finde that the Synagogues were not appropriated to holy uses onely,<note place="margin">Matt. 10 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which suppose it were not meant of the executing and inflicting of the punishment upon them, but onely as some would have it, of passing the Sentence, yet this will not help them, for still it was a Civil and Secular use of the place, where they met for the publick Worship of God.</p>
                  <p>I may therefore here apply that of <hi>Isai.</hi> 27.9. <hi>By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his sin: when he maketh all the stones of the Altar as chalk-stones, that are beaten asunder, the Groves and Images shall not stand up.</hi> God will never purge away the iniquity of <hi>Ireland,</hi> nor take away the sins of <hi>England,</hi> till the stones of the Altar be as Chalk-stones, till people be convinced that there is no more holiness in <hi>a Church,</hi> I mean <hi>the Meeting-place</hi> of Wood and Stones, then in a dwelling house, nor in an Altar more then in Chalk-stones. There have been some <hi>Episcopal men,</hi> Episcopal at least in some other things, who yet have been much above this gross superstitious Conceit of the difference of Places. Dr. <hi>Vsher</hi> in his <hi>Body of Divinity,</hi> speaking against the private Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the Sacraments, he hath these words; <hi>In times of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution the godly did often meet in Barns, and such obscure places, which were indeed publick, because of the Church of God there, the House or Place availing nothing to make it publick or private, even as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the Prince is, there is the Court, although it were in a poor Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, there is a Spiritual Presence of God in our publick Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-places, when his people are there assembled to <hi>Worship him in the Beauties of Holiness,</hi> but he doth not afford his Presence with respect to the place, but to the persons; he is not present with them for the places sake, but present in the place at that time for their sakes. And therefore this Spiritual Presence of God doth not make any place properly holy, for then all places should be holy, wheresoever holy persons meet to enjoy the Spiritual Presence of God in holy duties: as the Primitive Churches met in private Chambers, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.8. and by the same reason all the dwelling-houses where there are Family-duties, and daily worshipping of God in the Family, and in secret, are holy places also. Nay, the Fields, the Streets, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Prisons, and Dungeons, and Gibbets, and all places where the Saints come, and enjoy Communion with God in their Spirits, are holy places. And so by their own Argument they lay all places level, the Lord having many precious Saints that walk with him, who are dispersed &amp; scattered up and down almost in every corner of the Land.</p>

                     <pb n="64" facs="unknown:000151_0069_0FA2B81AD4331CB0"/>
                     <hi>Churches</hi> I confess are <hi>holy things,</hi> but the word <hi>Church</hi> is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, and <hi>Catachrestically</hi> used concerning the <hi>Material Church</hi> of Wood and Stones, by a <hi>Metonymie</hi>; but the Scripture knows no other Church but the <hi>Church of Saints.</hi> That place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.22. is much abused, and misinterpreted, <hi>Have you not houses of your own to eat and drink in? or despise you the Church of God?</hi> It is not meant of those improper <hi>Metonymical Churches,</hi> neither doth the opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inforce any such thing: for there be many other things which may be opposed to their own houses, besides the publick Meeting-place. There are in <hi>Logick</hi> not onely <hi>Contraria, quorum unum uni,</hi> but also <hi>Disparata quorum unum multis pariter opponitur:</hi> The Apostles Argument is this, that it is a contempt of the Church or Saints of God, to carry themselves so disorderly in their presence.</p>
                  <p>And yet it doth not follow, that the publick Meeting-places must be pulled down, for the Consecrating of them is an abuse of things necessary, and not of things indifferent. The Scripture mentions it as a good work to build them, <hi>He loveth our Nation, and hath built us a Synagogue,</hi> Luke 7.5. and as an act of great profaneness to pull them down, <hi>Psal.</hi> 74.8. <hi>They have burnt up all the Synagogues of God in the Land,</hi> which yet had no more holiness in them then our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-places. And the thing it self speaks, for if there ought to be publick Assemblies for the Worship of God, if this be a duty, it is necessary that there be places to meet in. It is true, the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Jews to demolish the Heathen Temples of the <hi>Canaanites, Deut.</hi> 12.2, 3. but these were built for Idols, and therefore might just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be accounted meer Monuments of Idolatry; but our Meeting-places were built for Christian Churches and Assemblies to Worship God in, amongst whom <hi>the Essentials of a Church-estate</hi> and Worship were preserved, even under <hi>the Apostacy of Antichrist,</hi> for the Woman was fed &amp; nourished all the 1260 dayes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6, 14. therefore som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Fundamental Ordinances were preserved, though both the Worship and the Places have been much defiled with Superstition: but yet as we do not therefore reject the Worship of God, because of those Abuses, so neither need we reject the Places, but should reform and retain both the one and the other, the Worship and Ordinances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing necessary by virtue of Gods Institution, and the Places needful for the performance of the Worship. And the Superstitious abuse of them hath been taken off by publick Authority. For the Great Parliament hath thus declared: <hi>As no Place is capable of any Holiness, under pretence of whatsoever Dedication or Consecration, so neither is it


<pb n="65" facs="unknown:000151_0070_0FA2B81CB3C0A840"/>
subject to such Pollution by any Superstition formerly used, and now laid aside, as may render it unlawful or inconvenient for Christians to meet together therein for the publick Worship of God; and therefore we hold it requisite, that the places of publick Assembling for Worship amongst us, should be continued, and employed to that use.</hi> Neither indeed can they be destroyed without great and manifest hinderance and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the publick Worship of God, unless new ones be first built. And if they that plead for it will first erect new Meeting-places, that are every way better, and stronger, and more comely, and more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious to contain large and numerous Assemblies, and more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently situated for the accommodation of all the people, I say, when this is done, they shall have my free consent to do what they please with the old ones. But if they will needs demolish them before new and better be built in their stead, the least that can be said to them in such a case, is that <hi>their Milk b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is therefore a strange Comparison which some have used, who have said they know no Argument to prove the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans simply unlawful, but what would prove a Cup of Wine unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. For we must remember, that the Question is concerning the use of them in the Worship of God: and therefore the Answer is, That there is a vast disparity of Reason between a Cup of Wine and Organs, for the one is instituted, the other not. Christ hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and commanded us to use Bread and Wine in his Worship in the Sacrament of the Supper, but he hath not appointed Cathedral Musick.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>I do not finde in the Scripture, that these Musical Instruments were a part of their Synagogue-worship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was Moral, but rather of their Temple-worship, which was Ceremonial.</hi> In their Synagogues they had the publick Moral Worship of God, Reading and Expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law, <hi>&amp;c. Acts</hi> 13.15. Some think they had Trumpets also in their Synagogues to call the people together, but this was a Moral use of them, for which we use the ringing of a Bell. But the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is clear, that the Musical Instruments were appointed to be used continually before the Ark, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.4, 5, 6. <hi>And the Singers and Trumpeters stood at the East end of the Altar at the dedication of the Temple,</hi> 2 Chron. 5.12. And in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time, <hi>when the burnt-offering began, the song of the Lord began also, with the trumpets, and with the Instruments ordained by David King of Israel,</hi> 2 Chron. 29.27 28. But seeing Christ is come, and hath caused the Sacrifice and the Oblation to cease, and the City and the Sanctuary being both destroyed, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.26, 27. all the Worship that was affixed thereto is ceased with it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>There was a typical signification in them.</hi> The Silver Trumpet signified the sounding of the Silver Trumpet of the Gospel through all the world, the Preaching of the pure Word of God by his Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, who are said to <hi>lift up their voice as a trumpet,</hi> Isa. 58.1. <hi>Set the trumpet to thy mouth,</hi> Hos. 8.1. <hi>The tongue of the just is as choice silver,</hi> Prov. 10.20. and both these, and all the rest of their Musical Instruments, were expressions and signs of joy, <hi>Psal.</hi> 98.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 89 15. <hi>Blessed is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

fit resemblances to shadow out that heavenly Musick, and inward Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody of the joyes and graces of Gods Spirit in the hearts of his people. The Apostle therefore exhorts us to sing, but in stead of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Instruments, he requires <hi>the melody of the heart,</hi> Eph. 5.19. <hi>and grace in the heart,</hi> Coloss. 3.16.</p>
                  <p>But 4. <hi>Suppose the signification of the Jewish Musick could not be found out, (as indeed it is an hard thing to finde out the meaning of all their Ceremonies) we are delivered not onely from their Types and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, but also from all their Yokes and Burthens.</hi> These things were a part of the burthensome <hi>Paedagogie,</hi> which the Church was under in the time of its Non-age and Childhood, but now the time of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-freedome is come, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1.

They are such an help as God hath not appointed, and what God doth not appoint, he is not wont to bless. But why should we not have Trumpets in the Worship of God as well as Organs? for the Jews had Trumpets also. And why must we have them onely in Cathedral Churches? If <hi>Organs</hi> be too dear for every poor Parish, yet they might get <hi>Citherus</hi> or <hi>Bagpipes.</hi> And why should there not be Dancing in the Worship of God as well as Piping?

                  <head>IX. The Book of Common-Prayer.</head>
                  <p>WHich is not, neither are you to look upon it under the Notion of a <hi>Directory,</hi> to inform and instruct men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Worship of God, for doubtless it is as lawful to write Books of Prayer and publick Worship, as of Faith, or Love, or any other duty. But you must consider it as a <hi>Praescript Form,</hi> as a set and <hi>stinted Liturgie</hi> devised and appointed by men, to be read as a part of the publick Worship of God, and to be kept to, both for matter and words. This is the true state of the Case, and upon this account we look upon <hi>the Book of Common-Prayer as a Grand Idol</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for it is a breach of the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more wayes then one.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Arguments of our Divines against the Books commonly called</hi> Apocrypha, <hi>may serve against the Book of Common-Prayer,</hi> for it is an Apocryphal Book, introduced into the publick Worship of God as a standing part thereof, and imposed by force and violence. But thus to introduce another Book, besides the Book of God, into his Church, is a dishonour, and an affront to the Scripture. <hi>If it</hi> be a sin for men <hi>to set their posts by his posts, their thresholds by his thresholds,</hi> as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.8. and <hi>their Altars by his Altars,</hi> 2 Kings 16.15. is it no sin to set their Books by his Book?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>We do not finde any Precept for it in the Scripture, nor any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that God will accept it, nor any hint of Example that ever any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officers took upon them to impose stinted Liturgies upon the Church.</hi> If ever there had been need of such an help, surely it had been most seasonable amongst the Jews, in those weak and childish times: but we finde no such thing throughout the Scripture. It is true, God by the hand of his extraordinary Messengers did appoint some Forms, but neither were they tyed up to them, neither will this warrant or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officers to do the like. God hath forbidden his people to <hi>make to themselves</hi> Images, or <hi>Forms,</hi> or wayes of Worship, but he hath not restrained himself to set up what Images or Forms himself seeth good.</p>

If the Service of the Church was good in Latine, it remaineth good in English, for nothing is altered, but to speak with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what was spoken with ignorance, and to let you understand what is said for you.</hi> It was all taken out of the Mass-book, if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the word Mass-book in a large sense, as it is commonly taken: but to speak more narrowly, it was Collected out of three Popish Books. The first part of publick Prayers, <hi>Ex Breviario.</hi> The second part, <hi>viz.</hi> the Order of administring Sacraments, Matrimony, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siting the Sick, and Burials, <hi>è Rituali.</hi> 3. The Order of Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Supper, the Epistles, and Gospels, and Collects, <hi>è Missali,</hi> as the Form of Consecration of Bishops and Priests, was taken <hi>è Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificali,</hi> as you may see more at large in <hi>Didoclavius,</hi> and in Mr. <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard.</hi> Who also shews, that as the Common-Prayer was taken out of the Mass, so the principal parts of the Mass were borrowed from the Idolatrous Pagans, and had their Original from <hi>Numa Pompi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> that Conjurer, who lived 700 years before Christ, to adorn and deck, as the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> thought, the Religion of Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, to the which, when thus corrupted with Paganish and Popish mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the <hi>Romans</hi> were with much ado at last Converted, who till then were obstinate in their old Heathenish Religion. Insomuch that when <hi>Theodosius</hi> sent to the Senate to renounce their Pagan Religion, and receive the Law of Christ, they returned Answer that they would not, but would observe the Ancient Law <hi>Pompilian</hi> to avoid the ruine of the Common-wealth, which they feared would come by the Change of Religion. And to those principal parts of the Mass ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Pagans, <hi>viz. Vestments, Holy Water, the Confiteor, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, Incense, Offertory, &amp;c.</hi> other deckings were also added, as divers Letanies, and the <hi>Kurie-eleeson, Lord have mercy upon us,</hi> to be sung nine times, invented by <hi>Gregory</hi> a Monk at first, well studied in the Laws of <hi>Numa,</hi> and <hi>Tullus Hostilius.

The Gradual, and Collects were added by <hi>Gelasius, Anno</hi> 493. the <hi>Gloria in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsis,</hi> by <hi>Symmachus,</hi> 508.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y better then the people of God, who have his Spirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them. Some indeed have said, it is no matter whence it comes; but when <hi>Whitgift</hi> said so concerning <hi>Deans, Canons, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendaries,</hi> &amp;c. that it is not material though they come from the Pope, Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> replies, It is as if he should say, <hi>It skills not though they come out of the bottomless Pit</hi>: for whatsoever cometh from the Pope, which is Antichrist, cometh first from the Devil. The second Commandment forbids taking up Wayes and Forms of Worship from Idolaters, and it must needs be a great encouragement and harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Papists, that their Mass is the Foundation of our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>It undermines that great Ordinance of the Ministry, the principal duties of which Office are Preaching and Prayer,</hi> Acts 6.4. in the one whereof they are the mouth of God to the people, in the other they are the mouth of the people unto God. But if we prescribe to one another set Forms of Prayer, why not by the same reason set Forms of <hi>Homilies?</hi> and then, as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> observes, neither the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles nor their Successors needed to have left off the Deacons imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to attend upon the Ministry of the Word and Prayer, for both are prepared to their hands by the Prescriptions of others. Hence also Ministers shall little need to edifie the Church by their own gifts received of Christ to that end, but may edifie them by the gifts of others. Yea Ministers, though destitute of Ministerial gifts, yet may be fit for the publick discharge of their duties by the help of other mens gifts, both in Prayer and Preaching. And so indeed a <hi>Prescript Liturgie</hi> is properly a maintenance for an Idol dumb Ministry. What difference is there between the carrying of the Ark upon a Cart, and our Prayers upon a Book? whereas both should be carried, the one upon the shoulders of the Levites, the other upon the gifts of the Ministers.</p>

at first in opposition to the Latine Worship of the <hi>Mass,</hi> and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was a good step of Reformation, to get the Worship of God into a known Tongue: but now it is set up, and pleaded for in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the Spirit of Prayer, and therefore it deserves now to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by no better name but <hi>Nehushtan,</hi> an ill said Mass. Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>first Reformers</hi> are not to be look'd upon altogether as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Ministers,</hi> as being stirred up and acted by a more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Spirit in the Work of Reformation, and doing some things somewhat out of ordinary course, whereof this hath been not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly reckoned to be one, the making <hi>Formula's</hi> of Divine Service, which might better be done in those dark and dismall times, when there was scarce one to be found for every County, that was able to Pray and Preach without a Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for so it was in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time.</p>
                  <p>But now God hath poured out his Spirit upon all flesh, so that private Christians are able to pray to the publick edification of a whole Church: and therefore suppose it were lawful to use such a Crutch for those that could not pray without it, yet it is unreasonable and absurd to force a man to go with Crutches when he is not lame. It is a vain and needless thing, to tye Bladders under the wings of Sea-fowls to keep them from sinking, or to help them to swim. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> saith, the Christians in the Primitive times were wont to pray <hi>sine monitore, quia de pectore,</hi> without a prompter, becaus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith, We know not what to pray for as we ought, but <hi>the Spirit helpeth our infirmities,</hi> Rom. 8.26. It is the Spirits office to <hi>intercede in us,</hi> as Christ <hi>intercedes for us.</hi> But what great need is there of the Spirit, to reade a Prayer out of a Book? Other use therefore of the Common-prayer at this day I know not, then the quenching of the Spirit, and putting him as it were out of office, or at least limiting and stinting the Spirit, what and how many words he must manifest himself by, without alteration, addition, or diminution, and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of <hi>dumb Ministers</hi> with the Instrument of a foolish Shepherd, without which they would be dumb indeed, and unable to say any thing. To which may be also added, the arming of Persecutors with a bloody Weapon and Instrument of Violence, whereby to oppress the Consciences of Gods faithful Ministers and people, which some <hi>Episcopall men,</hi> who have been more ingenuous then the rest of their

                     <hi>VSE. Let it be a word of Exhortation to the Bishops, and to the Episcopal Party, not to revive the Superstitions and Idolatries of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, or at least not to impose them.</hi> For you see what the Text saith, the Lord will have them to be rooted out: and therefore he will be angry with you, if you practise them, but his wrath will burn like fire, if you impose them. I might here speak many things, to shew the unreasonableness of such Impositions; for I do not now speak meerly against the things themselves, but against that violent, that bloody, that imposing Spirit, the Spirit of Persecution. I think it were easie to offer such Considerations to you concerning it, as might not onely convince your Consciences, but also move and melt your bowels. Make it your own case. If your Consciences were against such things, you would be loth to be imposed upon. You may fight for them with the Sword of the Spirit, and maintain them by the Word of God, if you can, but take heed of flying to Carnal Weapons, to oppress those Truths of Christ, which by dint of Spiritual Reason you cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due. If any of these men be present before the Lord this day, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you had been compelled in former times to turn Independents, or to let your Children die unbaptized, or to do it without the Sign of the Cross, I suppose you would have filled Heaven and Earth with your cries. And give me leave to tell you, that if you will be perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, the people of God will cry, and never cease crying in the ears of the Lord against you, till he hath brought upon you the Judgement written. Consider therefore how you would be dealt with, if it were your own case, and remember how you have been dealt with. I have been in <hi>Ireland</hi> these five years, and I do not know any Episcopal man, if of a good life and Conversation, that hath been deprived of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Ministry, but they have been tolerated and suffered as well as others to Preach the Gospel, which is all that I desire this day: and will the men of that Perswasion be so disingenuous, as to requite evil for good? will you he worse then the Scribes and Pharisees? who though they had not the grace to forgive their enemies, yet they had so much good nature as to love their friends: will you give us cause to say, that there is not so much as common Ingenuity to be found amongst you?</p>
                  <p>If you will be content with your own Liberty, and suffer your Neighbours that differ from you, to live peaceably and quietly with you, you may <hi>go to Gilgal, and pass over to Beth-aven,</hi> make haste to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Rome,</hi> be as Idolatrous and Superstitious as you please, I know no Minister, nor private Christian, that will hinder you, or give any the least impediment or obstruction to you, further then this, that we

will fight against you with <hi>the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God</hi>; but for any external impediment, we leave that to the Magistrate to whom it belongs, to <hi>remove the high places, and break the Images, and cut down the Groves.</hi> But if you will not be content to sin alone, but will needs persecute and compel us to sin and perish with you, you will engage the Prayers of all the people of God against you as one man. When you have stopt our mouthes from Preaching, yet we shall Pray, and not onely we, but all the Souls that have been converted, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and edified by our Ministry, of whom you know there be, through the grace of Christ, many in this City and Nation, they will all cry to the Lord against you for want of Bread, because you deprive them of those that should <hi>break the bread of life to them.</hi> And how dreadful this will be unto you, I think I need not tell you. For when Saints pray, God will hear, especially if they unite their forces, and joyn together in the same requests. I had rather be environed with Armies of armed men, &amp; compassed round about with drawn Swords, and Instruments of death, then that the least praying Saint should bend the edge of his Prayers against me, for there is no standing before the Prayers of the Saints. You may see throughout the whole Scripture, and especially in the Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> what a powerful influence they have into all the Revolutions of Providence: before the opening of the Seven Seals, we reade of <hi>golden Vials full of odours, which are the Prayers of the Saints,</hi> Rev. 5.8. and before the sounding of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Trumpets, that great and dreadful dispensation of Providence, consisting of four lesser <hi>Woes,</hi> which made way for the three great <hi>Woes</hi>; for the <hi>Pope,</hi> who appears openly under the <hi>fifth Trumpet,</hi> and for the <hi>Turk,</hi> who breaks loose in the <hi>sixth,</hi> and for the final destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all Enemies, by the <hi>seventh Trumpet.</hi> The introduction to all these astonishing Judgements was this, Christ appears as the Angel of the Covenant, with a golden Censer in his hand, and with much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense of his own merits and mediation, and <hi>offers it up with the prayers of all Saints, upon the golden Altar which was before the Throne; and the smoke of the Incense, with the prayers of the Saints, ascended up before God out of the Angels hand,</hi> and after this there followed <hi>Thunderings and Lightnings,</hi> and dreadful dispensations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3, 4. Lastly, before the pouring out of the <hi>seven Vials,</hi> which is thought by many to be the dispensation that these Times are under, the Saints are brought in praying and praising God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. and the <hi>seven Angels,</hi> the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Christ in the execution of these Plagues, are said to <hi>come out of the Temple,</hi> that is, out of <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> ver. 6. and one of <hi>the

four living Creatures,</hi> which some of the best Interpreters understand to be Church-Officers, and Ministers of the Gospel, <hi>gave unto the seven Angels, seven golden Vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever,</hi> ver. 7. It is their Faith and Prayers, and the light of Christ in their Ministry, that sets all the wheels a-going for the ruine of Enemies, for God puts all the Prayers and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If it be so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to offend the least Saint, that Christ himself professeth, <hi>it were better for that man that a milstone were tyed about his neck, and to be thrown with it into the bottom of the sea, then to offend one of these little ones,</hi> how dreadful will it then be to offend and grieve the Spirit of God in the hearts of all his people, and so to rowze that Lion, the Spirit of Prayer against you. For I testifie unto you, that as the Saints will pray, so the Lord himself will fight against you, and take you into his own revenging hand. I speak it conditionally, in case you persecute, and <hi>I wish all the Bishops in</hi> Ireland <hi>heard me</hi>; for in the Name, and in the love of Christ I speak it to you, and I beseech you so to take it. I say, if once you fall to the old trade of Persecution, the Lord Jesus will never bear it at your hands, but he will bring upon you swift destruction. And your <hi>second Fall</hi> will be worse then the first: for,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 5.3, 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Dagon the first time did onely fall before the Ark of God. But when the men of Ashdod had set him up in his place again the second time, then he brake himself all to pieces by his second fall, insomuch that there was nothing but the stump of Dagon left.</hi> Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution is a very ripening sin, and therefore if once you super-adde the sin of <hi>Persecution</hi> to the sin of <hi>Superstition,</hi> you will be quickly ripe for final ruine, and for the vengeance of eternal fire. And in the day when God shall visit you, the guilt of all the righteous blood that hath been shed upon the face of the earth, from the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> to the blood of <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Vdall</hi> was a godly <hi>Non-Conformable</hi> Minister, who was cast into Prison by the Bishops, and at last died there, by means of their cruelty towards him.</note> 
                     <hi>Vdall,</hi> and unto this day, it will come down the hill upon your heads, even upon the Persecutors of this generation. The Lord Jesus, when the day of Vengeance is in his heart, and when the year of his Redeemed is come, which is not far off, he will then require all that blood, and revenge it all upon your heads, if you justifie the wayes of former Persecutors, by walking in the same steps of Blood and Violence.</p>
