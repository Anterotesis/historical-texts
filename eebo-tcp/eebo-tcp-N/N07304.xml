            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

On theſe depend the order and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of civil life: in theſe, as they now affect ourſelves, I think we may diſcern the hand of GOD, <hi>great in counſel and mighty in work.</hi> And when the greateſt national bleſſings are ſhowered upon us from the riches of His goodneſs: the ingenuouſneſs of the human mind, the wiſdom of civil government, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of religion, incline and oblige us to praiſe and thank the author of all happineſs. Praiſe, conſidered as a ſpecies of Prayer to GOD, is neither of uſe to convey our ſentiments, as if they were unknown to Him, from whom nothing is hid; nor is to be ſuppoſed acceptable to Him, on account of any ſubſerviency to His glory and perfection. But the ſimple intention of all Prayer and Praiſe, is to exerciſe in ourſelves virtuous and devout affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; a truſt and dependence on GOD, and a conſciouſneſs of his <hi>moral</hi> Providence, by which he hath inſeparably connected hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs with virtue, in the whole plan of divine government. If we are attentive to the intrinſic nature of all religious acts; we muſt be ſenſible that no Praiſe can be acceptable to GOD, but as it proceeds from his virtuous and ſincere worſhippers. <hi>The righteous ſhall praiſe thy name</hi>: and, <hi>Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; for it becometh well the j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

To this end, we muſt enlarge our hearts and minds, to take in the idea of public felicity, to comprehend the welfare of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race, and to conceive the influence both of the paſt war and preſent Peace on the Civil and Religious intereſts of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH our attention is principally fixed on the bleſſing of the Peace; yet this does not exclude other ſubjects of Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, which croud upon our thoughts on this ſolemnity. Theſe, the author of this pſalm in part preſents to our view, in thoſe exulting expreſſions. <hi>Praiſe the Lord, O Jeruſalem! praiſe thy God, O Sion! for he hath made faſt the bars of thy gates, and hath bleſſed thy children within thee.</hi> It is a beautiful image, familiar to the ſacred writers, to repreſent <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Sion</hi> (the capital and citadel of their country) as the mother of all its cities and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants: and this manner of perſonifying the metropolis of Judaea is ſtill to be ſeen on the coins and medals of Antiquity. <note n="*" place="bottom">particularly thoſe of VESPASIAN and TITUS, on which Judaea is repreſented in the attitude ſo pathetically deſcribed by the prophet JEREMIAH, in his <hi>Lamentations.</hi> See <hi>Cabnet</hi>'s dict of the Bible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> III. 548.</note> A remark of this kind may give ſome light to the ſtile of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Nor does this image unaptly expreſs that dependence which we ourſelves, as Colonies, have on our mother-Country. During this calamitous war, we have experienced ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from it, as with the utmoſt propriety claims our praiſes

to GOD, for His bleſſings to her children: bleſſings ſo great, both to Us and our parent-kingdoms, that our Nation hath never been at ſo exalted an highth of glory and proſperity, as in this auſpicious year. Every advantage, that can protect or adorn a people, is now poured upon us in full meaſure; and all, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in the poſſeſſion, by the ſtriking contraſt of the dangers and calamities, from which both EUROPE and AMERICA have juſt emerged.</p>
            <p>WE have ſeen, for ſome years paſt, war and deſolation let looſe on all the world. In the eſtimation of a benevolent heart, even our ſplendid victories have been dearly purchaſed, by the deſtruction of the human ſpecies, both on our own and the enemies part. Diſeaſe and Infection have been auxiliaries to the wide waſting Sword; and innumerable unknown diſaſters have concurred in depopulating mankind. Scarcity and Famine have combined in the general ruin; while, either the fury of men hath deſtroyed the means of ſubſiſtence; or GOD, to puniſh their crimes, hath withheld the fertility of the Earth, and given ſucceſſive ſeaſons of drougth and barrenneſs. But it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to collect the materials of calamity, or even for the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to comprehend them all; as they have appeared in all parts of the world, during the whole continuance of the war. If we ourſelves have ſeen leſs of theſe diſtreſſes, than other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or than other parts of our own; if we have known them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by report than experience; this ſhould be conſidered as our ſingular felicity, an unmerited diſtinction in our favour, that ſhould excite the warmeſt emotions of praiſe and thankfulneſs.</p>

Peace, the beſt of all our civil bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, let us ingeminate with grateful hearts and voices, till the incenſe of our Praiſe reaches to the Heavens, and aſcends to the throne of GOD.</p>
            <p>THE general advantages of Peace are too obvious to need a recital: whether as putting an end to the calamities of a ſtate of War; or as attended with Tranquillity and Opulence, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Science, and the Arts that are neceſſary or ornamental to ſocial life. I ſhall not therefore detain you on this topic; but ſhall conſider the preſent Peace, more eſpecially as it affects our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in theſe colonies. Without entering far into political diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions, (which would be to ſtep out of my province, into one foreign to my place and duty, as well as to my ability) we may all diſcern the advantageous ſituation in which the happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the war hath placed us. Our Country hath been, from its firſt ſettlement, a diſputed prize between us and our rivals the French. Other nations too have put in their claims among us, and have poſſeſſed the fineſt territories on the Continent; which have been ceded to us by ſeveral treaties. FRANCE hath remained a continual <hi>thorn in our ſides</hi>: their colonies have been the ſchools of ſuperſtition and cruelty, wherein the native barbarity of the Indians, hath been trained to the utmoſt fierceneſs and hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

us: and their projects of dominion have been vaſt and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. The injuſtice of France led them, prematurely for their own purpoſe, but providentially for our ſafety, to anticipate the war by incroaching on our ſettlements in a time of profound Peace. They had, with every art of human policy, formed the ambitious plan, of ſurrounding and limiting our territory, with the view of more eaſily invading and diſpoſſeſſing us: and they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far in the <hi>execution</hi> that, to all appearance, they had not left it in our power to prevent it, by the utmoſt exertion of <hi>our own</hi> ſtrength. But GOD looked down from heaven, as he did of old on the builders of Babel.—<hi>Behold, this they begin to do, and now nothing will be reſtrained from them, which they have imagined to do.</hi>

            <p>WHEN we thus reflect on the many civil advantages to our Continent, and to the whole Britiſh empire, reſulting from a war ſo ſucceſsfully conducted, and terminated by ſo beneficial a Peace; we cannot but wonder at that ſpirit of faction, murmuring, and inſatiable political avarice, which amidſt theſe ample glories, ſtill repines for more; and clamours for yet greater acceſſions of wealth and territory. This is worſe than diſloyalty to a moſt excellent King; it is an impious ingratitude to the providence of GOD. Too much of this ill temper; (the popular effect of an overgrown proſperity, which kicks againſt the hand that feeds it) has prevailed in our mother-Country: where the only danger to Liberty is from its own exceſſes. May heaven avert from us the infatuation of diſcord, repining, and diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection! As we have the greateſt ſhare in the bleſſings of the Peace, we ſhould have the deepeſt ſenſe and expreſs the fulleſt

acknowledgment of them: grateful to the wiſdom and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence of our auguſt and gracious King; thankful, beyond the utmoſt expreſſion of our praiſes, to HIM who governs the hearts of Princes, and <hi>ruleth in the kingdoms of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is indeed ſome cloud over the happy face of things on this continent, from the commotions of the Southern <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>; which, like a baleful ſmoke, have ariſen from the aſhes of the recent war. But if we may be permitted to conjecture the effect of theſe incurſions; we may hope and truſt in the divine goodneſs, that they will eventually complete the public tranquillity: either by obliging the Indians to <hi>recede,</hi> from our frontiers; or, by preventing their <hi>communication</hi> with the French; or laſtly, by what is of all the moſt deſirable, a <hi>firm treaty of Peace</hi> with them. Such a treaty might aſcertain their territory, and lead them to a ſtate of civility and ſettlement; it might induce them to throw themſelves on the humanity of our nation, and to learn from us the arts of life; it might open the way to an equitable and mutually beneficial commerce. Their experience of our national humanity, juſtice, and fair dealing, would conciliate their confidence and good opinion: and this would go a great way towards recommending the Goſpel to their reception. If they are not introduced to the knowledge of it by theſe previous ſteps of humanity, commerce, and ſocial life; I think it muſt for ever be impracticable to fix on their minds any rational and laſting impreſſions of the Chriſtian Religion. The experience of all ages ſince the Church hath been

deſtitute of miracles, demonſtrates, that no great good can be done by religious miſſions for the converſion of Infidels, till the two objects, hitherto kept diſtinct, of <hi>Civilizing</hi> and <hi>Saving,</hi> are joined in one conſiſtent deſign; and act uniformly in concert to ſupport each other. Civility will prepare them to admit Religion; and Religion will prevent them from falling back into barbariſm. Even in human ſciences, and much more in the divine ſcience of Redemption, there is required not only the ability and faithfulneſs of the teacher, but the capacity, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and perſeverance of the learner. And it is not rational to expect ſuch diſpoſitions from Savages always in arms or hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or pillage, never fixed to any reſidence, and characterized by the inconſtancy of their manners. <note n="*" place="bottom">Ou il ne reſte plus d'hommes, il n'y a plus d' eglifes. et comment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertir des brutaux toujours armez, toujours courans au pillage, et dont on n'entend pas la langue? <bibl>FLEURY, III<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>CLEAR as I am in my own opinion on this important ſubject, (which never can be more ſeaſonably conſidered, than in this time and ſituation of public affairs) I mean not to repreſent the converſion of the Indians as a work that ſhould be neglected. It is, I think, incumbent on <hi>all who love our Lord</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>in ſincerity,</hi> to aſſiſt and encourage every attempt to bring theſe ſavage nations out of their darkneſs, into the light of His Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. The uſe of theſe ſentiments, is, at this time eſpecially, to lead conſiderate perſons, to examine the beſt methods of making ſuch attempts ſucceſsful. And this I ſuppoſe can no otherwiſe

be effected, than by ſome extraordinary effort of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both here and in Britain. Great things might be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould the preſent Indian war be happily terminated by treaties of Peace and Commerce, with an expreſs ſtipulation in regard to Religion. If they are thus brought under the protection of our King; the civil power and humanity of the nation may lead the way, by all the ſteps before traced out, to introduce with authority and influence ſuch a ſyſtem of Religion, as may be not only rationally taught, but rationally heard and learned. Other methods, particularly that of Schools and Seminaries for the Indian Youth, may be made very uſeful, in ſubſerviency to a royal and national encouragement. The Royal favour has been extended, among us, to ſeats of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commodiouſly placed for this purpoſe. And, as we actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſee ſuch a diſpoſition in our King; may we not venture to aſſert that it is peculiarly incumbent on Princes, to be in this inſtance the <hi>nurſing Fathers</hi> of the Church? The <hi>pretenſions</hi> of extending the Goſpel to the nations of America, are perhaps the firſt claim Europeans originally had to their territories in this new world. Thoſe claims indeed are confirmed to the preſent occupants, by the ſame title as all other dominion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by diſcovery, conqueſt, treaty, and preſcription. Yet the honour and virtue of Chriſtian ſtates, is eſſentially intereſted in making good their original claim; by exerting their power in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating thoſe heavenly bleſſings which would be a rich alternative for an uſeleſs and unoccupied territory. The plea of enlarging the kingdom of CHRIST by the converſion of Infidels, hath been indeed made the abominable pretence of much perfidy, cruelty

That which is our moſt glorious diſtinction, the Chriſtian and the Proteſtant Religion, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch advantages from the proſecution of the war and its happy concluſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they open to us an ample field of Praiſe and admiration. <hi>He ſheweth his word unto Jacob, his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and ordinances unto Iſrael.</hi> This the Pſalmiſt with reaſon places as the laſt and higheſt inſtance of the divine favour.

then by a much ſtronger obligation are bound to praiſe Him for His word and will revealed to us by CHRIST JESUS, who is the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and accompliſhment of all thoſe <hi>good things</hi> of which the Jewiſh Law was only a <hi>ſhadow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is no inſtance, wherein the providence of GOD ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears more conſpicuous in educing good from evil, than in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verruling the events of War to the ſupport and propagation of true Religion. As the <hi>moral</hi> government of the univerſe muſt be ever the main object of a divine adminiſtration; I think it certain, that the great revolutions in the hiſtory of mankind, have, either in the way of favour or puniſhment, been mainly ſubſervient to maintain or extend the influence of Religion. That the events of Arms and fortunes of Empire, have been always determined by the preſcience and ſupreme power of GOD; appears with the fulleſt evidence from the many prophecies of Scripture, and their hiſtorical completion: and that conqueſt and dominion have been the providential means of diffuſing Truth and Religion over the world, may be ſhewn from ancient and recent facts.</p>
            <p>THE victories of ALEXANDER were ſo ſwift, that he rather flew than marched: as the prophet Daniel characterizes him, <hi>he had the wings of an eagle, and he touched not the ground</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">DAN. VII. 6. VIII. 5.</note>. The effect of his rapid conqueſt of the Eaſt, was a revolution as great in religion as in Empire. The Learning and Language of the Greeks was introduced into Egypt, Syria, and moſt other
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009329_0026_1030ED70390F1DE0"/>
parts of Aſia. And the firſt tranſlation of the Scriptures, the only pandect of true religion, had great effects even on gentile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and philoſophy.</p>
            <p>THE Roman Empire, under AUGUSTUS, extended itſelf over all the civilized and many barbarous parts of the world. It was, in the ſtile of Daniel, <hi>'dreadful and terrible and ſtrong ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, and conquered the whole Earth</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">DAN. VII. 7, 23.</note>:' This univerſal empire was the theatre, deſtined for the reception of the SON OF GOD, <hi>'whoſe kingdom alone is an everlaſting kingdom, and all dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him.'</hi>

            <p>AFTERWARDS, when Religion was ſufficiently nurtured in the ſchool of Adverſity and Perſecution under the Roman tyrants; GOD raiſed up the great CONSTANTINE, to eſtabliſh the Chriſtian Faith throughout the empire. The victories of that Prince fixed the Church of CHRIST in that peaceful and proſperous ſtate, which is perhaps meant by that noble deſcription in St. John's apocalypſe, <hi>of a great multitude</hi> converted to the Faith, <hi>of all nations and tongues, ſtanding before the throne,</hi> hymning <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our</hi> GOD <hi>and to the Lamb.</hi>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>THE aſtoniſhing defection from the purity of the Goſpel fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in the Jewiſh and Chriſtian prophecies, was certainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in the Papal dominion. It would be too large and abſtruſe an enquiry, to ſhew the exact correſpondence of the inſpired deſcriptions with the grandeur and declenſion of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Rome. I will only ſhew, by pointing at ſome illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious periods of hiſtory, in how clear a manner Almighty GOD hath made the victories and conqueſts of favoured nations his inſtruments of weakening the Papal tyranny; of freeing the world from ignorance, ſuperſtition, and impoſture; and of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually reſtoring a pure goſpel, the original doctrine of JESUS CHRIST. Popery hath for a thouſand years prevailed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the greateſt part of Europe. It was perhaps at its highth both of ſuperſtition and authority, in the beginning of the Reformation; when all Europe trembled at the thunders of the vatican, and the Popes were both warlike and politic Princes. A great part of Germany; — and England, under a King impatient of controul, — adhered to and protected the reformation: and our happy nation hath been ever ſince the favoured inſtrument of Providence, in delivering Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from a Superſtition, which at once inſlaves and blinds her votaries. To aſſert the freedom of the human mind, and open a way for ſtill farther emancipating the nations from this grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous yoke; is probably, in the views of Providence, one great object of our late conqueſts and the preſent Peace. As the Chriſtian world is at preſent divided into two great Societies, Popery and Proteſtantiſm: it is certain that all the ſucceſſes of the war have terminated in favour of the latter againſt the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009329_0028_1030ED7857B49698"/>
former: in weakening the power and extent of Superſtition, in advancing the ſacred intereſts of Truth and Freedom.</p>
            <p>MAY we not then conclude that the purpoſe of the Deity, in giving empire to the Engliſh nation, is to maintain and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe among Mankind the bleſſings of humanity, freedom, and religion? In adapting human means to effect his counſels, may it not be probable; that our Nation is now raiſed to this highth of greatneſs and dominion, to be the refuge and aſylum of Truth and Liberty: by its influence and example to free the weſtern world from Error and Superſtition; and to fix on this extenſive Continent, what will be its <hi>peculiar</hi> glory, the univerſal eſtabliſhment of Civil Freedom and true Religion?</p>
            <p>CHRISTIANITY indeed diſclaims all methods of extending it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but thoſe of Truth and Perſuaſion: and it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that it is not for the honour of Religion, that it ſhould be promoted by arms and conqueſt. To vindicate this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it muſt be a firm principle, that a war entered into expreſly with the deſign of forcing the conſciences of men, and obliging them to adopt the religion of the conqueror, is the higheſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and impiety. The diſtinction between the wars which promote Truth, and thoſe which render Superſtition and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture triumphant, conſiſts in this. The wars which in their event promote true Religion are merely <hi>political</hi>; but in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending of impoſture and falſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the caſe of Mahomet, and the popiſh cruſades—thoſe wars were expreſly <hi>religious</hi>; undertaken to promote, not civil intereſts, but falſe opinions: which can never be obtruded on mankind otherwiſe than by violence and uſurped authority. Apply this diſtinction to the late War: the iſſue of which in the preſent Peace hath been ſo favourable to the cauſe of Truth. The War, now ſo happily terminated, was in itſelf merely a political and commercial quarrel between rival nations. Religion was not the <hi>human</hi> object in the conqueſts that have promoted it: and it may be doubted whether as to military meaſures, it has at all influenced the deliberations of the cabinet of any Prince in Europe. Yet the events of a War conducted only on political views, have been ſo overruled by a propitious Providence, as to effect the great ends of GOD's moral government: the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of vice, by the calamities it hath brought upon the world; the preſervation and enlargement of Religion, by giving victory and dominion to the juſt cauſe. The paſt War hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly awakened our mother-Country from that ſlumber of Honour Courage and Probity, into which a profligate ſyſtem of politics, and an overgrown commerce had gradually thrown her: thus it hath ſerved to puniſh our enormities, and retrieve our expiring virtue. Here then we muſt diſcern and adore that Providence, which draws from human affairs, effects and conſequences leaſt in the intention of its inſtruments and agents: which from the political and commercial conteſts of rival princes, accompliſhes every moral purpoſe of a divine adminiſtration: checks and and chaſtiſes the crimes of mankind: gives victory and conqueſt to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009329_0030_1030ED830E854CE8"/>
the juſter cauſe: and by War itſelf enlarges the empire of the PRINCE OF PEACE:</p>
            <p>HOWEVER flattering may be our ideas of the national glory and greatneſs: the <hi>Felicity</hi> of our Country ſo much tranſcends its <hi>Virtue,</hi> that we muſt refer it to ſome other cauſe; and what ſo probable, as that which is here aſſigned? that we are made the happy inſtruments of accompliſhing the views and purpoſes of divine Providence, on account of the Freedom of our civil Government, the purity and excellence of our Religion? Civil, like intellectual Liberty is better felt than explained: we enjoy it in fact; and England and her Colonies, by being ſo fair examples of both Civil and Religious Freedom, will natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be a check to foreign deſpotiſm; and we may hope, always a ſafe retreat, a ſacred aſylum, from Tyranny and Perſecution.</p>
            <p>Thus to diſcern JESUS CHRIST to be the <hi>end,</hi> His GOSPEL the <hi>object</hi> of all human revolutions, affords a convincing argument (among innumerable others) both of a moral Providence and of the truth of Revealed Religion. So characteriſtic is that deſcription of its divine author: <hi>a crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.</hi>

            <p>IF this theory be admitted—can there be a nobler ſubject of pious gratitude and thankſgiving? Empire, glory, commerce, are great objects to Kings and Stateſmen: but in the counſels

of GOD, they are only ſecondary attentions, and ſubſervient to his univerſal plan of moral government; to which the intereſts of virtue and religion are of the firſt importance, as being inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately connected with the happineſs of his intelligent Creatures.</p>
            <p>EVERY political bleſſing of Liberty and Empire, Peace and Security, ſhould therefore lead us to fulfil the intentions of the Deity; and to concur with his adminiſtration, by improving them, publicly, and every one of us, to the purpoſes of Religion. As we have reaſon to think, that the ſucceſſes of the War and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the Peace are intended for the furtherance of Truth and Chriſtianity: let us rightly improve the ineſtimable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege we ourſelves enjoy, of a pure and uncorrupted Goſpel. <q>
