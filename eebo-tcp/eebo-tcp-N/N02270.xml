            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR the Benefit of Mankind in general, I have taken Pairs to give the World an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what I have found written <hi>in the Works of the moſt Eminent Phyſicians,</hi> concerning the Good that Mankind may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the uſe of COMMON WATER; and of the Informations I have had concerning the <hi>Benefits thereof</hi> from others by Word of Mouth; and of what I have diſcovered <hi>by my own Experience,</hi> from frequent Trials during a Time that hath intervened from that of <hi>Thirty</hi> to <hi>Seventy four Years of Age</hi>: Which is ſufficient to confirm the ſtupendious Effects thereof in many Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, that ſhall be mentioned as my own Diſcovery with reſpect to this Excellent Remedy, which will perform Cures with very little Trouble, and without any Charge, and is alſo to be had where ever there are any Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which is what can hardly be ſaid of any other Thing: So that in ſome Senſe, Water may be truly ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>An Univerſal Remedy,</hi> ſince the Diſeaſes it either prevents or cures may have this Remedy applied to all Perſons, and in all Places where Men do inhabit.</p>

            <p>
               <label>Excellency of Water.</label> The firſt Commendation of Common Water that I ſhall mention, is that which is written concerning it by Dr. <hi>Manwaring,</hi>  in his <hi>Method &amp; Means of enjoying Health</hi>; wherein he ſaith, That Water is a whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Drink, or rather the moſt wholeſome— being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Man in his beſt State: which doth ſtrongly argue that Drink to be the moſt ſuitable for Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture — anſwering all the Intentions of common Drinks, for it cools, moiſtens, and quencheth Thirſt; 'tis clear, thin, and fit to convey the Nouriſhment through the ſmalleſt Veſſels of the Body — and is a Drink that is a Rule to itſelf, and requires little Caution in the Uſe of it, <hi>ſince none will be tempted to drink of it more than needs</hi>: And that in the Primitive Ages of the World, Water-Drinkers, he ſays, were the longeſt Livers by ſome Hundreds of Years— nor ſo often ſick and complaining as we are.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Keill,</hi> when he treats concerning the Stomach, in his <hi>Abridgment of the Anatomy of Human Bodies,</hi> ſaith, That Water ſeems the fitteſt to promote Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Food which we eat; all ſpiritous Liquors hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Property by which they hurt, rather than help Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion; the ſad Effects of which they are ſenſible of, he ſaith, who by a long Uſe thereof have loſt their Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, hardly ever to be reſtored without drinking Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>which ſeldom faileth of procuring a good Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite and a ſtrong Digeſtion.</hi> With which Dr. <hi>Baynard</hi> does agree in that Affirmation,
<q>That Water liquifies and concocts our Food better than any fomented Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor whatſoever.</q>
               <hi>Hiſt. of Cold Bathing,</hi> p. 440.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Prat,</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe of Mineral Waters,</hi> ſhews it to be his Judgment, That if People would accuſtom themſelves to drink Water, they would be more free from many Diſeaſes; ſuch as <hi>Tremblings, Palſies, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies, Giddineſs, Pains in the Head, Gout, Stone, Dropſy, Rheumatiſm, Piles,</hi> and ſuch-like: Which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes are moſt common among them that drink ſtrong Drinks, and which Water generally would prevent. Moreover, he alſo ſaith, That Water plentifully drank
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002701_0004_0FE5F2E223539058"/>
               <hi>ſtrengthens the Stomach, cauſeth an Appetite, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the Sight, maketh the Senſes lively, and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all the Paſſages of the Body,</hi> eſpecially thoſe of the Kidneys and Bladder.</p>
            <p>'Tis alſo ſaid by Dr. <hi>Duncan,</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe of hot Liquors,</hi> That when Men contented themſelves with Water, <hi>they had more Health and Strength</hi>; and that at this Day thoſe who drink nothing but Water, are more healthy &amp; live longer than thoſe who drink ſtrong Liquors, <hi>which raiſes the Heat of the Stomach to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, whereas Water keeps it in a due Temper.</hi> And he adds in another Part of the Book, That <hi>by hot Liquor the Blood is inflamed</hi>; and ſuch whoſe Blood is infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, live not ſo long as thoſe who are of a cooler Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: <hi>A hot Blood being commonly the Cauſe of Fluxes, Rheums, ill Digestion, Pains in the Limbs, Headach, Dimneſs of Sight,</hi> and eſpecially of <hi>Hysteric Vapours.</hi> He alſo imputes the Cauſe of Ulcers to a hot Blood, and declares, That if Men kept their Blood cool and ſweet, <hi>by a moderate and cooling Diet,</hi> they would never be troubled with Ulcers, or other Breakings-out. Which Coolneſs of the Blood will be well perform'd by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a large Draught of Water in the Morning, which will carry off the bilious and ſalt Recrements by Urine. And if Water is drank alſo after Dinner, it will cool a hot Stomach, and prevent the riſing of thoſe Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which cauſe Winds and Belching after Meat. So that if Perſons who are liable to theſe Diſorders, will leave off ſtrong Liquors and a hot Diet, and drink Water, they will procure better Health to themſelves than they had before.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Floyer</hi> alſo, in his <hi>Treatiſe of Cold Baths,</hi> does affirm, <hi>pag,</hi> 109. <hi>Edit.</hi> 5. That Water-Drinkers are temperate in their Actions, prudent, and ingenious; they live ſafe from thoſe Diſeaſes which affect the Head; ſuch as <hi>Apoplexies, Palſies, Pain, Blindneſs, Deafneſs, Gout, Convulſions, Trembling, Madneſs,</hi> and the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Water cures the <hi>Hiccough, Foetor of the Mouth, and of the whole Body, it reſiſts Putrefaction, and cools burning Heats and Thirſts, and after Dinner it helps
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002701_0005_0FE5F318552763D8"/>
Digestion.</hi> — And if the Vertues of Cold Water were ſeriouſly conſidered, all Perſons would value it as a Great Medicine, in preventing the <hi>Stone, Aſthma,</hi> and <hi>Hyſteric Fits; and to the Uſe of this Children ought to be bred up from their Cradles.</hi> And in <hi>Page</hi> 434, he ſaith, That as Water is in chief the Univerſal Drink of the World — <hi>ſo it is the best, and most ſalubrious.</hi> And in <hi>Page</hi> 437, That he hath known where a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Drinking of Spring-Water hath done conſiderable Cures, by Waſhing off the <hi>acrid, ſcorbutick Salts</hi> from the Blood, and ſtrengthning the <hi>Coats</hi> and <hi>Fibres</hi> of the Stomach and Bowels, <hi>and hath brought on a good Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and a ſtrong Digestion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having read over an old Book written by one Sir <hi>Tho. Elliot,</hi> intituled, <hi>The Caſtle of Health,</hi> he there decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from his own Experience, That in the County of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> tho' it was a very cold Quarter, the Poorer Sort, which in his Time did never, or but very ſeldom drink any other Drinks but Water, were ſtrong of Body, and lived to a very great Age: to which Relation that of Sir <hi>Henry Blount</hi> is very agreable, who affirmed in his Book <hi>of Travels into the Levant,</hi> (where under the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Government the Uſe of Wine was forbid, <hi>and where the common Drink is Water</hi>) that he then had a better Stomach to his Food, and digeſted it more kindly than he ever did before or ſince.</p>
            <p>And in the <hi>Treatiſe of the Vanity of Philoſophy,</hi> written by Dr. <hi>Gideon Harvey,</hi> it is affirmed by him, That it is not Heat that cauſeth a good Digeſtion, <hi>but a proper Ferment, or Liquor provided by Nature,</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Food into a Subſtance like unto Pap made with fine Flour, which Diſſolvent, he ſaith, is much depraved by hot ſpiritous Liquors; and therefore he commends Water above all other Drinks to promote Degeſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Gout and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriac Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly.</label> Water drinking is alſo ſaid by Dr. <hi>Allen</hi> to be good to prevent Two Deplorable Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the <hi>Gout,</hi>  &amp; the <hi>Hypochondri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac Melancholly</hi>; For, ſays he, the <hi>Gout</hi> is generally cauſed by the too great Drinking of fermented Liquors,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002701_0006_0FE5F3191C034F78"/>
               <hi>and is never ſaid to have aſſaulted any Drinker of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>; and he ſait<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> alſo, That <hi>Melancholly Hippochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driac is kept off longest by drinking Water instead of ſtrong Drink.</hi> To which let me add. That I once knew a gouty Gentleman, who, to avoid his Drinking Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in <hi>London,</hi> retired to <hi>New Brentford,</hi> where I then lived; in which Town by a very temperate Diet of one Meal a Day, and drinking only Water, he lived two whole Years free from Pain: But being viſited by one who came that Way, and invited to drink but one Bottle of Claret between them, he fell next Day into a terrible Fit of the <hi>Gout,</hi> which held above a Month after; of which being recovered, he by the ſame Courſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued well till I left the place, which was about a Year and an half after.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Gravel.</label> The good Properties of Water are further manifeſted in preventing <hi>the breeding of Gravel in the Kidneys</hi>;  for <hi>Zechias,</hi> in <hi>Conſul.</hi> 17. as he is quoted by <hi>Salmon,</hi> affirms, That nothing does ſo much abate the Heat of the Kidneys, and free them from thoſe Recrements which cauſe Pain in the Back, <hi>one great Sign of Gravel,</hi> as Water does; but he adviſeth <hi>to drink it warm,</hi> by the Uſe of which, he ſaith, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Heat in time will be ſo extinguiſhed, that no more of that Matter cauſing Gravel will be produced in the Body. Which Aſſertion by Experience I have found to be true; for obſerving much Gravel to be voided by me, as alſo abundance of Matter floating in the Urine like Bran, with a great Number of Recrements like Cutt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Hair, ſome above an Inch long, <hi>which Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were found in all the Water that I made in above Twelve Months</hi>; for which I could get no Remedy: I was adviſed to drink Water, which in about half a Year did intirely free me from thoſe Symptoms, which ſome out of Ignorance imputed to Witchcraft, ſo that from that Time to this preſent I never have been troubled with it.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Stone in the Bladder.</label> Water alſo is commended as efficacious to prevent <hi>the breeding of the Stone in the Bladder,</hi>  for it hath been obſerved, that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002701_0007_0FE5F319E37E49D8"/>
in ſome who have been cut for the Stone <hi>that new Stones have been engendered, ſo that ſome young Perſons have been cut ſeveral Times.</hi> Now to prevent this, the drinking Water hath been adviſed with Succeſs; for by this that intemperate Heat in the Body was abated which did occaſion the Diſtemper. Some have adviſed to drink it warm, and others cold, and in particular <hi>Van Heydon,</hi> a Phyſician of <hi>Ghent</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> in his Book, entitled, <hi>Help for the Rich and Poor</hi>; which, he ſaith, in <hi>p.</hi> 49. is ſufficiently inſinuated by <hi>Piſo</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> who do aſſure us, That the taking a Draught of cold Water in the Morning, hath done ſo much Good, that ſeveral after the voiding of a Stone never had any more Stones grow in them.</p>
            <p>Which Experiment may give Light to the Diſcovery of a Way to cure the Stone without Cutting; for if the growing of new Stones can be prevented by drinking Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let it be hot or cold, <hi>it may prevent a Stone from growing bigger when begun</hi>; and if the adding Matter to increaſe a Stone new begun, can be prevented, Nature in Time may waſte that which is begun, eſpecially if ſome Drops of ſweet Spirit of Nitre be added to all the Water drank, which will powerfully help to cool, and is known to be an admirable Mover or provoker of Urine, <hi>and will waste a Stone, and make it crumble like Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's Earth, if applied to a Stone taken from the Body.</hi> Or the Water may be ſweetned with Honey, which is now much in Uſe among the Gentry, as I am inform'd by an Ingenious Apothecary; who told me that among them at preſent, Pump-Water and Honey was in great Repute to give Eaſe in Gravel; And there is ſo near an Affinity between Gravel and the Stone, that what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for one, will be ſuitable to both, and will prevent the growing of both.</p>

Which Injury to unborn Infants would be prevented, if the Mother would be temperate in Diet, and drink Water; eſpecially at Meals, by which the Blood of the Mother would be kept cool and clean; which muſt needs communicate a healthful Subſtance to the Child within her, and prevent all thoſe Diſtempers, which Infants do bring with them into the World.</p>

               <label>Sickneſs at the Stomach.</label> Moreover, by means of Water all Sickneſs at the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach may be cured, which is done thus: Take four Quarts of Water,  make it as hot over the Fire as you can drink it; of which Water let a Quart be taken down at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Draughts; <hi>then wrap a Rag round a ſmall Piece of a Stick, till it is about the Bigneſs of a Man's Thumb,</hi> tie it faſt with ſome Thread; and with this, by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring gently to put it a little Way down your Throat, provoke your ſelf to vomit up again moſt of the Water,

then drink another Quart, and Vomit up that, &amp; repeat the ſame the third and fourth Time. You may alſo provoke Vomiting by tickling your Throat with your Finger, or the Feather-End of a Gooſe-Quill; <hi>but the Cloth round a Skuer maketh one Vomit with moſt Eaſe,</hi> which is done with no Trouble when the Stomach is full. And by this Way of Vomiting, <hi>which will be all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in an Hour's Time,</hi> that viſcous and ropy Phlegm in the Stomach, which cauſeth the Sickneſs, will be caſt up, ſo that the Party in that Time will be free from all that inward Diſturbance, <hi>if you uſe the Remedy at firſt</hi>; but if the Sickneſs hath continued for a Time, it will require the ſame Courſe <hi>once or twice more,</hi> which may be done in three or four Hours, one after another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Inconvenience, <hi>beſides that of being a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſore in the Breaſt the next Day, which will ſoon go off by the Force of Natare.</hi> Which Remedy, by Forty Years Experience, I look upon to be infallible <hi>in all Sickneſs at the Stomach from what Cauſe ſoever, and for all Pains in the Belly which ſeem to be above the Navel</hi>; for theſe are all in the Stomach, as by long Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience I have found: Which Pains are generally count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Cholick; but it is not ſo</hi>; for true <hi>Cholicks</hi> are always below the Navel, in the Gut, <hi>Colon.</hi> And by this Means I have eaſed very great Pains cauſed <hi>by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Muſſels that were poiſonous</hi>; and it is alſo a certain Cure for all <hi>Surfeits</hi> or Diſorders that follow after much eating; ſo that the Lives of Multitudes might be ſaved by this Means, who for Want of expelling what offends, do often die in Miſery: For by thus cleanſing the Stomach at the firſt, the Root of Diſeaſes proceeding from <hi>Surfeiting,</hi> or unwholeſome Food, or any viſcous Humours from a bad Digeſtion, are prevented; <hi>the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach being the Place in which all Diſtempers do at first begin.</hi> No Man was more ſubject to Sickneſs than myſelf <hi>before Thirty Years of Age</hi>; but ſince I found out the Way of Vomiting with Water, <hi>which is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Forty Years,</hi> I never have been ſick for two Days together: For when I find myſelf ill to any great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, I betake myſelf to this Way of Vomiting, <hi>which

            </p>
            <p>Some Few indeed pretend they are not able to vomit by this Means: Now, if they cannot vomit, let them take a Pint of Water when they find themſelves ill from eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and do ſo every three or four Hours, <hi>eating no more till they are hungry</hi>; and they will find the Water digeſt and carry off what was offenſive. The Ingenious Dr. <hi>Cheyne,</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe of the Gout,</hi> doth affirm, That warm Water drank freely in a Morning faſting, and at Meals, (<hi>and I ſay cold Water is as good</hi>) hath been a ſovereign Remedy <hi>for reſtoring loſt Appetites, and ſtrengthning weak Digestions, when other more pompous Medicines have failed.</hi> And he adviſeth Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Perſons, after Exceſs either in Meat or Drink, <hi>to ſwill down as much fair Water as their Stomach will bear,</hi> before they go to Bed, whereby they will reap theſe Advantages, <hi>either the Contents of the Stomach will be thrown up,</hi> or both meat &amp; Drink will be much diluted, <hi>and the Labour and Expence of Spirits in Digestion much ſaved.</hi> And indeed I have found by long Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that nothing cauſeth ſo good a Digeſtion as fair Water: but this requires Time to free us from the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs that an ill Digeſtion cauſeth, <hi>whereas Vomiting is an immediate Remedy,</hi> and frees a Man from it upon the Spot.</p>
            <p>We are told by Sir <hi>John Floyer,</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe of Bath and Mineral Springs</hi> That Vomiting with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is very uſeful <hi>in the Gout, Sciatica, Wind, Shortneſs of Breath, Hypochondriac Melancholy, and Falling-Sickneſs</hi>; which Diſtempers are generally derived from evil Matter contained in the Stomach, as is likewiſe

               <hi>Giddineſs in the Head, and Apoplexies,</hi> with which myſelf once ſeemed to be threatned; for after eating a plentiful Dinner, I was ſeized with Giddineſs, and the Sight of my Eyes became ſo depraved, that Things ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed double, which was accompanied with a ſtrange Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation of Spirit; and having read, That <hi>Apoplexies generally ſeize after Eating,</hi> I immediately called for Water, and not daring to ſtay till it was warmed I drank it cold, and by the Help of my Finger provoked Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Upon which I did immediately overcome the Evils <hi>I was threatned with,</hi> the Symptoms before mentioned being the ſame <hi>as did precede the Fit of an Apoplexy in another Perſon,</hi> as himſelf afterwards told me, who died of it the third Fit, about a Year after.</p>

And I knew one, who by this Means, <hi>as he was adviſed by me,</hi> lived com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably in this City two or three Winters, but having undertaken Buſineſs which did occaſion drinking ſtrong Drinks, was the next Winter carried off by the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; <hi>Wine, Ale,</hi> or <hi>Brandy,</hi> being as bad as Poiſon to People troubled with Shortneſs of Breath.

And the ſame was the Practice of <hi>Sigiſmundus Graſius,</hi> who commends pure Water in a Vomiting and Looſneſs <hi>to be drank in large Quantities</hi>; for thereby, he ſaith, the curroſive and ſharp Humours will be ſo weakened, that they will no more offend: And, he ſaith, it may be drank cold, if the Patient be ſtrong, otherwiſe let it be warmed.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Fluxes.</label> And in <hi>common Fluxes</hi> without Vomiting, a Quart or more of warm Water drank, will ſo weaken the Sharpneſs whereby the Diſtemper is cauſed,  that it will ſoon be overcome, and the Gripings eaſed; and in the <hi>Bloody Flux,</hi> which is the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous of all Fluxes, the Ingenious <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth a large drinking of cold Water as the beſt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies: <hi>But then no other Subſtance muſt be taken till the Diſeaſe is cured.</hi> And another great Phyſician, by Name <hi>Luſitanus,</hi> affirms, <hi>Cent.</hi> 1. <hi>Obſer.</hi> 46.

And 'tis ſaid by another, That 'tis an excellent Remedy <hi>in Fevers, to drink a Quart of hot Water, and ſweat upon it, being covered warm.</hi> There is alſo one Dr. <hi>Quinion,</hi> who, in his <hi>Book of Obſervations,</hi> writes, That to one in a <hi>malignant Fever,</hi> whoſe Pulſe was ſo low it could ſcarcely be felt, there was three Quarts of Water given, at ſeveral Draughts, to make him Vomit; but it did not operate that Way, yet the Event was this; That <hi>it did refreſh him, much raiſed his Pulſe, brought him into a breathing Sweat, and paſſed off by Urine</hi>: Which Lowneſs of the Pulſe my own Experience hath often found to be raiſed by drinking Water plentifully. And I know a Woman, who, tho' ſhe in <hi>a Fever</hi> had the Advice of two Doctors, yet became diſtracted: I bid the Nurſe give her a Pint of cold Water, which ſhe drank up, <hi>and in three or four Minutes came to her right Senſes; and deſiring to drink more, ſhe recovered.</hi> And I have obſerved, that when, in Fevers, the Patient can reliſh no other Drink, <hi>yet Water is always drank with Pleaſure,</hi> as it alſo will always be after the eating

ſweet Things, that ſpoil the Reliſh of other Drinks; which is one Excellence peculiar to Water, and ſhews it to be moſt agreeable to the Nature of Mankind, tho' now ſo much ſlighted.

Some order the Water to be drank warm but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay, <hi>That the drinking it cold vastly excells the uſing it hot in a Cough.</hi> 'Tis ſaid by <hi>Van Heydon,</hi> That ſome may think it ſtrange to adviſe Water in ſuch Diſeaſes, which moſt do account to proceed from <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi> or <hi>Indigestion</hi>; but he ſays, That in any Diſeaſe where the Caſe is dangerous, <hi>the Uſe of Water is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly friend to Nature</hi>; cold Water being a Preventer <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a Cauſe of Crudity, ſince by all Experience, it is proved to be a Promoter of a good Digeſtion</hi>: And at this Time I know a Woman, Seventy-eight Years of Age, who for this Ten Years paſt hath had a great Cough, and ſpit much tough Phlegm, that this preſent Winter 1722, hath been perſuaded to leave off all ſtrong and ſmall fermented Liquor, and drink only Water at Meals, and ſometimes a diſh or two of Tea; and hath found herſelf much leſs ſubject to Cough than before, and ſcarce Coughs at all in Bed, tho' ſubject before to Cough very much in the Night; ſhe alſo Drinks at Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time half a Pint of cold Water, and the ſame Quantity firſt in the Morning, and finds herſelf more comforted by it at ſo great an Age, than Wine hath at any Time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded.</p>

            <p>To what hath been ſaid, may be added this Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>That when the best Phyſicians are baffled by ſome Diſtempers,</hi> they adviſe their Patients to uſe the Water of ſome Mineral Spring; tacitly acknowledging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, <hi>that all their Preſcriptions may be excell'd by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> They pretend indeed, to aſcribe its Effects to ſome Minerals with which the Waters are Tinctur'd: But Dr. <hi>Baynard,</hi> in <hi>pag</hi> 438. of Sir <hi>John Floyer's Cold Bathing,</hi> tells of a certain Perſon who uſed to frequent <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> by which he found much Benefit; but being hindered from going thither one Seaſon did drink the ſame Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Water taken from the Pump of a Spring in his own Yard, which did him as much Service: Whereupon he wrote thus on his Pump:

            <p>I once knew <hi>a large Ulcer in the Foot,</hi> made by the running of melted Braſs into the Shoe, that was kept in hand by a <hi>Surgeon</hi> nine Weeks, without any Probability of Healing, <hi>becauſe of the great Inflammation that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it</hi>; but the Party being a Lover of Angling, was perſuaded to go with ſome others to <hi>Hackney River</hi>: Some of them went bare-legg'd into the Water, to come at a certain Hole where much Fiſh was ſometimes found. The Sport was ſo good that the lame Man, having pulled off his Stockings and Plaiſters, went in alſo, <hi>where he ſtaid above two Hours,</hi> and coming out again he found the <hi>Ulcer,</hi> which appeared very read and angry when he went in, did look pale; <hi>he put on his Dreſſings,</hi> and came home, and in leſs than a Fortnight his Ulcer healed up; which doubtleſs was occaſioned <hi>by the aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Inflamation by the Coldneſs of the Water.</hi> And I have had an Account alſo from an Acquaintance, that was Surgeon to a Merchant Ship, that their Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, at a Time when their Captain treated ſome Friends on Board, going to charge a Gun that juſt before had been fired off, the Cartridge he was ramming down took fire, whereby he was blown into the Water, <hi>and had ſome of his Fingers blown off,</hi> and it was about an Hour before a Boat could be got to take him up: But they found that the Coldneſs of the Water had almoſt ſtopt the Bleeding, and the Cure was effected ſo ſpeedily, that other Surgeons wondered at it; which he imputed to the Water, <hi>which kept back the Humours, by its Coldneſs, from flowing to the Part at first</hi>: So that there was no Impediment, from Inflammation, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der healing; <hi>for the chief Impediment to healing, is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation in Wounds or Ulcers.</hi>

Remedy, as <hi>Van Heydon</hi> affirms; who ſaith, That by bathing in cold Water all harm ſo received may, by this Remedy, be cured more ſafely and more ſpeedily than by any other, without Loſs of Time, Coſt or Trouble; for no more is to be done, as I have often found, that, as ſoon as can be, <hi>to put the Part into a Veſſel of cold Water for about two Hours,</hi> which will prevent all Swelling and Pain, <hi>by repelling or keeping back the Humours that otherwiſe would flow to the Part.</hi> And if it ſhould be the Shoulder, or any other Part, which is ſo hurt, that cannot well be immerſed in Water after this mannner, Water may be applied, by dipping Towels <hi>folded up</hi> into it, and laying them to the Part, as is done, in effect, to the wrenched Joints of Horſes, about which, if you wind oftentimes a thick Rope made of Hay, and then caſt upon it divers times a Pail of cold Water, the Wrench will be cured; which Experiment is now commonly practiſed by thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about Horſes.</p>

cold Water to the Part every Day for about a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Hour: <hi>Upon reading of which, I tried the Experiment upon myſelf,</hi> who for a long Time had been troubled with the running of much clear Water from my Noſe, with great ſpitting of thin Rheum: <hi>For I let a Water-Cock run upon the Mould of my Head every Morning,</hi> by which, in about Six Weeks Time, I was eaſed of my Trouble. And ſince that I had a credible Information of a certain Servant-Maid, who was afflicted greatly with a <hi>Rheumatiſm</hi> and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable <hi>Pain in the Head,</hi> who being put into <hi>St</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas<hi>'s Hoſpital,</hi> her Nurſe was order'd by the Doctor to apply to her Head Towels four Times double, dipped in cold Water, changing them as they became warm, which ſhe was to continue doing Four or Five Hours; in which Time ſhe was freed from that Pain in the Head, and was afterwards cured of the <hi>Rheumatiſm</hi> by other Means.</p>

               <label>Want of Sleep in Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</label> The <hi>Want of Sleep in</hi> Fevers may be cured likewiſe by the Application of cold Water: For to a near Relation in a Fever,  who could not ſleep for three Days and three Nights, I ordered a Towel to be ſeveral Times folded up, then to be dipped in Water, and a little wrung-out, <hi>and ſo laid upon her Forehead, and to be new dipped as it grew hot</hi>; which in about two Hours time ſo cooled her Head, that ſhe fell into a Sleep, and continued in it five Hours: And I order'd the ſame to be done the next Night, with the ſame Succeſs. And we find that Dr. <hi>Cockburn,</hi> in his Treatiſe of <hi>Sea Diſeaſes,</hi> did order for the Want of Sleep in Fevers, to dip a Towel, four times doubled in <hi>Oxycrat,</hi> which is ſix Parts Water, and one Part Vinegar, to be bound about the Head and Temples; which, he ſaith will cauſe Sleep with wonderful Succeſs. But cold Water only will have the ſame Effect, as I often have proved.</p>

in an Inſtant will recover tho' for a Time he ſeemeth dead, and perhaps might not have recovered in ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, if cold Water had not been ſo applied; ſuch Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings being ſometimes deadly, which proceed from poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Vapours aſcending up to the Brain from a foul Stomach; for ſuch Effects there are, as I have found by Experience, who in my young Days, did ſwoon away twice; <hi>at both which times I was ſenſible of a Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Wind in my Stomach,</hi> from whence I plainly felt a Fume or Vapour aſcend to the Head, <hi>that in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand deprived me of all Senſe</hi>: But being both Times in the Company of a Perſon who had ſeen the Thing tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he daſhed ſome cold Water againſt my Face, <hi>which I remember made me ſtart, as if I had been ſuddenly awaked.</hi> And I am apt to think, that ſome die in ſuch a Fit, when none are near to help them; and eſpecially when ſo taken in their Sleep, <hi>which I believe none need fear who live temperately, or that eat no Suppers</hi>; none who have refrain'd from Suppers, having been ever found to die in Sleep.</p>

               <label>Bleedings at the Noſe.</label> Dangerous <hi>Bleedings at the Noſe</hi> have alſo been cured with cold Water largely drank,  ſyringing cold Water up their Noſtrils, and applying Towels round their Necks dipt in cold Water, changing them as they grow warm; for 'tis ſaid by a good Writer, That this will ſo cool the Heat of the Blood, and by the Coldneſs of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſyringed up the Noſe, ſo contract the Mouths of the Veins which bleed, that it will put a ſtop to the bleedings. Such Bleedings have alſo been ſtopt <hi>by daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold Water often into the Face,</hi> as a <hi>French</hi> Writer hath affirmed, whoſe Name was <hi>Flamand</hi>; and the ſame alſo is affirmed by <hi>Cook</hi> in his <hi>Marrow of Surgery.</hi>

it on.</hi> This, by preventing Inflammation and a Flux of Humours, will give Nature time ſoon to heal it without any other Application, as is ſeen in the common Practice of Surgeons when they let a Man blood; <hi>for all the Application they make to the Vein ſo cut, is a Pledget of Linnen dipt in cold Water, and bound on with a Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi>: for all Wounds without loſs of Subſtance will heal of themſelves, if Inflammation be prevented, and the Lips of the Wound are kept cloſe together.</p>

For if this Immerſion be of uſe when the Party is ſo far gone, why ſhould it not be of greater force in preſerving from it, <hi>if ſpeedily applied &amp; repeated</hi>? Now tho' this is mention'd by him as a probable Opinion, yet Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in our days ſhews, <hi>That the plunging the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient into the ſalt Water either of the River of</hi> Thames <hi>about</hi> Graveſend, <hi>or in the ſalt Springs in</hi> Cheſhire, is the beſt means to prevent any Evil ſucceeding the Bite of a mad Dog; <hi>they muſt indeed be dipt ſo often, as to be almoſt drown'd before the Danger is over</hi>: but 'tis a queſtion whether the Saltneſs of the Water contributes any thing to this Cure, ſince <hi>Boerhaave,</hi> the preſent Profeſſor at <hi>Leyden,</hi> affirms, That when Men bitten by a mad Dog are arriv'd to the Fear of Water, call'd an <hi>Hydrophobia,</hi> they may be cured, <hi>by blinding the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's Eyes, and throwing of him into a Pond of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

often, till he ſeems not to be afraid of it,</hi> or but very little, and then force him to drink large Quantities.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Falling-Sickneſs.</label> And we are told by Dr. <hi>Edw. Browne,</hi>  that a Perſon troubled with the <hi>Falling-Sickneſs,</hi> by happening to fall into a cold Spring (<hi>I ſuppoſe it was in the time of his Fit</hi>) was freed from his Diſtemper all his Life after: and he ſaith there is no need of preparing the Body for it in this, as in ſome other Caſes. But the Patient, when plunged into a cold Bath, ought to continue in the Bath each time about three or four Minutes: for in plunging over head and ears at his firſt Entrance into a cold Bath, the Brain will be ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly affected, as to be relieved from the Diſtemper, which is a kind of Convulſion proceeding from an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſome other Cauſe; <hi>but we want more Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments to confirm this Notion</hi>: Which Notion may be worth noting, that the thing may be tried in others, to ſee whether it will ſucceed as it did in this Perſon. For 'tis ſaid by the ingenious Dr. <hi>Pitcairn,</hi> a <hi>Scotchman,</hi> ſome time <hi>Profeſſor</hi> at <hi>Leyden,</hi> that <hi>there is no ſuch thing as the Art of Curing, but only the Practice, Remedies were found out by chance, p.</hi> 264. of his Works: for when Remedies thus happen to be diſcover'd, and prove often to be effectual, the remembring that Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to apply it in a like caſe Practice, brings Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the Preſcriber; but if it fails, ſome other Experiment muſt be tried, which, were Phyſick an Art, need not be done, becauſe the Rules of Art art certain, and Men depend upon them as ſuch.</p>

               <label>Madneſs and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.</label> 'Tis alſo ſaid by the ſame Dr. <hi>Browne,</hi>  that <hi>Madneſs</hi> &amp; <hi>Melancholy,</hi> with all their Retinue, may find better Effects from the Uſe of bathing in cold Water, than from other violent Methods, with which People ſo afflicted are now treated; for ſays he, <hi>that which will make a drunken Man ſober in a minute, will certainly go a great way towards the Cure of a Madman in a month.</hi> Now 'tis moſt certain, to my own Knowledge, <hi>that if

a drunken Man be plunged over head and ears in cold Water, he will come out of it perfectly ſober</hi>: And ſome I have known, that in ſuch caſes have been reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by barely waſhing their Heads in cold Water. Which fore-mentioned Opinion of Dr. <hi>Browne</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Practice of Dr. <hi>Blair,</hi> who, in a Letter to Dr. <hi>Baynard,</hi> declares, That he cured a Man <hi>raving mad,</hi> who being bound in a Cart, ſtript of his Clothes, and blindfolded, <hi>that the Surprize might be the greater</hi>; he on a ſudden had a great Fall of Water let down upon him from the height of twenty foot, <hi>under which he continued ſo long as his Strength would permit</hi>: and after his Return home, he fell into a Sleep, and ſlept twenty-nine Hours, and awaked in as quiet a State of Mind as ever, and ſo had continued to the time of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that Letter, which was twelve Months.

See <hi>pag.</hi> 226.</p>
            <p>Which Relation ſeems to make that a more probable Truth, which was related in a Letter from Sir <hi>John Floyer</hi> to Dr. <hi>Browne,</hi> and printed by that Doctor; wherein it is ſaid, that in <hi>Normandy</hi> they <hi>immerſe Fools, or dip them in cold Water, to cure them</hi>: a hot Brain being the Cauſe, perhaps, of ſeveral Diſorders in the Underſtanding, and is in great part found to be true, in the ridiculous Behaviour of ſome drunken Men, which, when their Heads are become cool, <hi>abhor what they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did do or ſay.</hi> Now if ſuch Dipping would cure Fools among us, great Numbers might be made more happy then they are by being ſo dipt.</p>

               <label>Jaundice.</label> We alſo find mention,  in the Deſcription of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Iſlands, of an odd Remedy commonly made uſe of there for the Cure of the <hi>Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi>; which is this: They ſtrip the Party naked, lay him upon the Ground on his Belly, <hi>and pour unawares upon his Back a Pail of cold Water.</hi> And alſo <hi>Pains in the Joints,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Curtis</hi> tells us, will be cured, by holding the Part under the Stream of a Pump or Cock; and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting with cold Water is commended as good to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage <hi>hot Swellings.</hi> And I know a Perſon who had often been ſubject to <hi>blood ſhot or inflamed Eyes,</hi> who afterwards, upon the beginning of the ſame Diſtemper, took, by Advice, a Ball of Linnen Rags, dipt them in cold Water, and applied them to the Part, <hi>cooling them by new dipping as oft as they grew hot</hi>: which Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was continued three Hours, in which time the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour was ſo repelled, as to be troubleſome no more; for the Party, to my knowledge, hath had no ſign of that Diſtemper ſince, tho' the ſame had been very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome many times before.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Defluctions.</label> It is alſo adviſed by Dr. <hi>Gideon Harvey,</hi>  to waſh the Eyes well twice a day in cold Water, as the beſt Remedy <hi>to prevent Defluxions on them, &amp; preſerve the Eye ſight, which it greatly comforts.</hi> And this I have found true for many Years, my Eyes being often apt to be dim, and ſtiff, ſo that I could ſcarce open my Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids; which, upon waſhing for a minute with fair Water, hath been felt no more for a good while after. Beſides which Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to the Eyes, Authors ſay it is alſo good to <hi>preſerve the Memory,</hi> if the whole Forehead be waſhed twice a day; which alſo is a certain Cure for itching in the Eyes, as Authors tell us. And indeed waſhing with Water will free Mankind from a troubleſome Itching in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Part of the Body, let it be never ſo private, as <hi>Cook,</hi> in his <hi>Obſervations on</hi> Engliſh <hi>Bodies,</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly declare from Experience.</p>

               <label>Calloſity.</label> Some People are troubled with a <hi>Calloſity,</hi>  or <hi>Hardneſs of the Bottoms of their Feet,</hi> which is ſo troubleſome, as to be a hindrance to their eaſy walking; for which a Cure is preſcribed by Dr. <hi>Cook,</hi> that is, <hi>to ſoak them well in warm Water,</hi> till the Hardneſs is ſoften'd, and then ſcrape it off with the Edge of a Knife: and if the Feet burn with any unnatural Heat, the bathing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in hot Water will cool them, by giving vent to what offends.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Scurvy.</label> And the plentiful drinking of Water is commended in the Scurvy <hi>whether hot or cold,</hi>  by Dr. <hi>Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cairn,</hi> to diſſolve the Scorbutick Salts, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them out by Urine, <hi>whether they are Acids or Alkalies</hi>; and myſelf having formerly been extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled with the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> which often made me faint and weak, and my Pulſe ſo low as ſcarcely to be felt, did find at laſt that the Pulſe would infallibly riſe upon drinking a Pint or more of cold Water, <hi>and in a little time I ſhould again become brisk &amp; ſtrong</hi>: For I have often obſerved, that upon a Diſorder of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, the Strength of the bodily Members ſoon would fail, <hi>and as eaſily be recovered when the Diſorder of the Stomach was removed</hi>; yea, by long Experience, I have found that nothing conduceth ſo much to bodily Strength as a Stomach in right Order, which requires Temperance &amp; cooling Diet to bring it into Order, when diſtempered.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Aſthma.</label> To what hath been already ſaid,  I will add an Account, taken from a credible Perſon, of a Man in the Pariſh of <hi>Shoreditch,</hi> who was deſperately ill of an <hi>Asthma,</hi> or <hi>Shortneſs of Breath,</hi> and <hi>deep Conſumption,</hi> for which he had tried many Remedies to no purpoſe. At length he was adviſed by a Phyſician, being poor, <hi>to drink no other Drink but Water, and eat no other Food but Water Gruel, without Salt or Sugar</hi>; which Courſe of Diet he continued for three Months, finding himſelf at firſt to be ſomewhat better, and at the three Months end he was perfectly cured: but, for Security-ſake, he continued in that Diet a Month longer, and grew ſtrong and fat upon it. <hi>But his Diet he had no

mind to till he was thorowly hungry,</hi> and then he eat it with pleaſure; in which perhaps conſiſted the beſt part of his Cure, it being an Advantage to Health never to eat till Hunger calls for Food.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Cough.</label> And I remember a young Woman, a Burniſher of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>who had a deſperate Cough,</hi> for which ſhe had taken many things of an <hi>Apothecary</hi> to no purpoſe;  at length the Journeyman told her, his Maſter ſaid, he could do no more: but, ſaid the Fellow, I would adviſe you every Morning to waſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind your Ears, and upon your Temples, and on the Mould of your Head with cold Water; which ſhe told me ſhe did, and was perfectly cured of her Cough by that Means.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Difficulty in making wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</label> There are divers other Caſes wherein the Uſe of Water hath done much good.  I knew an ancient Practiſer in Phyſick, who told me, That in many <hi>Difficulties of making Water,</hi> he adviſed the Party to put his Yard into Water as hot as he could endure it, <hi>which, in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, did cauſe him to make water</hi>; and that Women have had the ſame Benefit by ſitting over hot Water. And he often had adviſed them <hi>who were coſtive, and went to Stool with great Difficulty,</hi> to ſit over a Pot with hot Water in it; which ſoon was attended with an eaſy Dejection, or Stool, the Body drawing up the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, which did provoke Expulſion of Excrements with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much ſtraining.</p>
            <p>And it hath been obſerved, that <hi>froward Children have been made much more quiet,</hi> by waſhing their low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Parts every Morning with Water, to waſh off the Salts of their Urine, which uſually ſtick in the Pores of the Skin, and are fretful and uneaſy, <hi>and nothing cures their Soreneſs about thoſe Parts like it.</hi> Nor is there any thing more effectual to cure Men, <hi>who are gauled with Riding,</hi> than to waſh themſelves well, when they go to bed, with cold Water; <hi>and waſhing the bear Breast every Morning with cold Water,</hi> will make thoſe hardy who before were apt at every turn to take
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002701_0033_0FE5F38BF4C15730"/>
Cold. To which I will add this, that Sir <hi>Theodore Mayhern</hi> affirms in his <hi>Medicinal Counſels,</hi> that in moſt Diſeaſes of the Head, there is nothing better than to bathe it with cold Water, which, in a deſperate Pain in the Ears upon taking cold, I have found to be true; for the Pain ſeemeth to Vaniſh upon applying to it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 30 Minutes, a Towel doubled up often, and wet in cold Water; and tho' it returned again ſome Hours after, yet Eaſe was obtained the ſame way, and the Cure perfected in four times doing: Which Cure of a Pain gotten with Cold, by a cold Application, will not ſeem ſo ſtrange, when we conſider that in the Northern Countries, Mortifications from Cold are no ways to be cured but by applying cold Snow.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, Water when rightly made uſe of, doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from the Accounts beforementioned, very effectual <hi>to prevent &amp; Cure many Diſeaſes,</hi> but more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the inward Uſe thereof; for to uſe the Words of the ingenious Dr. <hi>Curtis,</hi> in his <hi>Eſſay for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; Recovery of Health</hi>; The habitual Uſe of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for common Drink <hi>preſerves the native Ferment of the Stomach in due Order, keeps the Blood tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and helps to ſpin out the Thread of Life to the longeſt Extent of Nature, it makes the Reſt at Night more quiet and refreſhing, the Reaſon and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more clear, the Paſſions leſs diſorderly; and, in caſe of eating too much, a large Draught of cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vaſtly exceeds any other Cordial to cauſe Digeſtion</hi>: Water being not ſo cold and lifeleſs, <hi>he ſaith,</hi> as many do imagine. Beſides which Commendation of it by this Doctor, <hi>'tis certainly a Drink that will not ferment in the Stomach, nor turn ſour,</hi> as Wine and ſtrong Malt-Drinks will do, to the hindering of a good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, <hi>which all Acidity in the Stomach certainly doth, when it abounds there</hi>; and is beſt corrected by weakening or making it leſs ſour, by drinking good Store of Water, <hi>as the Experience of above Forty Years Practice hath aſſured my ſelf and many others.</hi> For tho' Water is accounted a contemptible Drink, yet by beginning to make uſe of it at about Thirty Years of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002701_0034_0FE60DC8438181B8"/>
Age, <hi>before which I was often out of Order,</hi> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing the Uſe of it ever ſince, drinking very little Wine or ſtrong Drink, <hi>I have attained to the Age of ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four Years</hi>; when Thouſands in the mean time, who delighted only in drinking ſtrong Beer, Wine, and Brandy, have not lived half ſo long: which makes good that Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Scriptures, That <hi>Wine is a Mocker, &amp; ſtrong Drink is Raging, and he who is deceived thereby is not wiſe,</hi> Prov. xx. 1. ſince it no ways contributes to long Life; for 'tis certain that Thouſands in the World live as long who drink no ſtrong Drink, <hi>as any Drinkers of it do.</hi> Some indeed, from an extraordinary Strength of Nature, have been hard Drinkers, <hi>and yet Die old</hi>; but for one who does this, perhaps an hundred are deſtroyed by it before they come to half the time of Life: and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally we ſhall find that very ſtrong and healthy Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, at the long Run are ruined by Riot and Exceſs, there being no certain Safety in any way of Living, <hi>but that of Temperance &amp; Moderation.</hi> Nature in ſome may, a long time, withſtand the Abuſes offered to it, <hi>but at laſt it will yield to its Enemies</hi>; and thoſe who live the longeſt in an intemperate Courſe, might, from the Strength of their Conſtitution, <hi>have lived much longer, had they eat leſs, and uſed themſelves to drink more Water</hi>; which Drink, as it is moſt friendly, and longeſt will preſerve the Life of a ſtrong Conſtitution, <hi>ſo 'tis abſolutely neceſſary for thoſe that are weak and ſickly,</hi> and are naturally ſubject to <hi>the Gout, the Stone, Shortneſs of Breath, Wind, Ill-Digestion,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Uſeful in Vomiting.</label> But the chief Uſe of Water in preſerving of Health,  <hi>is by uſing of it as a Vomit, as before was ſhewn,</hi> which is an infallible and the moſt ſpeedy Remedy that ever was found out for any Stomach-Sickneſs, or Pain there; for to vomit with warm Water will effectually remove it in one Hour, and be a means to prevent great Fits of Sickneſs, and preſerve the Lives of many Thouſands to old Age, <hi>by cleanſing the Stomach from that tough, ſlimy, or corrupt Matter that offends, and is the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002701_0035_0FE5F38FE9E14C58"/>
Cauſe of all mortal Diſeaſes</hi>; eſpecially of an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy,</hi> which tho' counted a Diſeaſe of the Head, <hi>yet hath its Original from a foul Stomach,</hi> which nothing doth ſo effectually cleanſe as Vomits: according to that of Dr. <hi>Curtis,</hi> who ſaith, That vomiting with warm Water, or <hi>Carduus</hi> Tea, is very beneficial to bring up that which fluctuates in the Stomach, and that tough, ropy Phlegm which ſticks faſt to the Wrinkles and Folds of that Bowel, <hi>and which Purges do often paſs over, and cannot remove.</hi> Which way of Vomiting with warm Water, is ten times more eaſy and pleaſant than that which is effected by the Uſe of a nauſeous Tea made of <hi>Carduus,</hi> which Phyſicians do ſometimes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe; and 'tis alſo ſuch as can do no harm by Violence, as other Vomits made from <hi>Antimony</hi> ſometimes do, for want of drinking after each Vomit a Pint or more of Water-gruel, or warm Water, ſince you may ſtop when you pleaſe, by forbearing to drink more warm Water, when you vomit with Water.</p>
            <p>And here it may not be amiſs to relate what I ſome Years ago diſcovered, in order to Mens freeing themſelves from Sickneſs that may happen after eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for being invited to dine at a certain Table, where there were ſeveral good Diſhes of Meat, I was over-perſwaded to eat more than I ſhould do, and in a little time after Dinner found my ſelf begin to be ſick. I went out and in a private Place attempted to vomit, by tickling my Throat with my Finger, but could not vomit as I deſigned to do; only by this means I raiſed up two or three mouthfuls of thick tough Phlegm, upon which <hi>I found my ſelf better, and my ſick Qualm went off.</hi> I took the Hint it gave me, and have done the ſame ſeveral times ſince, and find that the getting up the Phelgm, <hi>which like Yeſt upon Beer, works up to the Mouth of the Stomach</hi> a Man may free himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rom ſome kinds of Sickneſs after eating.

            <p>
               <label>Gripings.</label> I will conclude with this Note, That in ſuch Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers <hi>where Water-drinking will be availa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a Cure,</hi>  the ſame muſt not be drank ſparingly but plentifully, <hi>as</hi> (for inſtance) <hi>to eaſe the Gripings in a Looſneſs or Flux</hi>: for if but a Pint of Water ſhould be drank, Eaſe would hardly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; but drinking in about an hour's time <hi>a Quart or three Pints,</hi> the Sharpneſs and evil Quality of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour offending will be ſo far diluted or weakened, that immediate Eaſe will follow. <hi>If the Seaſon be too cold to drink cold water, you may warm it a little upon the Fire, or put a hot Toaſt of Bread in every Pint</hi>: and the ſame is true <hi>in Fevers, or in Pains from Gravel or the Cholick</hi>: A ſmall Quantity will not be effectual in theſe Caſes, for in the <hi>Cholick</hi> a Quart is neceſſary, <hi>which ought to be carefully noted,</hi> and in a Fever a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Water will rather increaſe the Burhing, which large Draughts, often drank, will ſoon take off. <hi>Reſt, Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and drinking much Water,</hi> after a Vomit or two, is a Courſe that never yet hath failed to cure Fevers, <hi>by clearing the Stomach of that ſordid Filthineſs which cauſeth he Distemper</hi>; for a happy Iſſue will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow ſuch a Courſe, if the Fever is ſimple, and not complicated with ſch other Diſtempers, which will re, ſiſt all Remedies: for in many Caſes nothing can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Mortality, <hi>as is evident by the Death of the best Phyſicians themſelves, and by the Death of many, who conſulted with them for a Cure, ſince many die under the Hands of the moſt able Doctors, as well as Quacks.</hi>

               <label>Grief.</label> I will add to what hath been ſaid, one Experiment more, that is very material, And that is, being very <hi>hypochondriacal,</hi>  and of a <hi>melancholly Temper,</hi> I have often ſtrangely dejected in Mind when under Grief for ſome Misfortunes, which ſometimes have been ſo great, <hi>as to threaten Danger
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002701_0037_0FE5F39124C6E6D8"/>
to Life</hi>; in which Fits of Grief I always found the Parts within my Breaſt very uneaſy, and ſometimes continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long: but now I have found a good Remedy, <hi>for upon drinking a Pint or more of cold Water, I find eaſe in two or three Minutes, ſo that no Grief ſeems to afflict.</hi> Which Experience I diſcover for the ſake of others in the ſame Circumſtances, being verily perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the Stomach ſympathizeth with the Mind, and this becomes the Cauſe of that uneaſy Senſation and Pain perceived there; for which, cold Water I have found to be the beſt Remedy in my ſelf, and I believe others may find the ſame Benefit, who will make uſe thereof upon the like Occaſion, and it gives alſo Relief to People under Frights.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Vapours.</label> There is alſo another Experiment that I have often ſeen of good effect;  and that is, that if Perſons, ſubject to what is called <hi>Vapours,</hi> or that are afflicted with Fits, commonly called, <hi>The Fits of the Mother,</hi> will but drink Water when they find their Fits approach, it will immediately yield Relief. There is in this caſe a mealy Julep preſcribed by Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> which is to take <hi>a Spoonful of fine Wheat-Flower, an Ounce of fine Sugar, and a Pint of Water, brew them together, and drink it off</hi>: This is pleaſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Water alone; but Water of it ſelf will be as effectual, or rather better, as hath been often proved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Perſons in thoſe Fits.</p>

               <label>How to diſtinguiſh Water.</label> Some perhaps may deſire to know how to diſtinguſh good from bad Water;  &amp; the way to do this, <hi>is by the Taſte &amp; Scent</hi>; for if it have no Taſte nor Smell, being purely freſh, not ſalt, nor ſweetiſh, nor ill-ſcented, 'tis good, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be pure &amp; clear</hi>; of which kind is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water uſed in <hi>London,</hi> when well ſettled, or in fair Weather. As for thoſe who are curious, and will be at the Charge, they may procure the beſt Water for Drink by <hi>Diſtillation,</hi> either in an Alembick, or in a cold Still uſed in drawing any cold Water from Herbs;
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002701_0038_0FE60DC997C799C8"/>
               <hi>for no earthy or metallick Substance, nor any kind of Salt will riſe in Distillation</hi>: ſo that the Water ſo diſtilled will be pure &amp; admirable to drink when cold, and will keep as long from ſtinking as any of the cold diſtilled Water in the Apothecaries Shops; according to what Dr. <hi>Quincy</hi> hath affirmed about it in his <hi>Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe who have not the Convenience of Diſtillation, may boil it a little as they do for <hi>Tea</hi>; for then, when kept a while after it is cold, it will become more fine, by ſuffering any mixture contained in it to ſettle to the bottom of the Veſſel wherein it is contained, and that will render it ſtill more pure: in ſhort, all Water that will make a good Lather with Soap, is wholeſome to drink without boiling, but none elſe.</p>

               <label>Pains in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</label> Since the collecting together the forementioned Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, I have met with a Book written by Dr. <hi>Boerhaave,</hi>  the preſent Profeſſor of Phyſick at <hi>Leyden,</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> who affirms, that drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water, made very warm, is a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy <hi>to pacify griping Pains in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach</hi>; and that 'tis proper to bathe wounds in the Face with it, when they come to be juſt healed, ſo that the Place be kept continually wet, <hi>which I conceive is beſt done by applying often Linnen Cloths wet, and binding them till they begin to be dry,</hi> for this will prevent Scars: And he ſaith, that warm Water is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to attenuate, or thin the Blood, than cold Water.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Fevers.</label> There is alſo publiſhed lately a Book of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments made with Water,  by Dr. <hi>Hancock,</hi> a Divine, called <hi>Febrifugum Magnum</hi>; wherein he ſaith, that drinking a Pint or Quart of cold Water in Bed, will raiſe a copious Sweat, <hi>and cure all burning Fevers,</hi> which at once taking hath done the buſineſs: it will raiſe a Sweat without much more covering than ordinary. And he further affirms, that the ſame taken <hi>at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the cold Fit of an Ague, and ſweating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it,</hi> at two or three times taking will cure that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper. A large Quantity of hot Water, I know, hath
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:002701_0039_0FE5F392C8E04720"/>
been adviſed to take off the cold Fit of Agues, but the Party was not ordered to ſweat. Which Diſcovery of the Reverend Doctor about Fevers, is confirmed by the following Accounts, which I received from a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman. Mr. <hi>Ralph Thoresby,</hi> F. R. S. <note n="*" place="bottom">Author of <hi>Ducatus Leedienſis,</hi> or Topography of <hi>Leeds,</hi> which the learned Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the new Edition of <hi>Camden</hi>'s <hi>Britannia,</hi> ſtiles, <hi>An Uſeful &amp; Accurate Treatiſe.</hi>#</note> to whom they were tranſmitted by Mr. <hi>Lucas,</hi> a pious and learned Gentleman of <hi>Leeds</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> who ſays that</p>
            <q>One Captain <hi>Roſier</hi> fell into a violent Fever, which, as ſoon as he perceived, he ſaid he muſt have ſome cold Water. The Gentlewoman, at whoſe Houſe he lodged, not thinking that proper, boiled the Water (unknown to him) and put ſome Spirits therein, and ſent it up cold; but he ſmelt it before it came to his Head, and refuſed to drink it, ſaying, he knew what he did, for he had ſeveral times tried it. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſome clear Water being brought, he drank it, ſweat profuſely, and was well the next Day.</q>
            <q>Another Captain of a Ship alſo took the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, when he, or any of his Men, fell into a Fever; which had the deſired ſucceſs.</q>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Lucas</hi> adds, in another Letter to the ſame Gentleman,</p>
            <q>That his own Wife fell very ill of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; ſhe drank Water, ſweat very much, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by recovered.</q>
            <p>All which Inſtances corroborate the new Way of curing Fevers, ſo lately diſcovered in this City by Dr. <hi>Hancock</hi>; who alſo ſaith, he has had long Experience of curing <hi>common Colds</hi> with cold Water; and this is done by drinking a large Draught of Water at going to Bed, another in the Night, and another in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: which, he ſaith, will ſoon thicken &amp; ſweeten, and digeſt that thin ſharp Rheum, that provokes Coughing to no purpoſe: <hi>for the Rheum, when thin, is hard to
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002701_0040_0FE60DD1C58DFF40"/>
be brought up</hi>; but when thicken'd, it will come up ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, and the Cough will ſoon go off. Which agrees with what I before affirmed from my own long Experience.</p>
            <p>He alſo affirms from his own Experience, that uſing ſometimes to take a Walk of eight or ten Miles in a Morning, he found that <hi>Water gave twice as good Breath for that purpoſe as Wine or Ale</hi>; and if it would do this for a Man who had no <hi>Aſthma,</hi> he doubts not but it would do the ſame in one troubled with one. And he alſo affirms Water to be the beſt Remedy <hi>for a Surfeit,</hi> to the truth of which I can teſtify by long Experience.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</label> He alſo affirms,  that drinking cold Water hath been found good in <hi>Rheumatiſms,</hi> and that to one ſo afflicted he had adviſed to drink it as he lay in his Bed, and it took off the Fit; but if hot Water attenuates the Blood moſt, as <hi>Boerhaave</hi> affirms, 'tis then beſt to drink of it warm daily to a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity: for, as <hi>Pitcairn</hi> obſerves, <hi>'tis then the beſt Diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of all kinds of Salts in the Body,</hi> which it will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry off in the Urine, it drank plentifully; for by Urine Salts are evacuated, as is evident by the Taſte.</p>

               </gap>e affirms, and that with great reaſon, <hi>that Sweating in Fevers by drinking cold Water, is more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral than to do it with hot Sudorificks,</hi> which often do harm <hi>in the beginning of Fevers,</hi> except good ſtore of cooling moiſtening Liquors are drank with them, <hi>they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more apt to inflame than cool &amp; quench Heat in the

            <p>Which Cure, he ſaid, did ſucceed in one who was his Relation, <hi>at the fifth Day after his falling ſick</hi>; to whom he gave a Doſe of Water after he was in bed, and he ſweated profuſely for twenty-four Hours, and thereby was cured. <hi>Half a Pint,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a grown Child<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <label>Plague.</label> And Dr. <hi>Hancock</hi> lets down an Account of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Free Thinker,</hi> concerning a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>who,  in the last great Plague,</hi> fell ill of that Diſtemper, who got her Husband to fetch her a Pitcher of Water from <hi>Lamb</hi>'s <hi>Conduit</hi>; ſhe drank plentifully of it, but did not avoid the Cold, and ſo did not ſweat, <hi>however ſhe was cured.</hi> And he gives us ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Relation of an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> formerly Reſident at <hi>Morocco,</hi> that fell ill of the Plague at that Place, and getting Water to drink, fell into a violent Sweat, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd: from whence he concludes, that Water is good in the Plague; agreeable to what is related in Sir <hi>John Floyer's</hi> Book of Cold Baths, wherein it is ſaid, That but two died of the Plague who lived over the Water upon <hi>London Bridge,</hi> p. 223. the Coolneſs of the Air being ſuppoſed to contribute to their Health who inhabited on the Water in that manner, their Blood being cooler than
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:002701_0042_0FE60DD1D1A68248"/>
others: 'Tis ſaid alſo, the Water-men eſcaped better than others.</p>
            <p>I will here add to what the Doctor hath ſaid before concerning the Cure of Fevers, that if the Fever be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied in the beginning <hi>with any great Illneſs at the Stomach, nauſeating or vomiting,</hi> it will be the ſureſt and ſafeſt Practice to clear the Stomach firſt, by vomiting with <hi>warm Water, as before hath been directed</hi>; for I cannot believe it poſſible for the Stomach to be cleared from foul Humours by ſweating: <hi>it may do, if no great ſenſe of Diſorder is perceived there,</hi> but it will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſafeſt to cleanſe the Stomach firſt, <hi>which is the Place where all Diſeaſes are originally begun</hi>; for then ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with cold Water afterwards may turn to good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Indeed I have not made any trial of it ſince the Doctor's Book was publiſhed, but I have a very good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of his Accounts therein given concerning the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Water, <hi>having had ſo much Experience thereof in my own Practiſe for above forty Years</hi>; for ſo long it is ſince I firſt began to collect thoſe Accounts, and make thoſe Experiments, which are herein made publick for the Benefit of all.</p>
            <p>And thus, for the common Good of Mankind of all Ranks and Degrees, I have gathered together all the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts I have obſerved in <hi>Phyſick-Books,</hi> relating to <hi>the Uſe of common Water in preventing &amp; curing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes</hi>; to which I have added ſome Experiments of my own, which by numerous Trials I can warrant as ſure and certain, <hi>eſpecially that of curing any Sickneſs in the Stomach upon the Spot, by vomiting with warm Water</hi>: which is an Experiment, that, if put into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Practice, would prevent many thouſand Fits of Sickneſs in a Year among Mankind, and alſo a great number of untimely Deaths; <hi>for it takes away the Cauſe of all Stomach-Sickneſs,</hi> which is the Root or firſt Beginning of moſt of the Evils that afflict the Body.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude all with this Advertiſement, That if this finds a kind Acceptance, the Author intends to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>a Collection</hi> he hath made <hi>out of the beſt Writings

The Collection was begun above forty Years ago for my own uſe, <hi>without any deſign originally to make them publick</hi>; but I am now perſwaded to let others partake of the Benefit of my Labour, if I can do it with the Proſpect of any ſuitable Encouragement, from the kind Reception this may meet with among thoſe who deſire Health, which is beſt attained to by the moſt uncompounded Remedies.</p>
            <div type="rules">
               <head>Some <hi>RULES</hi> for preſerving Health by <hi>DIET,</hi> collected from Phyſical Authors.</head>
               <p>IN a little Treatiſe, entitled, <hi>Kitchin-Phyſick,</hi> written by Dr. <hi>Cook,</hi> the Author declares, <hi>he can hardly be told of any Diſeaſe which he cannot relieve or cure by a proper Diet, p.</hi> 39. And in the ſame Book we find his Opinion to be this, That all tender ſickly People, and all aged and decrepid Perſons, <hi>ought to eat often, and but a little at a time,</hi> becauſe weak and waſted Bodies are to be reſtored by little and little; and by moiſt and liquid Food alſo, rather than by ſolid, <hi>becauſe moiſt and liquid Diet does nouriſh ſooneſt, and digest eaſieſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe, he ſaith, that eat much, and get little Strength by eating, ſhew, that they have uſed themſelves to too full a Diet; <hi>and the more you cramb ſuch Bodies, the leſs they thrive by it, but rather grow worſe and worſe</hi>: becauſe by much feeding you do but add to the bad Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours wherewith the Body is already filled, which ſhould rather be waſted by purging and uſing a ſpare Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:002701_0044_0FE60DD5153CEF78"/>And a ſpare Diet he deſcribes to be this, <hi>That we never eat at once till the Appetite is fully ſatisfied, and never to eat till we have an Appetite</hi>; and Men never have a true Appetite till they can eat any ordinary Food: And he adviſeth <hi>to keep conſtantly to a plain Diet</hi>; for thoſe, he ſays, enjoy moſt Health, and live longeſt, <hi>that avoid Curioſity and Variety of Meats and Drinks,</hi> which only ſerve to entice to Gluttony, and ſo work our Ruin.</p>
               <p>Another ſaith, that the leſs Food the ſick Perſon eats, the ſooner he will recover; for 'tis a true Saying, <hi>The more you fill foul Bodies, the more you hurt them.</hi> The Stomach being the Place where Diſeaſes begin, when that Part therefore is weak, and out of order, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a good Digeſtion when much is eaten, raw or crude Humours then muſt needs be bred, and bad Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours cannot produce good Blood.</p>
               <p>All Men do find by Experience, that in the Morning before they have eaten, they are light and pleaſantly eaſy in their Bodies, but after they have indulged their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites with Plenty of Food, they find themſelves heavy and dull, and often ſleepy: which ſufficiently ſhews <hi>that thoſe full Meals are prejudicial to the Welfare of the Body</hi>; for a moderate Meal would have continued the Eaſe and Lightſomneſs they before found in themſelves, and would have refreſhed any Faintneſs that Emptineſs might occaſion. And he certainly, who uſeth the moſt ſimple Meat and Drinks, <hi>avoideth the Snare of provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Appetite beyond the Neceſſities of Nature; whereas Variety enticeth to a freſh Deſire of every Dainty,</hi> till at laſt the Stomach is gorged, and made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of performing a good Digeſtion; and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth thoſe Crudities, which are the Cauſe of all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and of ſo many ſudden Deaths.</p>
               <p>'Tis generally obſerved, that the moſt unhealthy are found among thoſe <hi>who feed high upon the most delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Dainties, and drink nothing but the ſtrongest and most ſpirituous Liquors</hi> whereas others who want this delicate Fare, are ſeldom ſick, except they have ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:002701_0045_0FE60DAFB0F04E18"/>
Appetites as to eat too much; which a Man may do of the plaineſt Diet; <hi>whoſe Belly is his God,</hi> as an Apoſtle expreſſes it. But tho' Men may glut themſelves with coarſe Food, yet coarſe Food and long Life are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conſiſtent, as appears by <hi>John Bill,</hi> mention'd in the Hiſtory of Cold Baths, <hi>p.</hi> 408 whoſe Food was Bread, Cheeſe and Butter; and Drink, Whey, Butter-milk or Water; and yet he lived 133 Years, was a ſtrong, ſtrait, upright Man. And the Food of <hi>John Bailes,</hi> whoſe Age amounted to 128, was for the moſt part brown Bread and Cheeſe, and his Drink, Water, or ſmall Beer and Milk, <hi>p.</hi> 416. He had buried the whole Town of <hi>Northampton</hi> twenty times over, except three or four, and ſaid ſtrong Drink killed them all.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Pratt</hi> adviſeth to Sup ſparingly; for to Sup ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, he ſaith, is moſt healthful, <hi>becauſe of the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of an infinite Number of Perſons who have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the greatest Benefit from light Suppers.</hi> For the Stomach being not over-burdened, the Sleep is more pleaſant; and from ſparing Suppers the breeding of thoſe Humours are prevented, which Cauſe <hi>Defluxions, Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſms, Gouts, Dropſies, Giddineſs, and Corruption in the Mouth from the Scurvy</hi>: and from light Suppers a Freedom from Sickneſs and Reaching in the Morning is obtained, and Concoction is made perfect, which prevents Obſtructions.</p>
               <p>Another ſaith, It is well known, that <hi>many Indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions are cured by Faſting, or a very ſpare Diet</hi>; for what is taken into the Stomach being no more than can be well digeſted, the chylous Juice, ſo rightly prepared, is conveyed into the Lacteal Veſſels, and from thence into the Blood: ſo that Nature being duly ſupplied with well-concocted Nouriſhment, the corrupted Blood will free itſelf from that Corruption in time, by throwing it out, through the Pores of the Skin, in Perſpiration, and ſupply itſelf with the purer Juices; and in this way, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions and Scurvys,</hi> and other Chronical Diſtemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, will be overcome: which way of curing Diſeaſes by Faſting, Swine do naturally betake themſelves to, who,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:002701_0046_0FE60DE46D8872C8"/>
when ſick, will eat nothing till they recover, as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways do after they injure themſelves by over-eating; in which they are imitated by all who delight in Gorman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing or Gluttony, tho' not in uſing the ſame means of Recovery.</p>
               <p>That Men in Health may prevent Diſeaſes, 'twas ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, that one Meal ſhould not be eaten, till the other, which was eaten before, was paſſed off clean out of the Stomach; <hi>which never is done till the Appetite of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is found to call for another Supply</hi>: by means of which conſtant Obſervation, the Food will be converted into good Chyle, and from good Chyle, <hi>which is a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky Subſtance</hi> good Blood will be bred, and from good Blood generous Spirits will be produced, <hi>out of which a healthy Conſtitution will enſue</hi>; but, on the contrary, too great a Quantity of Food being taken <hi>for pleaſure only,</hi> which the Stomach cannot well digeſt, the Chyle will be raw and corrupt, which will foul the Blood, and render the Body diſorderly and unhealthful.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, that Abſtinence and Sobriety free from moſt Diſeaſes, eſpecially <hi>Catarrhs, Coughs, Wheeſings, Giddineſs, Pain in the Head and Stomach, ſudden Death, Lethargies, Gout</hi> and <hi>Sciatica,</hi> an ill Digeſtion being the Cauſe of all theſe; it alſo prevents <hi>Pain in the Spleen, Stone, and Gravel, and a day Itch</hi>; it makes the Body vigorous and nimble, maintains the five Senſes in a good State, preſerveth the Memory, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the Wit, and quencheth all undue Luſt in Mankind; and, in ſhort, all Miſers, who eat and drink but little, live long.</p>
               <p>Two Meals a day is ſaid to be ſufficient <hi>for all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons after fifty Years of Age, and all weak People</hi>; and the omitting of Suppers does always conduce much to the Health <hi>of the Weak and Aged</hi>: ſince if no Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per be eaten, the Stomach will ſoon free itſelf from all tough ſlimy Humours wherewith it is ſlabbered over on the Inſide, and thereby the Appetite will be renewed, and Digeſtion made more ſtrong and vigorous. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, all that are troubled with <hi>Sweating in the Night, any ill Taſte in their Mouths, belching, and troubleſome
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:002701_0047_0FE60DB2B7B30880"/>
Dreams,</hi> muſt avoid Suppers: for in Sleep the Fibres of the Stomach relax, and are not able to contract them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo ſtrongly, as when awake, to embrace the Food, and by Trituration reduce it into a Pan fit to paſs out into the other Bowels, called <hi>the Guts,</hi> out of which the Nouriſhment is ſent to other Parts.</p>
               <p>'Twas ſaid by Dr. <hi>Curtis,</hi> that though thoſe who uſe a ſpare Diet, cannot well bear long Labour; <hi>yet ſuch People, when their Exerciſe is ſuitable to their Strength, do live longer than thoſe of a robuſt Constitution, that think large feeding adds Strength</hi>; eſpecially ſuch as being ſtrong, uſe no Exerciſe proportionable to it, to conaume the Superfluities which a full Feeding doth oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion: ſo that the only way for thoſe to live long, who have much Wealth, and need not labour for a Livelihood, is to live temperately: and this Temperance doth conſiſt in not letting the common Cuſtom of Meals invite you to eat, <hi>except your Appetite concur with thoſe Times.</hi> We muſt not indulge the Cravings of a depraved Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, <hi>as thoſe do who eat to pleaſe their Fancy, and not the Neceſſities of Nature</hi>; and when we do eat, we muſt not think that the more plentifully we eat, we ſhall be more ſtrengthened, for it will not prove ſo: <hi>a little well digested will make the Body ſtronger,</hi> than the being glutted with Superfluity, moſt of which will be turned into a corrupt Juice, and muſt be caſt out by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, or elſe Sickneſs will enſue, and the eaſieſt Phyſick is that which the <hi>Germans</hi> call the <hi>Hunger Cure,</hi> if continued a due time.</p>
               <p>It is the Opinion of <hi>learned Men,</hi> that the early Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the Bodies of Children, called <hi>the Rickets,</hi> proceeds from the Fault of their Mothers, <hi>in making them Gluttons from their Cradles,</hi> gorging them with Food till they loath it, out of a miſtaken Opinion, <hi>that this is the way to make them thrive and grow ſtrong</hi>: which Exceſs is not only the Cauſe of this Diſeaſe, but of the immature Death of many; and in others it lays the Foundation of many Diſtempers, which afflict thoſe afterwards who live to Years of Maturity: and as they gorge them with Food, ſo they vainly think to cheriſh

them with ſtrong Drink, <hi>than which nothing can be more pernicious to the Health of Children,</hi> whoſe Diet ſhould be little and often, and their Drink cooling. As it alſo ſhould be when Men arrive at the time <hi>of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Children again in Old Age</hi>; that is, in an helpleſs State, which ſhould be prevented as much as can be, <hi>by a cooling moistening Diet, in oppoſition to the hot &amp; dry, and withered State of Age</hi>; for 'tis Heat and Dryneſs that are the Cauſe of moſt old Mens Miſeries, eſpecially the waſting of the Subſtance that fills the Parts with Moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and keeps the Body plump and ſmooth; they who ſtile Wine the old Man's Milk, being greatly miſtaken, for Milk cools, and Wine heats.</p>
               <p>It was the Opinion of Dr. <hi>Pitt,</hi> who was formerly Phyſician to St. <hi>Bartholomew's Hoſpital, that Faſting, Rest, and drinking Water</hi> would cure moſt Diſeaſes; <hi>and there ſeemeth to be a great deal of Reaſon in what he aſſerted.</hi> For Faſting will give time to the Stomach to unload itſelf of the Cauſe of Diſtempers, <hi>the Cauſe of all Diſeaſes being begun in that Bowel only</hi>; to which cleanſing, the drinking of Water plentifully will much contribute, which alſo will keep the Action of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach upon the Hinges, <hi>by filling of it when empty,</hi> at which time there will be need of Reſt, for thereby the Body will be leſs fit for Buſineſs: tho' the mere drinking of Water, <hi>which affords Nouriſhment ſufficient for the Growth and Support of all Vegetables,</hi> will, in ſome meaſure, ſupply the want of Food, <hi>as hath been ſhewn in the Example of two, who were ſupported a long time by nothing elſe.</hi> In ſhort, the beſt way for a ſink Man to recover, is to eat little or no Food till he finds an Appetite, according to that Saying,
<q>
                     <l>Spare Diet will the most Diſeaſes cure,</l>
                     <l>If a due Time you can the ſame endure.</l>
                  </q>
And faſting from Food may be continued long enough to be a Remedy for many Diſeaſes, with the Aſſiſtance of common Water; by the drinking of which warm, in a due Quantity, without a total Faſting, <hi>two Perſons, I

am informed, were recovered out of Conſumptions,</hi> with which they were extreamly weakened, and that in about ſix Weeks time; as was another <hi>by drinking Milk and Whey, equal Parts, made blood-hot without uſing any other Diet,</hi> which is thought to be far more effectual than Aſſes Milk, whoſe Virtue conſiſts in being thinner than other Milk.</p>
               <p>But beſides a ſpare Diet, cool dry Air is alſo very helpful to preſerve Men in Health, who are not ſick, for it mixes with the Blood, and without it the Motion of the Blood and Spirits can never be preſerved, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Diving-Veſſels,</hi> in which Men cannot live when the Air therein is made hot by their own Body and Breath: And is proved alſo by an Experiment of Dr. <hi>Croone</hi>'s, who ſtifled a Chicken, till it ſeem'd quite dead; <hi>and yet by blowing cool Air into the Lungs, with a ſmall Pair of Bellows, it revived.</hi> Hence it appears that the common Cuſtom of managing ſick People is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pernicious, and ſo far from helping them to recover, that 'tis ſufficient <hi>to make a healthy Perſon ſick</hi>; for were a Perſon, who was not ſick, confined for three or four Weeks in a Room, made hot like a Stove, and kept in his Bed, with the Curtains drawn, and all the Windows cloſe ſhut, and the Room made unpleaſant with the nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous Fumes of Phyſick, and a cloſe-ſtool, <hi>which will almoſt make a freſh Man ſick when he juſt enters into it</hi>; we can never think that this is the way to recover one that really is ſick, and wants the freſh Air and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Scents to cheriſh his Blood; <hi>a freſh open ſweet Air being one principal means to ſtrengthen the Body, make a good Appetite &amp; Digeſtion, &amp; render the Spirits brisk and lively</hi>: which Advantage ſhould be allowed to all but <hi>Childbed Women,</hi> &amp; thoſe who are afflicted with the <hi>Small-Pox</hi>; for the freſh Air can be prejudicial to no other, whoſe Bodies are clothed warm, either in Bed, or ſitting in a Chair in their Chamber.</p>
               <p>Some Years ſince a Neighbour became very feveriſh, and his Wife perſuaded him to go to Bed; and hearing of it ſoon after, I gave him a Viſit, where I found the Windows cloſe ſhut, the Curtains of the Bed drawn,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:002701_0050_0FE5F2CF26407718"/>
and the Room very hot, <hi>for it was in</hi> July: he was burning hot, <hi>and complained for want of Breath.</hi> I drew open the Curtains, covered him warm, and then opened the Windows, &amp; the Wind blew into the Room; upon which he ſoon told me his Shortneſs of Breath had left him. <hi>I perſuaded him to drink ſome Water,</hi> which he found did much refreſh him; and after I had taken my Leave of him, he called for more Water: And while he had the Cup in his hand, <hi>an Apothecary came in,</hi> whom his Wife had ſent for, who, finding him about to drink the Water, told him, if he did it he was a dead Man; but inſtead of forbearing, he drank it up in his Preſence: Upon which the other took his Leave, and told him, he would ſay no more to him. However, before Night, the Perſon got up, went abroad, and was cured of his Fever; which is one Inſtance, <hi>among many others which might be given,</hi> of the Benefit of freſh Air to a Perſon who is kept warm in his Bed; for thereby his Body was cooled inwardly, and his Breathing made more free by the Air which was drawn into his Lungs to refreſh and comfort the Blood as it paſſed through them.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only add, <hi>that by keeping the Blood cool as well as clean,</hi> is to be underſtood, not only Moderation in Diet, but to feed moſt on cooling Food made of <hi>Wheat, Barley, Oatmeal, Rice,</hi> and ripe <hi>Apples,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo on <hi>Milk</hi>; which, joined with Oatmeal, is the chief Food of thoſe luſty and ſtrong Men, the <hi>Highlanders of Scotland,</hi> who abound in Children, as Dr. <hi>Cheyne</hi> tells us in his Treatiſe of the <hi>Gout, p</hi> 108. <hi>Edit.</hi> 4. which demonſtrates Milk and Oatmeal to be a moſt ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Food, and ſuch as keeps the Blood in due Order; ſo that therewith Men may ſubſiſt, though they abſtain from <hi>Beef, Pork, and Veniſon,</hi> and all other Meals hard to digeſt, and drink Water <hi>as the Highlanders do</hi>: Of the Efficacy of which cooling <hi>Milk Diet,</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

and the Intervals longer; and finding his Diſeaſe mend, <hi>as its Fuel was withdrawn,</hi> he took to vegetable Food and Water only, <hi>which put an entire Period to his Fits without any Relapſe</hi>: but finding that Food windy to him, he took to Milk, of which he eat a Pint for Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, a Quart at Dinner, and a Pint for Supper, <hi>without Fiſh, Fleſh, Bread, or any strong or ſpirituous Liquor,</hi> or any Drink but Water, with which he lived afterwards for fourteen Years, <hi>without the least Interruption in his Health, Strength, or Vigour,</hi> but died afterwards of a <hi>Pleuriſy.</hi> Which is a Confirmation of what Dr. <hi>Cook</hi> did affirm, of the Poſſibility of curing Diſeaſes by Diet only that is temperate and cooling.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, Temperance or a ſpare Diet, void of Dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, never was injurous to the ſtrongeſt Conſtitution, and without it, ſuch as are weak &amp; ſickly cannot long ſubſiſt; for the more ſuch Perſons eat &amp; drink, the more weak and diſordered they will ſtill find themſelves to be: <hi>So that if the ſtrong deſpiſe Temperance, yet the Comfort of weak, ſickly, and pining People, does depend entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon their conſtantly obſerving it</hi>; which, when they are accuſtomed to it, will be eaſy to do: ſo that they will deny all intemperate Deſires with as great Pleaſure, as they before did delight in what is falſely ſtiled good Eating and Drinking; <hi>for nothing of that is good, which is injurious to Health,</hi> 'tis Cuſtom only that makes Men hanker after Gluttony and Drunkenneſs, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Cuſtom will make Men abhor it as much: And therefore 'tis a Wonder the Rich do not ſtrive to attain it; for

                  </q>
Temperance being that which will enable them to live moſt at eaſe, and enjoy their Wealth the longeſt; this, and Water-drinking, being the ſureſt way to bring Men to Old Age, tho' it hath not power to make the Aged young.</p>
