            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ALTHOUGH immediate peace is neceſſary for the welfare and ſafety of the nation, and that peace cannot be had but by the acknowledgment of the independency of America, in which all Europe, and indeed the whole univerſe are intereſted; yet, becauſe a formal acknowledgment of it would be moſt humiliating to the pride of the nation, it is thought, by ſome, more adviſeable to make uſe of expedients, and to obtain the neceſſary tranquility, either</p>

               <item>III. By deſtroying every thing before the ſtruggle is given up, in order to cripple the Americans in their future operations.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Every one of theſe ways are inadequate to the end.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, a truce made between Great-Britain and America will defeat what is, and ought to be, the firſt object of government; it will not only be an acknowledgment, <hi>pro <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anto et pro tempore,</hi> of the claimed independency, but will prevent the two people returning to their ancient good humour and harmony, the great object of the propoſed tranquility; for ſuch truce will be, as all truces are, armed and full of ſuſpicion.</p>

2dly, To withdraw the troops and leave the Americans to themſelves will not have the appearance of the dignity, but ſullenneſs of majeſty; it will be a proof of the preſent impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, and future intention of this ſtate, and, conſequently, will beget in the Americans preſent contempt, and future dread; this contempt, and dread, will encourage and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke on their part the proſecution of the war, which is wiſhed to be avoided: There is, however, reaſon to think ſome ſuch meaſure is now purſuing, the troops having been ordered, it is ſaid, to abandon New-York. Whether this is done through inability to maintain that poſt, or to ſuccour the capital and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential parts of the empire at this critical juncture, is not worth the preſent enquiry; it is probable the oſtenſible reaſon will be given, that it is done for the bringing about a treaty, the Americans having made this ſtep one of the alternatives ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be complied with before they would treat; to prove this, however, the Britiſh force muſt be withdrawn from all the territories claimed by the Americans; if a part is left any where, at Rhode-Iſland for inſtance, which perhaps is meant to be made a place of arms, the whole meaſure will be abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: It is worth recollecting, likewiſe, that when this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, of either acknowledging the independency or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing the troops, was firſt made, America ſtood uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected and free from real or implied ſtipulations with foreign powers; the caſe is now ſo altered, that there may be doubts whether ſhe is able, or willing, to act in any thing without the concert and concurrence of France; but, at moſt, this alternative is only a preliminary of a treaty, the eſſential ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of which is the American independency.</p>
            <p>3dly, The retiring after having done all poſſible miſchief is the council of folly and malice; it proceeds from deſpair, and would for ever ſhut the door of peace; it would produce an eternal abhorrence.</p>
            <p>Should it be thought, on conſideration, that neither of theſe expedients are proper, for that Great-Britain can now do nothing but acknowledge the independency of America, yet that this acknowledgment ought not to be made ſimply and unconditionally; it would be well for ſuch to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, that although there was a time when this mode of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and bargaining might have been propoſed, and agreed to, that
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:016245_0005_0F9BCFAC900234A0"/>time is now paſt: There was a time when this iſland might have offered independency to America as a conceſſion requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome valuable return; at preſent, having vindicated, and poſſeſſing it in fact, and being guaranteed in the enjoyment thereof by one of the greateſt powers, whoſe influence and example will induce others to take the ſame ſtep, America will not conſider the acknowledgment of independence as a favour: The right and power which ſhe preſumes ſhe has to maintain herſelf in her preſent ſituation, and the fear leſt ſuch a mode of bargaining might bring doubts on her unqueſtioned right, and of ſetting a dangerous precedent to other nations for her emancipation and purchaſe of freedom, will oblige her to inſiſt on this acknowledgment in the moſt perfect, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, ſimple, and unconditional manner.</p>
            <p>If ſuch acknowledgment is made, the object of the peace, which would undoubtedly follow, would be obtained, the good opinion of America would be ſecured, time would be thereby given for the removal of the preſent ſuſpicions and abhorrence, and for the return of the former amity and good will; it would give an opening to the ancient inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and a diſpoſition of conducting it with candor and liberality; the ſtrength, reſulting from thence, would be a benefit, and not a terror, to this iſland: America would then, though independent, be united in heart to Great-Britain, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being, as ſhe is at preſent, independent and united with her enemies. This country, even amidſt her moſt cruel actions, aſſured herſelf of the return of the antient good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of America; and, indeed, aſſured herſelf ſo much of it, that, however ſtrange it may appear, it is moſt certain, this her natural diſpoſition was made uſe of as an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and provocation to the utmoſt exertions of the moſt unrelenting war; for, do what you will, it was ſaid, Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica would ſtill look up to, and wiſh to renew, her antient connection with this iſland. Let this ſuppoſed temper of America be tried in the only way now left; force has been found not only ineffectual, but pernicious; let time do that which force cannot do; let that time of peace and its deſired operations be obtained by an immediate, clear, and full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the independency of America.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:016245_0006_0F9BCFAED299B030"/>
Should all difficulties relative to the matter of a treaty be thus removed, there would ſtill remain difficulties relative to the manner of conducting it; as government, however, has at length got rid of an embarraſſment which had been thought inſuperable, and had long checked the proper courſe of buſineſs, it cannot be doubted that either wiſdom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity will induce it to adopt the only mode of obtaining peace now left.</p>
            <p>To treat with thoſe who denied, and took up arms in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the authority of Parliament; to treat with declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enemies, and, above all, with the <hi>unlawful</hi> and <hi>vagrant</hi> Aſſembly, the Congreſs, were once conſidered ſo contrary to the dignity of government as not to be ſubmitted to. The ſtate of things has produced a different ſenſe in the miniſter; the Parliament has impowered Commiſſioners to treat with that obnoxious body, thinking it was the only medium through which peace with America could be had. On the ſame principle, another mode muſt now be adopted; we not only want peace with America, but with France, and the reſt of Europe; but peace with the one cannot now be had, <hi>nor indeed is it worth having,</hi> without peace with the other: we muſt now negociate, and that ſoon, or an important part of Europe will interfere, and thereby embarraſs the nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation with the adjuſtment of new intereſts and claims. This can only be effected by an immediate application to the American Commiſſioners at Paris. The propoſition may at firſt ſtartle the people of this country, but the ſurpriſe will be ſoon got over, if the ſtate of affairs are duly conſidered— Things once ſtrange now appear familiar to them—Strange, however, as this may appear, the only mode of attaining peace is to conſider and make the American Commiſſioners at Paris MEDIATORS between Great-Britain and France; for, though inimical at preſent becauſe of the hoſtile diſpoſition of this country, they have at bottom, as is ſuppoſed, an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to it. Change, then, your diſpoſition, and theirs will be changed; they will be the friends of Great-Britain in her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>llen ſtate, who have oppoſed her in her <hi>hour of inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;</hi> they muſt be conſidered better diſpoſed to this people than the hireling miniſter of any foreign ſtate; and, if treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with candour, may be truſted with ſecurity—there is little doubt that France would accept their mediation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:016245_0007_0F9BCFAEE97D3358"/>
Should it be queſtioned, whether the American Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners at Paris have powers ſufficient to ſettle the ſubſiſting differences, the doubt might be ſoon cleared up by an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate application; in the mean while it may be preſumed they have ſuch powers: for, is it probable that the Congreſs ſhould have enabled their Commiſſioners to enter into treaties of commerce and eventual leagues offenſive and defenſive, for the opening a new intercourſe and for the carrying on a war, without enabling them to continue the antient connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and preventing war? There is no reaſon to think their judgment ſo defective. Should it, however, prove, on en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, they have not powers ſufficiently ſatisfactory to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a perfect treaty, yet no one can be ſo ignorant of the weight and influence of the American Commiſſioners, as not to imagine their recommendations will have the fulleſt effect with Congreſs. In the mean while a ſuſpenſion of arms may be obtained in Europe, on the credit, liberality, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of the terms propoſed. This is a point of the greateſt conſequence in the preſent ſtate of the afrairs of Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>This form, and it is now perhaps little elſe, the Americans having the reality, being complied with, Great-Britain will prevent the impending miſchief and ruin which the combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Powers of Europe, intereſted in the independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of America, will otherwiſe bring down upon her; and America will obtain the only thing ſhe wants: She wants nothing from Europe but peace; which being had, ſhe will ſhew herſelf to Europe in general a moſt beneficial friend, and to Great-Britain in particular an <hi>eſſential</hi> one.</p>
            <p>This will be manifeſt to any one who conſiders the nature of the northern continent of America, and the ſtate of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; it is not neceſſary here to enter into this diſcuſſion. There is nothing more clear than that ſhe really wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and can ſupply the wants of Europe; this takes away all ground of contention between them. If America ſtands in need of peace to ſettle her governments, Great-Britain ſtands in need of it for the ſupport of her exiſtence; neither, therefore, have claims on each other, for the bleſſing which is ſo neceſſary to both, but in proportion to the greater neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of one or the other.—America, however, may perhaps
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016245_0008_0F9BCFAFA7CC6A60"/>be induced to make ſtipulations of great importance to Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>She may agree not to paſs the Cape of Good Hope, or go round Cape Horn; ſhe may diſclaim all connection with Africa, and its accurſed trade; ſhe may engage not only not to poſſeſs any part of the Weſt-India Iſlands, but guarantee to England her poſſeſſions there. Theſe are matters of great conſequence to this country, but of little moment to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica: They are of little moment to America, who wants not extended and diſtant territory; ſhe has herſelf more land, capable of every produce, than can be cultivated for ages to come; ſhe knows the miſchiefs of the India trade, and ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at the impiety of the African one; the ſituation, and neceſſity of the Iſlands, will ever make them more beneficially dependent on the Continent, than the claim and poſſeſſion of unlimited power over them; and their preſent political par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition among the ſeveral ſtates of Europe, is more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to her than their engroſſment by any one prince.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are ſuggeſted to ſhew that the ſtipulations on theſe heads will be obſerved, becauſe the continent of America has no real intereſt in the breach of them;—a better ground for political faith cannot be had: But although the continent of America has no real intereſt in the interruption of the preſent poſſeſſion of the powers of Europe, yet, actuated by the ſpirit of hoſtility, if provoked, ſhe will neceſſarily inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere, and give ſuch diſturbance as to render their enjoyment highly precarious at leaſt; and thereby become, from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, a dangerous enemy, inſtead of being a beneficial friend.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſtipulations are well worth the attention of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; but there are, likewiſe, conceſſions, which might be made of the greateſt conſequence to this country. She may be induced to take a certain quantity of her manufactures, and ſupply her with naval ſtores for a certain number of years; ſhe may enter into engagements about the fiſheries on her coaſts, the importance of which is well known; ſhe might diſclaim an interference with, or interruption of, the trade to Hudſon's Bay, the full value of which moſt are ignorant of; ſhe may, in ſhort, ſecure, by articles of pacification and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016245_0009_0F9BCFB051F486F0"/>the moſt profitable parts of the Britiſh trade, which will be greatly endangered by the continuance of the preſent war. But let it be remembered that theſe articles, ſtipulations and conceſſions, muſt be ſubſequent to, and not on condition of, the acknowledgment of independency: The prior ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment is neceſſary to give validity and an obligatory force to the mutual engagements of the two countries, which, without it, might in ſome future hour of chicane be much queſtioned.</p>
            <p>But, that this and other important matters may be gained, the application ought to be <hi>immediate and open.</hi> The delay of doing what was right has increaſed the public miſchief, and daily embarraſſes the progreſs of peace; it brought on the American declaration of independency, and the French guarantee, and war, in ſupport of it. A farther delay will produce other fatal conſequences. No one can doubt the part which Spain will take, who knows the part ſhe has already taken. That Portugal will follow the dictates of Spain, now ſhe is thrown into her arms by the inability of England to protect her, is perhaps certain; her intereſt, and her inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, concur with her preſent neceſſity: Will the Dutch ſtand out when the Americans ſhall declare, and the declaration, if not already made, may be expected ſoon, <q>they will not trade with any Powers that ſhall not acknowledge her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency?</q> The Dutch, againſt whom the act of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation was levelled, will rejoice at its ſubſtantial repeal, and eagerly enjoy the freedom of the ſea, and of commerce, on the terms propoſed. Should Great-Britain come into the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary meaſure after theſe powers, ſhe will do it with ſo ill a a grace, that her merit will be ſmall indeed.</p>
            <p>But, above all, the application ought to be open; it ought to be ſincere and candid in itſelf, and without diſguiſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> myſtery in the making. The former applications, either of a public or private nature, have been defective on this head; there has been deceit, at leaſt it appears ſo to the Americans, in the matter and manner of them. If application is now made to the Commiſſioners at Paris, all under-hand dealings muſt be omitted, becauſe they cannot have the deſired effect; it is the attempt I would guard againſt, for the practice of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice cannot ſucceed. By the nature of the government of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016245_0010_0F9BCFB1126895E0"/>France, few things done in that country can be kept ſecret; a negotiation with America can by no means be concealed; it is the particular intereſt and honour of the American Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners at Paris to diſcover to the French Court all ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications from Britain; private attempts will, as the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones have done, turn againſt the miniſter; they will give the Americans, as they have in all matters ſince the 16th of December laſt, much advantage in negotiation; it will give them the merit of diſcovering to the French miniſter how much they are courted by the Engliſh government, and, by conſequence, induce him to court them more.</p>
            <p>Not a ſingle attempt to gain the Americans has yet ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, becauſe candour was wanting; the attempts were treacherous in themſelves, and ſuſpicious in their manner. Men of all denominations and characters have been ſent, ſome of whom, under the maſk of friendſhip, have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> into the deepeſt political diſcuſſions—They were ſent for that purpoſe, whatever their oſtenſible pretences were to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary—they loſt their errand; they were conſidered as the tools of the miniſter, and not as the unreſerved, undeſigning and confidential friends of the ſocial hour; they played their parts, and were perhaps deſervedly played upon.</p>
            <p>But whatever they were, they were ſuited to the buſineſs they were ſent on. The buſineſs muſt now have another complexion, and, by conſequence, agents of a different diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. If the terms of accommodation are candid and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral, as the times require, the agents need not be men of noted learning, or political abilities; depend more on the matter which is to be offered, than on the man who delivers it. In truth, no man is wanted that anſwers only to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of an agent; a faithful meſſenger will do the buſineſs much better; the times want not the adroitneſs of a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician, but the ſimplicity and good intentions of a commen man, for the happineſs of Great-Britain and America.</p>
            <p>Conſider what the public and parliamentary Commiſſioners have done in America; their ſucceſs is now fully known: They are men of rank, note and confidence, of various qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and abilities; but, whatever rank, note, confidence, qualities and abilities they may have, they are by no means
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016245_0011_0F9BCFB1D9FE2108"/>the men proper to have been ſent: One of them, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, who has ſtepped forward moſt buſily in the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſeems to betray it; he is abuſive of thoſe who have employed him, for their inſolence; and moſt flattering to the great qualities of his enemies, who have oppoſed his country; he apparently juſtifies the one, and condemns the other, for all their proceedings; and, inſtead of a Commiſſioner of the King of Great-Britain, paid an enormous ſalary for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of a public employment, he wiſhes to become the curious and wondering traveller, and no more: If more is intended by this abuſe, flattery and curioſity, it is ſuch an unworthy piece of buſineſs, as would warrant any one's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the failure of the commiſſion to the choice of him and his coadjutors, if there was not in the commiſſion itſelf an internal vice and cauſe of defeat.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, it is not by ſuch means this country can be ſaved from the ruin which the American diſpute is likely to bring upon it.</p>
            <p>The terms of accommodation ought to do their own bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; they ought to be ſo good as to recommend themſelves; they will do it, if they are ſuited to the times.</p>
            <p>The American treaty, ſigned at Verſailles the 6th of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, was ſuppoſed here not to be perfect until ratified by the people of America, and therefore the Engliſh Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, arriving in the country before that event, would eaſily ſet the whole aſide by the offers of Parliament. The French King knew better; he well knew his offers were ſuch as inſured to themſelves the approbation of America; he waited not for the return of the ratification; he took his meaſures as if every thing was concluded. The event has juſtified his judgment.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding what has been, and might be, ſaid to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a full and direct acknowledgment of the independency of America, and an immediate and open application to the Commiſſioners at Paris, there are, perhaps, thoſe who think it will be more for the intereſt and honour of the kingdom, to ſue for peace in a private manner in the cloſet of the miniſters of France.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:016245_0012_0F9BCFB28F418480"/>
The object of this mode of application is to avoid, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the acknowledgment of the American independency; for it is thought there can be no ſacrifice, however great, which may and ought not to be made for the recovery of the real, or at leaſt the nominal, ſovereignty of that country: They who are of this opinion will go great lengths; they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps offer Canada to France, acknowledge her right, and give her freſh means of carrying on to advantage the Fiſheries on the Banks of Newfoundland, and confirm her in the ſtipulated part of the American commerce.

<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016245_0013_0F9BCFB3512B7260"/>the times, and that, after ſuch an application, there is no farther hopes of accommodation, ſhe may be induced, and indeed compelled, to take a ſtep moſt fatal to this country; ſhe may forbid the entrance of the Britiſh flag into her ports; ſhe may exclude all Britiſh bottoms from her commerce, and lay treble duties on the importation of Britiſh commodities.</p>
            <p>The idea of excluding the iſland of Great-Britain from the commerce of the continent of America will be pleaſing to all the powers of Europe. They will rejoice at ſuch a ſignal deſtruction of an envied monopoly; and perhaps conſider it, inſultingly, as an act of juſtice, that <hi>that</hi> ſhould be the only ſtate excluded from the coaſts of America, which, arrogating the whole to itſelf, had excluded the reſt of mankind.</p>
            <p>There is nothing excluſive in the original treaty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and alliance between France and America; this country was candidly told ſo, and thereby an hint given, what might be. The neceſſity of affairs may give another turn to the treaty.— The longer the contention is continued, and the more violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is preſſed, the more will the affections of America be alienated from England, and the more firmly will they be fixed on France.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more abſurd, dangerous and fruitleſs, than an endeavour to procure an eſtabliſhment of the former ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty by the means of France; it is the intereſt of France, that you ſhould have neither the <hi>former ſovereignty no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> peace.</hi> The independence of America is of more value to her than any thing this country can offer; it ſecures every effect and benefit of the moſt humble conceſſions, and does every poſſible miſchief to her rival and avowed enemy. The miniſter, therefore, may depend on it, ſhe will ſide with America, who hath firmly withſtood the various public and private applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to withdraw herſelf from her engagement;—it is both the inclination and intereſt, and, after what has paſſed, the honour of France to conſider her alliance ſacred and inviolable.</p>
            <p>Should the offers of the miniſter be as conſiderable, or more ſo than what has been ſuggeſted, reflect on the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences—they muſt be ſo conſiderable as to enable France to proſecute her ſchemes with greater certainty in future, or elſe ſhe will certainly not forego her preſent advantage; they
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016245_0014_0F9BCFB4194FA510"/>will be ſo great as to give that court ſuſpicions that they are only offered at this time to gain a ſovereignty, and former connection, by which the force of America may be deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically collected, or artfully turned againſt her by the ſpecious ſhew of moderation.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more common than to hear of the inſidienſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of France; it has been, and ever will be, the conſtant topic of declamation of the good people of this country; but whilſt it is ſo, we cannot but wonder that a private treaty ſhould be entered into, and that ſuch treaty ſhould tend to enable that very power to be more inſidious, and ſhould be entered into immediately after the Commiſſioners of the King and Parliament of Great-Britain had demanded of the Congreſs—<q>Whether they could depend on the word and confidence of that court, <hi>whoſe inſidious interpoſition had, from the ſettlement of the colonies, been actuated with enmity to both?</hi>
               </q>—The miniſters muſt ſurely appear very ſimple, or very inſidious themſelves, who can negotiate with ſuch a power in preference to theſe, of whom they have no real cauſe of diſtruſt.</p>
            <p>No one will put much faith in the Princes of any country. He that truſts to any thing, but the operation of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, is a poor politician; and he that complains of deceit, where there is an intereſt to deceive, will ever be conſidered as a fool. But if he does complain, let him be careful to avoid the juſtice of a ſimilar accuſation. France probably laughs at the charge of inſidiouſneſs, brought againſt her by the court of Great-Britain: When it was brought, <hi>ungraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi> brought, at the beginning of theſe troubles, againſt America, it excited pity: America, however, who only felt an emotion, mixed with ſorrow and diſdain, when ſhe thought herſelf calumniated, expreſſed lately the greateſt indignation when the inſidiouſneſs of France was <hi>inſidiouſly</hi> alluded to. To America, the conduct of France appears magnanimous and liberal; her offers are at the leaſt apparently fair, and equal to her wiſhes; in keeping to this appearance there is much political wiſdom: But when Great-Britain offers to America every thing but independence, ſhe ſhews the extreme folly of inſidiouſneſs; <hi>ſhe gives every thing, only to gain the right and power of retracting every thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:016245_0015_0F9BCFB7D382A100"/>
Let Great-Britain then conſider whether it is not, and ever muſt be, the intereſt of France to ſupport the independence of America; ſuch conſideration will ſhew the folly of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with that power to betray it, that no offers are ſufficient to obtain her forbearance, but that ſhe will either directly or indirectly purſue her great and permanent intereſt, by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the Americans in their oppoſition, and inciting other nations to hold up their forbearance likewiſe as worthy of purchaſe.</p>
            <p>But the particular incitement of France againſt this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is not neceſſary; the very precedent is of itſelf ſufficient to ſuggeſt to other foreign ſtates the part to be taken in the preſent circumſtances: The purchaſe of peace is a dangerous expedient; it ſtirs up freſh oppoſition, and opens the door to future miſchief. Should the direct or indirect forbearance of France be actually obtained, it will perhaps be conſidered as a great point carried; for her countenance and ſupport, alone, are ſufficient to enable America to ſet the power of this iſland, <hi>even in its moſt flouriſhing condition,</hi> at defiance: But there is hardly a Prince in Europe, whoſe aſſiſtance is not ſufficient to determine the die in the <hi>preſent ſtate of Britiſh affairs;</hi> and there is not one of them who is not ſenſible of his temporary and comparative ſtrength. Should France, therefore, be quieted, freſh adverſaries and freſh claims will ariſe in every quarter; every petty Prince, having an intereſt in the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency of America, will expect a ſatisfaction for giving up his pretences and intereſt: Some may be ſatisfied with a little; but others of great rank, power, and enmity to this country, will make important demands; may make ſuch as will be eventual ſacrifices of its honour and intereſt, and which, nevertheleſs, in the preſent ſituation of affairs, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not either in policy or common prudence be refuſed. Is it neceſſary to allude to Spain? If the forbearance of France is to be purchaſed on the terms ſuggeſted by ſome, Gibraltar and Jamaica will be moderate prices for the purchaſe of peace with Spain. With reſpect to the Dutch, there can be no terms offered in ſatisfaction for their loſs of the American commerce, by the re-eſtabliſhment of the former ſovereignty; for the Dutch value trade above all things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:016245_0016_0F9BCFB88D75C530"/>
In ſhort, it is impoſſible for Great-Britain to recover her former ſovereignty by any treaty with the powers of Europe; for all are intereſted in the independency of America. If ſhe had the means of gaining their preſent acquieſcence and forbearance, and of ſatisfying their ſeveral pretences by the moſt fatal ſacrifices, yet her ſuperiority over America would not be recovered; nor, what is of more conſequence at this juncture, would her peace be reſtored. America is now of herſelf ſufficiently able to baffle every hoſtile attempt; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dread nor deſpair will ever induce a ſubmiſſion. Hear her moſt ſolemn determination; the Parliamentary Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners heard it to their confuſion.</p>
            <p>
               <q>To ſuppoſe their minds leſs firm at the preſent hour than they were when deſtitute of all foreign aid, even without the expectation of an alliance, when upon a day of public faſting and humiliation, in their houſe of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and in the preſence of God, they reſolved <hi>To hold no conference or treaty with any Commiſſioners on the part of Great-Britain, unleſs they ſhould, as a preliminary thereto, either withdraw their fleets and armies, or in poſitive and expreſs terms acknowledge the independency of the States</hi>— would be highly irrational—Sooner than do it, they would commence treaties weſtward of yonder mountain.</q>
