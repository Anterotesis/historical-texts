            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE human body is certainly one of the moſt ſtupendous works of Omnipotence. Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy diſcovers in it ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand marks of wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which I have no room to mention here; nor indeed is it poſſible for any finite intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to deſcribe the geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal accuracy with which the Author of nature has formed every part of the fabric. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as I ſincerely wiſh that all who are honored with theſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and wonderfully wrought bodies, may poſſeſs them in health and happineſs, and, as
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:025349_0003_0FCD0165C6C65060"/>
long experience demonſtrates, that this can not be attained without TEMPERANCE and EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERCISE, I ſhall in this paper give the reader ſuch a view of the ſtructure and mechaniſm of his own frame, as will convince him of the neceſſity and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of thoſe virtues.</p>
            <p>I conſider the body as a ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of tubes and glands, or, (in a more ruſtic phraſe) a large bundle of pipes and ſtrainers; every part of the body, all the bowels, muſcles, tendons and ligaments, are compoſed by a conjunction of countleſs num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of theſe pipes and ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that is, of arteries, veins, nerves and glands. Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable veſſels, diſpoſed in proper order, and filled with
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:025349_0004_0FCD01673A4A93B0"/>
ſuitable fluids or juices, are, by divine appointment, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, while life laſts, a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al action and motion.</p>
            <p>The ſtomach and bowels are continually labouring to digeſt, that is, to grind and reduce the food into a kind of milk, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chyle; this, carried by mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of little pipes into the blood-veſſels, is there, by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tion of the heart and arteries, converted into blood, and circulated through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all parts of the body, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the conſtantly wearing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, to recruit the ever waſting fluids, and to furniſh a ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and friendly ſupply to the ceaſeleſs conſumption of nature.</p>
            <p>From this ſketch of the body and its laws, it plainly appears,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:025349_0005_0FCD016921CC1598"/>
that two things are principally eſſential to good health—Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſtrength of the veſſels—and a free circulation of the fluids.</p>
            <p>The veſſels muſt have ſtrength ſufficient to convert the food into wholeſome blood and urge it on with vigour; and the blood muſt have a proper conſiſtence to yield to the action of the veſſels and circulate freely. To preſerve the body in this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and healthy ſtate, is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant taſk indeed, and which Infinite Wiſdom has conſigned chiefly to temperance and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe. The one, allows us to take ſuch food only as is whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and ſuffici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:025349_0006_0FCD016B56D99818"/>
fibres as to enable them to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt and change the food into fit nouriſhment, and convey it to the different parts. And though the component parts of our bodies are ſo inconceivably numerous and complicated; though they are ſo very minute and delicate, yet ſo wonderful is the wiſdom and goodneſs of GOD in the diſpoſition of them, that they would ſeldom or never be diſordered, were we but duly temperate and laborious. And without a proper regard to thoſe great duties, the moſt ſovereign medicines in nature will not have virtue ſufficient to preſerve us long in health. There is an anecdote related by ſome of the oriental writers, which places the importance of exerciſe in a
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:025349_0007_0FCD016C80ADA138"/>
proper point of view. A king who had long languiſhed under an ill habit of body, and had taken abundance of medicines to no purpoſe, was at length cured by the following method. His phyſician took an hollow ball of wood and filled it with drugs, after which he cloſed it up ſo artfully that nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. He likewiſe took a mall, and having hollowed it, he incloſed in it ſeveral drugs after the ſame manner as in the ball itſelf. He then ordered the king to exerciſe himſelf eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning with theſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, till he ſhould get into a moderate perſpiration; when as the ſtory goes, the virtue of the medicaments perſpiring thro' the wood, had ſo good an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:025349_0008_0FCD016E1D86C6E0"/>
on the king's conſtitution, that they cured him of an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which all the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he had taken inwardly had not been able to remove.</p>
            <p>This allegory is finely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to ſhew us how benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial bodily labour is to health, and that exerciſe is the beſt phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic. But there is another grand preſervative of health, I mean temperance, which may be practiſed by all ranks and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, at any ſeaſon, or in any place, without interruption to buſineſs, expence of money, or loſs of time. Theſe two reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, duly obſerved, will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the conſtitution and render it, in ſome ſort, invulnerable. Exerciſe tends to throw off all ſuperfluities, and temperance
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:025349_0009_0FCD01703B347E80"/>
to prevent them; exerciſe clears the veſſels, temperance never overſtrains them; exerciſe rolls on the vital current, temperance gives nature full play, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows her to exert herſelf in all her force and vigour; exerciſe diſſipates a growing diſtemper, temperance ſtarves it.</p>
            <p>Phyſic is hardly any thing elſe but the ſubſtitute of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or exerciſe. 'Tis indeed abſolutely neceſſary in ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers, but did men but live in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> habitual uſe of thoſe two great inſtruments of health, there would be but little occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it. Bliſtering, cupping and bleeding, emetics, diet-drinks and bitters, are ſeldom of uſe but to the intemperate and idle, who uſe them in order
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:025349_0010_0FCD0171BB6EC090"/>
to make their luxury conſiſtent with health. The apothecary and doctor are perpetually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in countermining the cook and diſtiller. It is ſaid of Diogenes, that meeting a young man who was going to a feaſt, he took him up in the ſtreet, and carried him home to his friends, as one who was running into imminent danger, had not he prevented him. What would that philoſopher have ſaid, had he been preſent at the gluttony of a modern meal? Would he not have thought the maſter of a family mad, had he ſeen him devour fowl, fiſh and fleſh; ſwallow oil and vinegar, wines and ſpices; throw down ſallads of twenty different herbs, ſauces of an hundred ingredients,
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:025349_0011_0FCD017357935EB0"/>
confections and fruits of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs ſweets and flavors? What unnatural motions and counterferments muſt ſuch a medley of intemperance produce in the body? For my part, when I behold a faſhionable table ſet out in all its magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, I fancy that I ſee gouts and dropſies, fevers and lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, with other innumerable diſtempers, lying in ambuſcade among the diſhes.</p>
            <p>Were I permitted to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſuch a kind of temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as would ſuit all perſons, I would copy the following rules of a very eminent phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician.</p>
            <p>Make your whole repaſt out of one diſh. If you indulge in a ſecond, avoid drinking any
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:025349_0012_0FCD01758C5107C8"/>
thing ſtrong, till you have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed your meal; and abſtain from all ſauces, or at leaſt ſuch as are not the moſt plain and ſimple. A man would ſeldom be guilty of gluttony if he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to theſe few and eaſy rules prudently contenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with one good diſh, he would not be in danger of exceſs, like thoſe who indulge their craving appetites on every thing that is ſet before them. And by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from hot ſauces, and ſtrong drinks, he would never feel thoſe falſe appetites which often betray intemperate people to load their ſtomachs greatly to their hurt. And ſince it is to be feared, that the moſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate do ſometimes err a little on the ſide of exceſs, a man
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:025349_0013_0FCD0177A4FDF880"/>
would do well to miſs a meal now and then; it would prove a great relief to nature, help her to cleanſe and carry off her crudities, and give her time to recover the tones and ſprings of her diſtended veſſels. Beſides, abſtinence well timed, often kills a ſickneſs in the bud, and deſtroys the firſt ſeeds of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition. Several eminent writers of antiquity tell us, that Socrates lived in Athens all the time of that dreadful plague which ſwept off ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and yet he never took the leaſt infection; which theſe writers unanimouſly aſcribe to his temperate way of living.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that if we compare the lives of thoſe ancient ſages who
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:025349_0014_0FCD017878A557C0"/>
were ſo eminent for their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, with the lives of any ſet of kings or great men of the ſame number, we ſhould think they were of two different dates. For the generality of thoſe wiſe men were nearer an hundred than ſixty years of age at the time of their deaths. But the moſt remarkable inſtance of the efficacy of temperance towards procuring long life, is what we meet with in a little book pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Lewis Cornaro the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian; which I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he rather men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion becauſe it is of undoubted credit, as the late Venetian am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, who was of the ſame family, atteſted more than once in converſation when he reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in England. Cornaro, the author of the little treatiſe I am
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:025349_0015_0FCD0179F4EC7640"/>
mentioning was of an infirm conſtitution till about forty, when by obſtinately perſiſting in an exact courſe of temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he recovered a perfect ſtate of health, inſomuch that at fourſcore he publiſhed his book, which has been tranſlated into Engliſh, under the title of <q>
                  <hi>Sure and certain methods of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a long and healthy life.</hi>

               <p>I HAVE obſerved that cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom has lately introduced into Italy, two very dangerous evils—FLATTERY and INTEMPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RANCE.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe baniſhes from converſation, all frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and plain dealing. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the latter I declare open

war, as being the moſt fatal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of our health.</p>
               <p>'Tis an unhappineſs into which the people of this age are fallen, that variety of diſhes is become faſhionable and too generally preferred to frugality. And yet the one is the offspring of divine temperance; whilſt pride and gluttony are the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parents of the other. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the difference of their origin, yet prodigality is now a-days tricked up in the pompous titles of magnificence, generoſity and grandeur; whilſt bleſt frugality is too often brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the badge of an avaricious and ſordid ſpirit.</p>
               <p>This error has ſo far ſeduced us, as to prevail on many to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a frugal way of living,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:025349_0019_0FCD0183E0311AA8"/>
though taught by nature, from the earlieſt ages of the world; and has betrayed us into thoſe exceſſes which ſerve only to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge the number of our days. We are grown old before we have been able to taſte the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of being young. And the time which ought to be the ſummer of our lives is often the beginning of their winter. We ſoon perceive our ſtrength to fail, and weakneſs to come on, long before we have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the perfection of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. On the contrary, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance promotes and preſerves to us the full perfection of our natures. Our youth is laſting, and our manhood attended with a vigor that does not begin to decay till after a great many
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:025349_0020_0FCD0185AFD623B8"/>
years. This is ſo true, that when men were not addicted to intemperance they had more ſtrength and vivacity at four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore, than we have at forty.</p>
               <p>Oh unhappy Italy! doeſt thou not ſee, that gluttony and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs rob thee, every year, of more inhabitants than peſtilence, war, and famine could have done? Thy true plagues, are thy numerous luxuries and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate feaſtings, in which thy deluded citizens indulge themſelves to an exceſs unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the rational character and utterly ruinous to their health; for how is it poſſible to ſupport nature under ſuch loads of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and unwholeſome foods? Put a ſtop to this fatal abuſe, for God's ſake, for there is not,

I am certain of it, a vice more abominable in the eyes of the divine Majeſty, nor any more deſtructive. How many have I ſeen cut off, in the flower of their days by this unhappy cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of high feeding! How many excellent friends has glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony deprived me of, who, but for this accurſed vice, might have been an ornament to the world, an honour to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and have afforded me as much joy in their lives, as I now feel concern at their loſs!</p>
               <p>In order, therefore, to put a ſtop to ſo great an evil, I have undertaken this little book, and I attempt it the more readily, as many young gentlemen have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted it of me, moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by ſeeing their f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

off in the flower of their youth, and me ſo ſound and hearty at the age of eighty-one. They begged me to let them know by what means I attained to ſuch excellent health and ſpirits at my time of life. I could not but think their curioſity very laudable, and was willing to gratify them, and at the ſame time do ſome ſervice to my countrymen, by declaring, in the firſt place, what led me to renounce intemperance and lead a temperate life; ſecondly, by ſhewing the rules I obſerved; and thirdly, what unſpeakable ſatisfaction and advantage I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from it; whence it may be very clearly ſeen how eaſy a thing it is for a wiſe man to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape all the curſes of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:025349_0023_0FCD018E0A73FEB0"/>
and ſecure to himſelf the ineſtimable felicities of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous health and chearful age.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing that led me to embrace a temperate life, was, the many and ſore evils which I ſuffered from the contrary courſe of living; my conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, naturally, weakly and delicate, which ought in reaſon to have made me more regular and prudent, but being, like moſt young men, too fond of what is uſually called good eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking, I gave the rein to my appetites. In a little time I began to feel the ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſuch intemperance; for I had ſcarce attained to my thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-fifth year, before I was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked with a complication of diſorders, ſuch as, head-achs, a
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:025349_0024_0FCD019008E48128"/>
ſick ſtomach, cholicky uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the gout, rheumatic pains, lingering fevers, and continual thirſt; and though I was then but in the middle of my days, my conſtitution ſeemed ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ruined that I could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope for any other termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my ſufferings but death.</p>
               <p>The beſt phyſicians in Italy employed all their ſkill in my behalf, but to no effect. At laſt they told me, very candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there was but one thing that could afford me a ſingle ray of hope, but one medicine that could give a radical cure; viz. the immediate adoption of a temperate and regular life. They added moreover, that, now, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> no time to loſe, that I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> immediately, either
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:025349_0025_0FCD0191498996E0"/>
chuſe a regimen or death, and that if I deferred their advice much longer, it would be too late for ever to do it. This was a home thruſt. I could not bear the thoughts of dying ſo ſoon, and being convinced of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities and experience, I thought the wiſeſt courſe I could take, would be to follow their advice, how diſagreeable ſoever it might ſeem.</p>
               <p>I then requeſted my phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians to tell me exactly after what manner I ought to govern myſelf? To this they replied, that I ſhould always conſider myſelf as an infirm perſon; eat nothing but what agreed with me, and that in ſmall quantity. I then immediately entered on this new courſe of life, and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:025349_0026_0FCD0192C5581A60"/>
with ſo determined a reſolution, that nothing has been ſince able to divert me from it. In a few days I perceived that this new way of living agreed very well with me; and in leſs than a twelve month I had the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable happineſs to find that all my late alarming ſymptoms were vaniſhed, and that I was perfectly reſtored to health.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had I began to taſte the ſweets of this new reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but I made many very pleaſing reflections on the great advantages of temperance, and thought within myſelf, <q>if this virtue has had ſo divine an efficacy, as to cure me of ſuch grievous diſorders, ſurely i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> will help my bad conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and confirm my health.</q>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:025349_0027_0FCD0195222BC5B0"/>
I therefore applied myſelf dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to diſcover what kinds of food were propereſt for me. I reſolved to try whether thoſe diſhes that pleaſed my taſte, were friendly or hurtful to my health, and whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb be true, which ſays, <hi>that what delights the palate muſt be good for the ſtomach.</hi> I found it to be falſe; and that it juſt ſerves as an excuſe to gluttons who are for indulging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in whatever pleaſes their appetites.</p>
               <p>I therefore took no more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the proverb, but made choice of ſuch meats and drinks as agreed with my conſtitution, and made it an inviolable law with myſelf, <hi>always to riſe with an appetite to eat more if I</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:025349_0028_0FCD0197A3054560"/>
                  <hi>pleaſed.</hi> In a word, I entirely renounced intemperance, and made a vow to continue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of my life under the ſame regimen I had obſerved: A happy reſolution this! the keeping of which entirely cured me of all my infirmities. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before lived a year together, without falling once at leaſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome violent illneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this never happened to me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; on the contrary. I have always been healthy ever ſince I was temperate.</p>
               <p>I muſt not forget here to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a circumſtance of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſequence. I have been telling of a great, and to me, a moſt happy change in my way of living. Now all changes, though from the <hi>worſt</hi> to the <hi>beſt</hi>

hard ſtudy; and the ill effects of this imprudence, are greatly aggravated by that ſedentary life, ſtooping poſture, and lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt tables, which ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people are ſo often guilty of, and by which they too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently bring on themſelves pains of the breaſt, and incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſumptions.

               <p>The influence of the paſſions on the nerves, and health of our bodies, is ſo great, that none <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

his paſſions, and keep them in ſubjection to reaſon. For let a man be ever ſo temperate in diet, or regular in exerciſe, yet ſtill ſome unhappy paſſion, if indulged to exceſs, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over all his regularity, and prevent the good effects of his temperance; no words, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, can adequately expreſs the wiſdom of guarding againſt an influence ſo deſtructive. Fear, anger, grief, envy, hatred, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, revenge and deſpair, are known by eternal experience, to weaken the nerves, diſorder the circulation, impair digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and often to bring on a long train of hyſterical and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriacal diſorders; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ſudden fright, has often occaſioned immediate death.</p>

However, I muſt confeſs to my ſhame, that I have not been at all times ſo much of a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher and Chriſtian, as entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to avoid theſe diſorders; but I have reaped the benefit of knowing by my own repeated experience, that theſe malignant paſſions have in general a far leſs pernicious effect on bodies that are rendered firm and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous by temperance, than on thoſe that are corrupted and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by gluttony and exceſs.</p>
               <p>That eminent phyſician, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, made this obſervation long before me, and I might produce ſeveral authorities to ſupport this opinion, but I will go only upon my own experience. It was hard for me to avoid every extreme of heat and cold, and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:025349_0037_0FCD01A7E0B87700"/>
to live above all the occaſions of trouble which attend the life of man; but yet theſe things made no great impreſſion on the ſtate of my health, though I met with many inſtances of perſons who ſunk under leſs weight both of body and mind.</p>
               <p>There was in our family a conſiderable law-ſuit depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt ſome perſons, whoſe might overcame our right. One of my brothers, and ſome of my relations, were ſo mortified and grieved on account of the loſs of this ſuit, that they actually died of broken hearts. I was as ſenſible as they could be, of the great injuſtice done us, but, thank GOD, ſo far from break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my heart, it ſcarcely broke my repoſe. And I aſcribe <hi>thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

ſufferings and <hi>my</hi> ſafety, to the difference of our living. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance and ſloth had ſo weakened their nerves, and broken their ſpirits, that they eaſily ſunk under the weight of misfortune.

               <p>At ſeventy years of age, I had another experiment of the uſefulneſs of my regimen. Some buſineſs of conſequence calling me into the country, my coach-horſes ran away with me; I was overſet and dragged a long way before they could ſtop the horſes. They took me out of the coach, with my head bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, a leg and an arm out of

As ſoon as they had brought me home, they ſent for the phyſicians, who did not expect I could live three days: however, they reſolved upon letting me blood, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the fever, which uſually happens in ſuch caſes.

I ordered them to dreſs my head, to ſet my leg and arm, to rub me with ſome ſpecific oils pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for bruiſes; and, without any other remedies, I was ſoon cured, to the great aſtoniſhment of the phyſicians, and of all thoſe who knew me.</p>

I beg leave to relate one more anecdote, as an additional proof what an impenetrable ſhield temperance preſents againſt the evils of life.</p>
               <p>About five years ago<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was over-perſuaded to a thing, which had like to have coſt me dear. My relations, whom I love, and who have a real tenderneſs for me; my friends, with whom I was willing to comply in any thing that was reaſonable; laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, my phyſicians, who were looked upon as the oracles of health, did all agree, that I eat too little; that the nouriſhment I took was not ſufficient for one of my years; that I ought not only to ſupport nature, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to increaſe the vigor of it, by eating a little more than I
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:025349_0041_0FCD01AE7980EE98"/>
did. It was in vain for me to repreſent to them, that nature is content with a little; that with this little I had enjoyed excellent health ſo many years; that to me the habit of it was become a ſecond nature; and that it was more agreeable to reaſon, that as I advanced in years and loſt my ſtrength, I ſhould rather <hi>leſſen</hi> than <hi>increaſe</hi> the quantity of my food, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as the powers of the ſtomach muſt grow weaker from year to year. To ſtrengthen my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, I urged thoſe two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and true proverbs; one, that he who would eat a great deal muſt eat but little; that is, eating little makes a man live long, and living long he muſt eat a great deal. The other
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:025349_0042_0FCD01B0887D8DB0"/>
proverb was, that what we leave, after making a hearty meal, does us more good than what we have eaten. But neither my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs nor arguments could ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence their affectionate intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Wherefore to pleaſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who were ſo dear to me, I conſented to increaſe the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of food, but with two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces only. So that, as before I had always taken but twelve ounces of ſolid food in the day, I now increaſed it to fourteen, and as before I drank but four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ounces of wine in the day, I now increaſed it to ſixteen. This increaſe had in eight days time ſuch an effect on me, that from being remarkably chearful and briſk, I began to be peeviſh and melancholy, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:025349_0043_0FCD01B1EC7CA048"/>
ſo ſtrangely diſpoſed, that I neither knew what to ſay to others, nor what to do with myſelf. On the twelfth day I was attacked with a moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pain in my ſide, which held me twenty two hours, and was followed by a violent fever which continued thirty five days, without giving me a moment's reſpite. However, GOD be praiſed, I recovered, though in my ſeventy eighth year, and in the coldeſt ſeaſon of a very cold winter, and reduced to a mere ſkeleton, and I am poſitive, that, next to GOD, I am moſt indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to temperance, for my reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. O how great is the evil of intemperance, which could, in a few days bring on me ſo ſevere an illneſs, and how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:025349_0044_0FCD01B2F8C0E288"/>
are the virtues of temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which could thus bear me up, and ſnatch me from the jaws of death! Order, my friends, order is every thing; by order, the arts are more eaſily learnt; by order, armies are rendered victorious; by order, families, cities and kingdoms are raiſed to honour and happineſs; and order is the grand preſervative of health and long life; nay, I cannot help ſaying it is the only and true medicine. Hence it is, that when a diſintereſted phyſician viſits a patient, the firſt thing he preſcribes, is to live regularly. And when he takes leave of his patient after recovery, he adviſes him, as he tenders his health, to lead a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular life. And were a patient,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:025349_0045_0FCD01B578C3E410"/>
ſo recovered, to live in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he would hardly ever be ſick again. This we may ſay for a certainty, that would all men but live regularly and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately, there would not be a tenth of that ſickneſs which now makes ſo many melancholy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, nor any occaſion for a tenth part of thoſe nauſeous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, which they are now o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to ſwallow in order to carry off thoſe bad humours with which they have filled their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by over eating and drinking.—To ſay the truth, would every one of us but pay a becoming attention to the quantity and quality of what he eats and drinks, and carefully obſerve the effects it has upon him, he would ſoon become his own phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:025349_0046_0FCD01B7B3CEF850"/>
and indeed the very beſt he could poſſibly have, for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's conſtitutions are as different as their faces; and it is impoſſible, in many very important inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for the moſt ſkilful phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians to tell a man of obſervation, what would agree with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſo well as he knows himſelf. I am willing to allow that a phyſician may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times neceſſary; ſince there are ſome diſorders againſt which no human prudence can provide, and which affect us in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as to deprive us of the power of helping ourſelves; it is wrong then <hi>wholly</hi> to rely on nature; recourſe ſhould be had to ſome judicious phyſician, and in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of danger, the ſooner the better. But for the bare pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:025349_0047_0FCD01B8FA3A0568"/>
of preſerving ourſelves in good health, there needs no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter phyſic than a temperate and regular life. It is a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic and natural medicine, which preſerves the man, how tender ſoever his conſtitution be, and prolongs his life to above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, ſpares him the pain of a violent death, ſends him quietly out of the world, when the radical moiſture is quite ſpent, and which, in ſhort, has all the properties that are fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied to be in potable gold, which a great many perſons have ſought after in vain.</p>
               <p>But alas! moſt men ſuffer themſelves to be ſeduced by the charms of a voluptuous life. They have not courage enough to deny their appetites; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:025349_0048_0FCD01BA80A02800"/>
over-perſuaded by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations ſo far, as to think they cannot give up the gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them, without abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much of their pleaſures, they deviſe arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade themſelves, that it is more eligible to live ten years leſs, than to be upon the reſtraint, and deprived of whatever may gratify their appetites. Alas! they know not the value of ten years of healthy life, in an age when a man may enjoy the full uſe of his reaſon, and turn all his wiſdom and experience to his own, and the advantage of the world. To inſtance only in the ſciences. 'Tis certain that ſome of the moſt valuable books now extant, were written in thoſe laſt ten years of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:025349_0049_0FCD01BE4E770890"/>
lives, which ſome men pretend to undervalue; let fools and villains undervalue life, the world would loſe nothing by them, die when they will. But it is a loſs indeed, when <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>good</hi> men drop into the grave; ten years of life to men of that character, might prove an ineſtimable bleſſing to their families and country. Is ſuch an one a prieſt only, in a little time he might become a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and by living ten years longer, might render the moſt important ſervices to the world by his active diſſemination of virtue and piety. Is he the aged parent of a family, then though no longer equal to the toils of younger years, yet by his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable preſence and matured
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:025349_0050_0FCD01BFB672DBA8"/>
counſels, he may contribute more to the harmony and happineſs of his children, than all their labours put together. And ſo with all others, whether in church or ſtate, army or navy, who are advanced in years, though not equal to the active exerciſes of youth, yet in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their ſuperior wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and experience, their lives may be of more ſervice to their country, than the lives of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of citizens. Some, I know, are ſo unreaſonable as to ſay that it is impoſſible to lead ſuch a regular life. To this I anſwer, Galen, that great phyſician, led ſuch a life, and adviſed others to it as the beſt phyſic. <hi>Plato, Cicero, Iſocrates,</hi> and a great many famous men
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:025349_0051_0FCD01C1D0C048C8"/>
of paſt ages embraced it; and in our time, Pope <hi>Paul Farneze,</hi> Cardinal <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mbo,</hi> and two of our Doges, <hi>Lando</hi> and <hi>Dorato,</hi> have practiſed it, and thereby arrived to an extreme old age. I might inſtance in others of a meaner extract; but, having followed this rule myſelf, I think I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not produce a more convincing proof of its being practicable, and that the greateſt trouble to be met with therein, is the firſt reſolving and entering upon ſuch a courſe of life.</p>
               <p>You will tell me that <hi>Plato,</hi> as ſober a man as he was, yet affirmed, that it is difficult for a man in public life to live ſo temperately, being often in the ſervice of the ſtate, expoſed to the badneſs of weather, to the
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:025349_0052_0FCD01C2ED6BCEC0"/>
fatigues of travelling, and to eat whatever he can meet with. This cannot be denied; but then I maintain, that theſe things will never haſten a man's death, provided he accuſtoms himſelf to a frugal way of living. There is no man, in what condition ſoever but may keep from over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eating; and thereby happily prevent thoſe diſtempers that are cauſed by exceſs. They who have the charge of public affairs committed to their truſt, are more obliged to it than any others: where there is no glory to be got for their country, they ought not to ſacrifice themſelves: they ſhould preſerve themſelves to ſerve it; and if they purſue my method, it is certain they would ward off the diſtempers
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:025349_0053_0FCD01C444A4A8E0"/>
which heat and cold and fatigues might bring upon them; or ſhould they be diſturbed with them it would be but very light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>It may likewiſe be objected, that if one who is well, is diet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like one that is ſick, he will be at a loſs about the choice of his diet, when any diſtemper comes upon him. To this I ſay, that nature, ever attentive to the preſervation of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, teaches us how we ought to govern ourſelves in ſuch a caſe. She begins by depriving us ſo entirely of our appetites, that we can eat little or nothing. At that time, whether the ſick perſon has been ſober or intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, no other food ought to be u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſuch as is proper
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:025349_0054_0FCD01C5F2F82438"/>
for his condition; ſuch as broth, jellies, cordials, barley-water, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> When his recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will permit him to uſe a more ſolid nouriſhment, he muſt take leſs than he was uſed to before his ſickneſs; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the eagerneſs of his appetite, he muſt take care of his ſtomach, till he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured. Should he do otherwiſe, he would overburden nature, and infallibly relapſe into the danger he had eſcaped. But notwithſtanding this, I dare aver, that he who leads a ſober and regular life, will hardly ever be ſick; or but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and for a ſhort time. This way of living preſerves us from thoſe bad humours which occaſion our infirmities, and by
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:025349_0055_0FCD01C74CFBF1B0"/>
conſequence heals us of all thoſe diſtempers which they occaſion. I do not pretend to ſay that every body muſt eat exactly as little as I do, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from fruit, fiſh, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things from which I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain, becauſe ſuch diſhes diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with me. They who are not diſordered by ſuch diſhes, are under no obligation to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from them. But they are under the greateſt obligations to feed moderately, even on the moſt innocent food, ſince an overloaded ſtomach cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt.</p>
               <p>It ſignifies nothing to tell me that there are ſeveral, who, though they live very irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, yet enjoy excellent health and ſpirits, and to as advanced
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:025349_0056_0FCD01C8C2675370"/>
an age, as thoſe who live ever ſo ſoberly. For this argument is founded on ſuch uncertainty and hazard, and occurs ſo ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as to look more like a miracle than the regular work of nature. And thoſe, who, on the credit of their youth and <hi>conſtitution,</hi> will pay any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ſo idle an objection, may depend on it that they are the betrayers and ruiners of their own health.</p>
               <p>And I can confidently and truly affirm, that an old man, even of a bad conſtitution, who leads a regular and ſober life, is ſurer of a longer one, than a young man of the beſt conſtitution who lives diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. All therefore who have a mind to live long and healthy,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:025349_0057_0FCD01CB261A1AC8"/>
and die without ſickneſs of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or mind, muſt immediately begin to live temperately, for ſuch a regularity keeps the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the body mild and ſweet, and ſuffers no groſs fiery vapours to aſcend from the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach to the head; hence the brain of him who lives in that manner, enjoys ſuch a conſtant ſerenity, that he is always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly maſter of himſelf. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily freed from the tyranny of bodily appetites and paſſions, he eaſily ſoars above, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted and delightful contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heavenly objects; by this means his mind becomes gradually enlightened with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth, and expands itſelf to the glorious enrapturing view of the Power, Wiſdom,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:025349_0058_0FCD01CC79FA9B08"/>
and Goodneſs of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.—He then deſcends to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and acknowledges her for the fair daughter of GOD, and views her varied charms with ſentiments of admiration, joy, and gratitude, becoming the moſt favoured of all ſublunary beings. He then clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, and generouſly laments the wretched fate of thoſe, who will not give themſelves the trouble to ſubdue their paſſions, and thoſe three moſt enſnaring luſts, the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of honours, and the luſt of riches, which all wiſe and good men have firmly oppoſed and conquered, when they paſſed through this mortal ſtate; for knowing ſuch paſſions to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with reaſon and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:025349_0059_0FCD01CDF90B8FB8"/>
they at once nobly broke through their ſnares, and applied themſelves to virtue and good works, and ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came men of good and ſober lives. And when in proceſs of time, and after a long ſeries of years, they ſee the period of their days drawing nigh, they are neither grieved nor alarmed. Full of acknowledgments for the favours already received from GOD, they throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the arms of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mercy. They are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of thoſe dreadful puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which they deſerve who have ſhortened their days by guilty intemperance.

but are pilgrims and travellers to a far better. Exulting in this faith, and with hopes big with immortality, they go down to the grave in a good old age, enriched with virtues, and laden with honours.</p>
               <p>And they have the greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not to be dejected at the thought of death, as they know it will not be violent, feveriſh or painful. Their end is calm, and they expire, like a lamp when the oil is ſpent, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion or agony, and ſo they paſs gently away, without pain or ſickneſs, from this earthly and corruptible to that celeſtial and eternal life, whoſe happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the reward of the virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>

I walk out in my gardens, along my canals and walks; where I
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:025349_0065_0FCD01DC6EA0DFD8"/>
always meet with ſome little thing or other to do, which, at the ſame time, employs and amuſes me.</p>
               <p>I ſpend the months of <hi>April, May, September,</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> at my country-houſe, which is the fineſt ſituation imaginable: the air of it is good, the avenues neat, the gardens magnificent, the waters clear and plentiful; and this ſeat may well paſs for an inchanted palace.</p>
               <p>Sometimes I take a walk to my <hi>Villa,</hi> all whoſe ſtreets ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate at a large ſquare; in the midſt of which is a pretty neat church, and large enough for the bigneſs of the pariſh.</p>
               <p>Through this <hi>Villa</hi> runs a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulet; and the country about it is enriched with fruitful and
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:025349_0066_0FCD01DDB9999718"/>
well cultivated fields; having at preſent a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of inhabitants. This was not ſo formerly: It was a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhy place, and the air ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome, that it was more proper for frogs and toads, than for men to dwell in. But on my draining off the waters, the air mended, and people reſort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it ſo faſt, as to render the place very populous; ſo that I may, with truth, ſay that I have here dedicated to the LORD, a church, altars, and hearts to worſhip him; a circumſtance this, which affords me infinite ſatisfaction as often as I reflect on it.</p>
               <p>It is with great ſatisfaction that I ſee the end of a work of ſuch importance to this STATE,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:025349_0067_0FCD01E0677A27C8"/>
I mean that of draining and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving ſo many large tracts of uncultivated ground, a work which I never expected to have ſeen compleated, but, thank GOD, I have lived to ſee it, and was even in perſon in theſe marſhy places, along with the commiſſaries, for two months together, during the heats of ſummer, without ever finding myſelf the worſe for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues I underwent. Of ſuch wonderful efficacy is that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate life which I conſtantly obſerve.</p>
               <p>If in diſcourſing on ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a ſubject as this, it be allowable to ſpeak of trifles, I might tell you that at the age of fourſcore and three, a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate life had preſerved me in
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:025349_0068_0FCD01E195A72EB0"/>
that ſprightlineſs of thought, and gaiety of humour, as to be able to compoſe a very enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining comedy, highly moral and inſtructive, without ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or diſguſting the audience; an evil too generally attending our comedies, and which it is the duty, and will be the eternal honour of the magiſtracy to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance and ſuppreſs, ſince nothing has a more fatal ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to corrupt the morals of youth, than ſuch plays as abound with wanton alluſions, and wicked ſneers and ſcoffs on religion and matrimony.</p>
               <p>As an addition to my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I ſee myſelf immortalized as it were, by the great number of my deſcendants. I meet with, on my return home, not only
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:025349_0069_0FCD01E2F8822FC0"/>
two or three, but eleven grand children, all bleſt with high health, ſweet diſpoſitions, bright parts, and of promiſing hopes. I take a delight in play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the little pratlers: thoſe who are older I often ſet to ſing and play for me on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of muſick.—Call you this an infirm crazy old age, as they pretend, who ſay, that a man is but half alive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he is ſeventy? They may believe me if they pleaſe, but really I would not exchange my ſerene chearful old age, with any of thoſe young men, even of the beſt conſtitution, who give the looſe to their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites; knowing as I do, that they are thereby ſubjecting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves every moment to diſeaſe and death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:025349_0070_0FCD01E50B514B08"/>
I remember all the follies of which I was guilty in my younger days, and am perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of the many and great dangers, they expoſed me to. I know with what vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence young perſons are carried away by the heat of their blood. They preſume on their ſtrength, juſt as if they had taken a ſure leaſe of their lives: and muſt gratify their appetites whatever it coſt them, without conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they thereby feed thoſe ill humours, which do moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly haſten the approach of <hi>ſickneſs</hi> and <hi>death;</hi> two evils, which of all others are the moſt unwelcome and terrible to the wicked. The firſt of theſe, <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> is highly unwelcome, becauſe it effectually ſtops their
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:025349_0071_0FCD01E635D55770"/>
career after this world's buſineſs and pleaſures, which being their ſole delight and happineſs, muſt be inexpreſſibly ſad and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying. And the impatience and gloom of ſickneſs is rendered tenfold more inſupportable to them, becauſe it finds them ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtitute of thoſe pious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which alone can ſoothe the ſeverity of ſickneſs and charm the pangs of pain. They had never cultivated an acquaintance with GOD, nor accuſtomed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to look up to him as to a merciful Father, who ſends af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to wean us from this ſcene of vanity. They had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by prayers and good works, endeavoured to ſecure his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or cheriſh that love which would make his diſpenſations
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:025349_0072_0FCD01E774B85298"/>
welcome. So that unbleſt with theſe divine conſolations, the ſeaſon of ſickneſs muſt be dark and melancholy indeed: and beſides all this, their hearts often ſink within them at the proſpect of DEATH, that ghaſtly king of terrors, who comes to cut them off from all their dear delights in this world, and ſend their unwilling ſouls to ſuffer the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which their own guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſcience tells them is due to their wicked lives.</p>
               <p>But from theſe two evils, ſo dreadful to many, bleſſed be GOD, I have but little to fear; for, as for <hi>death,</hi> I have a joyful hope that that change, come when it may, will be gloriouſly for the <hi>better;</hi> and beſides, I truſt that HE whoſe divine voice

I have ſo long obeyed, will gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly ſupport and comfort his aged ſervant in that trying hour.

live in health and ſpirits, and enjoy this beautiful world, which is indeed beautiful to thoſe who know how to make it ſo, as I have done, and likewiſe expect (with GOD's aſſiſtance) to be able to do in the next.</p>
               <p>Now ſince a regular life is ſo happy, and its bleſſings ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and great, all I have ſtill left to do, (ſince I cannot accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh my wiſhes by force) is to beſeech every man of ſound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to embrace, with open arms, this moſt valuable treaſure of a long and healthy life; a treaſure, which, as it far exceeds all the riches of this world, ſo it deſerves above all things to be diligently ſought after, and carefully preſerved. This is that divine ſobriety, ſo
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:025349_0075_0FCD01EDC2535640"/>
agreeable to the Deity, the friend of nature, the daughter of reaſon and the ſiſter of all the virtues. From her, as from their proper root, ſpring life, health, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, induſtry, learning, and all thoſe employments worthy of noble and generous minds. Exceſs, intemperance, ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humours, fevers, pains, gouts, dropſies, conſumptions, and the dangers of death, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, in her preſence, like clouds before the ſun. She is the beſt friend and ſafeſt guardian of life; as well of the rich as of the poor; of the male as of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ſex; the old as of the young. She reaches the rich, modeſty; the poor, frugality; men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence; women, chaſtity; the old, how to ward off the attacks
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:025349_0076_0FCD01EEF7FFA1E0"/>
of death; and beſtows on youth, firmer and ſecurer hopes of life. She preſerves the ſenſes clear, the body light, the underſtanding lively, the ſoul briſk, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory tenacious, our motions free, and all our faculties in a pleaſing and agreeable harmony.</p>
               <p>O moſt innocent and divine ſobriety! the ſole refreſhment of nature, the nurſing mother of life, the true phyſic of ſoul as well as of body. How ought men to praiſe thee for thy prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gifts, for thy incomparable bleſſings! But as no man is able to write a ſufficient panegyric on this rare and excellent virtue, I ſhall put an end to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, leſt I ſhould be charged with exceſs in dwelling ſo long on ſo pleaſing a ſubject.

               <p>MY treatiſe on a temperate life has, thank GOD, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to anſwer my wiſhes, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſervice to many perſons of weakly conſtitutions, who, after every the leaſt exceſs, found themſelves greatly indiſpoſed.

regular courſe of living, from which, as their numerous letters to me declare, they have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the happieſt effects. In like manner, I ſhould be glad to be of ſervice to thoſe who are born with good conſtitutions, but preſuming too much upon them lead diſorderly lives; whence it comes to paſs, that on attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the age of ſixty or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, they are attacked with various diſeaſes; ſome with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant cholicky pains, the tone of the ſtomach and bowels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a manner deſtroyed by long continued exceſs; others are tormented with the gout, ſome are oppreſſed and drowned under dropſical humours, and others worn away to ſkeletons by the agonies of the ſtone, hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical

coughs, and a thouſand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mortal diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>I was born with a very chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric, haſty diſpoſition; flew into a paſſion for the leaſt trifle, huff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every body about me, and was ſo intolerably diſagreable, that many perſons of gentle man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners abſolutely ſhunned my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. On diſcovering how great an injury I was doing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I at once reſolved to make this vile temper give way to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I conſidered that a man overcome by paſſion, muſt at times, be no better than a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and that the only differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between a paſſionate and a madman, is, that the one has loſt his reaſon for ever, and the other is deprived of it by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>its on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but that in one of theſe, though

never ſo ſhort, he may do ſome deed of cruelty or death, that will ruin his character, and deſtroy his peace <hi>for ever.</hi> A ſober life, by cooling the fever of the blood, contributed much to cure me of this frenzy; and I am now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo moderate, and ſo much a maſter of my paſſion, that no body could perceive that it was born with me.</p>
               <p>A man may likewiſe, by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and exerciſe, correct a bad conſtitution, and, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a delicate habit, may live a long time in good health.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed, the moſt temperate may ſometimes be indiſpoſed, but then they have the pleaſure to think that it is not the effect of their own vices; that it will be but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:025349_0081_0FCD01F822387F80"/>
in its <hi>degree,</hi> and of ſhort continuance.</p>
               <p>Many have ſaid to me, <hi>"How can you, when at a table covered with a dozen delicious diſhes—how can you poſſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent yourſelf with one diſh, and that the plaineſt too at the table? It muſt ſurely be a great mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to you, to ſee ſo many charming things before you, and yet ſcarcely taſte them."</hi> This queſtion has frequently been put to me, and with an air of ſurprize. I confeſs it has often made me unhappy; for it proves that ſuch perſons are got to ſuch a paſs, as to look on the gratification of their appetites as the higheſt happineſs, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the mind is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the man, and that it is in the
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:025349_0082_0FCCDB9D146AC6B0"/>
affections of a virtuous and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mind, a man is to look for his trueſt and higheſt happineſs. When I ſit down, with my eleven grand children, to a table covered with various dainties, of which, for the ſake of a light eaſy ſtomach, I may not, at times, chuſe to partake, yet this is no mortification to me; on the contrary, I often find myſelf moſt happy at theſe times. How can it otherwiſe than give me great delight when I think of that goodneſs of GOD, which bleſſes the earth with ſuch immenſe ſtores of good things for the uſe of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and which, over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all this goodneſs, has put me into the way of getting ſuch an abundance of them for my

dear grand children; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides muſt it not make me very happy to think that I have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſuch a maſtery over myſelf as never to abuſe any of thoſe good things, but am perfectly contented with ſuch a portion of them as keeps me always in good health. O what a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of joy is this to my heart! What a ſad thing it is that young people will not take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, nor get benefit from thoſe who are older and wiſer than themſelves! I may uſe, in this matter, the words of the wiſe man, "I have ſeen all things that are done under the ſun." I know the pleaſures of eating, and I know the joys of a virtuous mind, and can ſay from long experience, that the
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:025349_0084_0FCD01FCB8443490"/>
one excelleth the other as far as light excelleth darkneſs; the one are the pleaſures of a mere animal, the other thoſe of an angel.</p>

Such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would do well to conſider, that by adopting a temperate and active life, they might ſoon recover ſuch vigour of conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as in a great meaſure, if not entirely, to throw off thoſe painful diſeaſes, and live in health and chearfulneſs to a fine old age.

               <p>To this ſome are ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that for their part they had rather eat and drink as they like, though it ſhould ſhorten their lives, that is, "give them a ſhort life and a merry one."

<pb n="88" facs="unknown:025349_0086_0FCD02010C0B38B0"/>
be a merry one? If men could eat to exceſs, drink to ſillineſs, and ruſt in ſloth, and after all, ſuffer no other harm than the abridgement of ten or a dozen years of life, they might have ſome little excuſe for calling it a merry life though ſurely it could appear ſo to none but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a ſadly vitiated taſte. But ſince high living does ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly tend to oppreſs and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the ſtomach, filling the whole habit with ſuperfluous and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered humours, head-achs, diſordered ſtomach, indigeſtion, diſturbed ſleep, bad dreams, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable taſte in the mouth in the morning, loſs of appetite, eructations, ſick ſtomach, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings, diarrhoeas, fevers, rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſms, gouts, conſumptions,

by eating little, my ſtomach is often craving after the manna, which I ſometimes feaſt on with ſo much pleaſure, that I ſhould think I treſpaſſed on the duty of temperance, did I not know that one muſt eat, to ſupport life; and that one cannot uſe a plainer or more natural diet.</p>
               <p>My ſpirits are not injured by what I eat, they are only reviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſupported by it.

<pb n="94" facs="unknown:025349_0092_0FCD020BEFBFD8B0"/>
grand children will declare eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal war againſt thee, and, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing my example, will let the world ſee the bleſſedneſs of a temperate life, and ſo expoſe thee, O cruel intemperance! for what thou really art, a moſt wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, deſperate, and mortal enemy of the children of men.</p>
               <p>It is really a very ſurpriſing and ſad thing, to ſee perſons grown to men's eſtate, and of fine wit, yet unable to govern their appetites, but tamely ſubmitting to be dragged by them into ſuch exceſſes of eating and drinking, as not only to ruin the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and ſhorten their lives, but eclipſe the luſtre of the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt parts, and bury themſelves in utter contempt and uſeleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. O what promiſing hopes
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:025349_0093_0FCD020CF4F4A018"/>
have been ſhip wrecked, what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal honours have been ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed at the ſhrine of low ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality! Happy, thrice happy, thoſe who have early been inur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to habits of ſelf-denial, and taught to conſider the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their appetites as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing ſource of diſeaſes and death. Ye generous parents who long to ſee your children adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with virtue, and beloved as the benefactors of their kind; O teach them the unſpeakable worth of ſelf-government. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupported by this, every advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of education and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will avail them but little: though the hiſtory of ancient worthies, and the recital of their illuſtrious deeds, may at times kindle up in their boſoms a

flame of glorious emulation, yet alas! this glow of coveted vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, this fluſh of promiſed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, is tranſient as a gleam of winter ſunſhine; ſoon overſpread and obſcured by the dark clouds of ſenſuality.</p>

               <p>THE human underſtanding muſt certainly poſſeſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing divine in its nature. What thanks do we not owe to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs, for this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful faculty of our minds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

we can, though never ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from them, indulge the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſeeing and converſing with thoſe we love! How glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious is this invention of writing, whereby we can eaſily commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to our abſent friends, whatever may afford them plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or improvement! By means of this moſt welcome contrivance, I ſhall now endeavour to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you with matters of the greateſt moment. It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that what I have to tell you is no news,—but I never told it you at the age of <hi>ninety one.</hi> Is it not a charming thing, that I am able to tell you, that my health and ſtrength are in ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a ſtate, that inſtead of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing with my age, they ſeem to increaſe as I grow old?
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:025349_0096_0FCD0213CBBAA7B0"/>
All my acquaintance are ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it; but I, who know the cauſe of this ſingular happineſs, do every where declare it. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, as much as in me lies, to convince all mankind, that a man may enjoy a paradiſe on earth even after the age of fourſcore.</p>
               <p>Now, my Lord, I muſt tell you, that within theſe few days paſt, ſeveral learned Doctors of this Univerſity came to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by me, of the method I take in my diet, having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that I am ſtill healthful and ſtrong; that I have my ſenſes perfect; that my memory, my heart, my judgment, the tone of my voice, and my teeth, are all as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="99" facs="unknown:025349_0097_0FCD021536679108"/>
the reſt of the day in walking out a-foot, and in taking all the innocent pleaſures that are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a virtuous man; even mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic itſelf, in which I bear my part.</p>
               <p>Ah, Sir! how ſweet a voice would you perceive mine to be, were you to hear me, like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>David,</hi> chant forth the praiſes of GOD to the ſound of my Lyre! You would certainly be ſurprized and charmed with the harmony which I make. Thoſe gentlemen particularly admired, with what eaſineſs I write on ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that require both judgment and ſpirit.</p>
               <p>They told me, that I ought not to be looked on as an old man, ſince all my employments were ſuch as were proper for a

youth, and did by no means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the works of men ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in years; who are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing nothing after four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore, but loaded with infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and diſtempers, are perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually languiſhing in pain.</p>
               <p>That if there be any of them leſs infirm, yet their ſenſes are decayed; their ſight and hearing fails them, their legs tremble, their hands ſhake, they can no longer walk, nor are they capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing any thing: and ſhould there chance to be one free from thoſe diſaſters, his memory decreaſes, his ſpirits ſink, and his heart fails him; he is not half ſo chearful, pleaſant and happy as I am.</p>
               <p>Several phyſicians were ſo good as to prognoſticate to me, ten
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:025349_0099_0FCCDBB988CC4608"/>
years ago, that it was impoſſible for me to hold out three years longer: however, I ſtill find my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf leſs weak than ever, and am ſtronger this year than any that went before. This ſort of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, and the many favours which I received from GOD, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged them to tell me, that I brought along with me at my birth, an extraordinary and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial gift of nature; and for the proof of their opinion they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all their rhetoric, and made ſeveral elegant ſpeeches on that head. It muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, my Lord, that eloquence has a charming force on the mind of man, ſince it often perſuades him to believe that which never was, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could be. I was very much
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:025349_0100_0FCCDBBB40757650"/>
pleaſed to hear them diſcourſe; and could it be helped, ſince they were men of parts who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangued at that rate? But that which delighted me moſt, was to reflect, that age and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may render a man wiſer than all the colleges in the world can. And it was in truth by their help, that I knew the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of that notion. To unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thoſe gentlemen, and at the ſame time ſet them right, I replied, that their way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not juſt: that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour I received was no ſpecial, but a general and univerſal one; that there was no man alive, but what may have received it as well as myſelf; that I was but a man as well as others: that we have all, (be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

exiſtence,) judgment and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: that we are all born with the ſame faculties of the ſoul; becauſe GOD was pleaſed that we ſhould all have thoſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages above the other creatures, who have nothing in common with us, but the uſe of their ſenſes: that the Creator has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on us this reaſon, and judgment to preſerve our lives: that man, when young, being more ſubject to ſenſe than rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is too apt to give himſelf up to pleaſure; and that when arrived to thirty or forty years of age, he ought to conſider, that, if he has been ſo imprudent as to lead, till that time, a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly life, 'tis now high time for him to take up and live tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately, for he ought to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:025349_0102_0FCCDBF9A0DFAE10"/>
that though he has hitherto been held up by the vigour of youth and a good conſtitution, yet he is now at the noon of life, and muſt bethink himſelf of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down towards the grave, with a heavy weight of years on his back, of which his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent pains and infirmities are certain forerunners; and that therefore, if he has not been ſo happy as to do it already, he ought now, immediately to change his courſe of life, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with reſpect to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and quantity of his food, as 'tis on that the health and length of our days do ſo greatly depend. For in truth, my Lord, 'tis impoſſible for thoſe who will always gratify their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, not to ruin their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:025349_0103_0FCCDC414AA65D38"/>
and that I might not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ruin mine, I devoted my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a ſober life. I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, it was not without great reluctance that I abandoned my luxurious way of living. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with praying to GOD, that he would grant me the gift of Temperance, well knowing that he always hears our prayers with delight. Then, conſidering, that when a man is about to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake any thing of importance, he may greatly ſtrengthen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in it, by often looking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the great pleaſures and advantages that he is to derive from it. Juſt as the huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man takes comfort under his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="106" facs="unknown:025349_0104_0FCCDC722CDF9068"/>
of GOD, when he thinks on the glory of that ſervice, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal joys that await him: ſo I, in like manner, by ſeriouſly reflecting on the innumerable pleaſures and bleſſings of health, and beſeeching GOD to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me in my good reſolutions, immediately entered on a courſe of temperance and regularity. And though it was at firſt high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſagreeable, yet I can truly ſay, that in a very little time the diſagreeableneſs vaniſhed, and I came to find great delight in it.</p>
               <p>Now on hearing my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they all agreed that I had ſaid nothing but what was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; nay, the youngeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them told me that he was willing to allow that theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:025349_0105_0FCCDC73D4D93FF0"/>
might be common to all men, but was afraid, they were ſeldom attained; and that I muſt be ſingularly favoured of Heaven to get above the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of an eaſy life, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace one quite contrary to it: that he did not look on it to be impoſſible, ſince my practice convinced him of the contrary, but however, it ſeemed to him to be very difficult.</p>
               <p>I replied, that it was a ſhame to relinquiſh a good undertaking on account of the difficulties that might attend it, and that the greater the difficulty, the more glory ſhould we acquire: that it is the will of the Creator, that every one ſhould attain to a long life, becauſe in his old age, he might be freed from
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:025349_0106_0FCCDC752F918938"/>
the bitter fruits that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ſenſe, and might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the good effects of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; that when he ſhakes hands with his vices, he is no longer a ſlave to the devil, and finds himſelf in a better condition of providing for the ſalvation of his ſoul: that GOD, whoſe goodneſs is infinite, has ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the man who comes to the end of his race, ſhould end his life without any diſtemper, and ſo paſs, by a ſweet and eaſy death, to a life of immortality and glory, which I expect. I hope (ſaid I to him) to die ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the praiſes of my Creator. The ſad reflection, that we muſt one day ceaſe to live, is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance to me, though I eaſily perceive that at my age, that
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:025349_0107_0FCCDC77566B74C8"/>
day cannot be far off; nor am I afraid of the terrors of hell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, bleſſed be GOD, I have long ago ſhaken hands with my ſins, and put my truſt in the mercy and merits of the blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this my young antagoniſt had nothing to ſay, only that he was reſolved to lead a ſober life, that he might live and die as happily as I hoped to do; and that though hitherto he had wiſhed to be young a long time, yet now he deſired to be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly old, that he might enjoy the pleaſures of ſuch an admirable age.</p>
               <p>The deſire I had of giving you, my lord, a long entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as being one with whom I could never be weary, has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined

me to write this long let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to you, and to add one word more before I conclude.</p>
               <p>Some ſenſual perſons give out, that I have troubled myſelf to no purpoſe, in compoſing a treatiſe concerning temperance, and that I have loſt my time in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to perſuade men to the practice of that which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Now this ſurprizes me the more, as theſe gentlemen muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> that I had led a temperate life many years before I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this treatiſe, and that I never ſhould have put myſelf to the trouble of compoſing it, had not long experience convinced me, that it is a life which any man may eaſily lead, who really wiſhes to be healthy and happy. And, beſides the evidence of my

own experience, I have the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to hear, that numbers on ſeeing my treatiſe have embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a life, and enjoyed from it the very ſame bleſſings which I enjoy. Hence I conclude, that no man of good ſenſe will pay any regard to ſo frivolous an objection. The truth is, thoſe gentlemen who make this objection, are ſo unhappily wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the poor pleaſure of eating and drinking, that they cannot think of moderating it, and as an excuſe for themſelves, they chooſe to talk at this extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant rate. However, I pity theſe gentlemen with all my heart, though they deſerve for their intemperance, to be tormented with a complication of diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and to be the victims of their paſſions a whole eternity.</p>

to the divine Goodneſs, for all his mercies conferred upon me? Moſt of your old men have ſcarce arrived to ſixty, but they find themſelves loaded with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities: they are melancholy, unhealthful; always full of the frightful apprehenſions of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: they tremble day and night, for fear of being within one foot of their graves; and are ſo ſtrongly poſſeſſed with the dread of it, that it is a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to divert them from that dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thought.

But that I may obſerve a method in the ſubject I am treating of, I will begin with man at his birth, and thence accompany him through every ſtage of life, to his grave.</p>
               <p>I ſay then, that ſome are born with ſo bad a conſtitution, that they live but a few days, months or years.</p>
               <p>Others are born well ſhaped and healthful, but of a tender make; and ſome of theſe live ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years, without being able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to that period which is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed old age.</p>

                  </gap>ld, and they indeed live to old age: but it is generally (as already obſerved)
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:025349_0113_0FCD0219EE0A9B18"/>
an old age of ſickneſs and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; for which they are to thank themſelves; becauſe they moſt unreaſonably preſume on the ſtrength of their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and will not on any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, abate of that hearty feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which they indulged in their younger days. Juſt as if they were to be as vigorous at four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore as in the flower of their youth: nay, they go about to juſtify this their imprudence, pretending that as we loſe our health and vigour by growing old, we ſhould endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the loſs, by increaſing the quantity of our food, ſince it is by ſuſtenance that man is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
               <p>But in this they are danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly miſtaken; for as the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:025349_0114_0FCD021B767C6128"/>
heat and ſtrength of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach leſſens as a man grows in years, he ſhould diminiſh the quantity of his meat and drink, common prudence requiring that a man ſhould proportion his diet to his digeſtive powers.</p>
               <p>This is a certain truth, that ſharp ſour humours on the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, proceed from a ſlow im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect digeſtion; and that but little good chyle can be made, when the ſtomach is filled with freſh food before it has carried off the former meal.—It cannot therefore be too frequently nor too earneſtly recommended, that as the natural heat decays by age, a man ought to abate the quantity of what he eats and drinks; nature requiring but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little for the healthy ſupport
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:025349_0115_0FCD021D8C795430"/>
of the life of man, eſpecially that of an old man. Would my aged friends but attend to this ſingle precept which has been ſo ſignally ſerviceable to me, they would not be troubled with one twentieth of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities which now harraſs and make their lives ſo miſerable. They would be light, active, and chearful like me, who am now near my <hi>hundredth year.</hi> And thoſe of them who were born with good conſtitutions, might live to the age of one hundred and twenty. Had I been bleſt with a robuſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, I ſhould in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, attain the ſame age. But as I was born with feeble ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ina, I ſhall not perhaps outlive an hundred. And this moral
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:025349_0116_0FCD021F00382AE8"/>
certainty of living to a great age, is to be ſure, a moſt pleaſing and deſirable attainment, and it is the prerogative of none but the temperate. For all thoſe who (by immoderate eating and drinking) fill their bodies with groſs humours, can have no reaſonable aſſurance of living a ſingle day longer: oppreſſed with food and ſwoln with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous humours, they are in continual danger of violent fits of the cholic, deadly ſtrokes of the apoplexy, fatal attacks of the cholera morbus, burning fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and many ſuch acute and violent diſeaſes, whereby thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands are carried to their graves, who a few hours before, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very hale and hearty. And this moral certainty of long life
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:025349_0117_0FCD02218BBE9398"/>
is built on ſuch good grounds, as ſeldom ever fail. For, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpeaking, Almighty GOD ſeems to have ſettled his works on the ſure grounds of natural cauſes, and temperance is (by divine appointment) the natural cauſe of health and long life. Hence it is next to impoſſible, that he who leads a ſtrictly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate life, ſhould breed any ſickneſs or die of an unnatural death, before he attains to the years to which the natural ſtrength of his conſtitution was to arrive. I know ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are ſo weak as to excuſe their wicked intemperance, by ſaying, that "the race is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to the ſwift, nor the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the ſtrong," and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let them eat and drink as
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:025349_0118_0FCD022389101950"/>
they pleaſe, they ſhall not die till their time comes. How ſcandalouſly do theſe men miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand Solomon and abuſe truth! How would it ſtartle us to hear our friends ſay, "that let them ſleep and play, as they pleaſe, they ſhall not be beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars till their time comes."</p>
               <p>Solomon does indeed ſay that "the race is not always to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong;" but he muſt be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a madman, who thence infers, that it is not <hi>generally</hi> ſo. For the invariable and eternal experience of mankind demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, that ninety nine time in an hundred, the race is to the ſwift and the battle to the ſtrong, bread to the induſtrious, and health to the temperate.</p>

But it is a matter of fact, and not to be denied, that, though temperance has the divine effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to ſecure us from violent diſeaſe and unnatural death, yet it is not to be ſuppoſed to make a man immortal. It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but that time, which effaces all things, ſhould likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy that moſt curious work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of GOD, the human body: but it is man's privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege to end his days by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral death, that is, without pain and agony, as they will ſee me, when the heat and ſtrength of nature is quite exhauſted. But I promiſe myſelf, that day is a pretty comfortable diſtance off yet, and I fancy I am not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, becauſe I am ſtill healthy and briſk, reliſh all I eat, ſleep

quietly, and find no defect in any of my ſenſes. Beſides, all the faculties of my mind are in the higheſt perfection; my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding clear and bright as ever; my judgment ſound; my memory tenacious; my ſpirits good; and my voice, the firſt thing that fails others, ſtill ſo ſtrong and ſonorous, that every morning and evening, with my dear grand children around me. I can addreſs my prayers and chant the praiſes of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. O, how glorious this life of mine is like to be, replete with all the felicities which man can enjoy on this ſide of the grave; and exempt from that ſenſual brutality which age has enabled my better reaſon to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and therewith all its bitter
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:025349_0121_0FCD02297B0F00D8"/>
fruits, the extravagant paſſions and diſtreſsful perturbations of mind. Nor yet can the fears of death find room in my mind, as I have no licenſed ſins to cheriſh ſuch gloomy thoughts: neither can the death of relations and friends give me any other grief than that of the firſt move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of nature, which cannot be avoided, but is of no long continuance. Still leſs am I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be caſt down by the loſs of worldly goods. I look on theſe things as the property of heaven; I can thank him for the loan of ſo many comforts, and when his wiſdom ſees fit to withdraw them, I can look on their departure without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring.—This is the happineſs of thoſe only, who grow old in
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:025349_0122_0FCD022B52DB7808"/>
the ways of temperance and virtue; a happineſs which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom attends the moſt flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing youth who live in vice. Such are all ſubject to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand diſorders, both of body and mind, from which I am entirely free: on the contrary; I enjoy a thouſand pleaſures, which are as pure as they are calm.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe is to do ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to my country. O! what a glorious amuſement, in which I find infinite delight, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my countrymen how to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify this our dear city of Venice, in ſo excellent a manner, as to make her a famous republic, a rich and matchleſs city. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amuſement of mine is that of ſhewing this maid and queen of cities, in what manner ſhe
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:025349_0123_0FCD022CB6CA2750"/>
may always abound with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, by manuring untilled lands, draining marſhes, and laying under water and thereby fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ning fields, which had all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long been barren for want of moiſture. My third amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in ſhewing my native city, how, though already ſtrong, ſhe may be rendered much ſtronger; and, though extremely beautiful, may ſtill increaſe in beauty; though rich, may acquire more wealth, and may be made to enjoy better air, though her air is excellent. Theſe three amuſements, all ariſing from the idea of public utility, I enjoy in the higheſt degree. Another very great comfort I enjoy is, that having been defrauded when young, of
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:025349_0124_0FCD022E3353E098"/>
a conſiderable eſtate, I have made ample amends for that loſs, by dint of thought and induſtry, and without the leaſt wrong done to any perſon, have doubled my income, ſo that I am able not only to provide for my dear grand children, but to educate and aſſiſt many poor youth to begin the world. And I cannot help ſaying, I reflect with more pleaſure on what I lay out in that way, than in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other.</p>
               <p>Another very conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to my happineſs is, that what I have written from my own experience, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend <hi>temperance,</hi> has been of great uſe to numbers, who loudly proclaim their obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to me for that work, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

                  </gap>ich makes me look on myſelf as one of the happieſt of men, is, that I enjoy as it were, two ſorts of lives; the one terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, which I poſſeſs in fact; the other celeſtial, which I poſſeſs in thought; and this thought is attended with unutterable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, being founded on ſuch glorious objects, which I am morally ſure of obtaining, through the infinite goodneſs and mercy of GOD. Thus I enjoy this terreſtrial life, partly through the beneficent influences of temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and ſobriety, virtues ſo pleaſing to Heaven; and I enjoy, through cordial love of the ſame

divine Majeſty, the celeſtial life, by contemplating ſo often on the happineſs thereof, that I can hardly think of any thing elſe. And I hold, that dying in the manner I expect, is not really death, but a paſſage of the ſoul from this earthly life, to a celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, immortal, and infinitely perfect exiſtence. And I am ſo far charmed with the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous elevation to which I think my ſoul is deſigned, that I can no longer ſtoop <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> thoſe trifles, which, alas! charm and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuate too great a part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The proſpect of parting with my favourite enjoyments of this life, gives me but little concern; on the contrary, I thank GOD, I often think of it with ſecret joy, ſince by that
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:025349_0127_0FCD0233FA824968"/>
loſs I am to gain a life incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more happy.</p>
               <p>O! who then would be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, were he in my place? what good man, but muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly throw off his load of worldly ſorrow, and addreſs his grateful homage to the Author of all this happineſs? Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, there is not a man on earth, who may not hope for the like happineſs, if he would but live as I do. For indeed I am no angel, but only a man, a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of GOD, to whom a good and temperate life is ſo pleaſing, that even in this world he great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rewards thoſe who practiſe it.</p>
               <p>And whereas many embrace a holy and contemplative life, teaching and preaching the great truths of religion, which is
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:025349_0128_0FCD0235C4F24BE0"/>
                  <hi>highly</hi> commendable, the chief employment of ſuch being to lead men to the knowledge and worſhip of GOD. O that they would likewiſe betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves entirely to a regular and temperate life! They would then be conſidered as ſaints in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed upon earth, as thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive chriſtians were, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſo conſtant a temperance, and lived ſo long. By living like them, to the age of one hundred and twenty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they might make ſuch a proficiency in holineſs, and become ſo dear to GOD, as to do the greateſt honour and ſervice to the world; and they would beſides, enjoy conſtant health and ſpirits, and be always happy within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; whereas they are now
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:025349_0129_0FCD023807F3BC70"/>
too often infirm and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If indeed they are melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, becauſe they ſee GOD, (after all his goodneſs) ſo ungratefully requited; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee men (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their innumerable obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to love) yet hating and grieving each other: ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy is truly amiable and divine.</p>
               <p>But to be melancholy on any other account, is, to ſpeak the truth, quite unnatural in good chriſtians; ſuch perſons being the ſervants of GOD and heirs of immortality; and it is ſtill more unbecoming the miniſters of religion, who ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider themſelves, as of all others, in the moſt important, ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and delightful employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="unknown:025349_0130_0FCD02395A882510"/>
I know, many of theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen think that GOD does pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely bring theſe occaſions of melancholy on them, that they may in this life do penance for their former ſins; but therein, as I think, they are much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. I cannot conceive how GOD, who loves mankind, can be delighted with their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. He deſires that mankind ſhould be happy, both in this world and the next; he tells us ſo in a thouſand places in his word, and we actually find that there is not a man on earth, who does not feel the good Spirit of GOD, forbidding and condemning thoſe wicked tempers, which would rob him of that happineſs. No; it is the devil and ſin which bring all the evils we ſuffer, on
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:025349_0131_0FCD023BCAACC9C0"/>
our heads, and not God, who is our Creator and Father, and deſires our happineſs: his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands tend to no other purpoſe. And temperance would not be a virtue, if the benefit it does us by preſerving us from diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, were repugnant to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of GOD in our old age.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, if all religious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſtrictly temperate and holy, how beautiful, how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a ſcene ſhould we then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold! Such numbers of venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble old men as would create ſurpriſe. How many wiſe and holy teachers to edify the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by their wholeſome preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and good examples!

in GOD. This was the life led by the holy fathers of the deſart, who ſubſiſted entirely on wild fruits and roots, drinking nothing but pure water, and yet lived to an extreme old age, in good health and ſpirits, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways happy within themſelves. And ſo may all in our days live, provided they would but mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the luſts of a corruptible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and devote themſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the exalted ſervice of GOD; for this is indeed the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of every faithful chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an as Jeſus Chriſt left it, when he came down upon earth to ſhed his precious blood, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to deliver us from the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical ſervitude of the devil; and all through his immenſe goodneſs.</p>

                  <pb n="136" facs="unknown:025349_0134_0FCCDBB6942C1BB8"/>
To conclude, ſince length of days abounds with ſo many bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and I am ſo happy as to have arrived at that ſtate, I find myſelf bound (in charity) to give teſtimony in favour of it, and ſolemnly aſſure all mankind, that I really enjoy a great deal more than what I now mention; and that I have no other motive in writing on this ſubject, than to engage them to practiſe, all their lives, thoſe excellent vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of temperance and ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which will bring them, like me, to a happy old age. And therefore I never ceaſe to raiſe my voice, crying out to you, my friends, may your days be many, that you may long ſerve GOD, and be fitter for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which he prepares for his children!</p>

            <p>OF all the people on the face of the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans are under the greateſt obligations to live temperately. Formed for commerce, our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try abounds with bays, rivers, and creeks, the exhalations from which, give the air a dampneſs unfriendly to the ſprings of life. To counteract this infelicity of climate, reaſon teaches us to adopt every meaſure that may give tone and vigour to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:025349_0136_0FCD02440D4C5F88"/>
This precaution, at all times neceſſary, is peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo in autumn, for then the body is relaxed by the intenſe heat of the dog-days, the air is filled with noxious vapours from putrid vegetables; Nature her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wears a ſickly drooping aſpect; the moſt robuſt feel a diſagreeable wearineſs and ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their fleſh, a heavineſs and ſluggiſhneſs in motion, quick feveriſh fluſhings, and ſudden chills darting along their nerves, (all plain proofs of a ſickly atmoſphere, and tottering health.) Now, if ever we need the aid of all-invigorating tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, now keep the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach light and vigorous by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate feeding, the veins well ſtored with healthy blood, and
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:025349_0137_0FCD02453A5E5E18"/>
the nerves full braced by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe and comely chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Be choice of your diet, fruit perfectly ripe, vegetables thoroughly done, and meats of the eaſieſt digeſtion, with a glaſs or two of generous wine at each meal, and all taken in ſuch pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent moderation, as not to load but ſtrengthen the conſtitution. For at this critical juncture, a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle act of intemperance, which would ſcarcely be felt in the wholeſome froſts of winter, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en turns the ſcale againſt nature, and brings on obſtinate indigeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, load at ſtomach, loſs of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, a furred tongue, yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the eyes, bitter taſte in the mouth in the morning, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious vomitings, agues, fevers, &amp;c. which in ſpite of the beſt
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:025349_0138_0FCD0247377C5498"/>
medicines, often wear a man away to a ghoſt. If bleſſed with a good conſtitution, he <hi>may</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps crawl on to <hi>winter,</hi> and get braced up again by her friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly froſts; but if old or infirm, it is likely death will overtake him, before he can reach that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of refuge.</p>
            <p>"The giddy practice of throwing aſide our winter clothes too early in the ſpring, and that of expoſing our bodies, when overheated to ſudden cold, has deſtroyed more people, than fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, peſtilence and ſword<note n="*" place="bottom">I ſaw (ſays an American officer) thirteen grenadiers lying dead by a ſpring, in conſequence of drinking too freely of the cold water, while dripping with ſweat in a hard day's march, in ſummer.

Thoſe who, by any accident, have loſt a meal, (ſuppoſe their dinner) ought not to eat a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſupper; for if they do, it will lie heavy on their ſtomach, and they will have a more reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs night than if they had both dined and ſupped heartily.

He who has taken a larger quantity of food than uſual, and feels it heavy and troubleſome on his ſtomach, will, if he is a wiſe man, go out and puke it up immediately<note n="*" place="bottom">The wiſe ſon of Sirach confirms this procept, and ſays, Eccleſ. xxxi. 21. "If thou haſt been forced to eat, ariſe, go forth and puke, and thou ſhalt have reſt." And moſt certain it is, (adds an ingenious phyſician) that hundreds and thouſands have brought ſickneſs and death on themſelves, by their ignorance or neglect of this rule. But at the ſame time people ſhould carefully avoid a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of that exceſs, which renders ſuch an evacuation neceſſary, for frequent vomitings do greatly tend to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and deſtroy the tone of the ſtomach.</note>. <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I cannot omit men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning a very ruinous error in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which too many are fond of running, I mean, the frequent uſe of ſtrong vomits and purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. A man every now and

then feeds too freely on ſome favourite diſh; by ſuch exceſs the ſtomach is weakened, the body filled with ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and he preſently finds himſelf much out of ſorts. The only medicine in this caſe, is moderate exerciſe, innocent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement, and a little abſtinence, this is nature's own preſcription, as appears by her taking away his appetite. But having long placed his happineſs in eating and drinking, he cannot think of relinquiſhing a gratification ſo dear to him, and ſo ſets himſelf to force an appetite by drams, ſlings, elixir of vitriol, wine and bitters, pickles, ſauces, &amp;c. and on the credit of this artificial appetite, feeds again as if he poſſeſſed the moſt vigorous

health. He now finds himſelf <hi>entirely</hi> diſorderd, general hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs and wearineſs of body, flatulent uneaſineſs, frequent eructations, loſs of appetite, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed ſlumbers, frightful dreams, bitter taſte in the mouth, &amp;c. He now complains of a foul ſtomach, or (in his own words) that his ſtomach is full of bile; and immediately takes a doſe of tartar emetic or a ſtrong purgative, to cleanſe out his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and ſo prepare for another courſe of high living. Of all the Apollyons or deſtroyers of nerves, health and life, this is the greateſt; and I have no ſort of doubt on my own mind but it has broken down more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, brought on more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers and ſent more people to

an early grave, than all the vices of this bedlam world put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. How much wiſer would it be in this caſe to follow the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the celebrated Boerhaave, i. e. to uſe a little abſtinence, take moderate exerciſe, and thereby help nature to carry off her crudities and recover her ſprings. I have been often told by a lady of quality, whoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances obliged her to be a good oeconomiſt, and whoſe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and temperance preſerved her health and ſenſes unimpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a great age, that ſhe had kept herſelf out of the hands of the phyſicians many years by this ſimple regimen. People in health ſhould never force them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to eat when they have no appetite; Nature, the beſt judge
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:025349_0144_0FCD0255BAC44BD8"/>
in theſe matters, will never fail to let us know the proper time of refreſhment. To act contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to this rule, will aſſuredly weaken the powers of digeſtion, impair health and ſhorten life. <hi>Plutarch.</hi>

"The world has long made a juſt diſtinction betwixt men of learning, and wiſe men. Men of learning are oft-times the weakeſt of men: they read and meditate inceſſantly, without allowing proper relaxation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment to the body; and think that a frail machine can bear fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue as well as an immortal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. This puts me in mind of what happened to the camel in the fable; which, refuſing tho' often premoniſhed, to eaſe the ox in due time of a part of his load, was forced at laſt to carry not only the ox's whole load, but the ox himſelf alſo, when he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under his burden. Thus it
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:025349_0147_0FCD025B4EE5E378"/>
happens to the mind which has no compaſſion on the body, and will not liſten to its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, nor give it any reſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſome ſad diſtemper com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels the mind to lay ſtudy and contemplation aſide; and to lie down, with the afflicted body, upon the bed of languiſhing and pain. Moſt wiſely, therefore, does Plato admoniſh us to take the ſame care of our bodies as of our minds; that like a well matched pair of horſes to a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, each may draw his equal ſhare of weight. And when the <hi>mind</hi> is moſt intent upon vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and uſefulneſs, the <hi>body</hi> ſhould then be moſt cheriſhed by prudence and temperance, that ſo it may be fully equal to ſuch arduous and noble purſuits."—<hi>Plutarch.</hi>

Nothing is more injurious to health than hard ſtudy at night; it is inverting the order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ruining the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>All who are ſo wiſe as to riſe early, and ſpend the day in uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful induſtry, will, by the time night's ſable curtains are drawn, feel the need of that balmy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorative, <hi>ſleep.</hi> Now when na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is already exhauſted, and needs repoſe, to go to hard ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, what is it but to ſtrain the nerves, waſte the ſpirits, bring tireſome watchfulneſs, loſs of appetite and general diſorder? But moſt of all, is it not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to lie reading in bed by can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle light? for it not only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the uſual inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of night ſtudy, ſuch as

ſtraining the eyes, weakening the ſight, fatiguing the mind, and wearing away the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but is oft-times the cauſe of the ſaddeſt calamities; thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of elegant houſes, with all their coſtly furniture, have been reduced to aſhes by this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imprudent practice. I knew an amiable lady, who was not a little tried by this ill habit in one of her acquaintance. He would ſleep all the morning, play the truant all day, and at night no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would ſerve him, but he muſt read in bed till midnight, with a blazing candle all the time cloſe to the curtains. The thought of this, as <hi>well it might,</hi> would not allow the lady a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's reſt, nor a ſingle wink to the maid, who, poor thing! was
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:025349_0150_0FCD025EB5B275C0"/>
packed up ſtairs every quarter of an hour, to take a peep at the candle. I ſuppoſe it might take well nigh the <hi>whole</hi> of an <hi>angel's benevolence</hi> to keep up a twelve month intimacy with ſo danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and troubleſome a viſitant. But admitting this habit of night ſtudying and reading in bed, were attended with none of theſe alarming inconveniences; no wiſe man would indulge in it, for it is evident he would ſave no time, gain no pleaſure nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from it. For, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry certain <hi>we muſt ſleep,</hi> and the paternal hand of GOD draws o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us the ſhades of night for that purpoſe; and if we don't ſleep <hi>then,</hi> we muſt do it in the day, and is it not a thouſand times better to ſleep in the night, while
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:025349_0151_0FCD02604E675120"/>
darkneſs veils from our eyes all the beauties of creation, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome damps make it dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to ſtir out, than to ſnore in bed all the morning, when the cheerful light, the chirping birds, the fragrant air, and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening ſight of gay-green land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkips, together with the ſpirit-ſtirring voice of glorious toil, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite to health, to uſefulneſs, and pleaſure?</p>
            <p>But how can giddy youth, hurried on by ſtrong paſſions and appetites, be prevented from running into thoſe exceſſes, which may cut them off in the prime of their days, or at leaſt hoard up diſeaſes and remorſe for old age? Why, their paſſions and appetites muſt early be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by proper diſcipline

and example. This important office muſt be done by their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, whoſe firſt and greateſt care ſhould be "to train up their children in the way they ſhould go, that when they are old they may not depart from it."</p>
            <p>"O that parents (ſays the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Mr. Locke) would care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inſtill into their children that great principle of all virtue and worth, viz. nobly to deny themſelves every wrong deſire, and ſteadily follow what reaſon dictates as beſt, though the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite ſhould lean the other way. We often ſee parents by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring them when little, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the principles of virtue in their children; and wonder af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to taſte the bitter wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their undutifulneſs or

Youth is the golden ſeaſon to inure the mind to the practice of virtue, on which their future health and reſpectability depend, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it will be impoſſible to deliver their conſtitutions, unbroken, to manhood and old age.
