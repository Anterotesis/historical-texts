            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>STATE OF FACTS, RELATING TO THE GEORGIA LANDS.</head>
            <q>
               <p>UNDER the term of GEORGIA WESTERN TERRITORY is included all that part of the State of Georgia, which dies weſt of the head waters of thoſe rivers, which fall into the Atlantic ocean. Theſe lands are principally inhabited by three na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Indians, the Chactaws, the Chickaſaws, and the Creeks,—of which nations the following is a ſummary character.</p>
               <p>THE Chactaws, or flat-heads, are a powerful, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſubtle and intrepid race of Indians, who inhabit a very fine and extenſive tract of hilly country, with large and fertile plains intervening between the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abama and Miſſiſippi rivers. They have about 40 towns and villages, and 4000 fighting men.—They have large plantations or country farms, where they employ much of their time in agricultural improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, after the manner of white people.</p>
               <p>THE Chickaſaws are a nation of Indians, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit the country on the eaſt ſide of the Miſſiſippi, on the head branches of the Tombeckbe, Mobille and Yazoo rivers. Their country is an extenſive plain, tolerably well watered from ſprings, and of a pretty good ſoil. They have 7 towns, and their number of ſighting men is eſtimated at 575.</p>
               <p>THE Greeks inhabit the middle part of Georgia. They eminently deſerve the encomium of all nations for their wiſdom and virtue in expelling the uſe of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031830_0004_0FEEC77599304DA0"/>
                  <hi>ſpiritous liquors.</hi> The firſt and moſt cogent article in all their treaties with the white people, is, that there ſhall not be any kind of ſpiritous liquors ſold or brought into their towns.—Inſtances have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occurred, on the diſcovery of attempts to run kegs of ſpirits into the country, of the Indians ſtriking with their tomahawks thoſe who attempted it, and giving the liquor to the ſand, not taſting of it themſelves. It is difficult to account for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent policy in civil government: it cannot derive its efficacy from coercive laws; for they have no ſuch artificial ſyſtem. They have 55 towns, beſide many villages, and their fighting men are about 5800.—They are a well-made, expert, hardy, ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, politic people; extremely jealous of their rights, and <hi>averſe to parting with their lands.</hi> They have abundance of tame cattle and ſwine, turkies, ducks and other poultry. They cultivate tobacco, rice, Indian corn, potatoes, beans, peas, cabbage, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, and have a plenty of peaches, plumbs, grapes, ſtrawberries and other fruits. They are faithful friends, but inveterate enemies; hoſpitable to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and honeſt and fair in their dealings. <hi>No na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has a more contemptible opinion of the white men's faith in general, than theſe people: yet they place great confidence in the United States, and wiſh to agree with them upon a permanent boundary, over which the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern States ſhall not treſpaſs.</hi> The country which they claim, is bounded northward by about the 34th degree of latitude, and extends from the Tombeckbe or Mobille river to the Atlantic ocean (though they have ceded a part of this tract on the ſea coaſt, by different treaties, to the ſtate of Georgia.)</p>
               <p>OF this weſtern territory, thus inhabited, the ſtate of Georgia by act of their legiſlature, paſſed January 7th, 1795, ſold about twenty-two millions of acres, to four different companies—viz.</p>

ONE tract to James Gunn, Matthew M'Alliſter and George Walker, and their aſſociates, called, <hi>The Georgia Company.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ONE tract to Nicholas Long, Thomas Glaſscock, Ambroſe Gordon and Thomas Cummings, and their aſſociates, called, <hi>The Georgia Miſſiſippi Company.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ONE tract to John B. Scott, John C. Nightingale and Wade Hampton, called, <hi>The Upper Miſſiſippi Company.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ONE tract to Zechariah Coxe, Mathias Maher, and their aſſociates, called, <hi>The Teneſſee Company.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HALF a million of dollars was the purchaſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:—this, or the greateſt part of it, was ſecured by mortgages, which have been ſince cancelled.— But the ſtate of Georgia now reclaims theſe tracts of land, alledging that the act authorizing the ſale, is contrary to the 4th article of the conſtitution of the United States; repugnant to the 16th and 17th ſections of the 1ſt article of the conſtitution of Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia; and was moreover obtained by means of fraud, atrocious ſpeculation, corruption and colluſion.— Hence, by an act paſſed February 13th, 1796, the aforeſaid act of January 7th, 1795, was declared null and void, and the grants, rights and claims de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from it, annulled and rendered void and of no effect.</p>
            </q>
            <p>THUS far my ſtatement is probably correct, being moſtly taken from Doctor Morſe's American Gazet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer.</p>
            <p>BETWEEN the time of paſſing the granting act in January, 1795, and of paſſing the reſcinding act in February, 1796, a great portion of theſe lands were alienated by the Companies, and became the property of purchaſers in the middle and eaſtern ſtates. Theſe ſales were effected under the influence of a certain pamphlet, entitled, <q>
                  <hi>State of facts, ſhewing the right of certain companies to the lands, lately purchaſed by
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031830_0006_0FEEC781F40D0320"/>them from the ſtate of Georgia,</hi>
               </q> and under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of certain other means, which will be noticed in the courſe of theſe numbers.</p>
            <p>To ſave the inconvenience of frequent references and quotations in the following pages, it may be well to inform the reader, that relying on the ſtatement of facts, publiſhed by the Georgia companies, I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved (till after the reſcinding act) that the <hi>ſee</hi> of the lands ſold to the companies and by them to us, had been extinguiſhed by the ſtate of Georgia; but that the Indians had a right of hunting and fiſhing, which would in time be abdicated or eaſily purchaſed; as ſuch a kind of right had formerly exiſted in this colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and had been virtually recognized in the ſeveral treaties with different tribes. But after the reſcinding act, it appeared that the right of the ſtate of Georgia to the <hi>fee,</hi> was juſt ſuch a right as the ſtate of North Carolina had ſet up to Indian lands; but which had been negatived unanimouſly by a committee of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, conſiſting of a member from each of the ſtates. It alſo appeared that this ſetting up of a <hi>ſee</hi> was point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly oppoſed to the uniform policy of the United States, to the uniform declarations of Congreſs, and to the treaty with the Creek nation, concluded Auguſt 7th, 1790.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>fee</hi> which was the ſubſtance of all theſe ſales had failed entirely and did not exiſt, and as much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney had been paid, and many notes been given, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came important to enquire whether the right of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption was worth any thing.—On enquiry it appeared that the ſtate of Georgia had a very <hi>queſtionable right</hi> to purchaſe lands (of three Indian tribes, who had no diſpoſition to ſell them) whenever Congreſs, (who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the exiſtence of this right) ſhould grant them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to hold a treaty. The Maſſachuſetts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut rights of preemption were undiſputed, and they contemplated lands, which the policy of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031830_0007_0FEEC789502D8290"/>States would juſtify them in purchaſing, and which the right owners were diſpoſed to ſell; but the numbers, characters and ſituation of theſe three na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, combined with the policy of the United States, preſented a very powerful contraſt in theſe Georgia lands. Impreſſed with theſe ideas, it occurred to me, that if the Creek nation had ſold to Long, Glaſscock and others, their right of preemption to the ſtate of Georgia, or the ſtate of Connecticut, I ſhould as readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been an aſſignee of the claim, as with a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of facts, have been a purchaſer under the Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia companies.</p>
            <p>BUT the reſcinding act led up ſome ideas about fraud, atrocious ſpeculation, corruption and colluſion, practiſed on the legiſlature, which led me to conſider whether ſome ſuch practices had not been adopted at the northward as well as the ſouthward; and on en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, it appeared that ſome of the agents of the Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia companies had conducted honorably—and have not any intention of profits in this unfortunate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive buſineſs:—but that others had eminently ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the characters of fraud and deceit in ſelling, which they had acquired in purchaſing.</p>
            <p>FROM theſe premiſes it appeared to me that men who take money or notes for that which proves to be nothing, eſpecially under the above circumſtances, ought to refund.—And this ſentiment, if true, will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in favor of all, thro' whoſe hands theſe lands have paſſed, back to the members of the firſt compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; and the reſcinding act has recognized this ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by providing that the firſt companies may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive back the money paid, and no one can oppoſe the operation of it, but thoſe who are watching to make fortunes out of the nothingneſs of this Georgia buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and this number I hope (for the honor of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity) is very ſmall.</p>
            <p>REPEATED diſcloſure of theſe opinions has led me
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031830_0008_0FEEC78AF3690E78"/>to hear much logic and law-learning upon this ſubject —much cenſure upon the ſtate of Georgia—many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon what the legiſlature might, could, or ought to have done.—But though my attention has been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſuſpended by the eloquence of great and learned men, on the ſubject; yet no one has convinced me that the <hi>right of the ſtate of Georgia to buy land</hi> of the Creeks, Chickaſaws and Chactaws was ever worth a farthing.—No one has convinced me that the ſtate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had ſuch right.—No one has proved that the fee of lands, and a right to buy the fee, are the ſame thing. Amidſt the variety of opinions and the indefinite ſtate of this buſineſs, I have ventured to throw out the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcuſſion, as the reſult of my own conviction; and have ſubſcribed it for the expreſs purpoſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding that confuſion, which often reſults from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous publications.</p>

            <p>THE State of Georgia claimed a right in fee to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain lands,—which lands were in fact ſubject to an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute fee-ſimple, in the right owners,—and ſaid ſtate acknowledged this fee, ſubject to a particular kind of uſufruct—which uſufruct was the abſolute undiſputed dominion and poſſeſſion of theſe owners, with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, inherent and interminable right of doing with it as they pleaſed, without any hindrance or moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from this claimant:—and this fee, dominion and poſſeſſion of the right owners, guaranteed by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, and ſecured by ſevere laws from all fraud and force on the part of the preemptors:—and to crown all, this ſame preemption claimed over the heads of this ſame ſtate of Georgia by the United States, who have an uncontrolable right to decide by judicial offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031830_0010_0FEEC78F65335890"/>of their own creation on the right of preemption: —and again, this uſurped preemption of the ſtate of Georgia, ſecured from invaſion by their own conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and poſitive laws, and guarded againſt fraud and deceit by all thoſe general maxims which obtain and are recognized in all ſovereign ſtates.</p>
            <p>THE mind of man can proceed but one ſtep further, and yet retain one idea of lands or claims; and this ſtep is preſented in the kind of right, which the Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia companies claim to theſe lands. By the force of fraud and corruption (as I ſhall ſhew hereafter) they have broken through all the barriers, which ſo perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecured the fee and poſſeſſion of the right owners— and after obtaining the ſemblance of a granting act, came forward, and by a printed pamphlet, entitled, <hi>"State of Facts,"</hi> &amp;c. declared to all the world, that they were the true and lawful aſſignees of the <hi>fee</hi> of thoſe lands, and to all the uſes of it, except a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar kind of uſufruct, called a right of hunting and fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Indians. Not one of the attributes of their claim was of neceſſity a matter of record; and the land could not from its ſituation promiſe to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer under them an office of record, where he might reſort for evidence of title;—therefore every thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a ſale muſt be from the ſeller, and in all ſuch caſes, <hi>let the ſeller look out, that he deceive not the buyer.</hi> 'Tis a maxim of common ſenſe and reaſon, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever inducements the ſeller improves to draw money from the buyer he ſhall make true, or ſuffer the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of their proving falſe; for if he has tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en money for his own falſhoods, he ought to reſund it, whenever equity and good conſcience demand it.— And if this rule is not in the books, it ought to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced there, by the ſide of <hi>caveat emptor.</hi> Both parties are to look out; all men are to look out; <hi>but courts are eſpecially to look out, and ſee that men get no gain by cheating their neighbours;</hi>—and if in every caſe they
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031830_0011_0FEEC7924E7DB780"/>cannot find a precedent for doing right, let them, as Lord Hardwicke did, make a precedent.</p>
            <p>THE frauds practiſed in the negociation and ſales of theſe Georgia lands, have been as numerous and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated as the heart of man could conceive; and the property now reſting for deciſion of the courts in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of them, is to an immenſe amount. The reſcinding act of the ſtate of Georgia has brought all theſe matters to a criſis, and one deciſion of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme court of the United States, may probably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the deciſions of lower courts. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proceed to diſcuſs,—1ſt. the validity of this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinding act—2d. the impoſſibility of affecting it by any court or power in the United States—and 3d. the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence upon all the notes depending on the ſales un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the granting act.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE validity of the reſcinding act depends on the power which paſſed it.—This is the ſovereign indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſtate of Georgia, having a right to make or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal their own laws at pleaſure, and this right wholly uncontrolable. When individuals deal with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there are courts to compel compliance with their contracts:—how far the policy of the United States will ſuſtain a citizen in a diſpute againſt a ſtate, for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies due on ſtate notes, or otherwiſe acknowledged; and whether a marſhall may ſafely commit to priſon the governor, treaſurer or ſecretary of the ſtate for a ſtate debt, is beſide my preſent object. This was a grant ſaid to be ſtanding on records, whereof the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature had the control. Theſe records do not now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt;—they are burnt, and the reaſons are aſſigned on new records for deſtroying the ſame. I aſk, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy have the Georgia companies? They cannot bring a writ of ejectment; for none but the Indians are in poſſeſſion.—They cannot ſue for the lands, but in the ſtate where the lands lie;—and whatever court tries the cauſe, muſt try it by the exiſting laws of the ſtate
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031830_0012_0FEEC796A8C63798"/>of Georgia; and no law exiſts in favor of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.—Copies of record will not anſwer: if they would, a ſecretary might certify what on trial would eject all the people of a ſtate from every foot of their land. The exiſting laws muſt be ſuch as are recognized by the people, legally repreſented; and the legal repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives muſt have a right to declare their ſenſe of the laws.</p>
            <p>IN various caſes a legiſlature may declare a pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed act void—as whenever 'tis contrary to conſtitution —as where a leſs number was preſent at paſſing it, than is required to form a houſe—or where the ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or preſident of the council was bribed to declare that a vote, which was not a vote; or where the voters in favor of an act were intereſted in the paſſing of it; or where it was paſſed by members not having taken the neceſſary oaths; and in all caſes, where fraud and deceit are combined between thoſe who compoſe the legiſlature, and thoſe who are to be benefited by any particular act. Take this power from a legiſlature, and where is the ſovereignty of the ſtate?—Such a powerleſs ſtate would be left open to the ravages of all the unprincipled men in the univerſe, and their prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty and rights might be bartered for bribes. All contracts with ſovereign ſtates muſt be made in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that power and integrity will be united; and he who approaches a ſovereign people for grants, muſt do it with clean hands. The maxims of honor and honeſty, which form a part of the policy of all enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened ſovereignties, are a ſufficient guarantee to thoſe who deal uprightly with governments. Let thoſe who maintain a different doctrine, go proſecute the nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al aſſembly of France to make good their aſſignats, or the United States for their continental bills.—Where is the power to try the cauſe?—Or let ſuch point out the power, which can control the ſtate of Georgia in the enaction of their laws, or the management of their
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031830_0013_0FEEC7982DC139F0"/>records. Can the congreſs of the United States do it? Certainly no:—this would deſtroy the confederation. Can the court of the United States? Clearly they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge what laws ought to exiſt.</p>
            <p>ALL the arguments of the oppoſers to the reſcind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing act would be more plauſible, if they had in view real eſtate in ſee and poſſeſſion; and had honeſtly paid a fair conſideration for it.—In ſuch a caſe the law might ſtretch its force to obtain them juſtice; but this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unſubſtantial thing the law cannot reach it, and could not do it, even if the queſtion was between two individuals. As in caſe A owns a large farm, divided into 16 lots, and has a right to keep it and uſe it as long as he lives, and then to leave it to his heirs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, B, C, D, and ſo on, to the number of 16; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that competition of buyers raiſes the value of ſarms, and diſpoſed for their own advantage to deprive A of this benefit, agree among them that B ſhall alone bid on lot No. 1, C on No. 2, ſo that A may ſell to no other.—B ſells his right of preemption in lot No. 1 to S for 10 dollars—S ſells it to T for 100—T to U for 1000. Now B declares that he was cheated out of it, —that he never delivered the deed, &amp;c. and that he holds himſelf a bidder for the land as much as ever. A is ſtill in poſſeſſion, and likely ſo to continue. Can U ſuſtain an action againſt B? All men will agree that B has done U no damage, and U has gained nothing by his money; but U has given his notes to T, and they are put in ſuit.—He petitions for relief, ſtating that T pretended that he owned the ſee, and that it was the moſt valuable part of the farm; and that this was his inducement to give 1000 dollars: that there were no records to reſort to, and that he relied ſolely on T's word. T owns it all—and that in fact <hi>he did not own the land, but had a right to buy it.</hi> Will a court doubt what equity and good conſcience demand in this caſe?—To apply this, the land in queſtion is merely a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031830_0014_0FEEC799B37B0420"/>right to buy land, which perhaps may never be for ſale; which conſideration alone, ſeparate from the doctrine of ſtate ſovereignty, is an invincible intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſtate of Georgia, and the northern pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers.</p>
            <p>SOME ſay they may reſtore the records. Am I to lie out of my money for an age, waiting to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſovereign ſtate of Georgia will pity me for having been cheated by thoſe who cheated her? But ſay others, ſhe may grant it to another company, and then we may try the title. Perhaps ages may paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſovereign ſtate will grant it again, and then neither of us can try the title to the lands, 'till the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian title is extinguiſhed.—That can't be done, but by liberty to hold a treaty; and this liberty cannot be granted to thoſe whom the ſtate of Georgia denies as her grantees, without violating her ſovereignty; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by a ſuit at law the title ſhould be determined;— and this title can never be made a law queſtion, 'till the fee and poſſeſſion of the right owners is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. Suppoſe a ſuit brought for the preemption, what marſhall could levy the execution?—on what could he levy it? Whatever might be the judgment, it would be an idle one, founded on nothing, and no one could carry it into effect.</p>
            <p>OTHERS ſay we have fairly bought it, <hi>and will have it</hi>—and under this grant, reſcinded and burnt, negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations are now making on the Miſſiſippi lands. Vain new editions of Miſſiſippi dreams! Such managers might as well have uſed force without a grant; but when ſorce is uſed, the reign of law and argument has ceaſed.</p>
            <p>THOSE who have not cheated nor been cheated in this buſineſs, feel diſpaſſionate; they utter no depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations againſt Jackſon and his party, but calmly view the ſtate of Georgia, exerciſing a ſovereign right in a ſovereign and righteous manner. A great claſs of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031830_0015_0FEEC79F6AE71FB0"/>people comfort themſelves with a hope of trying the queſtion in the federal court, in ſome one of the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern ſtates, whether the reſcinding act is valid. As well might you try it before a juſtice's court: the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of both would be equally powerleſs. Can you put at iſſue in a diſtant ſtate the ſovereignty of Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia? Can you obtain judgment that her legiſlature has been diſtracted; and what will you do with your execution? All the propoſitions which have been made to render the reſcinding act of no validity are equally unpromiſing, as to the preſent claimants under the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting act.—All common-law principles attempted to be applied to the ſubject are loſt; and the greateſt lawyer is as the weakeſt peaſant, when attempting to diſcuſs it. As preemptive claims were never founded on law or right, they are not a ſubject of law-books; as they are peculiar to this country, they are not underſtood elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; and as no caſes ſuch as that of the reſcinding act have ever before occurred, we are not to wonder, that men ſhould be confounded at the operation of it.</p>
            <p>BUT take the nature of their claims, as it is explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—the rule of equity, which applies to the transfer of them—the ſovereignty of the ſtate—the reſcinding of the act—the impracticability of trying the legality or equity of it, and it will fairly appear that <hi>the preſent purchaſers have nothing, and have no proſpect of any thing for their money or their notes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2d. THESE things being true, what is the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence upon the notes, depending on the ſales under the granting act? My anſwer is, that they ought not to be paid. What ſorms the courts may think proper to adopt in rendering them void is not material. If it be once aſcertained that they ought to be void, courts will adopt or invent means proper for the end.</p>
            <p>I BEGIN then by taking the three following poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—1ſt. <hi>That where a man has been deceived in a contract, and in conſequence has deceived another, he ſhall
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031830_0016_0FEEC7A6AED99F30"/>gain nothing by the transfer: if he eſcape without loſs, it is the moſt he can deſire.</hi>—2d. <hi>If he know of the deceit practiſed on him previous to his ſelling, and yet made uſe of the deceit to induce a bargain, the leaſt he can expect is the total loſs of the price agreed on.</hi>—3d. <hi>If he were a partaker in the original deceit, he ought to loſe the whole and be ſeverely puniſhed.</hi> All the ſellers of Georgia land have been within theſe claſſes; for there was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit at the bottom;—and the many inſidious arts prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by many of the ſellers, give good reaſon to believe that they were the <hi>original</hi> deceivers.</p>
            <p>THE whole tranſaction has all the air and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a deep-laid and thoroughly executed plan of ſwindling.—The management of it proves that in the plan ſome ſouthern people were to be gainers, and a great number of the northern people to be loſers. I venture to predict, that ſome ſouthern people will be bankrupts, and that the northern people will, after much vexation and delay, eſcape from loſs. The reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinding act has ſtruck a deadly blow at theſe firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, and has arreſted their career at the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when they were about to be loaded with wealth.</p>
            <p>IN this preciſe ſtage of the buſineſs, the granting act being reſcinded—the preemption reſumed—no fee of lands in exiſtence—the ſellers greedy for payment, crouding for it at the bar of our courts—hoſts of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers in their pay, on great wages—notes all in ſuit, and petitions for relief pending:—What can our courts do? I anſwer, they are courts of law and equity, and are inſtituted for the purpoſe of doing right between man and man; and this they are to do as far as may be, according to the principles and practice of law and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in the books. I think it has been ſhewn abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, that this caſe could not have been contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the books;—it will follow then that this muſt form the baſis of a precedent, and muſt be determined on its own merits.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:031830_0017_0FEEC7AB16065DE0"/>
THE firſt natural enquiry of the courts therefore, is—the character of the parties and their reſpective claims on the juſtice or equity of the law.—Not their private character; but that which they wear in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this new and unprecedented cauſe. The plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs in theſe cauſes when aſked this queſtion may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwer—"We are of thoſe, who contrived and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded with ſeveral members of the legiſlature of the ſtate of Georgia, to procure an act, violating their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and alienating the property of the people.— By promiſes of gain, by bribes, we led them to violate their oaths and thoſe principles of honor and fidelity to their conſtituents, which all laws command them to maintain.—We ſucceeded in our plan—procured a grant—we publiſhed not ſingle pages, but pamphlets of lies—circulated them with our own hands—ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported them by our own affirmations—ſwore to them on our honor.—We thus enliſted men of integrity on our ſide—cauſed them to betray their neighbours— opened ſubſcriptions for the land—headed with names of men, whoſe permiſſion had never been obtained.— We entrapped the unwary—committed heads of fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies for more than they were worth—pretended that we were ſelling under the influence of embarraſſment, for leſs than half what we might get, had we time to ſeek purchaſers.—We haſtened our bargains, leſt the reſcinding act ſhould overtake us;—and to crown all, after we knew the act was paſſed, we employed emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries from Philadelphia to ride expreſs to complete bargains already projected, and to open contracts at all hazards;—and when all this was known, we curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Jackſon and his party, in the language of fallen Lucifer to Michael.—We then ſecretly employed law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers to write treatiſes againſt the reſcinding act, as their <hi>voluntaries,</hi> upon ſuch an unprincipled meaſure. —We circulated theſe to convince the dupes of our management, that Jackſon was an enemy to fair deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031830_0018_0FEEC7AE1EF56E28"/>and that the ſovereign ſtate of Georgia was a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable ſubjected province, whoſe laws wanted no other confutation than our contempt:—but when conviction begun to operate on the public mind, and even on our own, that this reſcinding act was ſerious and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,—we employed hoſts of lawyers, with enormous fees, to abet our cauſe;—and by their combined influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the aid of law-books, we hope to bear all before us. Tho' we knew that the men whom we had deceived, retained only the miſerable ſhadows of land, which we pretended to ſell them, and were willing to give up their deeds, and to ſuffer loſs for their delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion—we haughtily refuſed; and to ſhew our power, loaded them with attachments—put them to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of expenſe, and are determined that wide-ſpread ruin and deſolation ſhall follow thoſe who have dealt with us,—for which object we approach the altar of juſtice, and pray the aid of this honorable court to carry our purpoſes into effect.—And if the court doubt this our character, we refer them to the reſcinding act, containing 64 depoſitions in proof of it—to our pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, and to our uniform conduct." To which cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, well may the court ſay—Hail Lucifer, ſon of the morning!</p>
            <p>THE other characters are plainly thoſe, who have been the ſubjects of all this deceit, impoſture, falſhood and vexation; and who come before the court to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain relief againſt a ſyſtem of fraud and ſwindling— perhaps more complicated in its machinery, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its operations, than any which has diſgraced the character of man in this or any other age.</p>
            <p>I HAVE put language into the mouths of the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs, which they would not be apt to uſe—<hi>for 'tis the language of truth,</hi>—not ſancied, but thorougly prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and with all the varniſhes and apologies, which this age of reaſon, refinement and revolutions, can put upon their conduct, the reſult of a fair inveſtigation
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031830_0019_0FEEC7B140F23000"/>will produce juſt ſuch a concluſion.—To overdraw the character, or diſtort the cauſe in this ſtage of it, would be a prejudice to the end which is aimed at. I have therefore preſented them as they muſt appear, when record, evidence and ſubſtantial teſtimony ſhall be combined in the proof;—which will infallibly take place before the concluſion of this buſineſs. Let not thoſe judge chimerical, this mode of introducing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, who have obſerved in courts of chancery ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing brought ſorward, which forms the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the parties, in direct relation to the cauſe in queſtion.—This is always admitted, and no more is contended.</p>
            <p>THE ſecond queſtion to the plaintiffs, is—"What claim have you upon the juſtice or equity of this court?"—The anſwer muſt be—"We have notes for our Georgia deeds, and we pray the power of the court to enforce the collection of them." The queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the defendants, is—"Did you ſign and deliver thoſe notes?—are they your act and deed?"—The anſwer is—"We did ſign and deliver the notes; but they are not our act and deed?" At this inſtant books, authorities, precedents all croud in favor of the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs: and a court poſſeſſed of full power to make a precedent of right, is to be ſtormed out of all delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. But is every note, ſigned and delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditionally, the act and deed of the ſigner?—ſuppoſe he is unable to read, and the note is read to him as for £.100, and it really is for £.1000, and can be ſo proved, and that the obligee read it to him wrong,— is that his act and deed?—Again, ſuppoſe that he reads a note himſelf, and by ſhuffling of the obligee, another is placed for him to ſign, and he deliver the laſt,—is that his act and deed?—Or if he ſigned and delivered it with a piſtol at his breaſt:—Are ſuch notes the act and deed of thoſe who deliver them?—Every one will agree no. Then there are caſes where a note may be
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031830_0020_0FEEC7B5DBEFDEE8"/>ſigned and delivered unconditionally, and yet not be the act and deed of the ſigners.—Pray is there any difference between ſlight of hand and ſlight of head? Or ſhall he who reads a note wrong, and he who tells 100 lies to obtain it, ſtand on a different footing?— Reaſon and common ſenſe ſay no. The books may be very nice about the mode in which the injured ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhall get rid of the payment; but they will never ſupport a malefactor in recovering notes under theſe circumſtances.</p>
            <p>COURTS will not decide againſt notes upon mere ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſton of fraud: It muſt be made evident. In theſe caſes, various are the kinds and degrees of evidence; but when once it can be ſhewn, that the plaintiff is one of the horde, or allied to thoſe men who overrun theſe northern ſtates with their Georgia ſcrip or deeds, and that the conſideration of the notes has wholly fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—the preſumption becomes violent, that theſe frauds have attended the ſales; and that ſmall portion of light and evidence, which almoſt every individual purchaſer can produce, will be ſufficient to bring every caſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the general principles and deciſions, which muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in all the Georgia cauſes.</p>
            <p>OUR courts and juries, if driven to peremptory law deciſions, will decide that theſe notes are not the act and deed of the makers and deliverers of them. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine Georgia ſpeculators, who feel not the indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and contempt which follows their enveloped frauds, may, under the pupilage of their lawyers, be taught to hope better things:—But let them remember, that great cauſes draw forth the energy of man; and that on cauſes of ſuch magnitude, courts will do right. Haſte, negligence, confinement to nice conſtructions, ſometimes thwart the courſe of juſtice, in ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes; <hi>but here no recovery can eventually be had, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it ſhall appear eventually right, that men ſhall gain wealth by their own wrong.</hi> I have here taken the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031830_0021_0FEEC7B8CF2A6E58"/>worſt iſſue which the cauſes can poſſibly be brought to; and if courts and juries will not, under the old eſtabliſhment, determine againſt the notes, yet when the ſellers knew they had no right in fee, and when it appears by the event, that by reaſon of their own fraud they had no right at all,—courts and juries will deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine againſt the notes, whatever innovation it may produce. Probably a deciſion that theſe notes are not the act and deed of the makers of them, upon the ground that they were obtained by the groſſeſt deceit of the obligee, would form a new precedent: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baſed on right, it could never prejudice right in any future deciſions. The danger of new precedents is, that the perverſeneſs or ignorance of man may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them where they ought not to be applied; but this danger, however great and often inculcated, has never intimidated the independent judges in Weſtminſter-Hall from doing right, and making precedents where juſtice required them.</p>
            <p>THESE remarks may apply to negotiable notes—to Miſſiſippi ſcript—to quit-claim deeds—and to all the variety of caſes under theſe Georgia contracts.—For if my premiſes are right reſpecting the original fraud, and the total loſs of the lands, or the preemptive right in the purchaſers,—the concluſion will extend to ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery note and contract, iſſuing from ſuch a corrupt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>
            <p>THE caſe in reſpect to the northern purchaſers, is preciſely as if the firſt grantees had forged the grant: For, a grant voidable becauſe of fraud and corruption, is no better nor worſe, than a forged one;—and the original actors in this fraud, and all their abettors, confederates and acceſſories, are every way as <hi>baſely guilty</hi> as if they had forged the act.—The guilt as reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects the ſtate of Georgia is the ſame; and the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition on the purchaſers is certainly as great and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious. I call moſt of thoſe their confederates who
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031830_0022_0FEEC7BACA1A2A98"/>came from the midſt of them, with their pamphlets and miſrepreſentations:—and even they, who were themſelves deceived, and who deceived their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and are now preſſing for great profits to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, deſerve an high rank in this brigade of impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. I ſhould not aſſert thus poſitively on this ſubject, were I unable to bottom myſelf on the moſt ſubſſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial proofs;—and no individuals can be wounded by ſuch obloquies, but thoſe whoſe known conduct has fully juſtified them.</p>
            <p>THESE remarks were not deſigned to <hi>add</hi> any odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um to the fraudulent ſellers of Georgia land; but to lead the minds of the purchaſers, who have given their notes, to reflect <hi>on the whole Georgia buſineſs as a ſys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of impoſture and ſwindling—on the reſcinding act as valid and concluſive—and on the power and diſpoſition of our courts to do ample juſtice on the ſubject.</hi> If the hints ſuggeſted will lead to a new train of inveſtigation, they will anſwer the purpoſe for which they were written.</p>
            <p>NOTE.—The compaſs which I have taken would not admit refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to documents: and the preſent ſtage of the buſineſs ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it improper to diſcuſs very minutely how the notes may be avoided:—But thoſe who hold deeds of Georgia land ought to be thoroughly convinced, that all the lands now claimed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the uſurped act, are not worth one cent; and a pretence that the reſcinding act is void, is a miſerable deluſion.</p>

            <head type="sub">No. II.</head>
            <p>FROM the premiſes in my firſt number, I open this with the following queſtions, and anſwers:—</p>
            <p n="1">1. DID the ſtate of Georgia ever own the right in fee to the lands deſcribed in the granting act?—An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer—No.</p>
            <p n="2">2. DID not the pretended claimants under the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting act publiſh and circulate a pamphlet, entitled,— "STATE OF FACTS,"—declaring the right of the ſtate to have been a right in fee, and the ſale of the ſtate to have been fair and conſtitutional?—Anſwer—They did.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WAS there any truth in theſe declarations?— Anſwer—No.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WAS it not generally repreſented to the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers in theſe northern ſtates, verbally as well as by ſaid pamphlets, that the ſtate of Georgia would not, and could not, reſcind ſaid grant?—Anſwer—It was.</p>
            <p n="5">5. WAS there any truth in this repreſentation?— Anſwer—No.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Is not the grant reſcinded in ſuch manner, that the purchaſers are wholly forecloſed of all poſſible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſit from their purchaſes, 'till the ſame ſovereign will and power which reſcinded the act, ſhall be united to reſtore it?—Anſwer—Yes.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Is there any probability that they will ever vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untarily do this?—Anſwer—Not the leaſt.</p>
            <p n="8">8. CAN they be compelled to do it by any court or power in the United States?—Anſwer—No.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:031830_0024_0FEEC7C3CAE89658"/>
9. HAS not the ſtate of Georgia by their reſcinding act, put at great hazard the property, limbs and life of any man or body of men, who within the limits of ſaid ſtate ſhall in any way attempt to contravene ſaid act, or any clauſe of it?—Anſwer—Yes.</p>
            <p n="10">10. HAVE they not a ſovereign right to make ſuch laws as they judge proper for the well ordering of the ſtate?—Anſwer—They have.</p>
            <p n="11">11. IF the declarations of the ſellers and of their pamphlets had been true, would not the purchaſes have been profitable to the purchaſers?—Anſwer—They probably would.</p>
            <p n="12">12. FALSHOOD having been ſubſtituted in the place of truth, and the purchaſers having relied on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of the ſellers, and thoſe declarations having proved uniformly deceitful—ſhall it be in the mouth of the ſellers to ſay to the purchaſers—"You ought to have looked out that we did not cheat you?"—An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer—No.</p>
            <p>IF any perſon is diſpoſed to give a different anſwer to any of theſe queſtions, the queſtion and anſwer ſhall be made the ſubject of a ſeparate diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p>SEVERAL powerful deluſions have been improved to crown the firſt deluſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. THAT a grant is in its nature irreverſible.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. THAT provided the purchaſers will ever have any claim on the ſellers, they muſt firſt try the title which they have acquired; and if that fails, then they may come upon the ſellers.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. THAT theſe lands were purchaſed as lottery tickets are, and if they had turned out fortunately, it would have been well with the purchaſers: otherwiſe they muſt bear the loſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. THAT all the book-principles relating to real eſtate and to notes are in favor of the ſellers, and that conteſting the payment will be vain.</p>
            <p n="5">5th. THAT our courts will decide againſt the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinding
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031830_0025_0FEEC7C9B11FD9F8"/>act, and then the lands may be ſold in Europe, for a dollar per acre.</p>
            <p n="6">6th. THAT the reſcinding act was made in the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of the people, and that there is good chance of its being repealed, and the grant reſtored.</p>
            <p n="7">7th. THAT if this reſcinding act is good, the ſtate of Connecticut may reſcind the act granting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and Maſſachuſetts their act granting the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſee country.</p>
            <p>BY ſuch chimeras, the advocates of the ſales are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing themſelves to the hopes and fears, to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and to the weakneſs of the purchaſers; and are thus endeavoring to wheedle them out of further pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But be not deceived;—for this irreverſible grant is actually reverſed, beyond the power of man; and all the compariſons between the ſovereign ſtate of Georgia, granting their lands, and the province of New-Hampſhire, then ſubject to Great-Britain, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their lands, will be found vain. The diſtinction muſt be ſuſtained, that a dependant power has a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er above them, to compel them to make good their grants and contracts; and that <hi>an independent power can make, or unmake grants at will; becauſe no power can decide on the morality, equity, or policy of their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</hi> If the granting act had been conſtitutional, fair and honorable, and the reſcinding act ever ſo unfair and immoral,—yet the conſequence to the purchaſers would be equally fatal. The power which has depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them of the lands, is beyond their control; and all the advocates in favour of the ſellers, never have and never can ſuggeſt one practicable mode of even beginning to attack the validity of the reſcinding act. —That of deciding againſt it in theſe northern ſtates, has been already ſhewn to be futile. Some have been diſpoſed to maintain, that if the firſt act could be void at all, it muſt have been ſo in its own nature; and therefore the reſcinding act, notwithſtanding the firſt,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031830_0026_0FEEC7CFB502F7F8"/>ſtands to be diſcuſſed on its own merits:—But this is only a re-production of the firſt deluſion;—for the granting act does not ſtand at all: it is burnt, and that power alone, which could declare definitively on the validity of it, has put it beyond the reach of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion. The power itſelf is firſt to be diſcuſſed, and if you can once diſcuſs that out of exiſtence, you well know that the granting act will be good enough.— You have the parchments, 'tis true, large as dining<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, certified by the ſecretary.—Vain ſhadows of a grant!—Dare you produce them in the ſtate of Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, to ſupport the title which you pretended to ſell us? Of little worth are they, if they cannot be produced on a trial, where if we obtain judgment, the execution will inveſt us with the title which you ſold us. A condition of wrong without redreſs, or of right with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out power, is very undeſirable to a landholder. Your own wrongs, your own frauds and violations of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, have led up this act, againſt which you ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently cry—ſhame, wickedneſs, immorality!—Go cry them in the ſtreets of Georgia, plead them in their courts, ring them in the ears of their legiſlators,—there alone will they anſwer our purpoſe. If this is all a fair tranſaction, as you declared to us by words and pamphlets, make it appear ſo to the world, and let us have the benefit of your exertions.—While it appears unfair and wicked, we ſhall withhold from you pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—courts will ſuſtain us in withholding it:—and the certain event of the breaking of the bubble, will be your own bankruptcy, which is even now at the doors. I have not reſted entirely on the ground of power, thro' any idea that the granting act would be valid on its own merits. If any man judges that it was valid, and that the ſellers have conducted with a due portion of integrity, let him aſſert it; and I am willing to take the burden of proving the act bad, and unfairly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,—and the conduct of a number of the ſellers
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:031830_0027_0FEEC7D14003B538"/>to have been thoroughly abandoned.—In this number I include all thoſe who were themſelves deceived, and who in conſequence deceived their neighbours, and who are demanding any profits in the trade. This fact of demanding <hi>profits</hi> in ſuch a buſineſs, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by a few acknowledged principles and deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will fix the character of ſuch beyond a vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I HAVE thus anſwered the two firſt deluſions, and pray you to reflect, that the grant is really reverſed and revoked, and that you can never try your title to any purpoſe—that you have loſt all ſhadows of the land—and that if you have any defence to make, any money to ſave, any notes to avoid, or any redreſs to obtain,—now is your time; and the time to avail your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will be ſhort.</p>
            <p>NEXT, as to the ſimilitude between theſe ſales, and thoſe of lottery tickets, ſo often introduced, it may be juſt as reſpects a number of the Georgia bargains, ſo far as it can apply; but if a man propoſes to me to purchaſe of him a 100 tickets in the Savannah fire lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and ſhews me a ſcheme of the lottery, and aſſures me that it will be drawn in 60 days, and I buy them, and give him my note for the payment—and it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards appears that there was neither lottery, managers, nor any ſcheme publiſhed, or that there was a lottery without a prize, or one which could never be drawn,— am I to pay my note?—Certainly not—eſpecially not, if I can prove that this ſame man contrived with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others, to make out a ſcheme of a lottery, which could not in its nature anſwer any other purpoſes than thoſe of impoſture. But this compariſon with lottery tickets is not juſt: for in lottery tickets, every man buys with known hazard of loſs or gain. In theſe bargains every man bought with the greateſt certainty of gain, provided the pamphlets and declarations which he bought with his deeds, proved true.—He could not
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:031830_0028_0FEEC7D5823D4DA0"/>calculate upon loſs, except from thoſe circumſtances of treachery and fraud on the part of the ſellers, which would wholly vacate the contract.</p>
            <p>BUT 4th. Thoſe who have given notes, are to be frightened by the books!!—Unfortunately for the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, the books give no comfort, no ſupport. Courts have been trammelled by books at the opening of this buſineſs.—Judge Chaſe was trammelled with books in the opening of the famous Connecticut ſtate cauſe; but after four days digeſtion, his mind was relieved, and he declared that the books did not apply, and that there was <hi>no ſuch thing as ſuſtaining an analogy between protections granted by a ſovereign independent ſtate, and thoſe granted by the dependant courts of Weſtminſter-Hall.</hi> By citing books and authorities, and covering the green cloth with folios, the advocates may perſuade their Georgia clients, that much good may come out of evil; but on thorough canvaſſing, it will be found, that (ſtrange to tell) the books can afford no light on a ſubject of which the compilers had no conception.</p>
            <p n="5">5th. LET purchaſers be guarded againſt being amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the proſpect of <hi>our</hi> courts deciding againſt the reſcinding act.—If all the courts in the United States ſhould decide againſt it, and all the marſhalls and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty-marſhalls, ſheriffs and deputy-ſheriffs, ſhould be employed to carry their judgments into effect,—the whole would ſtill be a miſerable farce and deluſion; —for they would not in the leaſt prejudice the reſcind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing act, nor benefit our title, and the ſtate of Georgia would care nothing about them.</p>
            <p n="6">6th. As to the reſcinding act being made in the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of the people, and that there is good chance of its being repealed—there is not one word of truth, nor ſymptom of probability about it:—and this pretence is a mere continuation of the falſe and ſwindling mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which have been practiſed on you.</p>
            <p n="7">AND 7th. As to the hypothetical reaſoning, that if
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:031830_0029_0FEEC7D85C945860"/>Georgia could reſcind this act, then Connecticut and Maſſachuſetts can reſcind theirs—it ought to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſtated, viz.—That Georgia has reſcinded her gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting act, and if Connecticut and Maſſachuſetts ſhould reſcind theirs, they would do as Georgia has done;— and what would the claimants do in any ſuch caſe, where the Indian title is not extinguiſhed? In a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wholly remedileſs, as to title or preemption, are you who have thought yourſelves purchaſers of Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia lands; and your ſituation is brought on you by your confidence in thoſe, who ſold to you;—and this ſituation is aggravated by the perſecutions and law per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, with which theſe deceivers are hunting you. Your time is devoted, and your property ſubjected to the apparent rapacity of the Georgia ſellers; but they in reality, are now only the puppets of the farce— there is not one chance in a thouſand of their event<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually gaining any thing; but ſtill the farce muſt be carried on, for the emolument of the craftsmen. Of great importance is it in this ſituation, that you poſſeſs yourſelves of facts—that you give way to no deluſions —and that you compoſe yourſelves under theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated abuſes. If you get rid of your notes, yet the land deeded to you is not worth a thouſandth part of what you have paid—be that ſum ever ſo ſmall.</p>
            <p>As many of the ideas, which have been introduced on this ſubject, tending to ſhew that the common law principles and practice cannot be applied to theſe caſes, may appear inadmiſſible,—I beg leave to enforce them by reference to the reaſonings and practice adopted in the South ſea ſcheme, in the year 1721.

            <q>
               <p>WHEN the bubble burſt, and the ſtock the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers had purchaſed at 1000 per cent. fell to 150, and of courſe the loſs of every ſuch ſubſcriber was £.850 out of every £.1000 ſubſcribed—I ſay, when
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:031830_0030_0FEEC7D9E4232110"/>this happened, legal ſuits (of which very many were commenced) for theſe debts, due to the company, would have reduced moſt of the monied men in the kingdom, to a ſtate of remedileſs bankruptcy, and the company muſt have loſt moſt of their money in the bargain. The public creditors had loſt moſt of their public ſecurities, which they had ſubſcribed into that fund,—and infinite other miſchiefs of a like nature muſt have accrued of a kind moſt ruinous and wrong, and of an amount ſo great as to affect national intereſt, honor and credit, and of ſuch an extreme and extraordinary nature, that no ordinary rules of law could be applied in any ſuch manner as to afford the leaſt remedy; but would rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the evil, and give the wrong a kind of ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the law.</p>
               <p>IN this extreme caſe, the parliament found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under an abſolute neceſſity of aſſuming the power of ſovereign equity, and as ſupreme chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of the kingdom to ſuperſede the ordinary rules of the law, control its force, ſoften its rigor, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt ſuch equitable principles as would afford ſome remedy of an evil, an injury, a wrong of ſuch mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude as brought the juſtice, credit and ſafety of the nation into danger. On this principle, they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended law-ſuits, annulled ſpecial bails, diſcharged numberleſs debtors who owed for ſtock, on paying 10 per cent. of their debts, compelled compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in favor of the ſufferers, forced dividends and appropriations of the ſtock of the company, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven puniſhed many for miſmanagement, who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have conformed themſelves to the letter of the law, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            </q>
            <p>VERY ſtrong remonſtrances were made againſt the interference of the legiſlature, and that the matter ſhould be left to the courſe of law, i. e. to be decided according to the common rule of aſſignments of all
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:031830_0031_0FEEC7DB74392018"/>negotiable notes, bonds, &amp;c.—but on a cloſe inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter, it was ſoon clearly ſeen, that the variation of the exchange of theſe ſtocks (or their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation, as we call it) was ſo enormous and extreme, that any application of the ordinary rules of law and practice, to them, would produce the moſt ruinous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and wrongs,—and of courſe, every idea of that mode of ſettlement and adjuſtment was inſtantly given up. Their great principle was, that juſtice and right was the grand end of law, and paramount to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular rules, or eſtabliſhed practice,—and of courſe, ought to control them in all caſes of ſo extreme and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary a kind, as could not fall within the reaſon on which theſe rules were founded; but ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced as that an application of theſe common rules, would unavoidably produce ſuch injury and wrong, as was totally deſtructive of all that right, which was the eſſential principle and end of all laws.</p>
            <p>AS a further explanation of the interference of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, it was ſaid that collections according to the common rule of aſſignments, "would bring remedileſs ruin on thouſands of individuals, and at the ſame time heap immenſe fortunes on others, who had never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them."</p>
            <p>VERY ſimilar to this, in operation and management, was the Miſſiſippi bubble, in France, two years before. In both theſe important and memorable proceedents, of two of the moſt enlightened nations in the world, were recognized ſpecifically the following principles—"That the ordinary rules of law would do infinite miſchief and injuſtice, were not the rigor of them to be ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and corrected by chancery—that the powers of chancery ought always to control the common law, whenever in any caſe the application of the ordinary rules of law, will manifeſtly deſtroy right and juſtice, or work a wrong—that law is certainly perverted, and needs correction, whenever it deſtroys right or does
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:031830_0032_0FEEC7DFE2E7DA20"/>wrong." That the ſupreme power of every ſtate, is the ſupreme chancery of it, and muſt have ſovereign authority to repeal, to limit or control every rule of law, and may and ought to do it, whenever that rule operates by way of deſtruction or defalcation of right, or producing of wrong,—and that juſtice and ſecurity of right can never be perfect or even tolerable in any ſtate, without the exiſtence of this power and the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent exerciſe of it.
<note n="*" place="bottom">For theſe remarks on the South Sea bubble, ſee Peletiah Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Political Eſſays, page 334.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THESE are vital iſſues from the ſource of law, calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to do good, wherever they flow:—theſe are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which put to flight all tecknical diſtinctions, and furniſh us with a truth highly important in theſe cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, viz.—that there are extraordinary caſes, where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law principles cannot and ought not to be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by reaſon of the manifeſt injuſtice, which would reſult from an application of them.</p>
            <p>THESE Georgia cauſes furniſh the ſtrongeſt inſtance ſince 1721, for the application of theſe principlies.— They do not preciſely reſemble either of the other bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: for in the South ſea ſcheme, the amazing riſe of the ſtock, originated in their contract with parliament, for taking in the national debt. Their ſtate of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity was overrated, and the funds roſe by mere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, from 130 to 330 per cent.—and from the month of April to Auguſt, they roſe from the laſt ſum to 1000 per cent; but it was a reality they were deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in:—and even after the bubble broke and parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment interfered, the ſtock was really worth 150 per cent. It will be well ſeen, that the Georgia bubble does not preciſely reſemble that of the South ſea;— for here was no reality at bottom, and here was great fraud in the means, as I conſtantly hold myſelf reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponſible to ſhew, whenever it ſhall be doubted.—But in one very important reſpect, there is a reſemblance.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:031830_0033_0FEEC7E169A82B58"/>The legiſlature of the ſtate of Georgia, like the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign legiſlatures of England and France, ſeeing the wrong and oppreſſion, which would be cauſed by the collection of the notes, and combining this with the other inducements before ſtated—have, as they had a ſovereign right to do, deſtroyed the whole conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the notes, and have thus let them and the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of them to the ground. The ſovereign legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the union, might have ſuſpended the power of their own courts, from any cognizance of the cauſes: ſo the legiſlatures of the ſeveral ſtates might have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the power of their courts; but this would have been only a partial remedy of the evil. The ſtate of Georgia, whoſe acts and laws are to be reſpected thro'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the union, has in a moſt pointed and peremptory manner declared, that there is no conſideration for theſe notes,—and has ſhewn the neceſſity and propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of this declaration more concluſively, than they were ſhewn by either of thoſe parliaments. Their exerciſe of ſovereignty is not novel, and the reaſons on which it is founded are as old as the world.— <hi>This public act of the ſtate of Georgia, is the beſt and moſt concluſive teſtimony of a want of conſideration, which can be improved in a court of chancery: and thoſe courts could never have granted relief againſt notes for want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, on more ample grounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN a very important reſpect alſo, the Georgia plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs ſtand in the ſame rank with thoſe, who in the South ſea buſineſs were proſecuting for 850/1000 of what coſt them nothing, and was good for nothing:—the remaining 150/1000 and the price actually paid for the lands by the Georgia companies, placing them both on an equal footing,—both having a law of a ſovereign ſtate, barring them from an oppreſſive recovery—and both equally deſerving to feel the inconvenience reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to oppreſſors from the operation of principles of equity.—Neither can be in the rank of thoſe, who
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:031830_0034_0FEEC7E5D5897D20"/>hold notes for money lent, or labour done; but both are in the rank of thoſe, who are hunting for money, on principles deſtructive to the deſign of courts, and the exiſtence of ſociety. It is fortunate for the public, that there ſhould be ſuch a concurrence of public acts of ſovereign legiſlatures, on ſubjects ſo ſimilar—and that the parties preſſing for payment at the bar of our courts, ſhould meet an obſtacle ſo equally and juſtly fatal to their unfounded claims: for the deciſions in theſe caſes againſt the notes, will give to our courts occaſion to aſſert principles deſtructive to the fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent arts, which have expoſed many of our citizens to ſevere loſs of property.</p>
            <p>HAPPILY our courts are not deſtitute of chancery powers, ſufficient to carry the equitable objects of the reſcinding act into full effect: and when the doctrines of chancery are introduced—when the original prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of right are contemplated—when this bubble is compared with other bubbles—when the parties and the cauſes are known, and the reſcinding act is duly plead,—if courts can heſitate about pronouncing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the notes, it will be only that one fiat of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional legiſlature, may put a perpetual end to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions and diſtreſs cauſed by the Georgia, Virginia, Suſquehannah, Canada, and all other baſeleſs ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
            <p>IT will be well ſeen, that I have not left theſe notes to depend on the contingence of ſuch a national mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The defence of thoſe, who are ſued on their notes, ſtands moſt ſubſtantially on the chancery pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers veſted in our courts:—and the means of calling thoſe powers into effectual exerciſe, have been juſt ſhewn to be abundant.</p>
            <p>BUT merely to get rid of the payment of the notes is not the ſole object.—Large ſums of money have been paid, which in equity and good conſcience ought to be refunded.—In addition to theſe, great damages
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031830_0035_0FEEC7F2DD2BD5A0"/>have been ſuſtained, by reaſon of the falſhood and ſwindling practiſed in theſe ſales. The lands or deeds in the hands of the purchaſers, are not worth a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,—and would be worth the meereſt trifle, if the reſcinding act ſhould now be burnt, and the granting act reſtored:—for the granting act reſtored would not inveſt you with the fee of the lands, ſubject to the right of hunting and fiſhing, &amp;c.—which fee you thought yourſelves to have bought: and the violent parties, which have been created in the confuſion of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, would probably prevent your ever obtaining a right to extinguiſh the Indian title.—Indeed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions about the Georgia lands, have led up a ſerious claim of congreſs,—which otherwiſe would have been as dormant as their claim to the Cheneſſee country.— This claim, however originated, will not be eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed.</p>
            <p>BUT if all obſtacles were removed, your right to hold a treaty, is merely a right to buy the land at the full value of it,—and this you are to do under the eye of ſworn commiſſioners and interpreters. This treaty is to be opened with great expenſe: and your agents are to meet not a few ignorant ſtraggling Indians, but the powerful, opulent and enlightened nations of the Creeks, Chactaws and Chickaſaws—headed by chiefs of great fame, information and influence.—The object of this treaty is, to buy from them the place of their birth, their conqueſts and their reſidence:—and you come to them under the faſcinating character of men, repreſenting a horde of impoſtors, who cheated the repreſentatives of the ſtate of Georgia, out of their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped and impoſing right of alone bidding on theſe lands: and you apply to them, after blood has been repeatedly and unſucceſsfully ſhed, to force them to retreat.—You apply to them for their lands—not as a place of refuge from perſecution—not as a ſoil, where you wiſh to labour, and to introduce agriculture, and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:031830_0036_0FEEC7F5E0B978D0"/>the arts of civilized life—not as a place, where you wiſh to embrace and treat them as a band of brothers;— but as a frontier, where you may erect forts, eſtabliſh garriſons, ſtretch the ſtrong arm of the union, and fill, with their ancient and implacable opreſſors and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.—With a council ſuch as theſe nations will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to you,—rum, whiſky and ruſty nails, will not be conſidered as concluſive arguments:—truth, ſincerity and a ſufficiency of property to enable them to remove where they may do better, will alone go down. Will you tell them, that you have already paid large ſums of money, to prevent others from bidding on their lands—and that therefore you cannot give the full va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of them?—Will you deſire the commiſſioners to inform them, that you expect to make immenſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes out of their lands, and that there is no way of your doing it, but by purchaſing them for far leſs than they are worth?—Shall your interpreters expound to them the whole hiſtory of this buſineſs?—Or will you ſmoke with them the calumet of peace, exchange your baubles for theirs, and call them friends and brothers? Will you tell them, that you came from a land flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with milk and honey, abounding in corn and green paſtures, and overflowing in all the conveniences and luxuries of life—from a land, where every induſtrious man may gain wealth—and that for their ſakes you are come up thither? They know better than all this,— they have lately told us, at lake Erie, that they know the arts of the white men:—and the Georgia commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, but laſt year, with as much parade as could attend a treaty, and as plauſible talks as you can hold with them, got for anſwer, that they would not ſell.— And ſuppoſe you get the ſame anſwer, after all your expenſes, what is your preemption worth?—Or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they ſhould offer the lands to you, at ſuch price as you have repeatedly declared them worth, if free from incumbrance, what would your preemption be
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:031830_0037_0FEEC7F768842970"/>worth? As reſpects the Indians, the lands are theirs in fee, with all the uſes belonging to them;—and they care not for preemptive rights—they can diſencumber them at pleaſure—and they feel and know themſelves entitled to as much in value, as the lands are worth to any purchaſer,—and there is no propriety in their giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you 9-10ths of the whole land for ſeiling the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder:—and yet a leſs commiſſion for doing this buſineſs, is hardly contemplated. Perhaps fraud or force may deprive theſe nations of their lands, within a few years; but I have no idea, that within a centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they will voluntarily ſell them:—for they are not a miſerable handful, as the Georgia ſellers repreſented, conſtantly decreaſing in numbers, and rather inclining to retreat than to maintain their ground; but juſt the contrary.</p>
            <p>SHALL it be ſaid, that the purchaſers knew or ought to have known all theſe things?—The beſt anſwer will be, that they did not know them, and had not the means of knowing them, and the whole repreſentation was as I have before ſtated—that there was only an uſufruct between the purchaſers and a complete poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the lands,—which uſufruct might be eaſily extinguiſhed, as there were immenſe tracts farther to the weſtward and northward, where the Indians would find better hunting and fiſhing than on theſe lands.— The commotions reſpecting the ſales have been ſuch, that a reſtoration of the granting act, if ſuch an event could be conceived, would be very far from reſtoring to the preſent claimants, what they ſuppoſed they had purchaſed:—ſo far from it, that the incumbrances then exiſting upon the claim, would in all probability be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurmountable. I have not even taken into my calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the influence which the ſtate of Georgia, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny party among them, might uſe againſt you in caſe of a treaty,—nor the probable exiſtence of a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terference of titles, by fraudulent and multiplied deeds,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:031830_0038_0FEEC7F8EF499B28"/>reſting merely on detached paper or parchment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any record to ſupport them or diſcover their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy;—but we have a fair right to believe, that men who will take unprincipled means to get rich, will not be leſs abandoned in the means of extrication, when the gulph of bankruptcy is before them.</p>
            <p>IN VIEW of the premiſes, I fully believe, that a reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration of the granting act, would not only wrong the people of Georgia,—but would prove a ſerious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to the preſent claimants, and a dreadful misfortune to all who might be after purchaſers.—It would open a new ſcene of deluſive hopes to the world, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh new daggers to aim at the vitals of morality, fair dealing and confidence between man and man. Long enough have friends ſtabbed friends, neighbours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed neighbours—and the wealth of centuries been waſted by the deluſions of a moment.—Truth, honeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and commercial credit have ſuffered wounds deep enough: and all the friends of ſociety feel grateful to the legiſlature, which arreſted in its progreſs the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tructive peſtilence. Formerly the enemies of man fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the public roads—put piſtols to the breaſts of unſuſpecting travellers, and robbed them of the valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables they had about them; but the ſufferers could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their houſes and lands, and by induſtry repair the loſs.—We live to ſee robbery in a more refined ſtile. Men who never added an iota to the wealth or morals of the world, and whoſe ſingle moment was never devoted to making one being wiſer or happier throughout the univerſe—riding in their chariots— plotting the ruin of born and unborn millions—aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with feathers to cut throats, and on parchments to ſeal deſtruction,—theſe are the robbers of modern days.—They bring deſolation among our farmers— they ſpread diſtreſs in towns—they ſcorn the paltry plunder of pocket-books, and watches—they aim at houſes and lands—ſtrike at the foundation of many
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:031830_0039_0FEEC7FA73D97000"/>generations,—and would deſtroy families, root and branch. Long enough have fraud, falſhood and ſwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling ſtalked our ſtreets:—often enough have our far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers left their fields and wrecked the induſtry of pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and honeſt years upon the mountains of Virginia: —often enough have our jails and dockets witneſſed the ruined hopes of the dupes of Newtown and Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge ſpeculations.—Theſe laſt are not imputable to the Georgia ſellers,—unleſs by their ſuperior addreſs, and the wider ruin they have cauſed, they may claim the honor of ingurgitating theſe leſſer robberies.</p>
            <p>I AM not diſtorting this ſubject; but am drawing likeneſſes of which the originals exiſt. The indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an incenſed public, is faſt gathering over you who have ſat for this picture.—The advocates of your impoſtures, begin to diſcover, that they have been led to abet meaſures which they abhor. The means of paying fees are nearly exhauſted—the funds to whch you look for help, will prove as deceitful as the eyes of thoſe, whom you have injured, will be dreadful to you, after your ruin ſhall be complete. Your char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters, your hopes of wealth, your all, are tumbling into the pit, which you have digged for others:—and if the day of your total poverty, contempt and deſpair, can be haſtened by what is here written, I ſhall have paid to you, who deſerve this character, the only debt, which in equity and good conſcience I owe you.</p>
