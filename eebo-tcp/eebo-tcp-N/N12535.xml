            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A ſerious ADDRESS to the People called QUAKERS, on the Continent of <hi>North-America,</hi> relative to the late great Revolution.</head>
            <p>AS there are divers opinions in the Society, reſpecting the preſont Government, and doubts in the minds of ſome, whether it be right or proper to withdraw their obedience from preceding rulers and powers, and to ſubmit to rulers and powers, who are ſeparated from, and ſet up in the ſtead and without the conſent of, the former: The right underſtanding and ſettling of this point appears to be the firſt neceſſary conſideration. I would therefore, in the firſt place, obſerve and lay it down as an axiom, that, in caſes of ſuch maguitude as the preſent, there muſt certainly be ſomething more than human, and that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, the Supreme Governor of the Univerſe, who is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecter of perſons, who doeth whatſoever he pleaſeth with the powers of this world, ſetteth up and pulleth down whomſoever he pleaſeth, and, for cauſes beſt known unto himſelf, hath allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and permitted, and ſtill doth allow and permit, changes and alterations in and of ſtates and empires, to take place. It may not be amiſs to call to mind the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious mighty and well-known re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions that he hath permitted at different times, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but moſt if not all the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires and people upon the face of the earth, to the ſubduing and ſetting aſide one, and raiſing up another in the room thereof, from the times of Saul and David down to this very day; ſome of which, for the ſake of the doubting, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed, or inconſiderate, I ſhall remark, as conciſely as conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently may be.</p>
            <p>The kingdom of Saul, which was the firſt we read of in Holy Writ, although regularly and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly eſtabliſhed, yet by degrees was weakened and reduced, and that of David by degrees raiſed over it; the introduction and riſe of whoſe government we may ſee 1 Sam. 22, where we find that, on account of Saul's tyranny, David fled <q>and eſcaped to the cave of Adullam, and when his brethren, and all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe heard it, they went down thither to him, and every one that was in diſtreſs, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and gathered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto him, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Captain over them:</q> This was the beginning of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's power, and theſe men, we learn, continued together with David until he was made King in Saul's ſtead, which, though by the order and appointment of Providence, yet it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that it was contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well as to the uſual cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of all ages, ſince David not being heir to the crown, the claim thereto upon thoſe principles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the houſe of Saul, which I think, was notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing declared ſhould grow weaker and weaker, and that of David ſtronger and ſtronger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:015843_0003_0F9A2C91522E05B0"/>
And of Solomon, (David's ſon and immediate ſucceſſor) the Lord declared, <q>Foraſmuch as thou haſt nor kept my covenant and my ſtatutes which I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee, I will ſurely <hi>rend</hi> the kingdom from thee, and will give it <hi>to thy ſervant.</hi> Notwithſtanding in thy days, I will not do it, (for David thy father's ſake) but I will <hi>rend</hi> it out of the hand of thy ſon. Howbeit I will not <hi>rend</hi> away all the kingdom, but will give one tribe to thy ſon, (for Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid my ſervant's ſake, and for Jeruſalem's ſake, which I have choſen.</q>) And in the next verſe it is expreſsly declared, that <q>
                  <hi>The Lord ſtirred up</hi> an adverſary unto Solomon, Hadad the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domite.</q>—And in the 23<abbr>d</abbr> verſe it is again ſaid, that <q>
                  <hi>God ſtirred him up</hi> another adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Rezon the ſon of Eliadah.</q> Which paſſiges clearly manifeſt, that the hand of the Lord is in ſuch events, and particularly the fulfilling of the foregoing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which we find conſumed by the declaration of the Prophet to Jeroboam, as alſo by the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification of the rent garment; the Prophet telling him in the name of the Lord, "I will take thee, and thou ſhalt reign accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so all that thy ſoul deſireth, and ſhalt be King over Iſrael," ver. 37.—which accordingly came to paſs by the revolt of the ten tribes, as we may ſee in the 12th chap. upon the unjuſt, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Another inſtance of the deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lord with the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of men, we may ſee in the 16th chap, of I. Kings, where "the word of the Lord came to Jehu, the ſon of Hanani, againſt Baaſha, (King of Iſrael) ſaying, foraſmuch as I exalted thee out of the duſt, and made thee Prince over my people Iſrael, and thou haſt walked in the way of Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam; behold, I will take away the POSTERITY of Baaſha, and the POSTERITY of his houſe."— And in the 9th of II. Kings, we find that the Prophet Eliſha fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the reign of Jehu, the ſon of Jehoſhaphat, (though a ſervant) in preference to his maſter, who had 70 ſons, ſaying unto Jehu, by a meſſenger which he ſent for that purpoſe, <q>Thus faith the Lord God of Iſrael, I have anointed thee King over the people of the Lord, even over Iſrael, and thou ſhalt ſmite the houſe of Ahab thy maſter,</q>—which was accordingly fulfilled, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the contemptuous ſpeech of the impudent woman Jezebel, who, upon his entering the city of Jezteel, cried out, <q>Had Zimri peace, who flew his maſter?</q>—but ſhe lived not long to repeat her folly:—Of this Jehu, although he flew his maſter and his 70 ſons, by orders for that purpoſe, yet, according to the 30th ver. of 10th chap. the Lord ſaid unto him, becauſe thou haſt done my will in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting that which is right in my eyes, and haſt done unto the houſe of Ahab, according to all that was commanded thee, thy children of the fourth generation ſhall ſit on the throne of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>Our ancient friend <hi>George Fox,</hi> in an addreſs to Kings and Rulers of all ſorts, wherein he ſpeaks of the Lord's power and dealings, ſays, <q>his hand is turned againſt Kings, and ſhall turn wife men
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:015843_0004_0F9A2C920FC8CD50"/>backward, will bring their crowns to the duſt, and lay them low and level with the earth.—Journ. p. 135.</q> And the ſame friend, in a paper given forth in the year 1660, p. 309, ſays,—<q>All friends, concerning the changing of times and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, let not that trouble any of you, for God hath a mighty work and hand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</q>—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward Burrough,</hi> in a piece called a repreſentation to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, an. 1659, page 610 of his works, ſays,— <q>Now friends, do but truly conſider, and with an humble mind, what the work of the Lord hath been in theſe nations, for divers years, and how he hath proceeded to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and overturn powers and authorities, princes and rulers, and made them of no account before him; and becauſe of the oppreſſion of Rulers among us, the nation hath groaned, and been left without a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter from any man, and could not repoſe confidence in its Princes and Rulers, and this was that the nation might look unto the Lord, and that thro' him they might be ſaved, and expect healing from him alone; and in all theſe overturnings, you need not fear but the hand of the Lord hath been in them, and his arm hath ſuffered and even brought theſe things to paſs; <hi>and therefore,</hi> why ſhould you murmur againſt God, and be unſatisfied in what he hath done.</q>—The ſame author, page 672, ſpeaking concerning the ſufferings of King Charles, ſays,— <q>As for the afflictions and ſufferings ſuſtained by him, ſo far as they were juſt and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgments from God becauſe of iniquity, can no man be charged with, but that is on God's account, who was pleaſed to chaſtiſe with afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſufferings, and no man can be blamed with injuſtice, for that affliction which cometh from the hand of God.</q> The public cauſes of Charles's ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are well known, and who can ſay but the caſe is the ſame at this very time; of which the very permiſſion of the preſent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is a ſtrong preſumptive proof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francis Howgill,</hi> an ancient and eminent miniſter and author amongſt us, in an addreſs to the army, committee of ſafety, and parliament, p. 325 of his works, about the year—, ſpeaking of the end and intent of rule and authority, ſaith,— <q>For the thing intended being loſt, the Ruler or Rulers rule no more for God, neither doth he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them ſuch, whatever they may account themſelves; and therefore hath raiſed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to overthrow that power, as hath been evident in this nation, in theſe many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions, although that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which was firſt in being," (no doubt meaning the King's) which was ordained for the end aforeſaid, might ſay to that which roſe up againſt it, that it was <hi>rebellion and treaſon,</hi> and declare it to be ſuch in the ears of the people, as hath been done by divers, which is in the memory of moſt; ſo that I need not inſtance, when I ſay <hi>it was not ſo accounted by the Lord,</hi> and he hath given a teſtimony of this by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of the former, and

            <p>The foregoing precedents and obſervations one would think might be ſufficient to ſatisfy the doubting, that the preſent revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is the work of the Lord, and according to the plan and deſign of his providence, and tend to <hi>prove</hi> the ſafety and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of a ſubmiſſion to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which now rule: But it may be objected in juſtification of the preſent ſcruples and refuſal by ſome, that the preſent powers and government are uſurped and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to law: To this it may be anſwered, that the ſame objection would have held good under eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry revolution which has hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been brought about, as they muſt no doubt have been contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the authority of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding powers, and by their friends and adherents been deemed uſurpations, which might alſo have been alledged againſt the preſent conſtitution of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain, as may be hereafter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked.</p>
            <p>It appears to me that it is for thoſe who chuſe not to have any hand in the formation of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to take governments ſuch as they find them, and comply with their laws, ſo far as they are clear of infringing religious rights and matters of faith toward God: It cannot perhaps be found that friends, ever ſince they were a people, ever refuſed to aſſiſt in the ſupport of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but have ever held it right and neceſſary to comply with the laws of the various governments under which they lived; for as, according to our own repeated declarations as a ſociety, (ſee Sewell's hiſt. p. 748, &amp;c.)—the <q>ſetting up and putting down Kings and Governments is God's peculiar prerogative for cauſes beſt known to himſelf, and that it is not our work or buſineſs to have any hand or contrivance therein, nor to be buſy bodies in matters above our ſtations.</q> Whether then can ſuch a people, <hi>by any means,</hi> undertake to weaken or oppoſe the preſent government, ſeeing theſe things are allowed to belong only unto God, is a matter wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of conſideration: for though ſome may ſay that the King's
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015843_0008_0F9A2C95D03D12F0"/>right is infringed, and that no other power than the King hath a right to this country and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thereof, it may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in return, that the King hath long ſince actually and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly put the people of this country out of his own protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without diſtinction of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whether private or public, civil or religious: But I would ſeriouſly aſk how any one knows, or can undertake to ſay, that the above aſſertion, on the part of the King, is really the caſe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together right in the ſight of God, who doth whatſoever he pleaſeth in the kingdoms of this world.

            <p>Several other inſtances might be adduced on this occaſion, but it is apprehended that theſe may be ſufficient to ſhew, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding preceding obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, attachments and declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the ſociety have not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended themſelves implicitly and unexceptionably bound to any King or Power, further than they governed according to the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental principles of the empire; but that they were diſſolved from their promiſes and declarations, when the Prince manifeſtly and actually attempted to ſubvert the principles of the conſtitution; otherwiſe how can we reconcile the ſolemn declaration and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to King James, with the promiſes and declarations made to King William, and thoſe who ſucceeded.</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing this has been the real and declared ſentiment and conduct of ſociety on former oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, would it not be hard for them to cenſure or condemn thoſe who apprehend themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable for conforming or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the preſent powers, which, according to Scripture, muſt be allowed "to be of God." This appears to ſome to be going a great length; but let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that if we examine the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and characters of former Rulers and Governors, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly thoſe concerning whom the Apoſtle makes that ſolemn ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, we ſhall have reaſon to believe that they were not more likely to be ordained of God, than the powers which are now ſet over us, ſeeing they were ſuperſtitious and warlike Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens immerſed in groſs idolatry: —But it may be objected the proceedings againſt King James, and the ſubſequent conformity of friends and others to the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing powers, was chiefly upon a religious account and principle, which he evidently attempted unlawfully to infringe: This is granted; but are not all laws and obligations between men conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, and no longer binding than the terms, upon which they were made, are kept and obſerved, agreeable to that well known maxim adopted by Wm.

            <p>Without entering far into a political diſquiſition of the merits of the cauſe now in agitation, I would juſt refer to conſideration the glaring undeniable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated ſtrokes given to, and breaches made in the conſtitution under which we have heretofore lived, by thoſe who were bound and ſworn to maintain it inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015843_0011_0F9A2C9811B5A160"/>even at the riſque of their eternal ſalvation, as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from W. Penn's works, v. I, p. 685, &amp;c. where, amongſt other things, he recites the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence pronounced againſt the breakers of the articles in the Great Charter, which is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: — <q>In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, Amen. Whereas our Sovereign Lord the King, to the honour of God and of Holy Church, and for the common profit of the realm, hath granted for him, and his heirs for ever, theſe articles above written. Robert, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury, Primate of all England, admoniſhed all his province, once, twice and thrice, becauſe that ſhortneſs will not ſuffer ſo much delay, as to give knowledge to all the people of England of theſe preſents in writing: We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enjoin all perſons <hi>of what eſtate ſoever they be,</hi> that they, and every of them, as much as in them is, ſhall uphold and maintain theſe articles granted by our Sovereign Lord the King, <hi>in all points:</hi> And all thoſe <hi>that in any point do reſiſt or break,</hi> or in any manner hereafter procure, counſel, or in any wiſe aſſent to reſiſt or break thoſe ordinances, or go about it, by word or deed, openly or privily, by any manner of pretence or colour; We the aforeſaid Archbiſhops, by our authority in this writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſſed, do excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and accurſe, and from the body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and from all the company of Heaven, and from all the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of Holy Church do ſequeſter and exclude.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which W. Penn obſerves, <q>We may here ſee, that in the obſcureſt times of popery, they were not without a ſenſe of juſtice and a care of <hi>freedom,</hi> and that even Papiſts, whom many think no friends to <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>property,</hi> under dreadful penalties, enjoin an <hi>inviolable</hi> obſervance of this Great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. And though I am no Roman Catholic, and as little value their other curſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon religious diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, yet I declare ingenuouſly I would not, for the world, incur this curſe, <hi>as every man</hi> DESERVEDLY DOTH, <hi>that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers violence to the fundamental freedoms thereby repeated and confirmed</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now if Kings, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, deſerved the penalties here mentioned, for a breach of that charter, then the mere renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or refuſal of their right to a ſmall ſpot of this earth, muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be conſidered in the mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt point of view. Plutarch (in Pyrrh. p. 390) ſays that <q>Kings, when any revolution happens in their dominions, are apt to complain bitterly of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects unfaithfulneſs and diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty; but they do them wrong, and forget that it was them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who gave them the firſt leſſons of their diſloyalty, by diſregarding juſtice and fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which they ſacrificed to their own particular intereſts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The judicious Rollin, author of the ancient hiſtory, vol. 2, p. 288, after treating of the cauſe of the declenſion in the Aſſyrian empire, ſays, <q>Surely the oaths by which Treaties were ſealed and ratified, and the Deity
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015843_0012_0F9A2C98CFD3BA30"/>brought in not only as preſent but as guarantee of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſtipulated, (as was the caſe between the Kings of Great-Britain and their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) is a moſt ſacred and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt ceremony, very proper for the ſubjecting of earthly Princes to the Supreme Judge of Heaven and Earth.—Now if Princes, by their unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will teach their people not to ſtand in fear of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, how ſhall they be able to ſecure reſpect and reverence to themſelves?—Nor is it all aſtoniſhing, that the contempt which an impious Prince, who has no regard to the ſanctity of an oath, ſhews of God and religion, ſhould ſhake the very foundations of the firmeſt and beſt eſtabliſhed empires, and ſooner or later occaſion their utter deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q> And page 275, the ſame author ſays, that <q>Among other cauſes which brought the ruin of that empire, the four follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be looked upon as the principal: Their exceſſive mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and luxury, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſubjection and ſlavery of the people, the bad education of their Princes, and their want of faith in the execution of their Treaties, Oaths and Engagements.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As to the renunciation of the King's heirs and ſucceſſors, which ſeems to be a material cauſe of objection with ſome, do we not find that when any perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons forfeit their eſtates to the King or country where they dwell, that their heirs and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors are alſo deprived of the ſame; indeed nothing can be claimed by an heir, as ſuch, but in virtue or right of his anceſtor or proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor; and if there be no right in them, or the right, if any, were forfeit or loſt, it is alſo loſt to their heirs and ſucceſſors; for though right not forfeited or ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, does not die, though it may ſleep, yet right once for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited or properly loſt, can never properly be regained: Beſide the King (as hath been obſerved) has already put the people of this country, without diſtinction, out of his protection, by expreſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration; and as protection and allegiance being reciprocal, is an eſtabliſhed maxim in all ſtates, and is according to the nature and reaſon of things: Upon this principle, by the King's own act, the allegiance of the people is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved —The ſame may be ſaid with regard to theſe States, if, by the will of Providence, they ſhould hereafter be ſubdued, and no longer capable of yielding protection; which is according to the declaration of Congreſs, as well as to the preamble of the act for ſecuring the preſent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which expreſsly declares that protection and allegiance are reciprocal: This is the object and ultimatum of the act, and is the natural, ſimple and true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the ſame, being, without doubt, no other than what muſt be intended and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected at the framing of the ſame, as is allowed by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe now in power, nor can it indeed be otherways right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid thus much as to declarations of fidelity and renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, it may not be amiſs to add ſomething on the ſubject of the payment of Taxes.</p>
            <p>For this purpoſe I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015843_0013_0F9A2C999269CA78"/>an epiſtle of George Fox, taken from his book of epiſtles, p. 137, where he adviſes, <q>

            <p>W. Penn, in an addreſs to the high court of parliament, anno 1671, vol. 1, p. 41, tells them, that "We both own and are ready to yield obedience to every ordinance of man, <hi>relating to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man affairs,</hi> and that for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake; and that IN ALL RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VOLUTIONS, we have demeaned ourſelves with much peace and patience, diſowning all contrary actings; and that we have lived <hi>moſt peaceably</hi> under all the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous governments that have been ſince our firſt appearance,"— which could not have been ſaid with propriety, unleſs they had ſubmitted to the civil ordinances of men, as above declared.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Story,</hi> in his Journal, p. 269, ſpeaking concerning a law made to enforce the bearing of arms, which he diſapproved, yet in the courſe of the debate, which he had with the judge of a court, ſaith,— <q>I began with the example of Chriſt himſelf for the payment of a Tax, tho' applied by Caeſar <hi>unto the uſes of war,</hi> and other exigences of his government;</q> and was going to ſhew the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a law that directly and principally affects the perſon in war, <hi>requiring perſonal ſervice,</hi> and a law which only requires <hi>a general tax,</hi> to be applied by Rulers as they ſee cauſe;—for though <hi>we as a people readily pay ſuch taxes</hi> impartially aſſeſſed, yet as the kingdom of Chriſt is not of this world, his ſervants will not fight, though they may and ought to pay taxes, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the example of Chriſt their head:" And what that inſtance and example was, he relates p. 410, where he ſays, that "The Lord Jeſus Chriſt obeyed all the righteous laws both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> ſo far as his condition in this world ſubjected him to them: For though he was, and is the peaceable Saviour, and came not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them, yet in obedience to the laws of men, where not oppoſite to or interfering with the laws of God, he wrought a miracle to pay a poll-tax, where in ſtrictneſs the law did not require it of him, nor of his diſciples; for having Roman privileges by virtue of an old league between the Jews and Romans, whereby they were as children and not ſtrangers, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs to obviate all occaſion of offence, he ſubmitted to it, tho' only an ordinance of men, and his apoſtles likewiſe, <hi>as an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to his church through all ages then to come."</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:015843_0014_0F9A2C9A4FBD01C8"/>
Though this example is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally well known, it may not be improper here to recite it, which was thus: "And when they came to Capernaum, they that received Tribute money, came to Peter, and ſaid, doth your maſter pay Tribute? He ſaith yes. And when he was come into the houſe, Jeſus prevented him, ſaying, what thinkeſt thou, Simon? Of whom do the Kings of the earth take Cuſtom or Tribute; of their own children or of ſtrangers? Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſaith unto him, of ſtrangers. Jeſus ſaith unto him, then are the children free. Notwithſtanding leſt we ſhould offend them, go thou to the ſea, and caſt an hook, and take up the fiſh that firſt cometh up, and when thou haſt opened his mouth, thou ſhalt find a piece of money: That take, and give unto them for me and thee." Mat. 17th, v. 24, 25, 26, 27.</p>
            <p>It is here remarkable that our Saviour appears to have revolved in his mind the whole nature of the caſe, and of the demand that was made; for upon Peter's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Tax-gatherers, that his maſter paid Tribute, our Lord took occaſion to remind him by a gentle rep ehenſion, that he had gone further in his reply than he was bound to do, or than was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite from the nature of their condition and circumſtances; and immediately upon Peter's enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the houſe, prevented his ſpeaking by making uſe of a very ſtrong and lively argument to convince Peter, that he had been quite as quick as was neceſſary; and that inſtead of being bound to pay the Tax, they were, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtom of the country, exempt and free; yet notwithſtanding this freedom and privilege, or without the leaſt objection to the uſe to which the money might be applied, though the Romans were in general Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then idolaters, and about that time, as appears from hiſtory, actually engaged in war on ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſides, and the character of their Emperor <hi>Tiberius</hi> marked as debauched, unjuſt, cruel, tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic, ſanguinary and inhuman.— Yet Chriſt our Lord, tho' cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with majeſty and power above all the laws and powers of this world, and was thereby able to have ſubdued all things unto himſelf, and made them ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to his will, was ſo tender of giving uneaſineſs to the powers that then bore rule, that he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Peter, by producing an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing miracle, as we have read, to comply and pay the Tax for this very ſtriking reaſon, "<hi>let we ſhould offend."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Story</hi> before mentioned, in his journal, page 413 ſaith, <q>That the ſufferings of the faithful in Chriſt, <hi>in all ages,</hi> have not aroſe from the breach <hi>of any laws</hi> relating only <hi>to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> government, which they do readily obſerve and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly obey.</q>—And in the ſame page, adds, <q>That as there always is and muſt be, in the nature of things, a great and neceſſary charge attending go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, (a kingdom <hi>or ſtate</hi> being but as one great houſe or family, and no private or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular family c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:015843_0015_0F9A2C9B0FFB9938"/>ſaith, <q>Though we are prohibited arms and fighting in perſon, as inconſiſtent (we think) with the roles of the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt; yet we can, and do, by his example, readily and cheerfully pay <hi>unto every government, and in every form,</hi> where we <hi>happen</hi> to be ſubjects, ſuch ſums and aſſeſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as are required of us by the <hi>reſpective</hi> laws under which we live. For when a general Tax was laid by the <hi>Roman</hi> Czar, upon his extenſive em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and the time of payment came, the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
               </q> (according to Scripture, Mat. 25, as recited by T. Story) <q>wrought a miracle to pay a Tax, where yet it was not ſtrictly due; we, by ſo great an example, do freely pay our Taxes to Caeſar, who of right hath the direction and <hi>application</hi> of them, to the various ends of government, <hi>to peace or to war,</hi> as it pleaſeth him, or as need may, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the conſtitution or laws of his kingdom.</q> Jour. p. 125.</p>
            <p>W. Penn, vol. 2, p 33, ſaith, <q>That ſince we are as large contributors to the government as our antagoniſts, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to as large protection from it.</q>—Now this ſaying could not have been true, unleſs they paid all the public Taxes, in common with other men, which no doubt their antagoniſts did; and by analogous concluſion, if we, under the preſent diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, refuſe to contribute to the government under which we live, how can we expect to be intitled to its protection, not only at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but in caſe the Almighty ſhould ſee meet further and fully to eſtabliſh it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſaid Author,</hi> in the ſame vol. p 788, in anſwer to ſome objections made againſt the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, obſerves among other things, that it was ſaid <q>The Quakers will not ſupport civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</q> &amp;c.—To which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <q>This is alſo untrue upon experience; for what people, (ſays, he) under government, pay their Taxes better than they do.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Samuel Bownas,</hi> in the account of his life, relates an epiſtolary argument he had with one <hi>Ray,</hi> a Prieſt, who charged friends with an inconſiſtency in that, while they actually paid and even collected Tax for the purpoſes of carrying on a war againſt France with vigour: They yet refuſed to pay Tythes and Militia-aſſeſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.— To which S. Bownas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, <q>We are ſtill of the ſame mind with R. Barclay, that wars and fightings are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the goſpel princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and ſtill lie under ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <hi>with reſpect to the militia,</hi> being careful to walk by the rule of Chriſt's doctrine; <hi>and yet</hi> do not think ourſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent in actively comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the law of Taxes, in rendering unto Caeſar the things that are Caeſar's, <hi>and he may do therewith what pleaſeth him.</hi>
               </q>—Where it may be well to obſerve, that he there ſpeaks of Taxes as due unto Caeſar; thereby no doubt meaning the power that for the preſent bears rule, whether Emperor, Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, King, or Congreſs.</p>
            <p>From what has been obſerved, I think it may plainly appear that friends heretofore have been ſo far from cenſuring or condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their members on ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,

            <p>As it is queried by ſome, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Friends paid their Taxes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the government of <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> although there is as great or greater reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they did, than there is to ſuppoſe or prove that they did not; yet it may be obſerved that the practice of friends, ever ſince the time of Geo. Fox, has been to keep a particular account of the ſufferings they ſuſtained, and the amount thereof, when it was on a conſcientious or religious account, which have been record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and tranſmitted down to as from time to time: Now as it never yet has appeared in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of friends ſufferings, that any thing was taken from them, on account of Taxes, even under <hi>Cromwell's</hi> government, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of ſafety, or any of the then powers, which, if on a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious account, they had refuſed to pay, would have amounted to a very conſiderable ſum, equal if not ſuperior to any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by them, and would no doubt have been taken particular notice of amongſt their other ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; but as nothing of this kind appears, it is therefore <hi>more than probable,</hi> and may be very ſafely concluded, that they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in theſe reſpects to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral governments, of what kind ſoever, under which they lived; and that they paid their Taxes for the ſupport of thoſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in common with other men, according to their uniform practice as a people.</p>
            <p>To the above Teſtimony of the dead, let us attend alſo to one of the living, an anonymus author; though well known to be Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Davis; a worthy friend and miniſter of the goſpel; in a letter to ſome of his intimate friends on the ſubject of paying Taxes to the preſent government, printed at Watertown about two years ago, and ſold by B. Edes, near the Bridge, has fully declared his ſentiments in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</p>
            <p>"If it be ſafe to follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our predeceſſors, why not comply.—"What did they do?"—I anſwer, they have from their very firſt appearance, as a ſeparate ſociety, been ſubject to ſuch who were inveſted with the authority of the nation, without meddling with the various diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes that have ariſen ſince their
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015843_0017_0F9A2C9C8FD8C728"/>time, concerning regal authority, and on whom it ought to devolve. For a farther conſideration hereof, you may remember, that Friends made their appearance in the reign of King Charles the Firſt; who by his too much aſpiring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſovereignty or deſpotiſm, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed the people; who, headed by Oliver Cromwell, prevailed againſt the king, and took the reigns of government into his own hands, and governed the kingdom himſelf, under the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of lord protector.—</p>
            <p>Here we do not find but that Friends, who had paid their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance and their taxes to the king, continued to pay them to Oliver Cromwell, during the time he held the reins of government: And what can be ſaid of him, but that he headed the populace, and was an oppoſer of kingly autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, not merely as ſuch, but as it became, through the hands of the king, ſubverſive of the rights and priviledges of the people: What harder things can be ſaid of thoſe who are at the head of the preſent oppoſition, that may render them leſs worthy of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taxes to defray the charges of government. By all that I have been able to diſcover, our ſociety in England have ever made a point of being careful and exact in paying all taxes that are legally aſſeſſed, except the Prieſts rates.</p>
            <p>After CROMWELL, king Charles the ſecond came to the throne, and they paid taxes to him alſo. After which, the crown continued in the family of Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arts, until the diſturbances in king James the ſecond's reign; who, by his favouring popery, juſtly alarmed and incens'd the people againſt him, that thinking himſelf not ſafe among a juſtly provoked people, took ſhelter in France, which made way for the Prince of Orange. Here we find the line of Stewarts interrupted again, which devolved on them according to legal ſucceſſion, and the Prince, in conjunction with the people, oppoſing the then kingly government in James; much the ſame as is laid to the charge of thoſe who are at the head of the preſent oppoſition; and Friends who were deſirous to live in peace with all men, paid taxes to him likewiſe; but ſay they—"James favoured popery and endeavoured to introduce po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh government, and therefore forfeited his right to the crown." Be it ſo—but is favouring popery the only inſtance in which the kings of England can forfeit their rights to reign over a free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?"—I ſhould think, that when the ſword is put into the hands of a king, to be directed <hi>for the puniſhment of evil doers, and praiſe to them that do well,</hi> we might have ſome reaſon to expect him to act, in ſome meaſure, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to his exalted ſtation, and the truſt the people have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in him, (askingly authority originates from the people)—But if to the contrary he ſhould act ſo far below his exalted ſtation as to turn the point of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e ſword at the vitals of the people, it muſt be very alarming, eſpecially when they have confer'd all the favours upon him, that were in their power, conſiſtent with the ſafety of the kingdom, he as fully for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits his right to reign over them, as in the caſe of popery.</p>
            <p>Every conſiderate man, no doubt, would be glad of ſuch a
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015843_0018_0F9A2C9D4FD3C200"/>form of government as might be unexceptionable; but we have no reaſon to expect it, in this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate of things: Yet we ought to uſe all juſt and reaſonable means to rectify all diſorders in government, that are in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of our power, conſiſtent with the peaceable profeſſion we make; and at the ſame time, to be as careful not to complain without juſt cauſe, but be as content as we can, under ſuch a form of government, as it hath pleaſed Divine Providence to caſt our lots: And it muſt be a very bad one indeed, that is not preferable to a ſtate of anarchy. In a word, let a man be under any form of government he can imagine to himſelf, where he receives any advantage by it, and while he remains under it, he ought to bear his proportion of the charge of it; for the thoughts of having our lives and every thing that is near and dear to us, lie wholly at the mercy of every invader, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any poſſibility of redreſs from any legal authority, I ſhould think would incline us to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to bear our juſt proportion of the charge of ſuch government as we are under, if it ſhould not in every reſpect be conſiſtent with the moſt perfect ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour hath ſet this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in an indiſputable light to me, by the converſation he had with Peter on that ſubject, at a time when thoſe who received tribute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money came to Peter querying with him, whether their <hi>Maſter paid Tribute</hi> or not, <hi>Peter ſaid</hi> he did. Chriſt willing, it appears, to take advantage of this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to leave an example to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ages of his approbation of paying taxes, in a caſe ſimilar to the preſent, in every thing eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the preſent argument, and as an additional weight to the holy example, introduc'd a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with Peter, not waiting for him to introduce it, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound any queſtions on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but <hi>prevented him,</hi> as if with deſign to remove every heſitation, proceeded thus, <hi>What thinkeſt thou Simon, of whom do the kings of earth take cuſtom or tribute, of their own children or of ſtrangers? Peter ſaith unto him, of ſtrangers. Jeſus ſaith unto him, Then are the children free.</hi> As much as if he had ſaid, "then have they no juſt demand on us, we being children, may very well refuſe paying of it.—Nevertheleſs, leaſt we ſhould offend them, it is beſt it ſhould be paid, therefore I would have thee do it," which he was enabled to do by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary miracle. I cannot ſee how it is poſſible for any thing to be expreſs'd more clearly to remove every ſcruple. It is further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that there is not one word of objection either from Chriſt or Peter, that part of this tribute money went to defray mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary charges, (for it undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did) which we might expect to find here if any where, ſeeing they were then upon the point of paying taxes.</p>
            <p>If our rulers purſue meaſures for the defence and ſupport of civil government, that we think not ſtrictly conſiſtent with the rules of the goſpel, even by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling force by force, to the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of human blood, it is out of our power to help it; they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the defence of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as it ſuits them beſt; and if their manner doth not ſuit us, that may not hinder, but we may
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015843_0019_0F9A2C9E842C6F88"/>receive as much advantage from it as if they purſued ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures as we may think we could point out. However, let them proceed in a hoſtile manner or not, in the defence of our rights and privileges, it is certain, if we receive advantage from civil government, we ought to bear our part of the charge of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of it, or elſe have no recourſe to it in any caſe whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; for it would be very odd for us to ſeek protection againſt the encroachments or abuſe of our fellow creatures, from an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that we refuſe to help to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. It may farther be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the tribute that Peter paid by our Saviour's direction, was at a time when the Jews were under the Romans and Ceſar at great expence in ſupporting his legions for the defence of his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: That as Chriſt by the hand of Peter, paid a tax, He muſt conſequently pay a proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of ſuch charge.</p>
            <p>In one place Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Caeſar the things that are his;</hi> but in the inſtance before us, he ſets us an example of paying the requiſition of civil authority, not only when the ſoldiers recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a part of it, but even where not ſtrictly due, rather than give offence; altho' it helped to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a government under which they (<hi>i. c.</hi> the Jews) were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The matter now under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is ſerious. Many valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble members of ſociety, both public and private, at this time, in different places, do not think themſelves called or bound to join in the refuſals and ſcruples which ſome make, and many more who have not yet fully conſidered the matter, will probably be of the ſame mind; if this be allowed, which I believe may ſafely be done, will it not be exceeding hard that they ſhould be denied the privileges of that ſociety, in whoſe ways they have been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and whoſe religious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples they profeſs and hold, and to which they are cloſely attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? In time paſt, though there was diverſity of ſentiments with regard to ſome matters, yet we bore one with another without cenſure, in that ſpirit of conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion and brotherly regard, which is peculiarly characteriſtic of the followers of the lamb, and ſhall we now, in very ſimilar ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, give up that chriſtian tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, caſt one another off, and produce a ſparation, when love and union might be preſerved as well as in former days, and for which there is probably as much occaſion as ever there was ſince the foundation of the province.</p>
            <p>If indeed we think it proper as a ſociety, to maintain an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the preſent powers of government, in civil as well as religious reſpects, it may preclude the uſe of the preſent obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or at leaſt render any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which might be expected
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015843_0020_0F9A2C9ED1C22868"/>from them, very improbable; but as that would appear to be ſo contrary to the profeſſion we have made, as well as inconſiſtent with our eſtabliſhed principles, that I preſume it cannot really be the caſe: I have therefore taken the freedom of laying theſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before us for our ſerious conſideration.</p>
            <p>Never was there a people more deeply intereſted in the event of public proceedings, than we now are. We are conſiderably nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in various parts of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and particularly ſo in this ſtate. We are not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted ourſelves, but future ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations may likewiſe be deeply affected by the part we now act. I wiſh us therefore ſo to conduct, as that Jew nor Gentile, or the church of Chriſt, either at this or any future time, may have juſt occaſion of offence.</p>
            <p>Now, notwithſtanding what has been offered, as there may be ſome who may alledge that their ſcruples and non compliance with the demands of the preſent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as to civil affairs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes from a principle of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which I am ſenſible is a very delicate point to touch upon, yet as I have no other end in view, but the good of ſociety, as well as individuals, I would therefore beg them to conſider that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, according to the general idea annexed to it, is a very ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred thing. Let us therefore be cautious how we apply is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, civil, and merely human affairs, leſt we make the plea for it upon more important occaſions of too light ellimation: It is deeply expedient for us to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its nature, or what we are to underſtand thereby in religious affairs, and what are the proper and ſit objects and ſubjects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which may be neceſſary to claim and aſſert as independent of the power of the civil magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate: For this purpoſe let us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Rob. Barclay's ſentiment of the matter, who, in the latter part of the 5th and 6th propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after ſpeaking of the light of Chriſt, and the light of man's natural conſcience, ſaith, <q>To the light of Chriſt then in the conſcience, and not to man's natural conſcience, it is that we commend men: This, not that, it is which we preach up and direct people to, as to a moſt certain guide unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</q>—From hence we may ſafely infer, that no objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ariſing from any thing ſhort of the light of Chriſt, can be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to operate with the profeſſors of Chriſt our Lord, as a chriſtian church, in their proceedings and determinations; ſo that it eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ſaid author, in the 14th propoſicion of the apology, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the power of the civil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, ſaith, "The queſtion is firſt, whether the civil magiſtrate hath power to force men <hi>in things religious,</hi> to do contrary to their conſciences, and if they will not, to puniſh them in their goods, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and lives? This (ſaith h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) we hold in the negative — but ſecondly,— as we would have the magiſtrate to avoid this extreme of incroaching upon mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; ſo, on the other hand, we are far from joining with or ſtrengthening ſuch libertines, as would ſtretch the liberty of their conſciences to the prejudice of their neighbours, or the ruin of human ſociety.—We underſtand therefore <hi>by matters of conſcience,</hi> ſuch as immediately relate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man, or men and men, as to meet together to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in that way which they judge is moſt acceptable unto him; and not to incroach upon or feek to force their neighbours, otherwiſe than by reaſon, or ſuch other means as Chriſt and his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles uſed, viz. preaching, and inſtructing ſuch as will hear and receive it; <hi>but not at all</hi> for men <hi>under the notion</hi> of conſcience, to do any thing contrary to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and perpetual ſtatutes <hi>general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> acknowledged by all chriſtians; in which caſe the magiſtrate may very lawfully uſe his authority." — The doctrine here preached is excellent both for thoſe in, as well as thoſe under authority, as it may clearly appear from thence that <hi>"in things religious,"</hi> ſuch as he there mentions, he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the magiſtrate has no juſt power, and that conſcience may ſafely be pleaded; but obſerve the care and caution with which he writes, and how poſitively he excludes from that ſacred claim <q>any thing that is acted contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the moral and perpetual ſtatutes generally acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all chriſtians.</q>—But it may be aſked, what are thoſe moral and perpetual ſtatutes? I at once take it for granted, that the laying and paying of Taxes for the ſupport of human and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil governments, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the authority of the ſame, are material parts; ſeeing they have been very generally aſſented and ſubmitted unto by chriſtians of all ſects and denominations, at and from the perſonal appearance of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in all countries, and under all revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, down to this very day; and without which "human ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety" could not be ſupported, but inevitably verge into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ruin:—From which I would as conciſely as poſſible, according to the worthy author's manner, and nearly in his own words, lay down a poſition, and then draw and prove what I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend to be an undeniable and conclutive argument, as follows: —Poſ. That it is unlawful and improper to counteract the moral and perpetual ſtatutes generally acknowledged by chriſtians.</p>
            <p>But the laying and paying of Taxes for the ſupport of human and civil governments, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the authority of the ſame, are of thoſe moral and perpetual ſtatutes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Therefore, it is unlawful and improper to counteract them.</p>
            <p>If the cauſe of refuſal and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliance were a matter of mere
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015843_0022_0F9A2CA051CDD898"/>faith and conſcience toward God, the caſe would be exceedingly different, and there would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be no diſſent; but as it appears to be only of civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and relates ſolely to human affairs, it is therefore apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not cenſurable by the church, or properly cognizable thereby: And here I cannot but remark one reaſon why I believe many among us are led into a miſtake, and ſcruples ariſe againſt paying of Taxes for want of a well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed judgment. It is a receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed opinion among us, that all wars without diſtinction are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: Hence ariſes this ſcruple a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt paying of Taxes for the ſupport of war; but this is not the genuine doctrine of our anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent friends, as will fully appear in the following extract from the writings of Iſaac Pennington, where ſpeaking to what he very properly ſtiles "a weighty queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning the magiſtrates protection of the innocent." It is to be obſerved, that this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned author views magiſtracy and defenſive war, as the ſame thing, or, if I may uſe a ſimile, as one building (tho' conſiſting of divers parts) ſtanding on the ſame foundation. The queſtion is as follows: Vol. 1ſt, p. 444. <q>Whether the magiſtrate, in righteouſneſs and equity, is engaged to defend ſuch, who (by the peaceableneſs and love which God hath wrought in their ſpirits, and by that law of life, mercy, good-will, and forgiveneſs, which God, by his own finger, hath written in their hearts) are taken off from fighting, and cannot uſe a weapon deſtructive to any creature.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer: <q>Magiſtracy was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by God for the defence of the people; not only of thoſe who have ability, and can fight for them, but of ſuch alſo who cannot, or are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the love and law of God, written in their hearts ſo to do. Thus women, children, ſick perſons, aged perſons, and alſo prieſts in nations (who have ability to fight, but are exempted by their function, which is not equivalent to the exemption which God makes by the law of his ſpirit in the heart) have the benefit of the law, and of the magiſtrates protection, without fighting for the defence of either.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now if magiſtracy be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, and it be the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates duty to defend ſuch, who are either not able, or cannot for conſcience ſake defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; is it poſſible any can be right who lay waſte this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or ſpeak of ſuch defence as ſinful? If any man be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God to defend my life, is it poſſible that God can authoriſe me to call him a ſinner for doing his duty? or is it poſſible that I can, conſiſtent with my duty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe him that tribute which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to enable him thus to defend me?

            <p>A candid and judicious author, to wit, Richard Finch, in a Treatiſe called Second Thoughts concerning War, ſee page 95, after the above quotation, further adds, <q>It is evident that this great man holds forth plainly the divine oeconomy I have hinted at above. We ſee it was his judgment that men uſing the ſword, in this goſpel day, may be God's inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and that herein, tho' not come to the better ſtate or ſummit of chriſtian perfection, they may yet be good enough to uſe or direct the ſword to be uſed religiouſly in God's fear: When perhaps many would think that religion in all, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of uſing the ſword, would if regarded, lead directly from the uſe of it; but it ſeems this writer, though a great advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for our doctrine, thought otherwiſe; and I profeſs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be his proſelyte, though at preſent, it there are a few perſons ſo pious, I ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ſoon expect to find the philoſophers ſtone, as an whole army of ſuch warriours: And I am perſuaded a due regard to what may be urged upon his and my principle, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more benevolence and reflection of mind than can be expected from unthinking bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry.</q> Again the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <q>I admire the wiſdom and charity of this writer, in his prudent and generous conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, though ſome may think he thereby gives his cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; but I believe them ſo eſſential to the preſervation of it, that what he writes is the very truth, and that without ſuch conceſſions it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to maintain our ground againſt a keen adverſary. All attempts to explain and defend our doctrine, which go upon the literal ſenſe of the precept, or conſider defenſive war as a thing in itſelf wicked, how ſpecious ſoever worked up or received by ſhallow judges, inſtead of honouring and ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, have injured a good cauſe by multiplying many if not needleſs abſurdities and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions upon all ſuch ill judged attempts to ſtate and clear the controverſy.</q> The ſame author, page 100: <q>The ſword then which in tenderneſs of conſcience thou canſt not draw, may in another (whom for wiſe reaſons it hath not pleaſed God to lead in the manner he hath cone thee) become the cutward providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial means to preſerve thee and others, as well as himſelf; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which principle his arms may protect thy perſon and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015843_0024_0F9A2CA1D07A4AD0"/>property, and thy virtue and piety be a defence and bleſſing upon his arms.</q> Again, p. 118: <q>King William the Third was a great warriour, and a great bleſſing to England, as he interpoſed for its deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in a trying time, when the liberty of the ſubject, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſpecious ſolemnity of preſerving is, was ſecretly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined; and the great duke of Marlborough, inſtead of being convinced of our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was a glorious inſtrument in a warlike way. From what has been laid down we may ſtrongly conclude, that though a meaſure of divine grace, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſcripture, is given to every man, yet there may be an infinite diverſity in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and all things conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it ſeems even impoſſible that it ſhould by the giver, in every age and perſon, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to make preciſely the ſame diſcoveries, and exalt to the ſame degrees of knowledge and perfection.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The above doctrine corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponds with a matter of fact, wherein the apoſtle Paul himſelf was nearly intereſted: It was at the time when upwards of forty of the Jews had "bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under a curſe, ſaying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul." Acts 23d chap. from the 16th to the 24th v. And when Pauls ſiſter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſon heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and told Paul. Then Paul called one of the centurious unto him, and ſaid, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him. So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and ſaid, Paul the priſoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath ſomething to ſay unto thee. Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went <hi>with him</hi> aſide privately, and aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>him,</hi> What is that thou haſt to tell me? And he ſaid, The Jews have agreed to deſire thee that thou wouldeſt bring down Paul to-morrow into the council, as though they would enquire ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of him more perfectly. But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themſelves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promiſe from thee. So the chief captain <hi>then</hi> let the young man depart, and charged <hi>him, See thou</hi> tell no man that thou haſt ſhewed theſe things to me. And he called unto him two centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſaying. Make ready two hundred ſoldiers to go to Ceſarea, and horſemen threeſcore and ten, and ſpearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night. And provide <hi>them</hi> beaſts, that they may ſet Paul on, and bring <hi>him</hi> ſafe unto Felix the governor." It is evident here that the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle's life was preſerved through the interpoſition of the chief cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and Paul heſitated not to put himſelf under his protection, although he had been previouſly aſſured of the Lord's particular providence and protection; the Lord having ſtood by him, and ſaid, "Be of good cheer, Paul, for as thou haſt reſtined of me in Jeruſalem, ſo muſt thou bear witneſs alſo at Rome."</p>

Upon the whole, much more might be produced to ſhew that it is perfectly conſiſtent with the doctrines of chriſtianity, and the practice of friends to acknowledge allegiance to the government that God, in the courſe of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, has thought proper ſhould take place, and to conſcientiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pay our proportion of Taxes for the ſupport thereof; but it is hoped the above is ſufficient with every unprejudiced mind.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of Government, and the Origin of it.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Government, as 'tis uſually defin'd, is <hi>The care of other peoples ſafety;</hi> which conſiſts in protecting and ſecuring them from being deſtroy'd or oppreſs'd by one another, as well as by ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and redreſſing the grievances of thoſe who are injur'd, and preventing the like for the future, by puniſhing offenders. In order to which, the governor muſt have a right to command the natural force of thoſe who expect his protection, to enable him to put his laws and decrees in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Tho' without power go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment cannot conſiſt, yet pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and government are not one and the ſame thing; a man may be in the power of another, and yet not be govern'd by him: It is neceſſary that this power be made uſe of for protection, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which 'tis impoſſible to be protected; ſo that protection and government are the ſame thing: for where people are not protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are ſtill in the ſtate of nature, and without government.</p>
               <p>It is government alone which gives the form, life, and unity to a civil ſociety or body politick, by which the ſeveral members have their mutual influence, ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, and connection: ſo that to be a member of a civil ſociety, and to be under government, is the ſame thing; and to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out government, and to be in the ſtate of nature, are reciprocal, and predicated of one another. None can pretend to be, or claim any civil rights as a member of a ſociety, without owning the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al government which makes it a ſociety: and they who diſown the government of the ſociety they live in, 'do outlaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and virtually declare they are no members of it; becauſe they have reduc'd themſelves to a ſtate of nature, by diſowning there is among them a common judge, who has a right to decide their controverſies, and redreſs their injuries, and in whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations they are oblig'd to acquieſce.</p>
               <p>God, who is the author of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good thing, may be ſaid in a more ſpecial manner to be ſo of government, becauſe 'tis abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to the well-being of mankind; and, by the law of nature, which obliges mankind to act for their good, he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted it, and by his poſitive law ſince ratify'd and confirm'd it. Yet he did not conſtitute any particular form of government, but left mankind at liberty to diſpoſe of themſelves, as (when they inſtituted ſocieties) they thought fit. God was ſo far from depriving any nation of this liberty, that when he was pleas'd to take upon him the office of a king over his own people the Jews, he firſt requir'd their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and a contract between God and the people (as is plain by the 19th of <hi>Exodus)</hi> was the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015843_0027_0F9A2CA41136B530"/>foundation of the Theocracy. And ſince it is not by God's po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive law, that one form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, rather than another, is any where eſtabliſh'd, there remains no other way by which any government can be erected, or that one man can have a right to command over others, than by the law of nature, or by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the parties concern'd. But there is no law of nature for any one form of government, ſo as to make the reſt unlawful, or that one perſon rather than another ſhou'd have the ſovereign admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of affairs: Nor can there be any one law of nature urg'd, why any particular perſon ſhou'd have a power over ſo many millions of different families, with no manner of relation or dependance one upon another, and who are by nature equal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame rank, promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly born to the ſame advantages of nature, and to the uſe of the ſame common faculties. And therefore it remains, that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be deriv'd from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Suppoſe I need not ſpend ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words to ſhew the abſolute neceſſity of government, for the good and well-being of mankind; or that it was for no other reaſon that men parted with their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (for what elſe cou'd be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent?) than the mutual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and ſecurity they receive by government, which is the ſole deſign and end of all laws, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments and rewards. As this reaſon was at firſt the ſole motive for ſubmitting to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo 'tis the only reaſon ſtill for continuing allegiance to them; and when this reaſon ceaſes, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural liberty returns, and then men are oblig'd, for the ſake of their own ſafety and preſervation, to pay allegiance where 'tis moſt for their intereſt and advantage.</p>
               <p>Obedience is due to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not to the perſon who governs, but on the account and for the ſake of it; otherwiſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might be oblig'd to pay alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to a king after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd his regal office. <hi>'Tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a king to loſe his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and not loſe the allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his ſubjects, becauſe they are relatives;</hi> and according to the nature of all relatives, one cannot ſubſiſt without the other.</p>
               <p>Natural relations, as that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween father and ſon, laſt as long as both parties live; but thoſe which are artificial (if I may ſo term 'em) as between maſter and ſervant, king and ſubject, may be deſtroy'd during their lives: and when theſe relations ceaſe, all obligations on both ſides ceaſe. The relation between ſovereign and ſubjects is deſtroy'd, when the ſovereign will no longer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect his people, and ſo freely withdraws from the government; or when he is depriv'd of the power of protecting 'em, and ſo is driven from his government:
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015843_0028_0F9A2CA4D094EF20"/>which, as to the people, (for whoſe ſake government was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted) has the ſame effect: and they equally loſe that protection and defence for the ſake of which alone allegiance is paid, whether the ſovereign will not or cannot any longer govern 'em, and is forc'd to leave his government in the hands of others, whereby thoſe who were his ſubjects are as incapable of paying him allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as he is to protect 'em; and the ſame force which juſtifies his leaving 'em, will equally juſtify their transferring their allegiance. And ſince no ſociety is able to ſubſiſt without having juſtice ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter'd, and enjoying thoſe other bleſſings deriv'd from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; either they muſt by living without government be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a prey to every one, or elſe there is a neceſſity of preſerving themſelves by paying allegiance to the new government.</p>
               <p>For none can have a right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the <hi>publick good,</hi> which <hi>is the only fundamental law of all ſocieties;</hi> contrary to which, no law (and conſequently no le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal right, which is built upon law) can be valid; to which, as to a center, each man's actions ought to tend, becauſe the more univerſal any good is, the more it ought to be imbrac'd: And <hi>ſocieties cou'd not ſubſiſt, but muſt neceſſarily fall into a ſtate of war and confuſion, if every man ſhou'd prefer the advantage of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon before the good of the whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As every particular perſon's intereſt muſt yield to the general good of the ſociety, ſo muſt that of a particular ſociety to the more univerſal good of all ſocieties; and no principles can be true, (however they may ſerve a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular turn) which, if generally practis'd, wou'd be againſt the good of all ſocieties. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more deſtructive and pernicious to all human ſocieties, than thoſe principles which aſſert that allegiance muſt be only paid to him who has a legal title; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it muſt oblige vaſt numbers in all revolutions to be deſtroy'd for the ſake of a ſingle perſon, rather than ſubmit to another who is in the ſame ſtation, and by whoſe power they might be govern'd and protected.</p>
               <p>Can it be ſuppos'd, that when men ſubmitted to government, (becauſe 'twas abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for their preſervation) they did it on ſuch terms, as ſhou'd oblige 'em in ſo many caſes to run into thoſe inconveniences which they deſir'd to ſhun, rather than live peaceably under a government which actually protects 'em?</p>
               <p>Nothing can juſtify ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, unleſs the <hi>miſery</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> not the <hi>preſervation</hi> of human ſocieties, be the <hi>ſupreme law;</hi> or that 'tis a ſin to act for the general good of a ſociety, and a duty in the people to expoſe themſelves to certain deſtruction, rather than act for their own good in a matter ſolely inſtituted for their benefit.</p>
               <p>A man may be oblig'd to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer rather than act againſt his duty; but that he ſhou'd be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd to ſuffer rather than do his duty, in promoting the general good of the nation, is a ſtrange paradox. If it be a duty to act for the publick good, and the general intereſt of a ſociety; and it the more univerſal the good be, the more it ought to be ſought for; then the means neceſſary to
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015843_0029_0F9A2CA59018FCA8"/>this duty, or end, muſt be as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as the end itſelf, becauſe the end preſcribes the means.</p>
               <p>The paying obedience to thoſe in poſſeſſion, is a doctrine which tends ſo much to the intereſt of human ſocieties, and of all the particular members thereof, that even they who oppoſe it, did they conſult their own happineſs, muſt wiſh it were true: And what greater argument can there be of the truth of it, than that 'tis ſo conducive to the good of of mankind?</p>
               <p>And that common objection, or rather reflection, That 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt makes theſe tenets, which require obedience to the preſent government, ſo univerſally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd, (however uncharitably deſign'd) is ſo far from deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the credit of 'em, that 'tis a demonſtration of their truth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are for the good of particulars, of which the publick is made up.</p>

               <p>ALL writers allow, That the leagues and contracts which princes make with one another, do oblige them no longer than they are in poſſeſſion of their kingdoms; becauſe the ſole rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of making theſe leagues were upon the power each king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had to afford mutual aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and benefit to one another. And if this be a conſtant practice with kings, that their treaties o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige them no longer than while each king has poſſeſſion of his kingdom; why will they not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame reaſon to hold for ſubjects, that they ſhou'd be free from all obligations to princes, when they no longer receive any protection from 'em? Seeing that was the only ground and ſole cauſe of their paying allegiance; and in truth they cannot be any longer oblig'd, than the reaſon for obliging 'em holds. For why ſhou'd people be oblig'd, when there is no reaſon they ſhou'd be ſo? No laws can bind any longer, than the reaſon for enacting 'em holds good; and when the ſole reaſon which made 'em laws ceaſes, the laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves muſt ſo too: much more muſt any particular law be null and void, when not only the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of keeping it ceaſes, but the keeping it thwarts the general intent of all laws, which is the happineſs of the ſocieties, to which all laws are but means: and there is no reaſon that the means ſhou'd oblige, when the end for whoſe ſake the means were ordain'd cannot be obtain'd by thoſe means, much leſs when they become deſtructive of the ſole end for which they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd.</p>
               <p>If there were a law that ſhips ſhou'd ſail on ſuch a ſide of the channel, and the ſole reaſon, whether expreſs'd or not, were for avoiding the dangerous ſands on the other ſide; ſhou'd the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:015843_0030_0F9A2CA64FB65AA8"/>ſands chance to be remov'd to the ſafe ſide of the channel, the pilot wou'd be ſo far from being bound becauſe of that law, to run his ſhip on the ſands, that he wou'd break the law if he kept to the letter of it, and wou'd obſerve it by going contrary to the letter. So again, if a law, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd obedience to one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon, ſhou'd happen to be deſtructive of the publick good, and of fatal conſequence to the community, the letter of the law wou'd oblige no more in one caſe than in the other; nay, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of not obſerving the laſt wou'd be ſtronger on account of the diſproportion of the number: But the true meaning and intent of the law wou'd in one caſe as well as the other, oblige people to act contrary to the letter of it; and they wou'd be as much bound to pay obedience, where 'tis for the publick good, as in the other caſe the ſhip wou'd be to ſail on the ſafe ſide of the channel.</p>

It is the duty of all ſubjects to do their utmoſt to defend the government; that's only a juſt return, and what's due for its protecting and defending 'em: But if by the chance of war, or any other way, it ſhou'd loſe the power of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting 'em, they are not oblig'd to have their throats cut, rather than pay allegiance to that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by whoſe ſavour and protection they ſubſiſt, and enjoy what they have.

               <p>It is ſtrange that any <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> who are the freeſt nation in the world, ſhou'd think they are no other than the King's proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Tho' 'tis but reaſonable that men who deſign to bring the moſt inſupportable ſlavery on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſhou'd be qualify'd for it by notions and principles ſo much below the dignity of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. While the contrary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are ſo far from being any ways prejudicial to mankind; that it is they alone which in all revolutions can ſecure human ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and make governments eaſy and ſafe both to kings and ſubjects, by putting an end to thoſe otherwiſe endleſs diſputes of titles. And princes may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fears or jealouſies mind the publick good, becauſe it ſecures them who are in poſſeſſion againſt all pretences.</p>
               <p>The moſt that can be objected is, That a prince who has once loſt his dominions, may by theſe principles chance to loſe the hopes of ever recovering 'em again.</p>
               <p>A prince unjuſtly expelled, ought to acquieſce, if he has no way of recovering his kingdom but by diſturbing the peace and quiet of a nation; he ought not to make uſe of ſuch unlawful means for the recovery of his kingdom: and certainly others can have no reaſon to act againſt the good of the community for his intereſt, when he himſelf is oblig'd not to act.</p>
               <p>The intereſt of a prince is only more ſacred than another's, when that of the publick is involv'd in it; but when that is no longer concern'd in his actions, he ceaſes to be the publick perſon, and is upon equal terms with other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, and ought as well as any other to acquieſce, rather than diſturb the quiet of a nation. And there is then the ſame reaſon for not endeavouring to reſtore him, as there was at firſt for not turning him out.</p>
               <p>All the ill conſequences which can happen in this caſe are, That the leſs hopes princes have of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtor'd by ſuch unlawful means, the more careful (it's hop'd) they will be in governing the commonwealth, and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of arbitrary and illegal practices.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>If all perſons, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly ſoever they get a crown, have the ſame right to the obedience of the people, to wit their conſent, then there can be no ſuch thing as an uſurper.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He who without any juſt cauſe deſtroys the right which any prince has to the allegiance of his ſubjects, by making him uncapable to protect 'em, and protects 'em himſelf, may be call'd an uſurper: Tho' the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the former prince's loſing his power to protect 'em, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to the ſtate of nature, and by conſequence free from any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance; and may lawfully, or rather are oblig'd (every one elſe being out of a capacity to protect 'em) to conſent to be govern'd by him who has the power to protect 'em; who being ſo choſen, has the only right a king can have, the conſent of the people, who are as much oblig'd to obey him, as they are any king whatever. The former king is ſo far then from being their legal king, that he is none at all, nor has any manner of right to their allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. 'Tis true, the uſurper
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:015843_0032_0F9A2CA846E03548"/>having done him anjury, ought to make him ſatisfaction, and (if he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The having a right to be reſtor'd by the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, is the only right a prince unjuſtly depriv'd of his regal of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice can pretend to. And when I ſpeak of his legal right, I mean only this by it: Among the <hi>Jews,</hi> tho' none cou'd have a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal right except one of their own nation, becauſe they were oblig'd by God himſelf to chuſe a king from among their brethren, and God afterward entail'd the crown on the poſterity of <hi>David;</hi> yet when theſe were diſabled to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the people by their being in the power of ſtrangers, 'twas ſo far from being a crime, that 'twas their duty (notwithſtanding the divine legal right any of their brethren cou'd pretend to) to pay allegiance to 'em, tho' for the moſt part they were uſurpers, having no juſt cauſe to conquer 'em.</p>

               </head>
               <p>ALL writers, I think, allow, that after a poſſeſſion of a long continuance (tho' they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely differ how much time is neceſſary) a right accrues to the poſſeſſor, tho' there are ſome of the right line ſtill in being. If it be unjuſt to pay the firſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor obedience, I don't ſee how a long poſſeſſion can alter the caſe. A continuance in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice may make the injuſtice greater, but not alter the nature of things, and make the greateſt wrong to be right: Though all things are done in time, yet time itſelf operates nothing.</p>
               <p>This miſtake, like many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is occaſion'd by the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel men draw between private perſons (who are ty'd up by laws enacted by the ſupreme powers) and the ſupreme powers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. By the laws of moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if private men neglect to make a legal demand of their rights in a certain time appointed they loſe 'em, and a right accures to the poſſeſſor; but this depends on a law enacted by the ſupreme powers, who have a right to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of private eſtates as they judge beſt for the publick good, whoſe laws can oblige only their own ſubjects. But what authority have the ſubjects, or the poſſeſſor, to diſpoſe of the legal prince's rights? Beſides, it might juſtly be imputed to a private man's own neglect, if, when the law is open, he does not recover his right: It may well be preſum'd he has relinquiſh'd it. But that can't be ſaid of a prince who has no court of juſtice to appeal to, or any other likely way to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his right; yet by bearing the arms and title, and by other ways, ſtill aſſerts his right.</p>
               <p>How numerous are the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:015843_0033_0F9A2CA8917A49F8"/>of princes poſſeſs'd of territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries belonging to others, and who have been ſo for a great many years? Yet none dare affirm, the ſubjects who pay'em allegiance, are, and have been all along trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. To give but one inſtance among hundreds: The kings of <hi>England</hi> have a right to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>France,</hi> and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly claim'd it by cauſing themſelves to be ſtil'd kings of <hi>France,</hi> and by bearing the arms of that crown; yet none will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the <hi>French</hi> as traitors, who have all along paid allegiance to the <hi>French</hi> kings. But if the kings of <hi>England</hi> by tract of time loſt their right to the obedience of the <hi>French.</hi> and before that time 'twas treaſon for thoſe of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to pay allegiance to the <hi>French</hi> kings, I ſhou'd be glad to know what month, or year, it ceas'd to be treaſon; for 'tis a thing of mighty conſequence to know how long 'tis treaſon to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey a king in peſſeſſion, and when it becomes treaſon not to obey him. In ſhort, if a king can have a right to a country, and it be no crime in thoſe of that country not to pay him alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, it demonſtrates that alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance is not annex'd to the title, but is due to the perſon who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects 'em.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Tho' time does not give a right, yet the acts, or the no acts, that is, the omiſſion of ſome, may in time amount to a reſignation of the right of the legal prince to the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I grant a man's mind may be expreſs'd by acts as well as words; yet 'twou'd be very hard to condemn all thoſe of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who have paid allegiance to the poſſeſſors, before they had ſufficient grounds to believe, the legal prince or his heirs had by their acts (if ſuch acts cou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the right of the next of kin) reſign'd their and their legal ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors right to the uſurper. In how few caſes is there reaſon for ſuch preſumption? If till then all people ſhou'd be oblig'd to be deſtroy'd rather than pay allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, what a deſtruction wou'd it make in the world: Wou'd it not in moſt caſes expoſe, at leaſt the good and conſcientious, to certain ruin? And others cou'd not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves without a ſin, the reward of which is damnation.</p>
               <p>Long poſſeſſion is not at all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to juſtify the peoples obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; for that very moment the people receive protection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence from the new powers, they ought to pay 'em the ſame allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as if they had been in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the government a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years. The leſs time a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has been ſettled, the more need it has of reſt and peace, and the more dangerous wou'd any violent revolution be.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of Protection.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IF any wou'd not be thought enemies to the ſociety, but part of it, ought they not to act equally with the reſt for the peace and quiet of it, and ſubmit to the head, that rules and governs it? How can they pretend to be members of the ſociety, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently claim any civil rights by being ſo, without owning the actual government which makes 'em so? Do they not, by diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, renounce the benefit of the laws (which only can be put in execution by the government) and out-law themſelves? How can they have any more right to the protection of the government, if they out law themſelves, than if the government, by putting 'em out of its protection, had out-law'd 'em? So that 'tis whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the favour of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (for they have no true pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to 'em) that they enjoy any legal rights. If they think they ſhou'd be ſeverely dealt with, did not the government protect 'em, why do they not what is neceſſary to enable the government to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect 'em? If they will the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the protection of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ought they not to will the antecedent, all that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to it? And if it be lawful to deſire and to receive the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which flow from govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which I ſuppoſe no Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite will be ſo hardy as to deny) why muſt not the means neceſſary to obtain theſe advantages, be ſo too?</p>
               <p>How can they who are willing to be protected by any perſon, be unwilling (except they deſire contradictions) that he ſhou'd have a power to govern 'em, ſince without ſuch a power he can't protect 'em? And they who are willing to receive a univerſal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, are preſum'd to be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pay all obedience neceſſary for that end; which is as univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal as the protection they expect. 'Tis evident, that he who is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive a univerſal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from a government, is willing that the government ſhou'd have a coercive power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all others, to reſtrain 'em from injuring him; and that it ſhou'd have ſufficient authority to do juſtice, and oblige all to pay obedience to the laws, when put in execution for his ſake, becauſe in it wholly conſiſts his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And he who is for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment's having power over all other people on his account, ought to be willing it ſhou'd have the ſame over him, for the ſake of others, except he'd be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man in the nation without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and is unwilling to do that himſelf, which he'd have all others (whatever their principles are) to do.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>nonjurors</hi> deſire to be protected, and do actually receive the protection of the government (tho' at the ſame time they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend 'tis againſt their conſciences) 'tis manifeſt they own the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and by their actions
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:015843_0035_0F9A2CAA11607898"/>conſent to ſubmit to it: And what force can a proteſtation have againſt their own acts?</p>
               <p>Do not all who go into any fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign princes dominions, during their ſtay, by receiving the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the government, own themſelves ſubject to it (except embaſſadors, over whom ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns have agreed to ſuſpend the exerciſe of their right) and are they not oblig'd equally with the natives, to pay allegiance; and alike guilty of treaſon, and ſo try'd, if they attempt any thing againſt it? And upon this head, all private attempts upon a prince in his own country, have been abhor'd by all nations: and they who deſign'd any thing of this nature, have not been treated as juſt enemies, tho' in time of war; becauſe 'tis preſum'd, they enter as ſubjects into the dominions of that prince who protects 'em.</p>
               <p>By examining what 'tis which gives government a right to the obedience of men who are by nature free, twill the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear what right the preſent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has to the allegiance of thoſe it protects.</p>
               <p>The reaſon uſually given, why people are oblig'd to obey any particular government, is (no prince being ridiculous enough to pretend a right, as the firſt-born in a direct line from <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>) becauſe 'twas the intent of thoſe who firſt form'd the ſociety, that ſuch perſon, and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors (if they made the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hereditary) ſhou'd have a right to govern the nation for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. But how cou'd they, whoſe authority with their being ceas'd ſo long ſince, oblige the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of thoſe who were not then in being? Or how cou'd any acts or compacts of their anceſtors take away the natural liberty of thoſe who were born ſo many years after, and who have the ſame right to freedom as they had? Or how cou'd their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts oblige thoſe who are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from 'em, but come from other countries into the ſociety; and make it a ſin in them not to obey the preſent governors of any ſociety, on whoſe authority alone and not on the founders of the ſociety, depends the validity of ali former laws, which can only bind, becauſe 'tis the will of the preſent powers they ſhou'd? o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe no laws cou'd be repeal'd if their very being did not depend upon the pleaſure of the preſent ſupreme powers, who deſign they ſhall oblige, till they declare the contrary.</p>
               <p>Every perſon, tho' born free, yet he is for the ſake of his own ſafety oblig'd to part with his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and put himſelf under the protection of government. Nor can he be ſecure in what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys any other way. Nor can he have a right in a country (which is already poſſeſt) to any thing, but by owning the government of that country. And by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the privileges the reſt of the ſociety enjoy, he has own'd himſelf a member of the ſociety, and a ſubject of the government of it. And this is the only way that any (except by verbal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes) conſent to become ſubject to a government.</p>
               <p>Whatever ſociety people chance to be members of, whether their native or any other, they are dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſtay equally oblig'd, for the ſake of the protection they receive, to pay allegiance to the governors of that ſociety. 'Tis
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:015843_0036_0F9A2CAAD091BAD0"/>not material, whether they enjoy properties for their lives, years, weeks, or days; the greateſt part of the natives have no more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, or enjoy no greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages by the government than foreigners, yet they are oblig'd to pay the ſame allegiance the reſt of the ſociety do.</p>
               <p>Tho' they who reſide in a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign ſociety are equally ſubject with the natives to the laws of it, and by oppoſing the government wou'd be equally guilty of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; yet if during their ſtay, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="36" facs="unknown:015843_0037_0F9A2CAB90847078"/>of 'em, as being directly againſt the good of human ſociety. In all promiſes and oaths concerning things not moral, this tacit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is always included, of their not being, or upon altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the circumſtances becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to the publick good: and this is without all doubt to be obſerv'd about government, becauſe 'twas inſtituted for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon than the publick good.</p>
               <p>Oaths do not alter the nature of allegiance, or make it due where it was not before; or any ways extend it, but only add a new tie to pay that allegiance which is due on the account of protection. He who lives under a government, tho' he has not ſworn to it, owes it the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance as he who has; and if he ſhou'd deny his allegiance to it, wou'd be equally guilty of treaſon, though not of perjury. 'Tis evident by the univerſal practice of mankind, that no ſubjects ever thought themſelves oblig'd by their oaths of fidelity, which governments have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly impos'd on 'em, when they ceas'd to be protected by 'em. The legiſlative power, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially where the people have a ſhare in it, are preſum'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede as little as poſſible from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural equity, and to deſign, by impoſing ſuch oaths, the good and preſervation of the ſociety; whoſe intereſt it is, that they who have the publick adminiſtration of affairs ſhou'd not be diſturb'd. But 'tis not at all material whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this or that man, provided they are well manag'd, has the direction of 'em: Nor can it without the greateſt abſurdity be ſuppos'd, that ſuch numbers of men as ſocieties are compos'd of, who are by nature equal, ſhou'd oblige themſelves by the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ues to become moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by living without protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nay, to loſe even their lives rather than own the government which can protect 'em, for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon than barely an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary fondneſs to one of their number, to give him not the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries or real conveniences of life, but only an office (for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is no other) which is but an imaginary happineſs: For it government were a real happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the perſons who poſſeſs it, ſeveral upon their parting with it wou'd not have found themſelves happier than before. That peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhou'd be true to thoſe who have the adminiſtration of civil affairs, is all which oaths of fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity require; and 'tis evident by the words of it, that the late oath of allegiance requir'd no more; and to extend it further than the power in poſſeſſion, is not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable with the reaſon, end, and deſign of paying obedience, which is the peace and happineſs of the ſociety, and which can never be maintain'd, if people may, for the take of a ſingle perſon, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb 'em who have the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of their common affairs: and 'twoud require impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, becauſe a private perſon is incapable of paying allegiance to a king when out of poſſeſſion of the government.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of Proofs of Scripture concerning Obedience to thoſe who actually adminiſter Government.</head>
               <p>CHRIST in the directions he gave, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23, to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and to the multitude, about their behaviour to the Scribes and Phariſees, requires obedience to be paid 'em only on the account of poſſeſſion; ſaying, <hi>The Scribes and Phariſees ſit in</hi> Moſes's <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, all therefore whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they bid you obſerve, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and do.</hi> And he gives no other reaſon for this great obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in doing and obſerving whatever they command, than becauſe they ſat in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s ſear; that is, were poſſeſs'd of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s authority, who in the Theocracy was the chief magiſtrate. Not that the Scribes and Phariſees had ſo great a power as <hi>Moſes;</hi> but as far as they did enjoy his ſeat, throne and authority, ſo far they were to be obey'd: They were then the greateſt, as well as chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the grand <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> which in all cauſes where the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> had left the <hi>Jews</hi> to their liberty, had the ſupreme power both in civil and eccleſiaſtical matters. (There were not in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> republick two diſtinct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent powers, one for civil, another for eccleſiaſtical cauſes) If the people were then oblig'd to pay ſo great obedience, barely on account of poſſeſſion, why may not the ſame direction ſerve for a ſtanding rule to the multitude in all times? And not only to the inferiors, but even to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme magiſtrate himſelf, Chriſt requires obedience on no other account than that of poſſeſſion. If <hi>Ceſar</hi> be in poſſeſſion of the empire, as it did appear by his coining of money, and ſtamping his image upon it, that being a mark of ſovereignty and empire, but not of any legal title to it; then <hi>Ceſar</hi> is to have tribute and all other parts of allegiance paid him.</p>
               <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> in expreſs terms requires obcoience to <hi>the powers which be,</hi> and declares there is no power but what is from God. The Jews being influenc'd by the Prieſts and Phariſees, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd by their law to place no ſtranger over 'em, ſcrupl'd to pay obedience to the <hi>Roman</hi> emperors, becauſe they were ſtrangers, and not capable of a legal right; not conſidering that the law oblig'd 'em only when it was in their own choice, and not when they were under the power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to whom for the ſake of pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>cti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they were oblig'd to pay obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore, to take away theſe ſcruples, aſſures 'em all powers are from God: But had he only meant legal powers, ſince only Jews were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being ſuch, he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd 'em in their error. But the reaſon why he obliges men to ſubmit, will demonſtrate that all actual rulers are meant, and only they, becauſe they alone are a terror to evil works, and a praiſe to the good; none but the <hi>actual
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:015843_0039_0F9A2CAD10D24640"/>ruler is a miniſter of God, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger to execute wrath upon him who does evil, or a miniſter of God for good.</hi> What can more fully demonſtrate that the reaſon of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is for the benefits men receive by government? And what makes the crime of reſiſting 'em ſo great, is, that men oppoſe thoſe by whom they receive ſo many advantages: It is, becauſe they have the power of the ſword (which includes all manner of puniſhment) by which they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and protect their ſubjects from all manner of injury and violence from ill men. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miniſters of God for good, includes all the good they receive both to their perſons and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: <hi>for which cauſe you pay tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute alſo, for they are God's mini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſters, continually attending upon this very thing.</hi> 'Tis their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing theſe advantages to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that makes 'em God's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and God's ordinance; the ſcripture affirming thoſe things which are neceſſary for the good of mankind to come from God, as plowing and ſowing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28, 23 —29. If it once be known, as the diſcovery can't be difficult, who 'tis that bears the ſword, who adminiſters juſtice, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and who puniſhes; and the apoſtle's word may be taken, ſubjection is not only due to him for wrath, but for conſcience<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake. And the ſame apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts, That <hi>prayers be made for kings, and all in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi> Theſe reaſons can only concern thoſe who have actual power and authority, by whoſe protection they who live under 'em may lead ſuch lives; and if it be our duty to pray that we may lead ſuch lives, it muſt be our duty to enable them who have authority over us, to ſecure us in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of a peaceable and quiet life.</p>
               <p>And St. <hi>Peter</hi> for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon requires people to ſubmit to the ſupreme magiſtrate, whom he calls <hi>the ordinance of man;</hi> ſo that 'tis plain, that God by approving this human ordinance, approves it as human, and requires obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it for the ſame reaſons that men a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> firſt inftituted it. And 'tis the power governors have to do good, which makes 'em to be not only God's ordinance, and God's miniſters, but even Gods: for ſince they are not Gods by nature (tho' by ſome peoples way of arguing one wou'd ſuppoſe they thought 'em ſuch, or at leaſt beings in themſelves ſuperior to to the reſt of mankind) it muſt be for the protection they afford that they are term'd ſo; who when they no longer protect the people, ceaſe to be a human or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and then too they ceaſe to be a divine one. And the ſame reaſon which obliges people to ſubmit to 'em, when they act for the good of the ſociety, as much obliges people to oppoſe 'em, if they deſign to ruin and deſtroy 'em. It can't well be ſuppos'd, that God, who has o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd mankind to preſerve their lives, and conſequently to uſe the means neceſſary for that end, ſhou'd require people to ſuffer themſelves to be deſtroy'd, only to gratify the luſt or barbarity of a ſingle perſon, or a few, who are by nature but their equals, and only above 'em by being in an office which they erected only for their convenience.</p>

Object. <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>makes no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of exception, but declares,</hi> Whoever reſiſts ſhall receive dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As the apoſtle requires obedience to parents in all things; and to maſters, huſbands, paſtors, without mentioning any excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: ſo here he declares (which was ſufficient for his purpoſe) that all people ought to obey the ſupreme powers, without menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning this exception: which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily flows from the nature, end, and deſign of government, and even from thoſe reaſons he gives for obedience.</p>
               <p>It can't be preſum'd that Chriſt authoriz'd his apoſtles to make ſlaves of mankind, by giving the emperors a new power, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by no law of God or nature had ſuch a power over peoples lives. All the power the <hi>Roman</hi> government had, was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the people; who, as 'tis plain in hiſtory, by their mutual conſent erected that common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: and what power the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors had, was given 'em too by the people, who by the <hi>Lex Regia</hi> confer'd it upon 'em.</p>
               <p>All that can be deduc'd from ſcripture is, That obedience is due to thoſe who protect the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and nothing can be plainer than thoſe Texts which require it: By which plain and ignorant people may know their duty as well as the learned and wiſe. 'Twou'd have been inconſiſtent with the goodneſs of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire obedience on the greateſt penalties, and yet leave it ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, as the <hi>Jacobitiſh</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples wou'd render it, to whom o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is to be paid. What can be more uncertain than ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally titles are? And are there not innumerable intricate diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, about long poſſeſſion, preſum'd conſent, a juſt cauſe for a total conqueſt? &amp;c. If about theſe points the learned ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely differ, as any one may perceive who examines what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have writ upon it, who give good reaſons for deſtroying one another's hypotheſis, but none for confirming their own, which are not liable to equal excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; What means or poſſibility have almoſt all mankind, the unlearned and common people, of knowing their duty?</p>
               <p>The primitive chriſtians all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long comply'd with the revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the empire; and whoever was in poſſeſſion of it, without examining his title, they paid him allegiance, and thought him inveſted with God's authority: And as the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and other barbarous nations on the one hand, and the <hi>Saracens, Turks</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> on the other, without any juſt cauſe, overturn'd the <hi>Roman</hi> empire; the chriſtians were ſo far from diſputing their titles, or refuſing to transfer their allegiance to 'em, that they never ſcrupled to own their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. If theſe Phariſaical notions had been then believ'd or practis'd, thoſe nations wou'd have extirpated all the profeſſors of chriſtianity as enemies to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and order, inſtead of being converted to their religion, as moſt of the northern nations were. Nor do the chriſtians who now live under the dominions of the infidels vary from this primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive practice, or ſcruple to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their allegiance to any who gets poſſeſſion of the ſacred office of governing, though the legal prince be ſtill alive. Did not the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:015843_0041_0F9A2CAE8FB4A910"/>
                  <hi>Jews,</hi> tho' commanded by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law to take a king from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their brethren, and God himſelf had intail'd the crown on the poſterity of <hi>David,</hi> practiſe the ſame as they fell under the power of the four great empires? And did they not ſubmit to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> without endeavouring to oppoſe him, when <hi>Darius,</hi> to whom they had ſworn obedience, cou'd no longer protect 'em?</p>
               <p>I ſhall add only one inſtance more, and that ſhall be of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> who thought it not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when <hi>Saul</hi> deſign'd to take away his life, to transſer his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, and fly to <hi>Achiſh,</hi> king of <hi>Gath,</hi> for protection, who made him keeper of his head, or captain of his guard: and whilſt he was under his protection, he thought it his duty to pay all manner of allegiance to him; and (tho' contrary to his intereſt, and the hopes he had of being king after <hi>Saul's</hi> death) even to join with the uncircumcis'd to invade his own country, and fight againſt the <hi>Lord's anointed,</hi> his late king and father-in-law; and, as appears by 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 29, 8, he was much g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iev'd, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expoſtulates with the king for not permitting him to attend him in the battle: <hi>But what have I done? or what haſt thou found in thy ſervant, ſo long as I have been with thee until this day, that I may not go and fight againſt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of my Lord the King? Saul</hi> by deſigning to deſtroy <hi>David,</hi> had freed him from the allegiance he ow'd him: for he who deſigns to deſtroy a perſon, can't have a mind to govern that perſon; and if he will not govern him, he is free from his government, and at liberty to pay his allegiance where he thinks beſt. And if <hi>David</hi> expected from the king of <hi>Gath</hi> a univerſal protection from all his enemies, he ought to pay the king a univerſal obedience.</p>
               <p>If a private perſon be freed from the government which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to deſtroy him, the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will hold as ſtrong in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of a nation deſign'd to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd; and whoever attempts it, not only renounces the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the nation, but puts himſelf in a ſtate of war, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares he is an utter enemy to 'em, who are as much oblig'd to reſiſt him, as they are any other enemy.</p>
               <p>Upon this head the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> took up a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ms againſt their legal king <hi>Antiochus</hi> (whom they all along acknowledg'd as ſuch, and who was ſucceſſor to <hi>Alexander,</hi> who had the ſame right to their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as the <hi>Perſians</hi> or <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> had) who was reſolv'd to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate'em if they wou'd not turn idolaters. And'tis manifeſt that God, by the miraculous aſſiſtance he gave'em (for what they did muſt be imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>By what has been ſaid I hope'tis plain, that by the poſitive law of God, by the law of right reaſon, by the law of nations, the univerſal practice of mankind, and the expreſs law of the land, obedience is due to that power who actually governs the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: which right I think has been ſufficiently demonſtrated by thoſe who have writ on that ſubject, at
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:015843_0042_0F9A2CAF4FBC8C98"/>leaſt to lawyers, and men who are competent judges in ſuch points; of which a great many can judge no better, than of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical demonſtrations, which are nevertheleſs demonſtrations. But none can be miſtaken who they are that actually govern the nation; and if obedience for that reaſon be due to 'em, other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries are needleſs.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I hope I have demonſtrated, That 'tis the duty of all people to bear true faith and allegiance to the preſent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by reaſons and arguments which are as firm as government itſelf, and which will endure as long as that, becauſe built upon the ſame foundation, <hi>The good of ſocieties;</hi> and which may ſerve for directions in all changes and revolutions, as well as for the juſtification of that happy one, which (by the bleſſing of God on his Majeſty King William's he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick endeavours) preſerves us in the enjoyment of all our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs both ſpiritual and temporal.</p>
