            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <bibl>Malachi, III Chap. 1, 2. Ver.</bibl>
                  <p>Behold I will ſend my Meſſenger, and he ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way before me: And the Lord whom ye ſeek ſhall ſuddenly come to his temple, even the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of the Covenant whom ye delight in: Behold, he ſhall come, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</p>
                  <p>But who may abide the day of his coming? And who ſhall ſtand when He appeareth? For He is like a refiner's fire and like fuller's ſoap.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE two firſt chapters of this prophecy contain a reproof of the ingratitude of the children of Iſrael, and the contempt which they caſt upon God in their ſacrifices. The aggravation of their ſin aroſe from the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar favour and goodneſs of heaven to their nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in placing them above the reſt of mankind, by the enjoyment of ſpecial privileges.</p>
            <p>The prieſthood incurred reproach by a baſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of their office and the introduction of manifold corruptions into divine worſhip.</p>
            <p>Their violation of the covenant of Levi, provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked God to render them contemptible before all the people: They were impoveriſhed and became deſpicable among their brethren, by the neglect of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014172_0005_0F9332F565D7C268"/>
the tribes in withholding their tithes and offerings. From cenſuring the Levites the Prophet proceeds to reprove the other inhabitants of Jeruſalem for their intermarriages with ſtrangers, and for vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the covenant with their lawful wives: hereby they were ſeduced into idolatry and all the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord had caſt out before the face of their fathers.</p>
            <p>The Jews wearied God with their impatience and murmuring complaints.</p>
            <p>They looked carefully for the promiſed Meſſiah, a Prince to ariſe up in the family of David to be their deliverer out of all their afflictions, and to exalt them high above the nations. They im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached the divine goodneſs for delaying this diſtinguiſhing benefit to them, and ſaid, 'Where is the God of Judgment'. Or wherefore doth not the juſt God fulfil his promiſes, and ſend us deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance? Hereby they diſcovered their diſtruſt of the divine faithfulneſs; and they wearied God with their infidelity and ſuſpicious jealouſy of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and goodneſs. But inſtead of chaſtizing them, as their impatient murmurings had merited, God ſent his Prophet with a new and merciful predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt's coming, and the ſigns and manner thereof. This prophecy begins with our Text. In treating of which I ſhall attempt</p>
            <p>I. A brief explanation of the ſeveral diſtinct parts thereof—And then,</p>
            <p>II. Dwell upon ſome general truths contained therein, with more particular attention. And,</p>
            <p>I. Let us attend to a brief explanation of the ſeveral diſtinct parts of the text.</p>
            <p>The Prophet uſhers in his gracious prediction with the word, "Behold", thereby challenging the attention of his countrymen to ſomething wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014172_0006_0F9332F59F2A8BD0"/>
their higheſt notice and regard. "I will ſend" I the Lord Jeſus, who am the author of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, by the mouth of my Prophet, "will ſend". Chriſt is the ſource of all benefits to the church. "My meſſenger." Chriſt's meſſenger or the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner who proclaimed his approach, was John the Baptiſt. "And he ſhall prepare the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me". This did the Baptiſt, by preaching re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto Iſrael for the remiſſion of ſins. He enjoined renunciation of all their iniquities as a neceſſary preparation for the reception of the Meſſiah, upon his public manifeſtation to the world. He preached that the kingdom of heaven was at hand.—"And the Lord, whom ye ſeek, ſhall ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly come to his temple". In about ſix months after the Baptiſt's preaching, Chriſt was made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, and anointed publickly by the Holy Ghoſt, to his work. In the days of our Prophet the people lamented the inferiority of the ſecond tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to that which was builded by Solomon; yet he lets them know for their conſolation, that it ſhould become illuſtrious, by the perſonal appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our Lord therein; agreable to the words of the Prophet Haggai. "And I will ſhake all nations, and the deſire of all nations ſhall come: and I will fill this houſe with glory, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts. The glory of this latter houſe ſhall be greater than the former, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts"<note n="*" place="bottom">Hag. chap. 2. ver. 7, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> The temple of Chriſt extends not only to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at Jeruſalem, but likewiſe to the goſpel church, which is frequently ſtiled, "His temple", and, "the temple of the living God". Chriſt will always protect his church; he will not long abſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf therefrom. Altho' for their declenſion he may viſibly hide his face and withdraw ſome of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014172_0007_0F9332F6A70FF060"/>
his ſpecial favours for a ſeaſon, yet he will not long delay his coming: He will never leave nor forſake them; he will return upon the wings of his love: He will not tarry, but come "ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly", "even the meſſenger of the covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom ye delight in." Chriſt is the great Prophet of his people and the head of the covenant of Grace; and he will not be negligent in bearing meſſages of peace to the church. He will be faithful and active in his work. The expreſſions, "whom ye ſeek, and whom ye delight in," evidence, that at all times there are ſome who are in a meaſure faithful to the Saviour, who rejoice in his preſence, and earneſtly look for his return and abode in his church or temple.—"Behold he ſhall come, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts". The promiſe is repeated with the moſt ſolemn aſſurances to ſtrengthen our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence therein. The Father hath promiſed by his great Name, that Chriſt ſhall return to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. That ſo they might have a ſtrong conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince it is impoſſible for God to lie.</p>
            <p>"But, who may abide the day of his coming?" However we are aſſured; that the meſſenger of the covenant will come; yet it will frequently be with his terrible Majeſty; in the way of ſevere Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: He will chaſtiſe his heritage for their apoſtacies; and ſend the moſt fearful calamities upon the wicked, who deſire not the Saviour's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. "God will ſhake nations, when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of all nations ſhall come." The hearts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny may fail them: Many may fall away in the tribulation of thoſe days: The cauſe may at times appear deſperate, and there may be an almoſt total defection; ſome may be brought to death in the terrible conflict: "For there ſhall be diſtreſs of nations; the waves and ſea roring." The Lord
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014172_0008_0F9332F71C54E630"/>
ſhall break forth in his glory, from a dark and pitchy Cloud.—"And who ſhall ſtand when he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth?" Who ſhall perſevere in the midſt of theſe diſtreſſes? Who ſhall maintain their integrity? who be found faithful to the end? The Prophet's words intimate, that very few would ſtand the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. "For he is like a refiner's fire, and like fuller's ſoap." Fire is for the purification of metals. Silver and Gold are caſt thereinto to burn up the droſs. The fuller's ſoap is uſed to take out the ſpots in cloaths and garments. Gold is caſt into the furnace, into the extremity of heat, before the alloy, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate metals are conſumed; when it returns, it comes forth pure gold. And likewiſe cloaths go through a ſevere purification before all the blem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhes are waſhed away. Chriſt is like this fire and ſoap; he raiſes the fire of affliction and perſecution to purge away the ſins of his people. Many are waſhed away in the filth: Many are conſumed with the droſs. God's children are ſeverely tried: Many of their darling ſins are burnt up. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes in them, the wood, the hay and the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Things very precious to them. They are often feeble and ſore-broken under divine judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and are ready to cry out with the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. 74. 1.</note>, "O God, why haſt thou caſt us off fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? why doth thine anger ſmoke againſt the ſheep of thy paſture?" Chriſt comes "with the fan in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor: He ſhall gather the wheat into his garner, and burn up the chaff with unquenchable Fire."</p>
            <p>Thus I have explained each part of our text ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately. Let us ſee how the promiſe which is twice repeated with ſo much ſolemnity, was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as it referred immediately to the Jews—In due
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014172_0009_0F9332F7CC972CD0"/>
time, John the Baptiſt, our Lord's forerunner, preached in the deſert of Judea the baptiſm of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for the remiſſion of ſins.<note n="*" place="bottom">Luk. 3.</note> He cried ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtraight. He warned the people, that the Kingdom of Heaven was at hand. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, while he was fulfilling his courſe, Chriſt came and was baptized of him in Jordan, and ſet up his public adminiſtrations. He came with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Authority. His doctrines were unexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. He had his fan in his hand. He caſt off the Scribes and Phariſees and Jewiſh doctors: diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed their fond hopes of diſtinction: He refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to aſſociate with them. He choſe his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers among the deſpiſed and rejected of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe were led into ſuch tribulation, that their hearts miſgave them, and finally when the meſſenger of the covenant was cut off in the midſt of his week, they all forſook him and fled. And after his Reſurrection, the church was beſet with all the malice of a rancorous and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting zeal. They were murdered; they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed; they were waſted and laid moſt deſolate, until the iniquities of their perſecutors were full. Then Chriſt came in fearful Judgments to avenge his Blood and the Blood of his Martyrs, and the breach of his covenant.<note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 24.—Luk. 21.</note> There were wars and rumours of wars. Nation roſe again Nation, and Kingdom againſt Kingdom; there were Famines and Peſtilences, and Earthquakes, in divers places; and ſuch tribulation as was not from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, even unto that time; no, nor ever ſhall be. And had not God ſhortned thoſe days, no fleſh would have been ſaved; but for the Elect's ſake, he ſhortened them.—<note n="‡" place="bottom">Joſephus,</note> There were

voices and ſights in the air; the moſt portentous prodigies; army againſt army in battle array, engaged over the city: The ſound of trumpets and the moſt aſtoniſhing noiſes, to fill their hearts with terror and dire diſmay. Theſe were but the beginnings of ſorrows, a prelude to that awful and final exciſion which they ſuffered at the hands of Titus—Thus did the meſſenger of the covenant come to his temple; to protect his church, and to execute wrath upon his enemies. Thus was he a Refiner's Fire, and Fuller's Soap, And how few did abide the day of his coming? or ſtand when he appeared? But let us now paſs on,</p>
            <p>II. To conſider of ſome of the more general truths in our text.</p>
            <p>We are thence taught;</p>
            <p>I. That Chriſt will defend his church.</p>
            <p>He came into the world a meſſenger of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: And his covenant will he keep with his people. And he hath the ſecurity of the Father's promiſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. 89. 29—35.</note> His ſeed alſo will I make to endure for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and his throne as the days of Heaven. If his children forſake my law, and walk not in my Judgments; if they break my ſtatutes, and keep not my commandments; then will I viſit their tranſgreſſion with the rod, and their iniquities with ſtripes. Nevertheleſs, my loving kindneſs will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to fail. Once have I ſworn by my Holineſs, that I will not lie unto David. And our bleſſed Lord, when he was parting from his Apoſtles, after his Reſurrection, to revive their drooping ſpirits under the preſſure of his abſence, gives them this refreſhing cordial<note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014172_0011_0F9332F9505CA8E0"/>
we have aſſurance, that at all times, and to the end of time, God will have a true miniſtry, and a true church. Although he may in a meaſure forſake them for a little ſeaſon, yet he will return; he will return ſuddenly. The gates of hell ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. At times, the church may decline; and God may frown: His people may go about the city ſeeking him whom their ſoul loveth: They may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain fears left he may have departed to viſit them no more. "But their beloved ſhall make haſte, and be like to a roe, or to a young hart, upon the mountains of ſpices".<note n="*" place="bottom">Solomon's Song.</note> Chriſt will viſibly maintain his church wherein his worſhip and ordinances ſhall be regularly adminiſtred. Although after repeated provocations, and long-ſuffering forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he may caſt off a particular people; yet he will direct his miniſters to turn to other nations; and he will be found of them which ſought not after him. We may never diſtruſt the divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, "For the Lord whom ye ſeek ſhall ſuddenly come to his temple, even the meſſenger of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, whom ye delight in; behold he ſhall come, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts." Again,</p>
            <p>II. God will be ſought unto, that he may come and viſit his church.</p>
            <p>"The Lord whom ye ſeek; the meſſenger of the covenant whom ye delight in". Agreable to theſe words, we read that before the coming of our Saviour, there were ſome who were devoted to his ſervice, who earneſtly looked for his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Chriſt's forerunner prepared the hearts of ſeveral for his reception. Among others, there was good old Simcon, who waited for the conſolation of Iſrael. And there was Anna, of the tribe of Aſher, "who departed not from the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014172_0012_0F9332FA26ADCF48"/>
but ſerved God with faſtings and prayers night and day". Theſe ſought the Lord and according to their deſires they were permitted to depart in peace: "For their eyes had ſeen his ſalvation".<note n="*" place="bottom">Luk. 2.</note> In every dark period of the church there are ſome names which are found faithful; who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly waiting upon God with an humble, firm confidence in his goodneſs, and merciful deſigns to his church. He expects his people to wait thus patiently upon him, and acknowledge him as the only repairer of breaches, who can reſtore again their waſte and deſolate places. When God was about to viſit his people Iſrael with the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious temporal and ſpiritual bleſſings, he ſays, "I will yet for this be enquired of, by the houſe of Iſrael to do it for them".<note n="†" place="bottom">Ezek. 36. 37.</note> Before Chriſt's merciful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to viſit his heritage, he ſends down his holy Spirit into the hearts of his children, to excite lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging deſires after his gracious approach. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of our Lord's return to his temple, after the primary deſign of diſplaying the divine Glory, are the tears and ſupplications of his people.</p>
            <p>III. Chriſt frequently comes to his church in the Majeſty of Judgments.</p>
            <p>When his ſpecial preſence has been for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon withdrawn, his church grows corrupt. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unworthy practices and many unworthy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors creep in. His children become looſe and negligent in their lives, and bring diſhonour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his name and ordinances. After a ſeries of mercies, they are often remiſs in their walk; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to the pollutions of the world; and are proud and forgetful of the rock of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus they tarniſh the beauty of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and give occaſion to the enemies of the Lord
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014172_0013_0F9332FADD0B70A8"/>
to blaſpheme; to deſpiſe God; and refuſe his worſhip. Hereby he is lightly ſpoken of by thoſe who are without. Chriſt therefore comes with the fan in his hand; to purge his church; to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate between the precious and the vile; the gold and the droſs. He ſends his judgments abroad in the earth, that men may learn righteouſneſs,<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai, 26. 9.</note> God's children are chaſtized for forſaking him, for their worldlineſs; for their pride and carnal ſecurity. The dead, formal and hypocritical, he will by his great ſeverity bring to ſubmit to his righteouſneſs, or otherwiſe burn them in the fire of his jealouſy, and conſume them as the alloy in the refining of ſilver. To effect theſe holy purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the church is caſt into tribulation; and this will often bring on apoſtacies, whereby the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt are through fear or malice induced to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the congregation of God's people; or God's people are induced to forſake the wicked. Here by the ends of divine judgments are more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally anſwered. Thoſe who have not the root of grace abiding in them, are ready to apoſtatize from the truth, when they can thereby eſcape ſome temporal calamity, or ſecure any conſiderable good. This method therefore God adopts to prove men, whether or not his fear be in them; whether they can ſtand the teſt of the fire, and come forth pure gold.</p>
            <p>Another deſign of Providence herein, is ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to humble a people, and fit them rightly to prize the favour and protection of heaven. Good obtained through ſuffering, is much the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſome. And when judgments proceed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, God's children will become truly dependant, ſubmiſſive and thankful to him. They who have the moſt diſtinguiſhed reward are thoſe who have
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014172_0014_0F9332FBA86946A0"/>
come out of great tribulation. Theſe have white robes, and palms in their hands, the enſigns of their victory.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. 7. 9.</note> There are, therefore many weighty and neceſſary reaſons why Chriſt in a time of deep declenſion, ſhould come to his church in the way of judgments. The moſt excellent deſign hereof is, "That he may purify the ſons of Levi, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the offering of Judah and Jeruſalem pleaſant unto the Lord"<note n="†" place="bottom">Context ver. 3, 4.</note> Again,</p>
            <p>IV. It is high matter of comfort in the midſt of ſevere trials, that God often graciouſly appears for his church in the way Judgment.</p>
            <p>Were divine judgments always a token of God's leaving his church and people, believers and all others, would be caſt into a moſt dreadful plunge upon the approach of calamity. But the hiſtory of divine providence ſhews that God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from giving up his people; that his correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are very commonly the ſtripes of a Father: And that nothing but a ſeries of obſtinate rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt repeated mercies and chaſtiſements, will induce him to caſt off forever. Therefore when his judgments are abroad, we may hope that it is, that the inhabitants of the world may learn righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs<note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſa. 26. 9.</note> That he is endeavouring to reclaim and bring to repentance a revolting people. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though judgments are an invariable ſign of ſome wrong conduct; yet the faithful are allowed, yea it is their bounden duty to hope, that Chriſt is coming to his church to purify it; to purge away the tin, and cleanſe it from wrinkles and blemiſhes: That he is acting the refiner, and the fuller, and is determined to ſanctify unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:014172_0015_0F9332FC4C8B9BE0"/>
When therefore God's arm is ſtretched out, let repentance mitigate his anger, and hope eſtabliſh the ſoul, that good days are yet to come, when he hath ſufficiently purified the houſe of Levi and the houſe of Judah. It is high ground of joy and thankfulneſs, that he who is head over all things for the church, over-rules every affliction and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs for his own glory, in the peace and enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his heritage.</p>
            <p>I have concluded the general truths which I purpoſed to conſider from the text; I proceed to apply them.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>Uſe 1. It is of infinite importance to every of us to be prepared in this day of declenſion, for the coming and appearance of our Lord to his church.</p>
               <p>The Prophet who wrote our text, gives us an example in ſome who lived in a ſeaſon of dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy. "Then they that feared the Lord ſpake often one to another; and the Lord hearkened, and heard it: And a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name. And they ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will ſpare them as a man ſpareth his own ſon that ſerveth him"<note n="*" place="bottom">Mal. 3. 16, 17.</note>.</p>
               <p>We ſhall all be ſpeedily called to meet our Lord in the way of death; if not in his judgments in this world. It is highly important therefore, that we have our lamps trimmed and burning, with oil therein, that we may be ready to go forth at any watch in the night. And beſide, thoſe who live in ſuch a ſeaſon of declenſion as the preſent, may be called to ſevere trials of their faith in this life.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014172_0016_0F9332FD13FA0B50"/>
It is, therefore, no ſmall thing which I enjoin, that we gird up the loins of our minds, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the conflict. God may prove us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be wheat or chaff; whether we be refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or reprobate ſilver. We may be called to ſhaking and perplexity of nations; to the waves and ſea roring. He who ſtandeth upon the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of eternity, alone knows the events which await us. It is certainly our duty and intereſt to be up, and preparing for the worſt: And this, by every man's mourning for his own ſins; reforming his life; putting on faith, patience, fortitude; and by a good example, and pious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, commending repentance and reformation to all about him. It would be a moſt deplorable condition, for any of us, to be marked out as the objects of divine wrath, as the droſs, which Chriſt ſhall purge from his church. Apoſtacy is a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful judgment: Nothing is more to be deprecated than falling beneath God's hand, when it is lifted up for the correction of his heritage. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be in readineſs, that we be not ſurprized into any thing diſhonorable to ourſelves, or our chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian profeſſion. In thoſe who are fitted for the conflict, it ſhall only burn up the wood, hay and ſtubble; the gold, ſilver, and precious ſtones ſhall remain. Therefore ſet each one himſelf upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and diligent preparation.</p>
               <p>Uſe 2. We have abundant reaſon to think, that as he hath already appeared ſo, the Lord purpoſes hereafter to come to his church in this land, with ſevere Judgments.</p>
               <p>We cannot, nor dare we deny that we have grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly apoſtatized from the God of our fore-fathers. The ſtory of our obligations to heaven, for merciful interpoſitions, would exceed the limits of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014172_0017_0F9332FF0A1F52E8"/>
To forget a God, who hath ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſaved us, and enlarged our borders, and given us ſuch precious priviledges in this good and large land, is baſe ingratitude, and merits his chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing rod. Accordingly, he hath holden it over us, and threatens ſtill further to puniſh our back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding. It is no leſs a calamity, than an evidence of our ſin, that his holy ſpirit hath ſo viſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from us, in his gracious operations upon the hearts of men. Added to our guilt, we have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidences of God's purpoſe to afflict and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify us.</p>
               <p>He hath ſuffered amongſt us luxury, luſt and diſſipation. And he hath likewiſe, as a righteous puniſhment of our diſobedience to his laws, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up adverſaries againſt this land. Men who have had deſigns of their own, incompatible with the general intereſts of the Britiſh empire, moved with a jealouſy of the liberties of the American Colonies, which ſtand ſo much in the way of their ambition, have, by the ſufferance of God's holy providence, been able to procure meaſures, wholly repugnant to the civil rights of the inhabitants of this country. The Britiſh adminiſtration by the force of great abilities, perverted to baſe purpoſes, and by their command of the national treaſure, have influenced the Parliament to enact the moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous edicts againſt us. Laws made, with the feigned pretence of protecting and ſecuring us, and for the ſupport of civil government, have been the moſt direct invaſion of our property, and ſubverſive of every idea of Engliſh freedom.</p>
               <p>They have been permitted to lay us under tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, when we have not even a diſtant reſtraint upon them. So far are we from having any voice in the Levies which are made, that our ſituation is
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014172_0018_0F9332FF46BD1900"/>
ſo diſtant from them, that they cannot even hear our groanings under oppreſſion. We cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve one kind word, to ſooth our aching hearts. They have applied our monies for the purpoſe of ſupporting<note n="*" place="bottom">Witneſs, the exorbitant Penſions given to the Governor, and Lieutenant Governor, and the Juſtices of the Superior Court, out of the American Revenue.</note> civil officers independant of our grants, thereby ſtill further to detach from our intereſt men who have never, as I may appeal to every one, ſhewn any ſuch<note n="†" place="bottom">The Advocates for the independency of civil Officers upon the People, have never attempted to produce a ſingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, wherein thoſe Officers while ſupported from the free Gifts of the People, have by this their dependance, been ſwerved from an induſtrious, perſevering maintenance of the royal Prerogative.

harbour of our great trading town, for nothing but the forcible oppoſition, which a few individuals made to their attempts to enſlave us: And becauſe the ground of contention was not at that time removed, by one who had it in his power, and was under the ſtrongeſt obligations to remove it; they have placed a garriſon in our metropolis, for no other crime, but their generouſly diſtinguiſhing themſelves as enemies to tyrannic meaſures. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to this, they have in a great meaſure taken away the chartered rights of this province, which hath as juſt claims to their favour and protection, as any of her ſiſter colonies on the Continent. They have made unjuſt alterations in the courſe of civil trials; and given the governor a power as exorbitant, as that of a general at the head of his army in time of war. They have annihilated one branch of our legiſlative council: And by the regulations reſpecting Town Meetings, laid a moſt cruel burden upon all our towns, and extended without limitation, the boundaries of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's authority. You may not repair an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way without his permiſſion. But what is the worſt part of the whole, they have put the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious eſtabliſhment of the Province into his hand. You can ſettle no miniſter but of that perſuaſion which he ſhall chuſe. Theſe things are obvious upon the ſlighteſt attention to the Act.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The regulating Act for this Province, together with two others paſſed by the Parliament in their laſt Seſſions, were grounded upon ex parte evidence. The people of Boſton, and the Province, were never ſummoned to make their defence. They were proceeded againſt without legal evidence, and in direct oppoſition to every uſage of law. In the one caſe, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of twenty thouſand freemen, were put abſolutely into the hands of the King and his Miniſtry. There are no condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and limitations in the Bill, by which, after every poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conceſſion which ſovereignty could demand, they can have the leaſt ſecurity of being ever reſtored to the poſſeſſion of their Eſtates and Privileges. And all this was inflicted while they were unheard.—As for the regulating Bill; the Charter Council of the Province is aboliſhed, from the plea of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency. Not a ſingle example is pretended to be alledged, wherein the Aſſembly have ever choſen a Member, whom they had not a right to elect, and who was not qualified by Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be one of the Board. Nor have they pointed out any inſtances of their Male Adminiſtration. A new Council is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, with ſcarce a ſhadow of that antient authority which reſided in the conſtitutional Council, as a check upon the arbitrary proceedings of the Governor.—It is a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fact, that the Juries of this Province, have time immemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, been exemplary for a faithful diſcharge of their truſt.

                     <p>By the clauſe reſpecting Town-Meetings, the Governor's war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant is neceſſary, to render valid any Town Votes, excepting merely in the choice of Town Officers, and Repreſentatives. Not a farthing can be raiſed to pay ſalary Men, or any other town debts. Should the Governor entertain any diſlike to a Man's religious or civil principles, it is only to give his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and he muſt be forever deprived of his living—So that although you may chooſe Town-Officers, yet you cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed one ſtep further in either civil or religious matters, only by his Fiat.

of a religion upon our backs, which every one who is in the leaſt acquainted with it, knows to be ſubverſive not only of all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but of all civil government.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being enumerated, it is but tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, to ſpeak of the invaſion of private property; the commitment of individuals, without the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of any pretended law; and under the form of law, inveſting the Caſtle, one great bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark of the province.</p>
               <p>This is a true repreſentation of facts, without exaggeration.</p>
               <p>Theſe are facts, which cannot ſoberly be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is the protection, which we have been taught to expect from the Britiſh miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the rewards which they have given us, for our vigorous exertions to advance their wealth, and increaſe the laurels of the Britiſh arms. Theſe are what are called by miniſterial writers, our <hi>imaginary</hi> burdens. Our apprehenſions from theſe things, are termed <hi>imaginary</hi> fears. They have not been aſhamed to ſay, that we are in no real danger of oppreſſion; that we have no cauſe of fear; that they have no deſign to injure us. Thus have they derided our ſorrow, and inſulted our underſtanding. "For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it; neither was it he that hated me, that did magnify himſelf againſt me; then I would have hid my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from him: But it was thou, a man, mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance."<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. 55. 13, 14.</note> "Falſe witneſſes did riſe up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not.

               <p>But this is not the concluſion of God's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt us. For ſince the beginning of this unhappy controverſy, many raſh violent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable meaſures, have been taken by ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ourſelves. In the heat of paſſion, and under the madneſs of oppreſſion, many injurious attacks have been made, upon the perſons and properties of our fellow ſubjects. And however theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtify the proceedings againſt us, yet they have been greedily catched at, as an handle. In theſe things therefore, we have been permitted to become enemies to ourſelves. Even the burden of our oppreſſion, and the threatnings levelled againſt us, cannot excuſe ſuch criminal exceſſes. And how are we now diſtreſſed, by the tumult and confuſion of our public affairs. And we have not a little to fear, from the new attacks of thoſe who are contending againſt us. As in times paſt, they will ſtill attempt to bring us to ſacrifice our liberties by high threats, bold aſſaults, and the voice of terror; ſome they may endeavour to ſooth into tame and ſervile compliances. I doubt not they will employ their Treaſury, their Army, their Navy, their Authority, their Promiſes to terrify ſome, and to allure others into a conſent to wear the chains. Nay we cannot doubt of a deſign of letting looſe our natural and inveterate enemies againſt us. They may attempt, and God only knows whether they will ſucceed in it, to revive

This is no <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary</hi> Fear: For the Quebec Bill was made, as it was ſaid in Parliament, and has been repeatedly avowed ſince, in order to be a curb upon the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs of the other colonies. By which we are to underſtand, that the Bill was framed for a reſtraint upon the freedom, and liberties of the antient Engliſh colonies.—We cannot conjecture, how far God will ſuffer us to be afflicted. It is beſt that the future deſigns of heaven ſhould be a ſecret, that our faith, patience, and fortitude, may have a ſuitable trial and exerciſe. There may probably be frequent and great changes in our affairs. At times, our hopes will be led to keep up our vigorous endeavours; and then a cloud be caſt over us, to exerciſe our reſignation to truſt in God. One while, perhaps, the cauſe may appear deſperate, and we ſhall give all over for loſt: We may be threatned with confiſcation of eſtates, with halters and military execution. It is poſſible that ſome of our trading towns, may by treachery and violence, be brought to paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoke. There may be a defection among ourſelves. Undoubtedly, attempts are uſing and will be uſed, to divide and diſtract our counſels. They will ſtrenuouſly endeavour to break the happy union of the Colonies, and prevent the full operation of the aſſociation entered into, by the general Congreſs.

And as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to your ſtedfaſtneſs, and confidence in God, you may depend on it for a certainty, that when your civil liberty is once gone, your religion will be driven into corners. And nothing will await us, but ſilver chains for <hi>Great</hi> ſlaves, and iron yokes for the reſt of us—Theſe are not the fears and dangers of <hi>Fancy.</hi> They are real, ſubſtantial evils, which will always be dreaded and reſiſted by brave and good men. However from our natural love of caſe, we may flatter ourſelves with peace, theſe dangers cannot be winked out of ſight by any of us. The preſent ſyſtem of colony-adminiſtration if purſued and ſucceeded, will leave us and our poſterity for many generations, to fetters; without property, without feeling, without virtue and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out religion. Therefore it concerns every man of us, as we love our God, our Country, ourſelves and our poſterity, that we do not by defection, or inactivity, conſpire to bring all theſe miſchiefs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this land. I ſpeak plainly, from a ſenſe of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as a chriſtian, and a member of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: We know not how ſoon the lips of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful may be ſealed up. Therefore I ſay again, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the conflict, which we may have when Chriſt ſhall come to his temple. But again laſtly,</p>

goodneſs; not from our own ſtrength; not from the relentings of our oppreſſors; not that we are able to rival the army, the navy and the wealth of Britain. The difficulties now ſubſiſting will not eaſily ſubſide. Nor can I think, that this country will ſoon be brought to ſhackles. The foundation of our hope is, that God is merciful, and we are called by his Name. And many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people, however we have declined, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the deriſion which our enemies may make of our prayers, are yet in the midſt of us, who depart not from the temple, but are humbly waiting day and night, for the conſolation of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. We may not fear the boaſted omnipotence of Parliament, ſo long as we have a reſource in the omnipotence of heaven. For who hath any might againſt our King. He delighteth to ſave the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and how eaſily doth he carry headlong, the devices of the crafty? Although we are great ſinners, yet by repentance, and truſt in God, we may hope, that he will deliver us.—For as to men, our cauſe is <hi>good.</hi> Our adverſaries have been the <hi>Aggreſſors.</hi> Our burdens are likewiſe great, and threatning; and to the cries of thoſe, who are groaning under ſuch heavy afflictions, the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth, are ever open. Chriſt will maintain his Church: He will glorify his long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering towards it. And as the Goſpel hath not been continued to this country, ſo long as he is wont to continue it with a profeſſing people; and as the method of divine Providence, is to grant a ſeries of mercies and judgments, for the trial and reformation of his covenant people, ſo we may ſtill humbly hope that the Lord will yet again return to his temple in this land. As public religion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not flouriſh without civil liberty; ſo God will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain reſtore us to our rights.</p>

Further to eſtabliſh a firm reliance upon heaven, I might point you to various nations, much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than we are, and aſſaulted by foes no leſs pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, who by the goodneſs of God, have been the ſucceſsful maintainers of their privileges.

               <p>When Iſrael was greatly impoveriſhed, becauſe of the Midianites, and cried unto the Lord, the Lord heard them, and raiſed up Gideon to be their ſaviour. And he blew a trumpet, and the people were gathered after him. But when the people were too many for the Lord to deliver the Midi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites into their hands, he choſe out from amongſt them three hundred men. With theſe Gideon came upon the Midianites and the Amalekites, and the children of the eaſt country who lay along the valley, like graſshoppers for multitude, and their camels were without number, as the ſand of the ſea ſhore for multitude.</p>
               <p>And they cried, "the ſword of the Lord and of Gideon." And the Lord ſet every man's ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his fellow, even throughout all the hoſt; and they were overthrown with a very great ſlaughter. Thus was Midian ſubdued before Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, ſo that they lifted up their heads no more.

I will point you to an inſtance nearer home.</p>
               <p>In the arbitrary reign of James 2d. Sir Edmund Androſs was ſent with an armament, to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Charters and Government of the New-England colonies; to overthrow their civil and religious rights; and ſet up Popery and arbitrary power. The land was covered with a cloud of midnight darkneſs. Our preſent diſtreſſes, great as they are, are much inferior to theirs. Their new, Governor executed his commiſſion with rigour. Nothing to human appearance awaited this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but ſlavery and perſecution from the Man of Sin. But God moved the hearts of our pious Fore-fathers, to uſe ſome reſolute attempts, for the recovery of their loſt privileges, and ſo bleſſed their endeavours, in bringing about the glorious revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, as to ſecure this land in the poſſeſſion of their liberty and religion, until of theſe late years, they have been unhappily made the ſubjects of a new and bold attack.<note n="*" place="bottom">The four examples given as inſtances of God's gracious inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to aid the virtuous endeavours of a People, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their civil and religious immunities, are probably very different in manner of expreſſion from the original diſcourſe, as the Author depended merely upon Memory in peruſing them for the Preſs.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As there ſeldom ever was a nation, who in the beginning of oppreſſion were more violently aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, than we have been; ſo Hiſtory does not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us a ſingle inſtance, wherein ſuch a number of people, reſolutely oppoſed to ſlavery, have been ſoon reduced under the yoke. It is no ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of comfort to us, that God will probably fruſtrate the counſels of thoſe, who have called in the aid of a religion, in a peculiar manner accurſed by him.</p>

ſhips with Jehoſaphat's, to be broken at Ezion-Geber. However the Quebec Bill may at preſent appear to be a very unfavourable circumſtance, yet I verily believe, that under God, it ſhall be one great means of our deliverance.—Let me therefore exhort you, to humble yourſelves before God for your ſins, the cauſe of his permitting theſe judgments to fall upon us. Repent of all your iniquities; truſt in the Lord, and be of good courage. Put away the vices of the land. Live frugally and temperately; deal juſtly; do violence to no man. Let the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws of Juſtice, be the guide of your whole conduct. Let each one reſolve to uſe oeconomy in his dreſs, at his table, and towards his viſitants. This private oeconomy, and ſelf-denial, joined with induſtry, and a public ſpirit, will enable us to go chearfully through the burdens of our neceſſary, public expences.</p>
               <p>Upon our faithful adherence to that plan, devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the united wiſdom of theſe Colonies, much under God depends. Thereby we have ſome well-grounded hope, of eſcaping from greater confuſion and blood-ſhed. Our defection herein, may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after juſtly fill us with deep remorſe, that we have been inſtrumental, either in forging chains for our country, or in bathing her boſom in the precious Blood of our fellow-ſubjects.—But eſpecially, while we renounce any ſecure confidence in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man help; let our eyes be directed to the Great Saviour of New-England; uſe faithfully the means which Providence hath put into our hands for deliverance; nor ſuffer ourſelves by treachery, by cowardice, by flattery and falſe hopes, to betray our unalienable property, in our conſtitution and religion. In this caſe we need not fear the
