            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I RACHEL WALL, was born in the town of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> in the ſtate of Pennſylvania, in the year 1760, of honeſt and reputable parents, who were alive and in good health not long ſince: They gave me a good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and inſtructed me in the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental principles of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and taught me the fear of God; and if I had followed the good advice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> ſhould never have come to this untimely fate. When I left home I had three brothers and two ſiſters alive and well.</p>
            <p>Without doubt the ever-curious Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, (but more eſpecially thoſe of a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous turn of mind) will be anxious to know every particular circumſtance of the Life and Character of a perſon in my unhappy ſituation, but in a peculiar manner thoſe relative to my birth and parentage</p>
            <p>With regard to my Parents, I have only room in this ſhort Narrative to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that my father was a Farmer, who was in good circumſtances when I left him. Both my parents being of the Preſbyterian, or rather Congregational Perſuaſion, I was educated in the ſame way. My father was of a very ſerious and devout turn of mind, and always made it his conſtant practice to perform family-prayers in his houſe every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening; and was very careful to call his children and family together every Sabbath-day evening, to hear the holy ſcriptures, and other pious books read to them; each one being obliged, after reading was over, to give an anſwer to ſuch queſtions in the Aſſembly's Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm as were propoſed to them.</p>
            <p>I left my parents without their conſent when I was very young, and returning again was received by them, but could not be contented; therefore I tarried with them but two years, before I left them again, and have never ſeen them ſince.</p>
            <p>I came away with one <hi>George Wall,</hi> to whom I was lawfully married: If I had never ſeen him I ſhould not have left my parents. I went with him to <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi>; we tarried there ſome time, but left that place and went to <hi>New-York,</hi> where we ſtaid about three months.— From thence we came to <hi>Boſton,</hi> where he tarried with me ſome time, and then went off, leaving me an entire ſtranger: Upon which I went to ſervice and lived very contented, and ſhould have remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo, had it not been for my huſband; for, as ſoon as he came back, he enticed me to leave my ſervice and take to bad company, from which I may date my ruin. I hope my unhappy fate will be a ſolemn warning to him. He went off again and left me, and where he is now I know not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> forgive him, as I expect forgiveneſs at the bar of God, through the merits of my dear Saviour and Redeemer JESUS CHRIST, who is able to ſave all thoſe that, by faith, come unto him, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing even the chief of ſinners.</p>
            <p>I hope my awful and untimely fate will be a ſolemn warning and caution to every one, but more particularly to the youth, eſpecially thoſe of my own ſex.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge myſelf to have been guilty of a great many crimes, ſuch as Sabbath-breaking, ſtealing, lying, diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to parents, and almoſt every other ſin a perſon could commit, except murder; and have not lived in the fear of God, nor regarded the kind admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and counſels of man.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the many ſmall crimes I have committed, are too numerous to mention in this ſheet, and therefore a particular narrative of them here would ſerve to extend a work of this kind to too great a length; which crimes I moſt ſincerely deſire to confeſs to Almighty God, humbly hoping forgiveneſs thro' his dear Son.</p>
            <p>But as I could heartily wiſh that the innocent may not ſuffer with the guilty, I ſhall, in ſome degree, deviate from my firſt intention, by relating the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of ſome material tranſactions of my life, which, perhaps, may ſerve as a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn warning to the living, of my ſex at leaſt; eſpecially to thoſe whom they may more immediately concern: They are as follow, viz.</p>
            <p>In one of my nocturnal excurſions, when the bright goddeſs Venus ſhined conſpicuous, and was the predominant Planet among the heavenly bodies, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in the ſpring of 1787, not being able to aſcertain the exact time, I happened to go on board a ſhip, lying at the Long-Wharf, in Boſton;—the Captain's name I cannot recollect, but think he was a Frenchman: On my entering the cabin, the door of which not being fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, and finding the Captain and Mate aſleep in their beds, I hunted about for plunder, and diſcovered, under the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's head, a black ſilk handkerchief containing upwards of thirty pounds, in gold, crowns, and ſmall change, on which I immediately ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>zed the booty and decamped therewith as quick as poſſible; which money I ſpent freely in comapny as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and wicked as myſelf, fully proving the old adage, "Light come light go."</p>
            <p>At another time, I think it was about the year 1788, I br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke into a ſloop, on board of which I was acquainted, lying at Doane's Wharf, in this town, and finding the Captain and every hand on board a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep in the cabin and ſteerage, I looked round to ſee what I could help myſelf to, when I eſpied a ſilver watch hanging over the Captain's head, which I pocketed. I alſo took a pair of ſilver buckles out of the Captain's ſhoes: I likewiſe made free with a parcel of ſmall change for pocket-money, to make myſelf merry among my <hi>evil companions</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and made my eſcape without being diſcovered.</p>
            <p>I would beg the patience of the public for only a few minutes, while I relate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother adventure that happened in the courſe of my life, which, were it not for the novelty thereof, might be thought too trifling to mention in this ſheet; but with a view of gratifying the curioſity of ſome particular friends, who have been very kind to me under ſentence. I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ed to give it to the publiſher for inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is as follows:</p>
            <p>Sometime about the year 1785, my huſband being confined in the Goal in this place for theſe, I had a mind to try an expedient to extricate him from his impriſonment, which was to have a brick-loaf baked, in which I contrived to encloſe a number of tools, ſuch as a ſaw, file, &amp;c. in order to aſſiſt him to make his eſcape, which was handed to him by the goaler in perſon, who little ſuſpected ſuch a trick was playing with him; however, it like to have had the deſired effect the crafty contriver intended; for, by means of this ſtratagem, the poor culprit, <hi>Wall,</hi> had bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily employed himſelf with the implements that his kind help-mate had in this curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner conveyed to him, and had nearly effected his deſign before it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
            <p>I do now, in the preſence of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare Miſs Dorothy Horn, a crippled per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Boſton Alms-Houſe, to be entirely innocent of the theft at Mr. Vaughn's in Eſſex-Street, tho' ſhe ſuffered a long im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, was ſet on the gallows one hour, and whipped five ſtripes therefor.</p>
            <p>As to the crime of Robbery, for which I am in a few hours to ſuffer an ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous death. I am entirely innocent to the truth of this declaration I appeal to that God before whom I muſt ſhortly appear, to give an account of every tranſaction of my life.</p>
            <p>With regard to the above Robbery, I would beg permiſſion to relate a few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which are, that I had been at work all the preceding day, and was on my way home in the evening, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to injure any perſon: in my way I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in the ſtreet; what it was I knew not, until I was taken up; I never ſaw Miſs <hi>Bendar</hi> (the perſon I was charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with robbing that evening) and was quite ſurpriſed when the crime was laid to my charge. The witneſſes who ſwore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me are certainly miſtaken; but as a dying perſon I freely forgive them.</p>
            <p>I return my ſincere thanks to the Hon. gentlemen who were my Judges, for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning me counſel, and to them for their kindneſs in pleading my cauſe.</p>
            <p>I likewiſe return my hearty thanks to the ſeveral Miniſters of the town, who have attended me ſince I have been under ſentence: alſo to a number of other kind friends, for the care they have ſhewn to me, both for ſoul and body, which grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude obliges me to acknowledge. May God reward them all for their kindneſs to me.</p>
            <p>And now, into the hands of Almighty God I commit my ſoul, relying on his mercy, through the merits and mediation of my Redeemer, and die an unworthy member of the Preſbyterian Church, in the 29th year of my age.</p>
