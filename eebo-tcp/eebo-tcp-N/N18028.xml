            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>I Believe it is difficult for thoſe who publiſh their own memoirs to eſcape the imputation of vanity; nor is this the only diſadvantage under which they labour: it is alſo their misfortune, that what is uncommon is rarely, if ever, believed, and what is obvious we are apt to turn from with diſguſt, and to charge the writer with impertinence. People generally think thoſe memoirs only worthy to be read or remembered which abound in great or ſtriking e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents;
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:023353_0009_0FBF2DF713CE34A8"/>
thoſe, in ſhort, which in a high degree excite either admiration or pity: all others they conſign to contempt and oblivion. It is therefore, I confeſs, not a little hazardous in a private and obſcure individual, and a ſtranger too, thus to ſolicit the indulgent attention of the public; eſpecially when I own I offer here the hiſtory of neither a ſaint, a hero, nor a tyrant. I believe there are a few events in my life, which have not happened to many: it is true the incidents of it are numerous; and, did I conſider myſelf an European, I might ſay my ſufferings were great: but when I compare my lot with that of moſt of my countrymen, I regard myſelf as a <hi>particular favourite of Heaven,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the mercies of Providence in every occurrence of my life. If then the following narrative does not appear ſufficiently intereſting to engage gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral attention, let my motive be ſome excuſe for its publication. I am not ſo fooliſhly vain as to expect from it either immortality or literary reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If it affords any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="3" facs="unknown:023353_0010_0FBF2DF84EBBBE68"/>
will be fully attained, and every wiſh of my heart gratified. Let it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be remembered, that, in wiſhing to avoid cenſure, I do not aſpire to praiſe.</p>
                     <p>That part of Africa, known by the name of Guinea, to which the trade for ſlaves is carried on, extends along the coaſt above 3400 miles, from Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal to Angola, and includes a variety of kingdoms. Of theſe the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable is the kingdom of Benin, both as to extent and wealth, the richneſs and cultivation of the ſoil, the power of its king, and the number and warlike diſpoſition of the inhabitants. It is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated nearly under the line, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends along the coaſt about 170 miles, but runs back into the interior part of Africa to a diſtance hitherto I believe unexplored by any traveller; and ſeems only terminated at length by the empire of Abyſſina, near 1500 miles from its beginning. This kingdom is divided into many provinces or diſtricts: in one of the moſt remote and fertile of which, I was born, in the year 1745, ſituated in a charming fruitful vale, named Eſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ka. The diſtance of this province from the capital of Benin and the ſea coaſt muſt be very conſiderable: for I had
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:023353_0011_0FBF2DFF7890D9A8"/>
never heard of white men or Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, nor of the ſea; and our ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the king of Benin was little more than nominal; for every tranſaction of the government, as far as my ſlender obſervation extended, was conducted by the chiefs or elders of the place. The manners and government of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who have little commerce with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countries are generally very ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and the hiſtory of what paſſes in one family or village, may ſerve as a ſpecimen of the whole nation. My father was one of thoſe elders or chiefs I have ſpoken of, and was ſtyled Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brenche; a term, as I remember, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the higheſt diſtinction, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying in our language a <hi>mark</hi> of grandeur. This mark is conferred on the perſon entitled to it, by cutting the ſkin acroſs at the top of the forehead, and drawing it down to the eye-brows: and while it is in this ſituation applying a warm hand, and rubbing it until it ſhrinks up into a thick <hi>weal</hi> acroſs the lower part of the forehead. Moſt of the judges and ſenators were thus mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; my father had long borne it: I had ſeen it conferred on one of my brothers, and I alſo was <hi>deſtined</hi> to receive it by my parents. Thoſe Embrenche or chief
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:023353_0012_0FBF2E00816E68C8"/>
men, decided diſputes and puniſhed crimes; for which purpoſe they always aſſembled together. The proceedings were generally ſhort: and in moſt caſes the law of retalliation prevailed. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a man was brought before my father, and the other judges, for kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napping a boy; and, although he was the ſon of a chief or ſenator, he was condemned to make recompenſe by a man or woman ſlave. Adultery, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was ſometimes puniſhed with ſlavery or death; a puniſhment which I believe is inflicted on it throughout moſt of the nations of Africa<note n="*" place="bottom">See Benezet's "Account of Guinea," througout!</note>: ſo ſacred among them is the honour of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage bed, and ſo jealous are they of the fidelity of their wives. Of this I recollect an inſtance—a woman was convicted before the judges of adultery, and delivered over, as the cuſtom was, to her huſband to be puniſhed. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he determined to put her to death: but it being found, juſt before her execution, that ſhe had an infant at her breaſt; and no woman being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on to perform the part of a nurſe, ſhe was ſpared on account of the child.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023353_0013_0FBF2E04E0F44B68"/>
The men, however, do not preſerve the ſame conſtancy to their wives, which they expect from them; for they indulge in a plurality, though ſeldom in more than two. Their mode of marriage is thus:—both parties are uſually betrothed when young by their parents, (though I have known the males to betroth themſelves). On this occaſion a feaſt is prepared, and the bride and bridegroom ſtand up in the midſt of all their friends, who are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled for the purpoſe, while he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares ſhe is thenceforth to be looked upon as his wife, and that no other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is pay any addreſſes to her. This is alſo immediately proclaimed in the vicinity, on which the bride retires from the aſſembly. Some time after ſhe is brought home to her huſband, and then another feaſt is made, to which the relations of both parties are invited: her parents then deliver her to the bridegroom, accompanied with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of bleſſings, and at the ſame time they tie round her waiſte a cotton ſtring of the thickneſs of a gooſe-quill, which none but married women are permitted to wear: ſhe is now conſidered as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely his wife; and at this time the dowry is given to the new married pair,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023353_0014_0FBF2E0684715C10"/>
which generally conſiſts of portions of land, ſlaves, and cattle, houſehold goods, and implements of huſbandry. Theſe are offered by the friends of both parties; beſides which the parents of the bridegroom preſent gifts to thoſe of the bride, whoſe property ſhe is looked upon before marriage; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſhe is eſteemed the ſole property of her huſband. The ceremony being now ended the feſtival begins, which is celebrated with bone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ires, and loud ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of joy, accompanied with muſic and dancing.</p>
                     <p>WE are almoſt a nation of dancers, muſicians and poets. Thus every great event, ſuch as a triumphant return from battle, or other cauſe of public rejoicing is celebrated in public dances which are accompanied with ſongs and muſic ſuited to the occaſion. The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly is ſeparated into four diviſions, which dance either apart or in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and each with a character pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to itſelf. The firſt diviſion contains the married men, who in their dances frequently exhibit feats of arms, and the repreſentation of a battle. To theſe ſucceed the married women, who dance in the ſecond di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion. The young men occupy the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023353_0015_0FBF2E0A146C3DB0"/>
third: and the maidens the fourth. Each repreſents ſome intereſting ſcene of real life, ſuch as a great achieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, domeſtic employment, a pathetic ſtory, or ſome rural ſport; and as the ſubject is generally founded on ſome recent event, it is therefore ever new. This gives our dances a ſpirit and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety which I have ſcarcely ſeen elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where<note n="*" place="bottom">When I was in Smyrna I have frequently ſeen the Greeks dance after this manner.</note>. We have many muſical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, particularly drums of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds, a piece of muſic which reſembles a guitar, and another much like a ſtickado. Theſe laſt are chiefly uſed by betrothed virgins, who play on them on all grand feſtivals.</p>
                     <p>As our manners are ſimple, our lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uries are few. The dreſs of both ſexes is nearly the ſame. It generally conſiſts of a long piece of calico, or muſlin, wrapped looſely round the body, ſomewhat in the form of a highland plaid. This is uſually dyed blue, which is our favorite colour. It is extracted from a berry, and is brighter and richer than any I have ſeen in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. Beſides this, our women of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction wear golden ornaments, which
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023353_0016_0FBF2E0BCA6D1CF8"/>
they diſpoſe with ſome profuſion on their arms and legs. When our wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not employed with the men in tillage, their uſual occupation is ſpinning and weaving cotton, which they afterwards dye, and make into garments. They alſo manufacture earthen veſſels, of which we have many kinds. Among the reſt tobacco pipes, made after the ſame faſhion, and uſed in the ſame manner, as thoſe in Turkey<note n="*" place="bottom">The bowl is earthen, curiouſly figured, to which a long reed is fixed as a tube. This tube is ſometimes ſo long as to be borne by one, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently out of grandeur, two boys.</note>.</p>
                     <p>OUR manner of living is entirely plain; for as yet the natives are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with thoſe refinements in cookery which debauch the taſte: bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks, goats, and poultry, ſupply the greateſt part of their food. Theſe conſtitute likewiſe the principal wealth of the country, and the chief articles of its commerce. The fleſh is uſually ſtewed in a pan; to make it ſavoury we ſometimes uſe alſo pepper, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpices, and we have ſalt made of wood aſhes. Our vegetables are moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plantains, eadas, yams, beans, and Indian corn. The head of the family
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023353_0017_0FBF2E105C49D628"/>

They are totally unacquainted with ſtrong or ſpiritous liquors; and their principal beverage is palm wine. This is got from a tree of that name, by tapping it at the top, and faſtening a large gourd to it; and ſometimes one tree will yield three or four gallons in a night. When juſt drawn it is of a moſt delicious ſweetneſs; but in a few days it acquires a tartiſh and more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritous flavour: though I never ſaw any one intoxicated by it. The ſame tree alſo produces nuts and oil. Our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal luxury is in perfumes; one ſort of theſe is an odoriferous wood of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious fragrance: the other a kind of earth; a ſmall portion of which thrown into the fire diffuſes a moſt powerful

                     <p>IN our buildings we ſtudy conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience rather than ornament. Each maſter of a family has a large ſquare piece of ground, ſurrounded with a moat or fence, or encloſed with a wall made of red earth tempered: which, when dry, is as hard as brick. Within this are his houſes to accommodate his family and ſlaves; which, if numerous, frequently preſent the appearance of a village. In the middle ſtands the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple building, appropriated to the ſole uſe of the maſter, and conſiſting of two apartments; in one of which he ſits in the day with his family, the other is left apart for the reception of his friends. He has beſides theſe a diſtinct apartment in which he ſleeps, together with his male children. On each ſide are the apartments of his wives, who have alſo their ſeparate day and night houſes. The habitations
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023353_0019_0FBF2E15790536B8"/>
of the ſlaves and their families are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed throughout the reſt of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure. Theſe houſes never exceed one ſtory in height: they are always built of wood, or ſtakes driven into the ground, croſſed with wattles, and neatly plaſtered within and without. The roof is thatched with reeds. Our day-houſes are left open at the ſides; but thoſe in which we ſleep are always covered, and plaſtered in the inſide, with a compoſition mixed with cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dung, to keep off the different inſects, which annoy us during the night. The walls and floors alſo of theſe are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally covered with mats. Our beds conſiſt of a platform, raiſed three or four feet from the ground, on which are laid ſkins, and different parts of a ſpungy tree, called plantain. Our covering is calico or muſlin, the ſame as our dreſs. The uſual ſeats are a few logs of wood; but we have benches, which are generally perfumed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate ſtrangers: theſe compoſe the greater part of our houſhold fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture. Houſes ſo conſtructed and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed require but little ſkill to erect them Every man is a ſufficient ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect for the purpoſe. The whole neighbourhood afford their unanimous

aſſiſtance in building them, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn receive, and expect no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe than a feaſt.</p>
                     <p>As we live in a country where na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is prodigal of her favours, our wants are few and eaſily ſupplied; of courſe we have few manufactures. They conſiſt for the moſt part of calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coes, earthen ware, ornaments, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of war and huſbandry. But theſe make no part of our commerce, the principle articles of which, as I have obſerved, are proviſions. In ſuch a ſtate, money is of little uſe; however we have ſome ſmall pieces of coin, if I may call them ſuch. They are made ſomething like an anchor; but I do not remember either their value or deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. We have alſo markets, at which I have been frequently with my mother. Theſe are ſometimes viſited by ſtout mahogany-coloured men from the ſouth weſt of us: we call them <hi>Oye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Eboe,</hi> which term ſignifies red men liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a diſtance. They generally bring us fire-arms, gun powder, hats, beads, and dried fiſh. The luſt we eſteemed a great rarity, as our waters were only brooks and ſprings. Theſe articles they barter with us for odiferous woods and earth, and our ſalt of wood aſhes. They
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023353_0021_0FBF2E1C908FF1C8"/>
always carry ſlaves through our land, but the ſtricteſt account is exacted of their manner of procuring them before they are ſuffered to paſs. Sometimes indeed we ſold ſlaves to them, but they were only priſoners of war, or ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us as had been convicted of kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napping, or adultery, and ſome other crimes, which we eſteemed heinous. This practice of kidnapping induces me to think, that, notwithſtanding all our ſtrictneſs, their principal buſineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us was to trepan our people. I remember too they carried great ſacks along with them, which not long after I had an opportunity of fatally ſeeing applied to that infamous purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>OUR land is uncommonly rich and fruitful, and produces all kinds of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables in great abundance. We have plenty of Indian corn, and vaſt quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of cotton and tobacco. Our pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apples grow without culture; they are about the ſize of the largeſt ſugar-loaf, and finely flavoured. We have alſo ſpices of different kinds, particularly pepper; and a variety of delicious fruits which I have never ſeen in Europe; together with gums of various kinds, and honey in abundance. All our induſtry is exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to improve theſe bleſſings of nature.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023353_0022_0FBF2E200E17BE08"/>
Agriculture is our chief employment; and every one, even the children and women, are engaged in it. Thus we are all habituated to labour from our earli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt years. Every one contributes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the common ſtock; and as we are unacquainted with idleneſs, we have no beggars. The benefits of ſuch a mode of living are obvious. The Weſt India planters prefer the ſlaves of Benin or Eboe, to thoſe of any other part of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea, for their hardineſs, intelligence, integrity, and zeal. Thoſe benefits are felt by us in the general healthineſs of the people, and in their vigour and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; I might have added too in their comelineſs. Deformity is indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known amongſt us, I mean that of ſhape. Numbers of the natives of Eboe now in London, might be brought in ſupport of this aſſertion: for, in regard to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, ideas of beauty are wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative. I remember while in Africa to have ſeen three negro children who were tawny, and another quite white, who were univerſally regarded by my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the natives in general, as far as related to their complexions, as deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Our women too were in my eye, at leaſt uncommonly graceful, alert, and modeſt to a degree of baſhfulneſs; not do

I remember to have heard of an inſtance of incontinence amongſt them before marriage. They are alſo remarkably cheerful. Indeed cheerfulneſs and affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility are two of the leading character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtics of our nation.</p>
                     <p>OUR tillage is exerciſed in a large plain or common, ſome hours walk from our dwellings, and all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours reſort thither in a body. They uſe no beaſts of huſbandry; and their only inſtruments are hoes, axes, ſhovels, and beaks, or pointed iron to dig with. Sometimes we are viſited by locuſts, which come in large clouds, ſo as to darken the air, and deſtroy our harveſt. This however happens rarely, but when it does, a famine is produced, by it. I remember an inſtance or two wherein this happened. This common is often the theatre of war; and therefore when our people go out to till their land, they not only go in a body, but generally take their arms with them for fear of a ſurpriſe; and when they apprehend an invaſion, they guard the avenues to their dwellings, by driving ſticks into the ground, which are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, and are generally dipt in poiſon. From what I can recollect of theſe battles,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023353_0024_0FBF2E25527A50F0"/>
they appear to have been irruptions of one little ſtate or diſtrict on the other, to obtain priſoners or booty. Perhaps they were incited to this by thoſe traders who brought the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean goods I mentioned amongſt us. Soch a mode of obtaining ſlaves in Africa is common; and I belive more are procured this way, and by kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napping, than any other<note n="*" place="bottom">See Benezet's Account of Africa throughout</note>. When a trader wants ſlaves, he applies to a chief for them, and tempts him with his wares. It is not extraordinary, if on this occaſion he yields to the tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with as little firmneſs, and accepts the price of his fellow creatures liberty with as little reluctance as the enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened merchant. Accordingly he falls on his neighbours, and a deſperate battle enſues. If he prevails and takes priſoners, he gratifies his avarice by ſelling them; but, if his party be vanquiſhed, and he falls into the hands of the enemy, he is put to death; for, as he has been known to foment their quarrels, it is thought dangerous to let him ſurvive, and no ranſom can ſave him, though all other priſoners may be redeemed We have fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023353_0025_0FBF2E26CB59F1E0"/>
bows and arrows, broad two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged ſwords and javelins: we have ſhields alſo which cover a man from head to foot. All are taught the uſe of theſe weapons; even our women are warriors, and march boldly out to fight along with the men. Our whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict is a kind of militia: on a certain ſignal given, ſuch as the firing of a gun at night, they all riſe in arms and ruſh upon their enemy. It is perhaps ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remarkable, that when our people march to the field a red flag or banner is borne before them. I was once a witneſs to a battle in our common. We had been all at work in it one day as uſual, when our people were ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly attacked. I climbed a tree at ſome diſtance, from which I beheld the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ight. There were many women as well as men on both ſides; among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers my mother was there, and arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a broad ſword. After fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a conſiderable time with great fury, and many had been killed, our people obtained the victory, and took their enemy's Chief priſoner. He was carried off in great triumph, and, though he offered a large ranſom for his life, he was put to death. A virgin of note a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our enemies had been ſlain in the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023353_0026_0FBF2E2A53D9C980"/>
battle, and her arm was expoſed in our market-place, where our trophies were always exhibited. The ſpoils were divided according to the merit of the warriors. Thoſe priſoners which were not ſold or redeeemed we kept as ſlaves: but how different was their condition from that of the ſlaves in the Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies! With us they do no more work than other members of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, even their maſter; their food, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and lodging were nearly the ſame as theirs, (except that they were not permitted to eat with thoſe who were free-born;) and there was ſcarce any other difference between them, than a ſuperior degree of importance which the head of a family poſſeſſes in our ſtate, and that authority which, as ſuch, he exerciſes over every part of his houſehold. Some of theſe ſlaves have even ſlaves under them as their own property, and for their own uſe.</p>
                     <p>As to religion, the natives believe that there is one Creator of all things, and that he lives in the ſun, and is gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted round with a belt that he may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver eat or drink; but, according to ſome he ſmokes a pipe, which is our own favourite luxury. They believe he governs events, eſpecially our deaths
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023353_0027_0FBF2E2B402B0F70"/>
or captivity; but, as for the doctrine of eternity I do not remember to have ever heard of it: ſome however be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the tranſmigration of ſouls in a certain degree. Thoſe ſpirits, which are not tranſmigrated, ſuch as their dear friends or relations, they belive al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attend them, and guard them from the bad ſpirits or their foes. For this reaſon they always before eating, as I have obſerved, put ſome ſmall portion of the meat, and pour ſome of their drink, on the ground for them; and they often make oblations of the blood of beaſts or fowls at their graves. I was very fond of my mother, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſtantly with her. When ſhe went to make theſe oblations at her mother's tomb, which was a kind of ſmall ſolitary thatched houſe, I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attended her. There ſhe made her libations, and ſpent moſt of the night in cries and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mentations. I have been often extremely terrified on theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. The lonelineſs of the place, the darkneſs of the night, and the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of libation, naturally awful and gloomy, were heigtened by my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's lamentations; and theſe concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the doleful cries of birds, by which theſe places were frequented;
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023353_0028_0FBF2E300A0DC2D0"/>
gave an inexpreſſible terror to the ſcene.</p>
                     <p>WE compute the year from the day on which the ſun croſſes the line, and on its ſetting that evening, there is a general ſhout throughout the land; at leaſt I can ſpeak from my own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, throughout our vicinity. The people at the ſame time make a great noiſe with rattles, not unlike the baſket rattles uſed by children here, though much larger, and hold up their hands to heaven for a bleſſing. It is then the greateſt offerings are made; and thoſe children whom our wiſe men foretel will be fortunate are then preſented to different people. I remember many uſed to come to ſee me, and I was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about to others for that purpoſe. They have many offerings, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at full moons; generally two at harveſt before the fruits are taken out of the ground: and when any young ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals are killed, ſometimes they offer up part of them as a ſacrifice. Theſe offerings, when made by one of the heads of a family, ſerve for the whole. I remember we often had them at my father's and my uncle's, and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies have been preſent. Some of our offerings are eaten with bitter
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023353_0029_0FBF2E3163C39FD8"/>
herbs. We had a ſaying among us to any one of a croſs temper, <q>That if they were to be eaten, they ſhould be eaten with bitter herbs.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>WE practiſed circumciſion like the Jews, and made offerings, and feaſts on that occaſion in the ſame manner as they did. Like them alſo, our children were named from ſome event, ſome circumſtance, or fancied forebod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the time of their birth. I was named <hi>Olaudah,</hi> which in our language ſignifies viciſſitude, or fortunate alſo; one favoured, and having a loud voice and well ſpoken. I remember we never polluted the name of the object of our adoration; on the contrary, it was always mentioned with the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence; and we were totally unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſwearing, and all thoſe terms of abuſe and reproach which find their way ſo readily and copiouſly into the language of more civilized people. The only expreſſions of that kind I remember were, <q>May you rot, or may you ſwell, or may a beaſt take you.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have before remarked that the natives of this part of Africa are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely cleanly. This neceſſary habit of decency was with us a part of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023353_0030_0FBF2E3369592CB0"/>
and therefore we had many puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications and waſhings; indeed almoſt as many, and uſed on the ſame occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, if my recollection does not fail me, as the Jews. Thoſe that touched the dead at any time were obliged to waſh and purify themſelves before they could enter a dwelling-houſe. Every woman too, at certain times was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to come into a dwelling-houſe, or touch any perſon, or any thing we eat. I was ſo fond of my mother I could not keep from her, or avoid touching her at ſome of thoſe periods, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which I was obliged to be kept out with her, in a little houſe made for that purpoſe, till offering was made, and then we were purified.</p>
                     <p>THOUGH we had no places of public worſhip, we had prieſts and magicians, or wiſe men. I do not remember whether they had different offices, or whether they were united in the ſame perſons, but they were held in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence by the people. They calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our time, and foretold events, as their name imported, for we called them Ah-affoe-way-cah, which ſignifies cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culators or yearly men, our year being called Ah-affoe. They wore their their beards, and when they died they
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023353_0031_0FBF2E343925D648"/>
were ſucceeded by their ſons. Moſt of their implements and things of value were intered along with them. Pipes and tobacco were alſo put into the grave with the corpſe, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways perfumed and ornamented, and animals were offered in ſacrifice to them. None accompanied their fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals but thoſe of the ſame profeſſion or tribe. They buried them after funſet, and always returned from the grave by a different way from that which they went.</p>
                     <p>THESE magicians were alſo our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or phyſicians. They practiſed bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by cupping; and were very ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in healing wounds and expelling poiſons. They had likewiſe ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary method of diſcovering jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, their, poiſoning; the ſucceſs of which no doubt they derived from the unbounded influence over the credulity and ſuperſtition of the people I do not remember what thoſe methods were, except that as to poiſoning: I recollect an inſtance or two, which I hope it will not be deemed impertinent here to inſert, as it may ſerve as a kind of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of the reſt, and is ſtill uſed by the negroes in the Weſt Indies. A young woman had been poiſoned, but
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023353_0032_0FBF2E3686C0F930"/>
it was not known by whom: the doctors ordered the corpſe to be taken up by ſome perſons, and carried to the grave. As ſoon as the bearers had raiſed it on their ſhoulders, they ſeemed ſeized with ſome<note n="*" place="bottom">See alſo Lieut. Matthew's Voyage p. 123.</note> ſudden impulſe, and ran to and fro unable to ſtop themſelves. At laſt, after having paſſed through a number of thorns and prickly buſhes unhurt, the corpſe fell from them cloſe to a houſe, and defaced it in the fall; and the owner being taken up, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately confeſſed the poiſoning<note n="†" place="bottom">An inſtance of this kind happened at Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerrat in the Weſt Indian in the year 1763.

THE natives are extremely cautious about poiſon. When they buy any ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table the ſeller kiſſes it all round before the buyer, to ſhew him it is not poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the ſame is done when any meat or drink is preſented, particularly to a ſtranger. We have ſerpents of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds, ſome of which are eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ominous when they appear in our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and theſe we never moleſt. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member two of thoſe ominous ſnakes. each of which was as thick as the calf of a man's leg, and in colour reſembling a dolphin in the water, crept at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times into my mother's night-houſe, where I always lay with her, and coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themſelves into folds, and each time they crowed like a cock. I was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſome of our wiſe men to touch theſe, that I might be intereſted in the good omens, which I did, for they were quite harmleſs, and would tamely ſuffer themſelves to be handled; and then they were put into a large earthen pan, and ſet on one ſide of the high-way. Some of our ſnakes, however, were
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023353_0034_0FBF2E3C55CDF860"/>
poiſonous: one of them croſſed the road one day as I was ſtanding on it, and paſſed between my feet without offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to touch me, to the great ſurpriſe of many who ſaw it; and theſe inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents were accounted by the wiſe men, and likewiſe by my mother and the reſt of the people, as remarkable omens in my favour.</p>
                     <p>SUCH is the imperfect ſketch my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory has furniſhed me with of the manners and cuſtoms of a people among whom I firſt drew my breath. And here I cannot forbear ſuggeſting what has long ſtruck me very forcibly, namely the ſtrong analogy which even by this ſketch, imperfect as it is, appears to prevail in the manners and cuſtoms of my countrymen and thoſe of the Jews, before they reached the Land of Promiſe, and particularly the patriarchs while they were yet in that paſtoral ſtate which is deſcribed in Geneſis—an ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, which alone would induce me to think that the one people had ſprung from the other. Indeed this is the opinion of Dr. Gill, who, in his commentary on Geneſis, very ably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the pedigree of the Africans from Afer and Afra, the deſcendants of Abraham by Keturah his wife and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:023353_0035_0FBF2E3E439D7DC8"/>

It is alſo conformable to the ſentiments of Dr. John Clarke, formerly Dean of Sarum, in his truth of the Chriſtian religion: both theſe authors concur in aſcribing to us this original. The reaſonings of thoſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen are ſtill further confirmed by the ſcripture chronology; and if any further corroboration were required, this reſemblance in ſo many reſpects is a ſtrong evidence in ſupport of the opinion. Like the Iſraelites in their primitive ſtate, our government was conducted by our chiefs or judges, our wiſe men and elders; and the head of a family with us enjoyed a ſimilar au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over his h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The law of retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obtained almoſt univerſally with us as with them: and even their religion appeared to have ſhed upon us a ray of its glory, though broken and ſpent in its paſſage, or eclipſed by the cloud with which time, tradition, and ignorance might have enveloped it; for we had our circumciſion (a rule I believe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to that people:) we had alſo our ſacrifices and burnt-offerings, our

I HAVE already acquainted the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with the time and place of my birth. My father, beſides many ſlaves, had a numerous family; of which ſeven lived to grow up, including myſelf and a ſiſter, who was the only daughter. As I was the youngeſt of the ſons, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, of courſe, the greateſt favourite with my mother, and was always with her; and ſhe uſed to take particular pains to form my mind. I was trained up from my earlieſt years in the art of war: my daily exerciſe was ſhooting and throwing javelins; and my mother adorned me with emblems, after the manner of our greateſt warriors. In this way I grew up till I was turned the age of eleven, when an end was put to my happineſs in the following manner:—Generally when the grown people in the neighbourhood were gone far in the fields to labour, the children aſſembled together in ſome of the neighbour's premiſes to play; and commonly ſome of us uſed to get up a tree to look out for any aſſailant, or kidnapper, that might come upon us; for they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times took thoſe opportunities of our parents abſence to attack and carry off as many as they could ſeize. One day as I was watching at the top of a tree
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:023353_0041_0FBF2E4D5A02E3C8"/>
in our yard, I ſaw one of thoſe people come into the yard of our next neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour but one, to kidnap, there being many ſtout young people in it. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately on this I gave the alarm of the rogue, and he was ſurrounded by the ſtouteſt of them, who entangled him with cords, ſo that he could not eſcape till ſome of the grown people came and ſecured him. But, alas! ere long it was my fate to be thus attacked, and to be carried off, when none of the grown people were nigh. One day, when all our people were gone out to their works as uſual, and only I and my dear ſiſter were left to mind the houſe, two men and a woman got over our walls, and in a moment ſeized us both, and, without giving us time to cry out, or make reſiſtance, they ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped our mouths, and ran off with us, into the neareſt wood. Here they tied our hands, and continued to carry us as far as they could, till night came on, when we reached a ſmall houſe, where the robbers halted for refreſhment and ſpent the night. We were then unbound, but were unable to take any food; and, being quite overpowed by fatigue and grief, our only relief was ſome ſleep, which allayed our
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:023353_0042_0FBF2E51B2BC8E50"/>
misfortune for a ſhort time. The next morning we left the houſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued travelling all the day. For a long time we had kept the woods, but at laſt we came into a road which I believed I knew. I had now ſome hopes of being delivered; for we had advanced but a little way before I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ſome people at a diſtance, on which I began to cry out for their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; but my cries had no other effect than to make them tie me faſter and ſtop my mouth, and then they put me into a large ſack. They alſo ſtopped my ſiſter's mouth, and tied her hands; and in this manner we proceeded till we were out of the ſight of theſe people. When we went to reſt the following night they offered us ſome victuals; but we refuſed it; and the only comfort we had was in being in one another's arms all that night, and bathing each other with our tears. But alas! we were ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of even the ſmall comfort of weeping together. The next day proved a day of greater ſorrow than I had yet experienced; for my ſiſter and I were then ſeparated, while we lay claſped in each others arms. It was in vain that we beſought them not to
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:023353_0043_0FBF2E5A26936978"/>
part us; ſhe was torn from me, and immediately carried away, while I was left in a ſtate of diſtraction not to be deſcribed. I cried and grieved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; and for ſeveral days did not eat any thing but what they forced into my mouth. At length, after many days travelling, during which I had often changed maſters, I got into the hands of a chieftain, in a very pleaſant country. This man had two wives and ſome chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and they all uſed me extremely well, and did all they could to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me; particularly the firſt wife, who was ſomething like my mother. Although I was a great many days journey from my father's houſe, yet theſe people ſpoke exactly the ſame language with us. This firſt maſter of mine, as I may call him, was a ſmith, and my principle employment was working his bellows, which were the ſame kind as I had ſeen in my vicinity. They were in ſome reſpects not unlike the ſtoves here in gentlemen's kitchens and were covered over with leather; and in the middle of that leather a ſtick was fixed, and a perſon ſtood up, and worked it, in the ſame manner as is done to pump water out of a caſk with a hand pump. I believe it was gold he
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:023353_0044_0FBF2E5B42689B90"/>
worked, for it was of a lovely bright yellow colour, and was worn by the women on their wriſts and ancles. I was there I ſuppoſe about a month, and they at laſt uſed to truſt me ſome little diſtance from the houſe. This liberty I uſed in embracing every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to inquire the way to my own home: and I alſo ſometimes, for the ſame purpoſe, went with the maidens, in the cool of the evenings, to bring pitchers of water from the ſprings for the uſe of the houſe. I had alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked where the ſunroſe in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſet in the evening, as I had travelled along; and I had obſerved that my father's houſe was towards the riſing of the ſun. I therefore deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſeize the firſt opportunity of making my eſcape, and to ſhape my courſe for that quarter; for I was quite oppreſſed and weighed down by grief after my mother and friends; and my love of liberty, ever great, was ſtrengthened by the mortifying cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of not daring to eat with the free-born children, although I was moſtly their companion. While I was projecting my eſcape, one day an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky event happened, which quite diſconcerted my plan, and put an end
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:023353_0045_0FBF2E5EA605DB30"/>
to my hopes. I uſed to be ſometimes employed in aſſiſting an elderly woman ſlave, to cook and take care of the poultry: and one morning, while I was feeding ſome chickens, I happened to toſs a ſmall pebble at one of them, which hit it on the middle, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly killed it. The old ſlave, having ſoon after miſſed the chicken, inquired after it; and on my relating the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (for I told her the truth, becauſe my mother would never ſuffer me to tell a lie) ſhe flew into a violent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, threatened that I ſhould ſuffer for it; and, my maſter being out, ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately went and told her miſtreſs what I had done. This alarmed me very much, and I expected an inſtant flogging, which to me was uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly dreadful; for I had ſeldom been beaten at home. I therefore reſolved to fly; and accordingly I ran into a thicket that was hard by, and hid my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the buſhes. Soon afterwards my miſtreſs and the ſlave returned, and, not ſeeing me, they ſearched all the houſe, but not finding me, and I not making anſwer when they called to me, they thought I had run away, and the whole neighbourhood was raiſed in the purſuit of me. In that part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:023353_0046_0FBF2E600ECEBDB0"/>
(as in ours) the houſes and villages were ſkirted with woods, or ſhrubbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the buſhes were ſo thick that a man could readily conceal himſelf in them, ſo as to elude the ſtricteſt ſearch. The neighbours continued the whole day looking for me, and ſeveral times many of them came within a few yards of the place where I lay hid. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected every moment, when I heard a ruſtling among the trees, to be found out, and puniſhed by my maſter: but they never diſcovered me, though they were often ſo near that I even heard their conjectures as they were looking about for me; and I now learned from them, that any attempt to return home would be hopeleſs. Moſt of them ſuppoſed I had fled towards home: but the diſtance was ſo great, and the way ſo intricate, that they thought I could never reach it, and that I ſhould be loſt in the woods. When I heard this I was ſeized with a violent panic, and abandoned myſelf to deſpair. Night too began to approach, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated all my fears. I bad before entertained hopes of getting home, and had determined when it ſhould be dark to make the attempt; but I was now convinced it was fruitleſs,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:023353_0047_0FBF2E620FDE39B0"/>
and began to conſider that, if poſſibly I could eſcape all other animals, I could not thoſe of the human kind; and that, not knowing the way, I muſt periſh in the woods. Thus was I like the hunted deer:
<q>
                           <l>—Ev'ry leaf and ev'ry whiſp'ring breath</l>
                           <l>Convey'd a foe, and ev'ry foe a death.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I heard frequent ruſtlings among the leaves; and being pretty ſure they were ſnakes, I expected every inſtant to be ſtung by them. This increaſed my anguiſh, and the horror of my ſituation became now quite inſupportable I at length quitted the thicker, very faint and hungry, for I had not eaten or drank any thing all the day, and crept to my maſter's kitchen, from whence I ſet out at firſt, which was an open ſhed, and laid myſelf down in the aſhes with an anxious wiſh for death to relieve me from all my pains. I was ſcarcely awake in the morning, when the old woman ſlave, who was the firſt up, came to light the fire, and ſaw me in the fire place. She was very much ſurpriſed to ſee me, and could ſcarcely believe her own eyes. She now promiſed to intercede for me, and went for her maſter, who ſoon after
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:023353_0048_0FBF2E68EB308C90"/>
came, and, having ſlightly reprimanded me, ordered me to be taken cure of, and not ill treated.</p>
                     <p>SOON after this my maſter's only daughter, and child by his firſt wife, ſickened and died, which affected him ſo much that for ſome time he was almoſt frantic, and really would have killed himſelf, had he not been watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and prevented. However, in a ſmall time afterwards he recovered, and I was again fold. I was now carried to the left of the ſun's riſing, through many dreary waſtes and diſmal woods, amidſt the hideous roarings of wild beaſts. The people I was ſold to uſed to carry me very often, when I was tired, either on their ſhoulders or on their backs. I ſaw many convenient well built ſheds along the road, at proper diſtances, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the merchants and travellers, who lay in thoſe buildings along with their wives, who often accompany them; and they always go well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rmed.</p>
                     <p>FROM the time I left my own nation I always found ſomebody that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood me till I came to the ſea coaſt. The languages of different nations did not totally differ, nor where they ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious as thoſe of the Europeans, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:023353_0049_0FBF4A91B208AB88"/>
the Engliſh. They were therefore eaſily learned, and, while I was journeying thus through Africa; I acquired two or three different tongues. In this manner I had been travelling for a conſiderable time, when one evening to my great ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, whom ſhould I ſee brought to the houſe where I was but my dear ſiſter!</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as ſhe ſaw me ſhe gave a loud ſhriek, and ran into my arms—I was quite over powered: neither of us could ſpeak; but, for a conſiderable time, clung to each other in mutual embraces, unable to do any thing but weep. Our meeting affected all who ſaw us; and indeed I muſt acknowledge, in honour of thoſe ſable deſtroyers of human rights, that I never men with any ill treatment, or ſaw any offered to their ſlaves, except tying them, when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to keep them from running away. When theſe people knew we were brother and ſiſter, they indulged us to be together; and the man, to whom I ſuppoſed we belonged, lay with us, he in the middle, while ſhe and I held one another by the hands acroſs his breaſt all night; and thus for a while we forgot our misfortunes in the joy of being together: but even this ſmall

                        </gap>. I was ſold here for one hundred and ſeventy-two of them by a merchant who lived and brought me there. I had been about two or
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:023353_0052_0FBF4A9C3A0001D8"/>
three days at his houſe, when a wealthy widow, a neighbour of his, came there one evening, and brought with her on only ſon, a young gentleman about my own age and ſize. Here they ſaw me; and, having taken a fancy to me, I was bought of the merchant, and went home with them. Her houſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were ſituated cloſe to one of thoſe rivulets I have mentioned, and were the fineſt I ever ſaw in Africa: they were very extenſive, and ſhe had a number of ſlaves to attend her. The next day I was waſhed and perfumed, and when meal time came, I was led into the preſence of my miſtreſs, and eat and drank before her with her ſon. This filled me with aſtoniſhment; and I could ſcarce help expreſſing my ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe that the young gentleman ſhould ſuffer me, who was bound, to eat with him who was free, and not only ſo, but that he would not at any time either eat or drink till I had taken firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was the eldeſt, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to our cuſtom. Indeed every thing here, and all their treatment of me, made me forget that I was a ſlave. The language of theſe people reſembled ours ſo nearly, that we underſtood each other perfectly. They had alſo the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:023353_0053_0FBF4A9DC68B8D68"/>
very ſame cuſtoms as we. There were likewiſe ſlaves daily to attend us, while my young maſter and I with other boys ſported with our darts and bows and arrows, as I had been uſed to do at home. In this reſemblance to my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer happy ſtate, I paſſed about two months; and I now began to think I was to be adopted into the family, and was beginning to be reconciled to my ſituation, and to forget by degrees my misfortunes, when all at once the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion vaniſhed; for, without the leaſt previous knowledge, one morning ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, while my dear maſter and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was ſtill aſleep, I was awakened out of my reverie to freſh ſorrow, and hurried away even amongſt the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed.</p>
                     <p>Thus, at the very moment I dreamed of the greateſt happineſs, I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf moſt miſerable; and it ſeemed as if fortune wiſhed to give me this taſte of joy only to render the reverſe more poignant. The change I now expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced was as painful as it was ſudden and unexpected. It was a change in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from a ſtate of bliſs to a ſcene which is inexpreſſible by me, as it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to me an element I had never before beheld, and till then had no idea
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:023353_0054_0FBF4AA45E435C38"/>
of, and wherein ſuch inſtances of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and cruelty continually occurred as I can never reflect on but with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
                     <p>All the nations and people I had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto paſſed through reſembled our own in their manners, cuſtoms, and language: but I came at length to a country, the inhabitants of which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from us in all thoſe particulars. I was very much ſtruck with this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, eſpecially when I came among a people who did not circumciſe, and eat without waſhing their hands. They cooked alſo in iron pots, and had Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean cutlaſſes and croſs bows, which were unknown to us, and fought with their fiſts among themſelves. Their women were not ſo modeſt as ours, for they eat, and drank, and ſtept, with their men. But above all, I was amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee no ſacrifices or offerings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. In ſome of thoſe places the people ornamented themſelves with ſcars, and likewiſe filed their teeth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſharp. They wanted ſometimes to ornament me in the ſame manner, but I would not ſuffer them; hoping that I might ſome time be among a people who did not thus disfigure themſelves, as I thought they did. At laſt I came
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:023353_0055_0FBF4AA5452D8408"/>
to the banks of a large river which was covered with canoes, in which the people appeared to live with their houſehold utenſils and proviſions of all kinds, I was beyond meaſure aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this, as I had never before ſeen any water larger than a pond or a rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let: and my ſurpriſe was mingled with no ſmall fear when I was put into one of theſe canoes, and we began to pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and move along the river. We continued going on thus till night; and when we came to land, and made fires on the banks, each family by themſelves ſome dragged their canoes on ſhore, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſtayed and cooked in theirs, and laid in them all night. Thoſe on the land had mats, of which they made tents, ſome in the ſhape of little hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: in theſe we ſlept: and after the morning meal, we embarked again and proceeded as before. I was often very much aſtoniſhed to ſee ſome of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as well as the men, jump into the water, dive to the bottom, come up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ſwim about Thus I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to travel, ſometimes by land, ſometimes by water, through different countries and various nations, till, at the end of ſix or ſeven months after I had been kidnapped, I arrived at the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:023353_0056_0FBF4AA6C1652D80"/>
ſea coaſt. It would be tedious and unintereſting to relate all the incidents which befell me during this journey, and which I have not yet forgotten; of the various hands I paſſed through, and the manners and cuſtoms of all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent people among whom I lived: I ſhall therefore only obſerve, that in all the places where I was, the ſoil was exceedingly rich; the pompkins eadas, plantains, yams, &amp;c. &amp;c. were in great abundance, and of incredible ſize. There were alſo vaſt quantities of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent gums, though not uſed for any purpoſe; and every where a great deal of tobacco. The cotton even grew quite wild; and there was plenty of red-wood. I ſaw no mechanics what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in all the way, except ſuch as I have mentioned. The chief employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all theſe countries was agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture, and both the males and females as with us, were brought up to it, and trained in the arts of war.</p>
                     <p>THE firſt object which ſaluted my eyes when I arrived on the coaſt was the ſea, and a ſlave ſhip, which was then riding at anchor, and waiting for its cargo. Theſe filled me with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which was ſoon converted into terror when I was carried on
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:023353_0057_0FBF4AA839A5B0C0"/>
board. I was immediately handled, and toſſed up to ſee if I were found, by ſome of the crew; and I was now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that I had gotten into a world of bad ſpirits, and that they were going to kill me. Their complexions too differing ſo much from ours, their long hair, and the language they ſpoke (which was very different from any I had ever heard) united to confirm me in this belief. Indeed ſuch were the horrors of my views and fears at the moment, that, if ten thouſand worlds had been my own, I would have freely parted with them all to have exchanged my condition with that of the meaneſt ſlave in my own country. When I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round the ſhip too and ſaw a large furnace or copper-boiling, and a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of black people of every deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion chained together, every one of their countenances expreſſing dejection and ſorrow, I no longer doubted of my fate; and, quite overpowered with horror and anguiſh, I fell motionleſs on the deck and fainted. When I recovered a little I found ſome black people about me, who I believed were ſome of thoſe who had brought me on board, and had been receiving their pay; they talked to me in order to
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:023353_0058_0FBF4AAE277C5E30"/>
cheer me, but all in vain. I aſked them if we were not to be eaten by thoſe white men with horrible looks, red faces, and long hair. They told me I was not: and one of the crew brought me a ſmall portion of ſpirituous liquor in a wine glaſs; but being afraid of him, I would not take it out of his hand. One of the blacks therefore took it from him and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ve it to me, and I took a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle down my palate, which, inſtead of reviving me, as they thought it would, threw me into the greateſt conſternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the ſtrange feeling it produced, having never taſted any ſuch liquor before. Soon after this the blacks who brought me on board went off, and left me abandoned to deſpair I now ſaw myſelf deprived of all chance of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my native country, or even the leaſt glimpſe of hope of gaining the ſhore, which I now conſidered as friendly; and I even wiſhed for my former ſlavery in preference to my preſent ſituation, which was filled with horrors of every kind, ſtill heightened by my ignorance of what I was to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo. I was not long ſuffered to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge my grief; I was ſoon put down under the decks, and there I received ſuch a ſalutation in my noſtrils as I had
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:023353_0059_0FBF4AB074339DF0"/>
never experienced in my life: ſo that with the loathſomneſs of the ſtench, and crying together, I became ſo ſick and low that I was not able to eat, nor had I the leaſt deſire to taſte any thing. I now wiſhed for the laſt friend, death, to relieve me; but ſoon, to my grief, two of the white men offered me eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables; and, on my refuſing to eat, one of them held me faſt by the hands, and laid me acroſs, I think the windlaſs, and tied my feet, while the other flog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me ſeverely. I had never experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced any thing of this kind before: and although not being uſed to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I naturally feared that element the firſt time I ſaw it, yet nevertheleſs, could I have got over the nettings, I would have jumped over the ſide, but I could not; and, beſides, the crew uſed to watch us very cloſely who were not chained down to the decks, leſt we ſhould leap into the water: and I have ſeen ſome of theſe poor African pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners moſt ſeverely cut for attempting to do ſo, and hourly whipped for not eating. This indeed was often the caſe with myſelf. In a little time after, amongſt the poor chained men, I found ſome of my own nation, which in a ſmall degree gave eaſe to my mind. I
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:023353_0060_0FBF4AB740C62A78"/>
inquired of theſe what was to be done with us? they gave me to underſtand we were to be carried to theſe white people's country to work for them. I then was a little revived, and thought, if it were no worſe than working, my ſituation was not ſo deſperate: but ſtill I feared I ſhould be put to death, the white people looked and acted, as I thought, in ſo ſavage a manner; for I had never ſeen among any people ſuch inſtances of brutal cruelty; and this not only ſhewn towards us blacks, but alſo to ſome of the whites them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. One white man in particular I ſaw, when we were permitted to be on deck, flogged ſo unmercifully with a large rope near the foremaſt, that he died in conſequence of it; and they toſſed him over the ſide as they would have done a brute. This made me fear theſe people the more; and I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected nothing leſs than to be treated in the ſame manner. I could not help expreſſing my fears and apprehenſions to ſome of my countrymen: I aſked them if theſe people had no country, but lived in this hollow place (the ſhip)? they told me they did not, but came from a diſtant one, "Then,' ſaid I, <q>how comes it in all our country was
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:023353_0061_0FBF4AB9EE4BB710"/>
never heard of them!</q> They told me becauſe they lived ſo very far off. I then aſked where were their women? had they any like themſelves? I was told they had: "And why," ſaid I, <q>do we not ſee them?</q> they anſwered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were left behind. I aſked how the veſſel could go? they told me they could not tell; but that there were cloth put upon the maſts by the help of the ropes I ſaw, and then the veſſel went on; and the white men had ſome ſpell or magic they put in the water when they liked in order to ſtop the veſſel, I was exceedingly amazed at this account, and really thought they were ſpirits. I therefore wiſhed much to be from amongſt them, for I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected they would ſacrifice me: but my wiſhes were vain; for we were ſo quartered that it was impoſſible for any of us to make our eſcape. While we ſtayed on the coaſt I was moſtly on deck; and one day, to my great aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, I ſaw one of theſe veſſels coming in with the ſails up. As ſoon as the whites ſaw it, they gave a great ſhout, at which we were amazed; and the more ſo as the veſſel appeared larger by approaching nearer. At laſt ſhe came to an anchor in my ſight,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:023353_0062_0FBF4ABAF728DD68"/>
and when the anchor was let go I and my countrymen who ſaw it were loſt in aſtoniſhment to obſerve the veſſel ſtop; and were now convinced it was done by magic. Soon after this the other ſhip got her boats out, and they came on board of us, and the people of both ſhips ſeemed very glad to ſee each other. Several of the ſtrangers alſo ſhook hands with us black people, and made motions with their hands, ſignifying I ſuppoſe, we were to go to their country; but we did not underſtand them. At laſt, when the ſhip we were in, had got in all her cargo, they made ready with many fearful noiſes, and we were all put under deck, ſo that we could not ſee how they managed the veſſel. But this diſappointment was the leaſt of my ſorrow. The ſtench of the hold while we were on the coaſt was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerably loathſome, that it was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to remain there for any time, and ſome of us had been permitted to ſtay on the deck for the freſh air; but now that the whole ſhip's cargo were confined together, it became abſolutely peſtilential. The cloſeneſs of the place, and the heat of the climate, added to the number in the ſhip, which was ſo
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:023353_0063_0FBF4ABC75D05A18"/>
crowded that each had ſcarcely roo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to turn himſelf, almoſt ſuffocated us. This produced copious perſpirations, ſo that the air ſoon became unfit for reſpiration, from a variety of loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſmells, and brought on a ſickneſs among the ſlaves, of which many died, thus falling victims to the improvident avarice, as I may call it, of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers. This wretched ſituation was again aggravated by the galling of the chains, now become inſupportable; and the filth of the neceſſary tubs, into which the children often fell, and were almoſt ſuffocated. The ſhrieks of the women, and the groans of the dying, rendered the whole a ſcene of horror almoſt inconceivable. Happily perhaps for myſelf I was ſoon reduced ſo low here that it was thought neceſſary to keep me almoſt always on deck; and from my extreme youth I was not put in fetters. In this ſituation I expected every hour to ſhare the fate of my companions, ſome of whom were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt daily brought upon deck at the point of death, which I began to hope would ſoon put an end to my miſeries. Often did I think many of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the deep much more happy than myſelf, I envied them the freedom
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:023353_0064_0FBF4ABEC2FCC158"/>
they enjoyed, and as often wiſhed I could change my condition for theirs. Every circumſtance I met with ſerved only to render my ſtate more painful, and heigtened my apprehenſions, and my opinion of the cruelty of the whites. One day they had taken a number of fiſhes; and when they had killed and ſatisfied themſelves with as many as they thought fit, to our aſtoniſhment who were on the deck, rather than give any of them to us to eat, as we expected, they toſſed the remaining fiſh into the ſea again, although we begged and prayed for ſome as well as we could, but in vain; and ſome of my countrymen, being preſſed by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, took an opportunity, when they thought no one ſaw them, of trying to get a little privately; but they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and the attempt procured them ſome very ſevere floggings. One day, when we had a ſmooth ſea and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate wind, two of my wearied country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who were chained together (I was near them at the time), preferring death to ſuch a life of miſery, ſomehow made through the nettings and jumped into the ſea: immediately another quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected fellow, who on account of his illneſs, was ſuffered to be out of irons,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:023353_0065_0FBF4AC298E16280"/>
alſo followed their example; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve many more would very ſoon have done the ſame if they had not been prevented by the ſhip's crew who were inſtantly alarmed. Thoſe of us that were the moſt active were in a moment put down under the deck, and there was ſuch a noiſe and confuſion amongſt the people of the ſhip as I never heard before, to ſtop her, and get the boat out to go after the ſlaves. However two of the wretches were drowned, but they got the other, and afterwards flogged him unmercifully for thus at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to prefer death to ſlavery. In this manner we continued to undergo more hardſhips than I can now relate, hardſhips which are inſeperable from this accurſed trade. Many a time we were near ſuffocation from the want of freſh air, which we were often without for whole days together. This and the ſtench of the neceſſary tubs, carried off many. During our paſſage I firſt ſaw flying fiſhes, which ſurpriſed me very much: they uſed frequently to fly acroſs the ſhip, and many of them fell on the deck. I alſo now firſt ſaw the uſe of the quadrant; I had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with aſtoniſhment ſeen the mariners, make obſervations with it, and I could
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:023353_0066_0FBF4AC4B9D7B570"/>
not think what it meant. They at laſt took notice of my ſurpriſe: and one of them, willing to increaſe it, as well as to gratify my curioſity, made me one day look through it. The clouds appeared to me to be land, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared as they paſſed along. This heightened my wonder; and I was now more perſuaded than ever that I was in another world, and that every thing about me was magic. At laſt we came in ſight of the iſland of Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, at which the whites on board gave a great ſhout, and made many ſigns of joy to us. We did not know what to think of this; but as the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel drew nearer we plainly ſaw the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and other ſhips of different kinds and ſizes; and we ſoon anchored amongſt them off Bridge-Town. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny merchants and planters now came on board, though it was in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They put us in ſeparate parcels, and examined us attentively. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo made us jump, and pointed to the land, ſignifying we were to go there. We thought by this we ſhould be eaten by theſe ugly men, as they appeared to us; and, when ſoon after we were all put down under the deck again, there was much dread and trembling
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:023353_0067_0FBF4AC645681C08"/>
among us, and nothing but bitter cries to be heard all the night from theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, inſomuch that at laſt the white people got ſome old ſlaves from the land to pacify us. They told us we were not to be eaten, but to work, and were ſoon to go on land, where we ſhould ſee many of our country people. This report eaſed us much, and ſure enough, ſoon after we were landed, there came to us Africans of all languages. We were conducted immediately to the merchant's yard, where we were all pent up together like ſo many ſheep in a fold, without regard to ſex or age. As every object was new to me, every thing I ſaw fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me with ſurpriſe. What ſtruck me firſt was that the houſes were built with bricks and ſtories, and in every other reſpect different from thoſe I had ſeen in Africa: but I was ſtill more aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſeeing people on horſeback. I did not know what this could mean; and indeed I thought theſe people were full of nothing but magical arts. While I was in this aſtoniſhment one of my fellow priſoners ſpoke to a countryman of his about the horſes, who ſaid they were the ſame kind they had in their country. I underſtood them, though
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:023353_0068_0FBF4ACE37B79C60"/>
they were from a diſtant part of Africa, and I thought it odd I had not ſeen any horſes there; but afterwards when I came to converſe with different Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, I found they had many horſes amongſt them, and much larger than thoſe I then ſaw. We were not many days in the merchant's cuſtody before we were ſold after their uſual manner, which is this:—On a ſignal given, (as the beat of a drum) the buyers ruſh at once into the yard where the ſlaves are confined, and make choice of that parcel they like beſt, The noiſe and clamour with which this is attended, and the eagerneſs viſible in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances of the buyers, ſerve not a little to increaſe the apprehenſion of terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Africans, who may well be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to conſider them as the miniſters of that deſtruction to which they think themſelves devoted. In this manner, without ſcruple, are relations and friends ſeparated, moſt of them never to ſee each other again. I remember in the veſſel in which I was brought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in the men's apartment, there were ſeveral brothers, who, in the ſale were ſold in different lots; and it was very moving on this occaſion to ſee and hear their cries at parting. O, ye no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal

Chriſtians! might not an African aſk you, learned you this from your God, who ſays unto you, Do unto all men as you would men ſhould do unto you? Is it not enough that we are torn from our country and friends, to toil for your luxury and luſt of gain? Muſt every tender feeling be likewiſe ſacrificed to your avarice? Are the deareſt friends and relations, now ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more dear by their ſeparation from their kindred, ſtill to be parted from each other, and thus prevented from cheering the gloom of ſlavery with the ſmall comfort of being toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mingling their ſufferings and ſorrows? Why are parents to loſe their children, brothers their ſiſters, or huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands their wives? Surely this is a new refinement in cruelty, which, while it has no advantage to atone for it, thus aggravates diſtreſs, and adds freſh hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors even to the wretchedneſs of ſlavery.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>I NOW totally loſt the ſmall remains of comfort I had enjoyed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with my countrymen; the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men too, who uſed to waſh and take care of me were all gone different ways, and I never ſaw one of them afterwards.</p>
                     <p>I ſtaid in this iſland for a few days; I believe it could not be above a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night; when I and ſome few more ſlaves, that were not ſaleable amongſt the reſt, from very much fretting, were ſhipped off in a ſloop for North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. On the paſſage we were better treated than when we were coming
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:023353_0071_0FBF4AD4F236ACE0"/>
from Africa, and we had plenty of rice and fat pork. We were landed up a river a good way from the ſea, about Virginia county, where we ſaw few or none of our native Africans, and not one ſoul who could talk to me. I was a few weeks weeding graſs, and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtones in a plantaion; and at laſt all my companions were diſtributed dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ways, and only myſelf was left. I was now exceedingly miſerable, and thought myſelf worſe off than any of the reſt of my companions; for they could talk to each other, but I had no perſon to ſpeak to that I could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. In this ſtate I was conſtantly grieving and pining, and wiſhing for death rather than any thing elſe. While I was in this plantation the gentleman, to whom I ſuppoſe the eſtate belonged, being unwell, I was one day ſent for to his dwelling houſe to fan him; when I came into the room where he was I was very much affrighted at ſome things I ſaw, and the more ſo as I had ſeen a black woman ſlave as I came through the houſe, who was cooking the dinner, and the poor creature was cruelly loaded with various kinds of iron machines; ſhe had one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly on her head, which locked her
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:023353_0072_0FBF4ADC785FCB10"/>
mouth ſo faſt that ſhe could ſcarcely ſpeak; and could not eat nor drink. I was much aſtoniſhed and ſhocked at this contrivance, which I afterwards learned was called the iron muzzle. Soon after I had a fan put into my hand, to fan the gentleman while he ſlept; and ſo I did indeed with great fear. While he was faſt aſleep I indulged my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a great deal in looking about the room, which to me appeared very fine and curious. The firſt object that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged my attention was a watch which hung on the chimney, and was going. I was quite ſurpriſed at the noiſe it made, and was afraid it would tell the gentleman any thing I might do amiſs: and when I immediately after obſerved a picture hanging in the room, which appeared conſtantly to look at me, I was ſtill more affrighted, having never ſeen ſuch things as theſe before. At one time I thought it was ſomething relative to magic; and not ſeeing it move I thought it might be ſome way the whites had to keep their great men when they died, and offer them liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as we uſed to do our friendly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. In this ſtate of anxiety I remained till my maſter awoke, when I was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed out of the room, to my no ſmall
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:023353_0073_0FBF4ADD8C83ACA0"/>
ſatisfaction and relief; for I thought that theſe people were all made up of wonders. In this place I was called Jacob; but on board the African ſnow I was called Michael. I had been ſome time in this miſerable, forlorn, and much dejected ſtate, without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any one to talk to, which made my life a burden, when the kind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known hand of the Creator (who in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very deed leads the blind in a way they know not) now began to appear, to my comfort; for one day the captain of a merchant ſhip, called the Induſtrious Bee came on ſome buſineſs to my maſter's houſe. This gentleman, whoſe name was Michael Henry Paſcal, was a lieutenant in the royal navy, but now commanded this trading ſhip, which was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in the confines of the county many miles off. While he was at my maſter's houſe it happened that he ſaw me, and liked me ſo well that he made a purchaſe of me. I think I have often heard him ſay he give thirty or forty pounds ſterling for me; but I do not remember which. However, he meant me for a preſent to ſome of his friends in England: and as I was ſent accordingly from the houſe of my then maſter, (one Mr. Campbell) to the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:023353_0074_0FBF4ADF4E485770"/>
place where the ſhip lay: I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted on horſeback by an elderly black man, (a mode of travelling which appeared very odd to me). When I arrived I was carried on board a fine large ſhip, loaded with tobacco, &amp;c. and juſt ready to ſail for England. I now thought my condition much mended; I had ſails to lie on, and plenty of good victuals to eat; and every body on board uſed my very kindly, quite contrary to what I had ſeen of any white people before; I therefore began to think that they were not all of the ſame diſpoſition. A few days after I was on board we ſailed for England. I was ſtill at a loſs to conjecture my deſtiny. By this time, however, I could ſmatter a little imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Engliſh; and I wanted to know as well as I could where we were going. Some of the people of the ſhip uſed to tell me they were going to carry me back to my own country, and this made me very happy. I was quite rejoiced at the idea of going back; and thought if I could get home what wonders I ſhould have to tell. But I was reſerved for another fate, and was ſoon unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived when we came within ſight of the Engliſh coaſt. While I was on
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:023353_0075_0FBF4AE459708AF0"/>
board this ſhip, my captain and maſter named me <hi>Guſtavus Vaſa.</hi> I at that time began to underſtand him a little, and refuſed to be called ſo, and told him as well as I could that I would be called Jacob; but he ſaid I ſhould not, and ſtill called me Guſtavus: and when I refuſed to anſwer to my new name, which at firſt I did, it gained me many a cuff; ſo at length I ſubmitted, and by which I have been known ever ſince. The ſhip had a very long paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; and on that account we had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhort allowance of proviſions. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the laſt we had only one pound and a half of bread per week, and about the ſame quantity of meat, and one quart of water a-day. We ſpoke with only one veſſel the whole time we were at ſea, and but once we caught a few fiſhes. In our extremities the captain and people told me in jeſt they would kill and eat me; but I thought them in earneſt, and was depreſſed beyond meaſure, expecting every moment to be my laſt. While I was in this ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation one evening they caught, with a good deal of trouble, a large ſhark, and got it on board. This glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened my poor heart exceedingly, as I thought it would ſerve the people to
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:023353_0076_0FBF4AE68CD14000"/>
eat inſtead of their eating me; but very ſoon, to my aſtoniſhment, they cut off a ſmall part of the tail, and toſſed the reſt over the ſide. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed my conſternation; and I did not know what to think of theſe white peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though I very much feared they would kill and eat me. There was on board the ſhip a young lad who had never been at ſea before, about four or five years older than myſelf: his name was Richard Baker. He was a native of America, had received an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent education, and was of a moſt amiable temper. Soon after I went on board he ſhewed me a great deal of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and attention, and in return I grew extremely fond of him. We at length became inſeparable; and, for the ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ce of two years, he was of very great uſe to me, and was my conſtant companion and inſtructor. Although this dear youth had many ſlaves of his own, yet he and I have gone through many ſufferings together on ſhipboard; and we have many nights lain in each other's boſoms when we were in great diſtreſs. Thus ſuch a friendſhip was cemented between us as we cheriſhed till his death, which, to my very great ſorrow, happened in the year 1759,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:023353_0077_0FBF4AE9AC7D7B08"/>
when he was up the Archipelago, on board his majeſty's ſhip the Preſton: an event which I have never ceaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, as I loſt at once a kind interpreter, an agreeable companion, and a faithful friend; who, at the age of fifteen, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a mind ſuperior to prejudice; and who was not aſhamed to notice, to aſſociate with, and to be the friend and inſtructor of one who was ignorant, a ſtranger, of a different complexion, and a ſlave! My maſter had lodged in his mother's houſe in America: he reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him very much, and made him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways eat with him in the cabin. He uſed often to tell him jocularly that he would kill and eat me. Sometimes he would ſay to me—the black people were not good to eat, and would aſk me if we did not eat people in my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. I ſaid, no: then he ſaid he would kill Dick (as he always called him) firſt, and afterwards me. Though this hearing relieved my mind a little as to myſelf, I was alarmed for Dick, and whenever he was called I uſed to be very much afraid he was to be killed; and I would peep and watch to ſee if they were going to kill him: nor was I free from this conſternation till we made the land. One night we loſt a
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:023353_0078_0FBF4AEB03C462D0"/>
man overboard; and the cries and noiſe were ſo great and confuſed, in ſtopping the ſhip, that I, who did not know what was the matter, began, as uſual, to be very much afraid, and to think they were going to make an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with me, and perform ſome magic; which I ſtill believed they dealt in. As the waves were very high I thought the Ruler of the ſeas was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and I expected to be offered up to appeaſe him. This filled my mind with agony, and I could not any more that night cloſe my eyes again to reſt. However, when daylight appeared I was a little eaſed in my mind: but ſtill every time I was called I uſed to think it was to be killed. Some time after this we ſaw ſome very large fiſh, which I afterwards found were called grampuſſes. They looked to me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely terrible, and made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance juſt at duſk; and were ſo near as to blow the water on the ſhip's deck. I believed them to be the rulers of the ſea; and as the white people did not make any offerings at any time, I thought they were angry with them: and, at laſt, what confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my belief was, the wind juſt then died away, and a calm enſued, and in
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:023353_0079_0FBF4AED7829D2A8"/>
conſequence of it the ſhip ſtopped go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I ſuppoſed that the fiſh had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed this, and I hid myſelf in the fore part of the ſhip, through fear of being offered up to appeaſe them, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry minute peeping and quaking: but my good friend Dick came ſhortly tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards me, and I took an opportunity to aſk him, as well as I could, what theſe fiſh were. Not being able to talk much Engliſh, I could but juſt make him underſtand my queſtion; and not at all, when I aſked him if any offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were to be made to them, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he told me theſe fiſh would ſwallow any body; which ſufficiently alarmed me. Here he was called away by the captain, who was leaning over the quarter-deck railing and looking at the fiſh; and moſt of the people were buſied in getting a barrel of pitch to light for them to play with. The captain now called me to him, having learned ſome of my apprehenſions from D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ck; and having diverted himſelf and others for ſome time with my fears, which appeared ludicrous enough in my crying and trembling, he diſmiſſed me. The barrel of pitch was now lighted and put over the ſide into the water: by this time it was juſt dark,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:023353_0080_0FBF4AF26184A488"/>
and the fiſh went after it; and, to my great joy, I ſaw them no more.</p>
                     <p>HOWEVER, all my alarms began to ſubſide when we got ſight of land; and at laſt the ſhip arrived at Falmouth, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a paſſage of thirteen weeks. Every heart on board ſeemed gladdened on our reaching the ſhore, and none more than mine. The captain immediately went on ſhore, and ſent on board ſome freſh provisions, which we wanted very much: we made good uſe of them, and our famine was ſoon turned into feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, almoſt without ending. It was about the beginning of the ſpring 1757, when I arrived in England, and I was near twelve years of age at that time. I was very much ſtruck with the buildings and the pavement of the ſtreets in Falmouth; and, indeed, every object I ſaw filled me with new ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. One morning, when I got upon deck, I ſaw it covered all over with the ſnow that fell over-night: as I had never ſeen any thing of the kind before, I thought it was ſalt; ſo I immediately ran down to the mate and deſired him, as well as I could, to come and ſee how ſomebody in the night had thrown ſalt all over the deck. He, knowing what it was, deſired me to bring ſome
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:023353_0081_0FBF4AF4B2D6D8C8"/>
of it down to him: accordingly I took up a handful of it, which I found very cold indeed; and when I brought it to him he deſired me to taſte it. I did ſo, and I was ſurpriſed beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. I then aſked him what it was; he told me it was ſnow: but I could not in anywiſe underſtand him. He aſked me if we had no ſuch thing in my country; and I told him, No. I then aſked him the uſe of it, and who made it; he told me a great man in the heavens, called God: but here again I was to all intents and purpoſes at a loſs to underſtand him; and the more ſo, when a little after I ſaw the air filled with it, in a heavy ſhower, which fell down on the ſame day. After this I went to church; and having never been at ſuch a place before, I was again amazed at ſeeing and hearing the ſervice. I aſked all I could about it; and they gave me to underſtand it was worſhipping God, who made us and all things. I was ſtill at a great loſs, and ſoon got into an endleſs field of inquiries, as well as I was able to ſpeak and aſk about things. However, my little friend Dick uſed to be my beſt interpreter; for I could make free with him, and he always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:023353_0082_0FBF4AF6FA4CB2A8"/>
me with pleaſure: and from what I could underſtand by him of this God, and in ſeeing theſe white people did not ſell one another as we did, I was much pleaſed; and in this I thought they were much happier than we Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans. I was aſtoniſhed at the wiſdom of the white people in all things I ſaw; but was amazed at their not ſacrificing, or making any offerings, and eating with unwaſhed hands, and touching the dead. I likewiſe could not help re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking the particular ſlenderneſs of their women, which I did not at firſt like; and I thought they were not ſo modeſt and ſhame-faced as the African women.</p>
                     <p>I had often ſeen my maſter and Dick employed in reading; and I had a great curioſity to talk to the books, as I thought they did; and ſo to learn how all things had a beginning: for that purpoſe I have often taken up a book, and have talked to it, and then put my ears to it, when alone, in hopes it would anſwer me; and I have been very much concerned when I found it remained ſilent.</p>
                     <p>MY maſter lodged at the houſe of a gentleman in Falmouth, who had a fine little daughter about ſix or ſeven years
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:023353_0083_0FBF4AF944935B30"/>
of age, and ſhe grew prodigiouſly fond of me; inſomuch that we uſed to eat together, and had ſervants to wait on us. I was ſo much careſſed by this family that it often reminded me of the treatment I had received from my little noble African maſter. After I had been here a few days, I was ſent on board of the ſhip; but the child cried ſo much after me that nothing could pacify her till I was ſent for again. It is ludicrous enough, that I began to fear I ſhould be betrothed to this young lady; and when my maſter aſked me if I would ſtay there with her behind him, as he was going away with the ſhip, which had taken in the tobacco again, I cried immediately, and ſaid I would not leave him. At laſt, by ſtealth, one night I was ſent on board the ſhip again; and in a little time we ſailed for Guernſey, where ſhe was in part owned by a merchant, one Nicholas Doberry. As I was now amongſt a people who had not their faces ſcarred, like ſome of the African nations where I had been, I was very glad I did not let them ornament me in that manner when I was with them. When we arrived at Guernſey, my maſter placed me to board and lodge
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:023353_0084_0FBF4AFBAAFF4748"/>
with one of his mates, who had a wife and family there; and ſome months after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he went to England, and left me in care of this mate, together with my friend Dick: This mate had a little daughter, aged about five or ſix years, with whom I uſed to be much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted. I had often obſerved that when her mother waſhed her face it looked very roſy; but when ſhe waſhed mine it did not look ſo: I therefore tried oftentimes myſelf if I could not by waſhing make my face of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour as my little play-mate (Mary,) but it was all in vain; and I now began to be mortified at the difference in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions. This woman behaved to me with great kindneſs and attention; and taught me every thing in the ſame manner as ſhe did her own child, and indeed in every reſpect treated me as ſuch. I remained here till the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the year 1757; when my maſter, being appointed firſt lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of his majeſty's ſhip the Roe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buck, ſent for Dick and me, and his old mate: on this we all left Guernſey, and ſet out for England in a ſloop bound for London. As we were coming up towards the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, where the Roebuck lay, a man of war's
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:023353_0085_0FBF4AFFC80F27F8"/>
boat came alongſide to preſs our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; on which each man ran to hide himſelf. I was very much frightened at this, though I did not know what it meant, or what to think or do. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I went and hid myſelf alſo under a hencoop. Immediately afterwards the preſs-gang came on board with their ſwords drawn, and ſearched all about, pulled the people out by force, and put them into the boat. At laſt I was found out alſo; the man that found me held me up by the heels while they all made their ſport of me, I roaring and crying out all the time moſt luſtily; but at laſt the mate, who was my conductor, ſeeing this, came to my aſſiſtance, and did all he could to pacify me; but all to very little purpoſe, till I had ſeen the boat go off. Soon afterwards we came to the Nore, where the Roebuck lay; and, to our great joy, my maſter came on board to us, and brought us to the ſhip. When I went on board this large ſhip, I was amazed indeed to ſee the quantity of men and the guns However my ſurpriſe began to diminiſh as my knowledge increaſed; and I ceaſed to feel thoſe apprehenſions and alarms which had taken ſuch ſtrong poſſeſſion of me when I firſt came
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:023353_0086_0FBF4B05D19FE6E0"/>
among the Europeans, and for ſome time after. I began now to paſs to an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite extreme; I was ſo far from being afraid of any thing new which I ſaw, that after I had been ſome time in this ſhip, I even began to long for an engagement My griefs too, which in young minds are not perpetual, were now wearing away; and I ſoon enjoyed myſelf pretty well, and felt tolerably eaſy in any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſituation. There was a number of boys on board, which ſtill made it more agreeable; for we were always together, and a great part of our time was ſpent in play. I remained in this ſhip a conſiderable time, during which we made ſeveral cruiſes, and viſited a variety of places: among others we were twice in Holland, and brought over ſeveral perſons of diſtinction from it, whoſe names I do not now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. On the paſſage, one day, for the diverſion of thoſe gentlemen, all the boys were called on the quarter deck, and were paired proportionably, and then made to fight; after which the gentlemen gave the combatants from five to nine ſhillings each. This was the firſt time I ever fought with a white boy; and I never knew what it was to have a bloody noſe before. This made
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:023353_0087_0FBF4B06F677D900"/>
me fight moſt deſparately; I ſuppoſe conſiderably more than an hour: and at laſt, both of us being weary, we were parted. I had a great deal of this kind of ſport afterwards, in which the captain and the ſhip's company uſed very much to encourage me. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time afterwards the ſhip went to Leith in Scotland, and from thence to the Orkneyes, where I was ſurpriſed in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarcely any night: and from thence we ſailed with a great fleet, full of ſoldiers, for England. All this time we had never come to an engagement, though we were frequently cruiſing off the coaſt of France: during which we chaſed many veſſels, and took in all ſeventeen prizes. I had been learning many of the manoeuvres of the ſhip during our cruiſe; and I was ſeveral times made to fire the guns. One even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, off Havre de Grace, juſt as it was growing dark, we were ſtanding off ſhore, and met with a fine large French built frigate. We got all things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ready for fighting; and I now expected I ſhould be gratified in ſeeing an engagement, which I had ſo long wiſhed for in vain. But the very moment the word of command was given to fire, we heard thoſe on board
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:023353_0088_0FBF4B0889857060"/>
the other ſhip cry, "Haul down the jib;" and in that inſtant ſhe hoiſted Engliſh colours. There was inſtantly with us an amazing cry of—"Avaſt!" or ſtop firing; and I think one or two guns had been let off, but happily they did no miſchief. We had hailed them ſeveral times; but they not hearing, we received no anſwer, which was the cauſe of our firing. The boat was then ſent on board of her, and ſhe proved to be the Ambuſcade man of war, to my no ſmall diſappointment. We returned to Portſmouth, without having been in any action, juſt at the trial of Admiral Byng (whom I ſaw ſeveral times during it): and my maſter having left the ſhip, and gone to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for promotion, Dick and I were put on board the ſavage ſloop of war, and we went in her to aſſiſt in bringing off the St. George man of war, that had run a-ſhore ſomewhere on the coaſt. After ſtaying a few weeks on board the Savage, Dick and I were ſent on ſhore at Deal, where we remained ſome ſhort time, till my maſter ſent for us to London, the place I had long deſired exceedingly to ſee. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both with great pleaſure got into a waggon, and came to London, where
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:023353_0089_0FBF4B0AA247CD78"/>
we were received by a Mr. Guerin, a relation of my maſter. This gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had two ſiſters, very amiable la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who took much notice and great care of me. Though I had deſired ſo much to ſee London, when I arrived in it I was unfortunately unable to gratify my curioſity; for I had at this time the chilblains to ſuch a degree that I could not ſtand for ſeveral months, and I was obliged to be ſent to St. George's Hoſpital. There I grew ſo ill that the doctors wanted to cut my left leg off at different times, apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mortification; but I always ſaid I would rather die than ſuffer it; and happily (I thank God) I recoverd without the operation. After being there ſeveral weeks, and juſt as I had recovered, the ſmall pox broke out on me, ſo that I was again confined; and I thought myſelf now particularly unfortunate. However I ſoon reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered again; and by this time my maſter having been promoted to be firſt lieutenant of the Preſton man of war of fifty guns, then new at Deptford, Dick and I were ſent on board her, and ſoon after we went to Holland to bring over the late Duke of—to England. While I was in the ſhip
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:023353_0090_0FBF4B0CCE24F4D8"/>
an incident happened, which, though trifling, I beg leave to relate, as I could not help taking particular notice of it, and conſidered it then as a judgment of God. One morning a young man was looking up to the fore-top, and in a wicked tone, common on ſhipboard, d—d his eyes about ſomething. Juſt at the moment ſome ſmall particles of dirt fell into his left eye, and by the evening it was very much enflamed. The next day it grew worſe; and within ſix or ſeven days he loſt it. From this ſhip my maſter was appointed a lieutenant on board the Royal George. When he was going he wiſhed me to ſtay on board the Preſton, to learn the French horn; but the ſhip being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered for Turkey I could not think of leaving my maſter, to whom I was very warmly attached; and I told him if he left me behind it would break my heart. This prevailed on him to take me with him; but he left Dick on board the Preſton, whom I embraced at parting for the laſt time. The Royal George was the largeſt ſhip I had ever ſeen; ſo that when I came on board of her I was ſurpriſed at the number of people, men, women, and children, of every denomination; and the largeneſs
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:023353_0091_0FBF4B1318B516A8"/>
of the guns, many of them alſo of braſs which I had never ſeen before. Here were alſo ſhops or ſtalls of every kind of goods, and people-crying their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent commodities about the ſhip as in a town. To me it appeared a little world, into which I was again caſt with out a friend, for I had no longer my dear companion Dick. We did not ſtay long here. My maſter was not many weeks on board before he got an appointment to the ſixth lieutenant of the Namur, which was then at Spit-heat, fitting up for Vice-admiral Boſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, who was going with a large fleet on an expedition againſt Louiſburgh. The crew of the Royal George were turned over to her, and the flag of that gallant admiral was hoiſted on board, the blue at the maintop gallant maſt head. There was a very great fleet of men of war of every deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aſſembled together for this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and I was in hopes ſoon to have an opportunity of being gratified with a ſea-fight. All things being now in readineſs, this mighty fleet (for there was alſo Admiral Corniſh's fleet in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, deſtined for the Eaſt Indies) at laſt weighed anchor, and ſailed. The two fleets continued in company for
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:023353_0092_0FBF4B1503DC01B0"/>
ſeveral days, and then parted; Admiral Corniſh, in the Lenox, having firſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted our Admiral in the Namur, which he returned. We then ſteered for America; but, by contrary winds, we were driven to Teneriffe, where I was ſtruck with its noted peak. Its prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious height, and its form, reſembling a ſugar loaf, filled we with wonder. We remained in ſight of this iſland ſome days, and then proceeded for America, which me ſoon made, and got into a very commodious harbour called St. George, in Halifax, where we had fiſh in great plenty, and all other freſh proviſions. We were here joined by different men of war and tranſport ſhips with ſoldiers; after which, our fleet being increaſed to a prodigious number of ſhips of all kinds, we ſailed for Cape Breton in Nova Scotia. We had the good and gallant General Wolfe on board our ſhip, whoſe affability made him highly eſteemed and beloved by all the men. He often honoured me, as well as other boys, with marks of his notice; and ſaved me once a flogging for fighting with a young gentleman. We arrived at Cape Breton in the ſummer of 1758: and here the ſoldiers were to be landed,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:023353_0093_0FBF4B1688C6FE78"/>
in order to make an attact upon Louiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh. My maſter had ſome part in ſuperintending the Landing; and here I was in a ſmall meaſure gratified in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an encounter between our men and the enemy. The French were poſted on the ſhore to receive us, and diſputed our landing for a long time: but at laſt they were driven from their trenches, and a complete landing was effected. Our troops purſued them as far as the town of Louiſhburgh. In this action many were killed on both ſides. One thing remarkable I ſaw this day.—A lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Princeſs Amelia, who as well as my maſter ſuperintended the landing, was giving the word of command, and while his mouth was open a muſquet ball went through it, and paſſed out at his cheek. I had that day in my hand the ſcalp of an indian king, who was killed in the engagement. the ſcalp had been taken off by an Highlander. I ſaw the king's ornaments too, which were very curious, and made of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                     <p>OUR land forces laid ſiege to the town of Louiſburgh, while the French men of war were blocked up in the harbonr by the fleet, the batteries at the ſame time playing upon them from the land.
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:023353_0094_0FBF4B196D0014A0"/>
This they did with ſuch effect, that one day I ſaw ſome of the ſhips ſet on fire by the ſhells from the batteries, and I believe two or three of them were quite burnt. At another time, about fifty boats belonging to the Engliſh men of war, commanded by Captain George Belfour of the Aetna fire ſhip, and Mr. Laforey another junior captain, attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and boarded the only two remaining French men of war in the harbour. They alſo ſet fire to a ſeventy-gun ſhip, but a ſixty four, called the Bienfaiſant, they brought off. During my ſtay here I had often an opportunity of being near cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Belfour, who was pleaſed to notice me, and liked me ſo much that he often aſked my maſter to let him have me, but he would not part with me; and no conſideration could have induced me to leave him. At laſt Loiſburgh was taken, and the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh men of war came into the harbour before it, to my very great joy; for I had now more liberty of indulging my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and I went often on ſhore. When the ſhips were in the harbour we had the moſt beautiful proceſſion on the water I ever ſaw. All the admirals and captains of the men of war, full dreſſed, and in their barges, well ornamented
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:023353_0095_0FBF4B20E471F0D8"/>
with pendants, came alongſide of the Namur. The vice-admiral then went on ſhore in his barge, followed by the other officers in order of ſeniority, to take poſſeſſion, as I ſuppoſe, of the town and fort. Some time after this the French governor and his lady, and other perſons of note, came on board our ſhip to dine. On this occaſion our ſhips were dreſſed with colours of all kinds, from the topgallant-ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> head to the deck; and this, with the firing of guns, formed a moſt grand and magnificent ſpectacle.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as every thing here was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, Admiral Boſcawen ſailed with part of the fleet for England, leaving ſome ſhips behind with Rear-Admirals Sir Charles Hardy and Durell. It was now winter; and one evening, during our paſſage home, about duſk, when we were in the channel, or near ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and were beginning to look for land, we deſcried ſeven ſail of large men of war, which ſtood off ſhore. Several people on board of our ſhip ſaid, as the two fleets were (in forty minutes from the firſt ſight) within hail of each other, that they were Engliſh men of war; and ſome of our people even began to name ſome of the ſhips.
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:023353_0096_0FBF4B21BA289490"/>
By this time both fleets began to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and our Admiral ordered his flag to be hoiſted. At that inſtant the other fleet, which were French, hoiſted their enſigns, and gave us a broadſide as they paſſed by. Nothing could create great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſurpriſe and confuſion among us than this: the wind was high, the ſea rough, and we had our lower and mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle deck guns houſed in, ſo that not a ſingle gun on board was ready to be fired at any of the French ſhips. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Royal William and the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet, being our ſternmoſt ſhips, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a little prepared, and each gave the French ſhips a broadſide as they paſſed by. I afterwards heard this was a French ſquadron, comanded by Monſ. Conflans; and certainly had the Frenchmen known our condition, and had a mind to fight us, they might have done us great miſchief. But we were not long before we were prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for an engagement. Immediately many things were toſſed overboard; the ſhips were made ready for fighting as ſoon as poſſible; and about ten at night we had bent a new main-ſail, the old one being ſplit. Being now in readineſs for fighting, we wore ſhip, and ſtood after the French fleet, who
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:023353_0097_0FBF4B2337F58BD8"/>
were one or two ſhips in number more than we. However we gave them chaſe and continued purſuing them all night; and at day-light we ſaw ſix of them, all large ſhips of the line, and an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Eaſt Indiaman, a prize they had taken. We chaſed them all day till between three and four o'clock in the evening, when we came up with, and paſſed within a muſket ſhot of one ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty-four gun ſhip, and the Indiaman alſo, who now hoiſted her colours, but immediately hauled them down again. On this we made a ſignal for the other ſhips to take poſſeſſion of her; and, ſuppoſing the man of war would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſtrike, we cheered, but ſhe did not; though if we had fired into her, from being ſo near we muſt have taken her. To my utter ſurpriſe, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet, who was the next ſhip a-ſtern of the Namur, made way likewiſe; and, thinking they were ſure of this French ſhip, they cheered in the ſame manner, but ſtill continued to follow us. The French Commodore was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a gun-ſhot a-head of all, running from us with all ſpeed; and about four o'clock he carried his foretopmaſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verboard. This cauſed another loud cheer with us; and a little after the
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:023353_0098_0FBF4B2612412438"/>
topmaſt came cloſe by us; but, to our great ſurpriſe, inſtead of coming up with her, we found ſhe went as faſt as ever, if not faſter. The ſea grew now much ſmoother; and the wind lulling, the ſeventy-four gun ſhip we had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed came again by us in the very ſame direction, and ſo near, that we heard her people talk as ſhe went by; yet not a ſhot was fired on either ſide; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five or ſix o'clock, juſt as it grew dark, ſhe joined her commodore. We chaſed all night; but the next day we were out of ſight, ſo that we ſaw no more of them; and we only had the old Indiaman (called Carnarvon I think) for our trouble. After this we ſtood in for the channel, and ſoon made the land; and, about the cloſe of the year 1758—9, we got <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>afe to St. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len's. Here the Namur ran aground; and alſo another large ſhip aſtern of us; but, by ſtarting our water, and toſſing many things overboard to lighten her, we got the ſhips off without any da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. We ſtayed for a ſhort time at Spithead, and then went into Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth harbour to refit: from whence the Admiral went to London; any my maſter and I ſoon followed, with a preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang, as we wanted ſome hands to complete our complement.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IT was now between two and three years ſince I firſt came to England, a great part of which I had ſpent at ſea; ſo that I became inured to that ſervice, and began to conſider myſelf as happily ſituated; for my maſter treated me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways extremely well; and my attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and gratitude to him were very great. From the various ſcenes I had beheld on ſhip-board, I ſoon grew a ſtranger to terror of every kind, and was, in that reſpect at leaſt, almoſt an Engliſhman. I have often reflected with ſurpriſe that I never felt half the alarm at any of the numerous dangers I have been in, that I was filled with at the firſt ſight of the Europeans, and at every act of theirs, even the moſt trifling, when I firſt came among them, and for ſome time afterwards. That fear, however, which was the effect of my ignorance, wore away as I began to know them. I could now ſpeak Engliſh tolerably well, and I perfectly underſtood every thing that was ſaid. I not only felt myſelf quite eaſy with
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:023353_0101_0FBF4B30308BCF88"/>
theſe new countrymen, but reliſhed their ſociety and manners. I no longer looked upon them as ſpirits, but as men ſuperior to us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had the ſtronger deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble them; to imbibe their ſpirit, and imitate their manners; I therefore embraced every occaſion of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and every new thing that I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved I treaſured up in my memory. I had long wiſhed to be able to read and write; and for this purpoſe I took every opportunity to gain inſtruction, but had made as yet very little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. However, when I went to London with my maſter, I had ſoon an opportunity of improving myſelf, which I gladly embraced. Shortly after my arrival, he ſent me to wait upon the Miſs Guerins, who had treated me with much kindneſs when I was there before; and they ſent me to ſchool.</p>
                     <p>WHILE I was attending theſe ladies, their ſervants told me I could not go to Heaven, unleſs I was baptized. This made me very uneaſy; for I had now ſome faint idea of a future ſtate: accordingly I communicated my anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the eldeſt Miſs Guerin, with whom I was become a favourite, and preſſed her to have me baptized; when to my
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:023353_0102_0FBF4B3240D65718"/>
great joy, ſhe told me I ſhould. She had formerly aſked my maſter to let me be baptized, but he had refuſed; however ſhe now inſiſted on it; and he being under ſome obligation to her brother complied with her requeſt; ſo I was baptized in St. Margaret's church, Weſtminſter, in February 1759, by my preſent name. The clergyman at the ſame time, gave me a book, called a Guide to the Indians, written by the Biſhop of Sodor and Man. On this occaſion, Miſs Guerin did me the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſtand as god mother, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gave me a treat. I uſed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend theſe ladies about the town, in which ſervice I was extremely happy; as I had thus many opportunities of ſeeing London, which I deſired of all things. I was ſometimes, however, with my maſter at his rendezvous-houſe, which was at the foot of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-bridge. Here I uſed to enjoy myſelf in playing about the bridge ſtairs, and often in the waterman's wherries, with other boys. On one of theſe occaſions there was another boy with me in a wherry, and we went out into the current of the river; while we were there, two more ſtout boys came to us in another wherry, and abuſing us
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:023353_0103_0FBF4B35F71C3720"/>
for taking the boat, deſired me to get into the other wherry-boat. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly I went to get out of the wherry I was in; but juſt as I had got one of my feet into the other boat, the boys ſhoved it off, ſo that I fell into the Thames; and, not being able to ſwim, I ſhould unavoidably have been drowned, but for the aſſiſtance of ſome watermen who providentially came to my relief</p>
                     <p>THE Namur being again got ready for ſea, my maſter, with his gang, was ordered on board; and, to my no ſmall grief, I was obliged to leave my ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, whom I liked very much, and always attended while I ſtayed in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, to repair on board with my maſter. Nor did I leave my kind pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troneſſes, the Miſs Guerins, without uneaſineſs and regret. They often uſed to reach me to read, and took great pains to inſtruct me in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of religion and the knowledge of God. I therefore parted from thoſe amiable ladies with reluctance: after receiving from them many friendly cautions how to conduct myſelf, and ſome valuable preſents.</p>
                     <p>WHEN I came to Spithead, I found we were deſtined for the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:023353_0104_0FBF4B3966F29C90"/>
with a large fleet, which was how ready to put to ſea. We only waited for the arrival of the admiral, who ſoon came on board; and about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſpring 1759, having weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anchor, and got under way, ſailed for the Mediterranean; and in eleven days, from the Land's End, we got to Gibraltar. While we were here I uſed to be often on ſhore, and got various fruits in great plenty, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cheap.</p>
                     <p>I had frequently told ſeveral people, in my excurſions on ſhore, the ſtory of my being kidnapped with my ſiſter, and of our being ſeparated, as I have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before; and I had as often expreſſed my anxiety for her fate, and my ſorrow at having never met her again. One day, when I was on ſhore, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning theſe circumſtances to ſome perſons, one of them told me he knew where my ſiſter was, and, if I would accompany him, he would bring me to her. Improbable as this ſtory was, I believed it immediately, and agreed to go with him, while my heart leaped for joy; and, indeed, he conducted me to a black young woman, who was ſo like my ſiſter, that at firſt ſight, I really thought it was her: but I was quickly
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:023353_0105_0FBF4B3C1CB6CCB0"/>
undeceived; and, on talking to her, I found her to be of another nation.</p>
                     <p>WHILE we lay here the Preſton came in from the Levant. As ſoon as ſhe arrived, my maſter told me I ſhould now ſee my old companion, Dick, who was gone in her when ſhe ſailed for Turkey. I was much rejoiced at this news, and expected every minute to embrace him; and when the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain came on board of our ſhip, which he did immediately after; I ran to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after my friend; but, with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible ſorrow, I learned from the boat's crew that the dear youth was dead! and that they had brought his cheſt, and all his other things, to my maſter: th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſe he afterwards gave to me, and I regarded them as a memorial of my friend, whom I loved, and griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, as a brother.</p>
                     <p>WHILE we were at Gibralter, I ſaw a ſoldier hanging by the heels, at one of the moles<note n="*" place="bottom">He had drowned himſelf in endeavouring to deſert.</note>: I thought this a ſtrange <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ight, as I had ſeen a man hanged in London by his neck. At another time I ſaw the maſter of a frigate towed to more on a grating, by ſeveral of the men of war's boats, and diſcharged the fleet, which I underſtood was a mark of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:023353_0106_0FBF4B3FD084B2E0"/>
for cowardice. On board the ſame ſhip there was alſo a ſailor hung up at the yard-arm.</p>
                     <p>AFTER laying at Gibralter for ſome time, we ſailed up the Mediterranean a conſiderable way above the Gulf of Lyons; where we were one night overtaken with a terrible gale of wind, much greater than any I had ever yet experienced. The ſea ran ſo high that, though all the guns were well houſed, there was great reaſon to fear their getting looſe, the ſhip rolled ſo much; and if they had it muſt have proved our deſtruction. After we had cruiſed here for a ſhort time, we came to Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona, a Spaniſh ſea-port, remarkable for its ſilk manufactures. Here the ſhips were all to be watered; and my maſter, who ſpoke different languages, and uſed often to interpret for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, ſuperintended the watering of ours. For that purpoſe he and the officers of the other ſhips, who were on the ſame ſervice, had tents pitched in the bay; and the Spaniſh ſoldiers we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e ſtationed along the ſhore, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſee that no depredations were committed by our men.</p>
                     <p>I uſed conſtantly to attend my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and I was charmed with this
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:023353_0107_0FBF4B422F292E60"/>
place. All the time we ſtayed it was like a fair with the natives, who brought us fruits of all kinds, and ſold them to us much cheaper than I got them in England. They uſed alſo to bring wine down to us in hog and ſheep ſkins, which diverted me very much. The Spaniſh officers here treated our officers with great politeneſs and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſome of them, in particular, uſed to come often to my maſter's tent to viſit him; where they would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times divert themſelves by mounting me on the horſes or mules, ſo that I could not fall, and ſetting them off at full gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop; my imperfect ſkill in horſemanſhip all the while affording them no ſmall entertainment. After the ſhips were watered, we returned to our old ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cruizing off Toulon, for the purpoſe of intercepting a fleet of French men of war that lay there. One Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, in our cruiſe, we came off a place where there were two ſmall French fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates laying in ſhore; and our admiral, thinking to take or deſtroy them, ſent two ſhips in after them—the Culloden and the Conqueror. They ſoon came up to the Frenchmen; and I ſaw a ſmart fight here, both by ſea and land; for the frigates were covered by bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:023353_0108_0FBF4B43D128CE98"/>
and they played upon our ſhips moſt furiouſly, which they as furiouſly returned, and for a long time a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant firing was kept up on all ſides at an amazing rate. At laſt one frigate ſunk; but the people eſcaped, though not without much difficulty: and a little after ſome of the people left the other frigate alſo, which was a mere wreck. However, our ſhips did not venture to bring her away, they were ſo much annoyed from the batteries, which raked them both in going and coming: their topmaſts were ſhot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and they were otherwiſe ſo much ſhattered, that the admiral was obliged to ſend in many boats to tow them back to the fleet. I afterwards ſailed with a man who fought in one of the French batteries during the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and he told me our ſhips had done conſiderable miſchief that day on ſhore and in the batteries.</p>
                     <p>AFTER this we ſailed for Gibraltar, and arrived there about Auguſt 1759. Here we remained with all our ſails un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, while the fleet was watering and doing other neceſſary things. While we were in this ſituation, one day the admiral, with moſt of the principal of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and many people of all ſtations,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:023353_0109_0FBF4B45B5180A80"/>
being on ſhore, about ſeven o'clock in the evening we were alarmed by ſignals from the frigates ſtationed for that purpoſe; and in an inſtant there was a general cry that the French fleet was out, and juſt paſſing through the ſtreights. The admiral immediately came on board with ſome other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers; and it is impoſſible to deſcribe the noiſe, hurry and confuſion through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole fleet, in bending their fails and ſlipping their cables; many people and ſhip's boats were left on ſhore in the buſtle. We had two captains on board of our ſhip who came away in the hurry and left their ſhips to follow. We ſhewed lights from the gun-wales to the main top maſt-head; and all our lieutenants were employed amongſt the fleet to tell the ſhips not to wait for their captains but to put the ſails to the yards, ſlip their cables and follow us; and in this confuſion of making ready for fighting, we ſet out for ſea in the dark after the French fleet. Here I could have exclaimed with Ajax,
<q>
                           <l>Oh Jove! O father! if it be thy will</l>
                           <l>That we muſt periſh, we thy will obey,</l>
                           <l>But let us periſh by the light of day.</l>
                        </q>
They had got the ſtart of us ſo far that
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:023353_0110_0FBF4B4C71CD2D10"/>
we were not able to come up with them during the night; but at day-light we ſaw ſeven ſail of the line of battle ſome miles ahead. We immediately chaſed them till about four o'clock in the evening, when our ſhips came up with them; and, though we were about fifteen large ſhips, our gallant admiral only fought them with his own diviſion, which conſiſted of ſeven; ſo that we were juſt ſhip for ſhip. We paſſed by the whole of the enemy's fleet in order to come at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, Monſ. La Clue, who was in the Ocean, an eighty-four gun ſhip: as we paſſed they all fired on us; and at one time three of them fired together, continuing to do ſo for ſome time. Notwithſtanding which our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral would not ſuffer a gun to be fired at any of them, to my aſtoniſhment; but made us lie on our bellies on the deck till we came quite cloſe to the Ocean, who was ahead of them all; when we had orders to pour the whole three tiers into her at once.</p>
                     <p>THE engagement now commenced with great fury on both ſides: the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean immediately returned our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ire, and we continued engaged with each other for ſome time; during which I was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:023353_0111_0FBF4B4DF948D350"/>
ſtunned with the thundering of the great g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>s, whoſe dreadful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents hurried many of my companions into awful eternity. At laſt the French line was entirely broken, and we obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the victory, which was immediately proclaimed with loud huzzas and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations. We took three prizes, La Modeſte, of ſixty-four guns, and Le Temeraire and Centaur, of ſeventy-four guns each. The reſt of the French ſhips took to flight with all the ſail they could crowd. Our ſhip being very much damaged, and quite diſabled from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the enemy, the admiral imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately quitted her, and went in the broken and only boat we had left on board the Newark, with which, and ſome other ſhips, he went after the French. The Ocean, and another large French ſhip, called the Redoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, endeavouring<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to eſcape, ran aſhore at Cape Logas, on the coaſt of Portugal; and the French admiral and ſome of the crew got aſhore; but we, finding it impoſſible to get the ſhips off, ſet fire to them both. About mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night I ſaw the Ocean blow up, with a moſt dreadful exploſion. I never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held a more awful ſcene. In leſs than a minute, the midnight for a certain
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:023353_0112_0FBF4B4F8A27C310"/>
ſpace ſeemed turned into day by the blaze, which was attended with a noiſe louder and more terrible than thunder, that ſeemed to rend every element a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round us.</p>
                     <p>MY ſtation during the engagement was on the middle-deck, where I was quartered with another boy, to bring powder to the aftermoſt gun; and here I was a witneſs of the dreadful fate of many of my companions, who, in the twinkling of an eye, were daſhed in pieces, and launched into eternity. Happily I eſcaped unhurt, though the ſhot and ſplinters flew thick about me during the whole fight. Towards the latter part of it my maſter was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and I ſaw him carried down to the ſurgeon; but though I was much alarmed for him and wiſhed to aſſiſt him I dared not leave my poſt. At this ſtation my gun-mate (a partner in bringing powder for the ſame gun) and I ran a very great riſk for more than half an hour of blowing up the ſhip. For, when we had taken the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges out of the boxes, the bottoms of many of them proving rotten, the powder ran all about the deck, near the match tub: we ſcarcely had water enough at the laſt to throw on it. We
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:023353_0113_0FBF4B51CED9FC98"/>
were alſo, from our employment, very much expoſed to the enemy's ſhots; for we had to go through nearly the whole length of the ſhip to bring the powder. I expected therefore every minute to be my laſt; eſpecially when I ſaw our men fall ſo thick about me; but, wiſhing to guard as much againſt the dangers as poſſible, at firſt I thought it would be ſafeſt not to go for the powder till the Frenchmen had fired their broadſide; and then, while they were charging, I could go and come with my powder: but immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards I thought this caution was fruitleſs; and, cheering myſelf with the reflection that there was a time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted for me to die as well as to be born, I inſtantly caſt off all fear or thought whatever of death, and went through the whole of my duty with alacrity; pleaſing myſelf with the hope, if I ſurvived the battle, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating it and the dangers I had eſcaped to the Miſs Guerins, and others, when I ſhould return to London.</p>
                     <p>OUR ſhip ſuffered very much in this engagement; for, beſides the number of our killed and wounded, ſhe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt torn to pieces, and our rigging ſo much ſhattered, that our mizen-maſt,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:023353_0114_0FBF4B54159BEBE0"/>
main-yard, &amp;c. hung over the ſide of the ſhip; ſo that we were obliged to get many carpenters, and others from ſome of the ſhips of the fleet, to aſſiſt in ſetting us in ſome tolerable order; and, notwithſtanding which, it took us ſome time before we were complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refitted; after which we left Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Broderick to command, and we, with the prizes ſteered for England, On the paſſage, and as ſoon as my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſomething recovered of his wounds, the Admiral appointed him captain of the Etna fire-ſhip, on which he and I left the Namur; and went on board of her at ſea. I liked this little ſhip very much. I now became the captain's ſteward, in which ſituation I was very happy: for I was extremely well treated by all on board; and I had leiſure to improve myſelf in reading and writing. The latter I had learned a little of before I left the Namur, as there was a ſchool on board. When we arrived at Spithead, the Etna went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Portſmouth harbour to refit, which being done, we returned to Spithead and joined a large fleet that was thought to be intended againſt the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah; but about that time the king died; whether that prevented the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:023353_0115_0FBF4B5A14B8CF40"/>
I know not; but it cauſed our ſhip to be ſtationed at Cowes, in the iſle of Wight, till the beginning of the year ſixty one. Here I ſpent my time very pleaſantly; I was much on ſhore all about this delightful iſland, and found the inhabitants very civil.</p>
                     <p>WHILE I was here, I met with a trifling incident, which ſurpriſed me agreeably. I was one day in a field belonging to a gentleman who had a black boy about my own ſize; this boy having obſerved me from his maſter's houſe, was tranſported at the ſight of one of his own countrymen, and ran to meet me with the utmoſt haſte. I not knowing what he was about, turned a little out of his way at firſt, but to no purpoſe: he ſoon came cloſe to me and caught hold of me in his arms as if I had been his brother, though we had never ſeen each other before. After we had talked together for ſome time he took me to his maſter's houſe, where I was treated very kindly. This bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent boy and I were very happy in frequently ſeeing each other till about the month of March, 1761, when our ſhip had orders to fit out again for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other expedition. When we got ready we joined a very large fleet at Spithead,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:023353_0116_0FBF4B5B83C08A70"/>
commanded by Commodore Keppel, which was deſtined againſt Belle-Iſle, and with a number of tranſport ſhips with troops on board to make a deſcent on the place, we ſailed once more in queſt of fame. I longed to engage in new adventures and ſee freſh wonders.</p>
                     <p>I had a mind on which every thing uncommon made its full impreſſion, and every event which I conſidered as marvellous. Every extraordinary eſcape, or ſignal deliverance, either of myſelf or others, I looked upon to be effected by the interpoſition of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. We had not been above ten days at ſea before an incident of this kind happened; which, whatever cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit it may obtain from the reader, made no ſmall impreſſion on my mind.</p>
                     <p>WE had on board a gunner, whoſe name was John Mondle; a man of very indifferent morals. This man's cabin was between the decks, exactly over where I lay, abreaſt of the quarter-deck ladder. One night, the 5th of April, being terrified with a dream, he awoke in ſo great a fright that he could not reſt in his bed any longer, nor even remain in his cabin; and he went upon deck a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four o'clock in the morning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely agitated. He immediately told
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:023353_0117_0FBF4B5D0A0FB6D0"/>
thoſe on the deck of the agonies of his mind, and the dream which occaſioned it; in which he ſaid he had ſeen many things very awful, and had been warned by St. Peter to repent, who told him time was ſhort. This he ſaid had greatly alarmed him, and he was determined to alter his life. People generally mock the fears of others when they are themſelves in ſafety; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> of his ſhipmates who heard him only laughed at him. However, he made a vow that he never would drink ſtrong liquors again; and he immediately got a light, and gave away his ſea-ſtores of liquor. After which, his agitation ſtill continuing, he began to read the Scriptures, hoping to find ſome relief; and ſoon afterwards he laid himſelf down again on his bed, and endeavoured to compoſe himſelf to ſleep, but to no purpoſe; his mind ſtill continuing in a ſtate of agony. By this time it was exactly half after ſeven in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: I was then under the half-deck at the great cabin door; and all at once I heard the people in the waiſt cry out, moſt fearfully—<q>The Lord have mercy upon us! We are all loſt! The Lord have mercy upon us!</q> Mr. Mondle hearing the cries, immediately
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:023353_0118_0FBF4B6038D25748"/>
ran out of his cabin; and we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſtruck by the Lynne, a forty gun ſhip, Captain Clark, which nearly run us down. This ſhip had juſt put about, and was by the wind, but had not got full head way, or we muſt all have periſhed; for the wind was briſk. However, before Mr. Mondle had got four ſteps from his cabin door, ſhe ſtruck our ſhip with her cutwater right in the middle of his bed and cabin, and ran it up to the combings of the quarter deck hatchway, and above three feet below water, and in a minute there was not a bit of wood to be ſeen where Mr. Mondle's cabin ſtood; and he was ſo near being killed that ſome of the ſplinters tore his face. As Mr. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle muſt inevitably have periſhed from this accident had he not been alarmed in the very extraordinary way I have related, I could not help regarding this as an awful interpoſition of Providence for his preſervation. The two ſhips for ſome time ſwinged alongſide of each other; for ours being a fireſhip, our grappling-irons caught the Lynne every way, and the yards and rigging went at an aſtoniſhing rate. Our ſhip was in ſuch a ſhocking condition that we all thought ſhe would inſtantly go
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:023353_0119_0FBF4B67CB1A29C0"/>
down, and every one ran for their lives, and got as well as they could on board the Lynne; but our lieutenant being the aggreſſor, he never quitted the ſhip. However, when we found ſhe did not ſink immediately, the captain came on board again, and encouraged our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to return and try to ſave her. Many on this came back, but ſome would not venture. Some of the ſhips in the fleet ſeeing our ſituation, immediately ſent their boats to our aſſiſtance; but it took us the whole day to ſave the ſhip with all their help. And by uſing every poſſible means, particularly frapping her together with many hawſers, and putting a great quantity of tallow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low water where ſhe was damaged, ſhe was kept together: but it was well we did not meet with any gales of wind, or we muſt have gone to pieces; for we were in ſuch a crazy condition that we had ſhips to attend us till we arrived at Belle-Iſle, the place of our deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and then we had all things taken out of the ſhip, and ſhe was properly repaired. This eſcape of Mr. Mondle, which he, as well as myſelf, always conſidered as a ſingular act of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I believe had a great influence on his life and conduct ever afterwards.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="unknown:023353_0120_0FBF4B68F3C403A0"/>
Now that I am on this ſubject I beg leave to relate another inſtance or two which ſtrongly raiſed my belief of the particular interpoſition of Heaven, and which might not otherwiſe have found a place here, from their inſignificance. I belonged for a few days in the year 1758, to the Jaſon, of fifty-four guns, at Plymouth; and one night, when I was on board, a woman, with a child at her breaſt, fell from the upper-deck down into the hold, near the keel. Every one thought that the mother and child muſt be both daſhed to pieces; but, to our great ſurpriſe, neither of them was hurt. I myſelf one day fell headlong from the upper deck of the Etna down the after-hold, when the ballaſt was out; and all who ſaw me fall cried out I was killed: but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the leaſt injury. And in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ame ſhip a man fell from the maſt-head on the deck without being hurt. In theſe, and in many more inſtances, I thought I could plainly trace the hand of God, without whoſe permiſſion a ſparrow cannot fall. I began to raiſe my fear from man to him alone, and to call daily on his holy name with fear and reverence: and I truſt he heard my ſupplications, and graciouſly
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:023353_0121_0FBF4B6A755D3588"/>
condeſcended to anſwer me according to his holy word, and to implant the ſeeds of piety in me, even one of the meaneſt of his creatures.</p>
                     <p>WHEN we had refitted our ſhip, and all things were in readineſs for attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place, the troops on board the tranſports were ordered to diſembark; and my maſter as a junior captain, had a ſhare in the command of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. This was on the 12th of April. The French were drawn up on the ſhore and had made every diſpoſition to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the landing of our men, only a ſmall part of them this day being able to effect it; moſt of them, after fighting with great bravery, were cut off; and General Crawford, with a number of others, were taken priſoners. In this day's engagement we had alſo our lieutenant killed.</p>
                     <p>ON the 21ſt of April we renewed our efforts to land the men, while all the men of war were ſtationed along the ſhore to cover it, and fired at the French batteries and breaſt works from early in the morning till about four o'clok in the evening, when our ſoldiers affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſafe landing. They immediately attacked the French; and, after a ſharp encounter, forced them from the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:023353_0122_0FBF4B72A7324958"/>
Before the enemy retreated they blew up ſeveral of them, leſt they ſhould fall into our hands. Our men now proceeded to beſiege the citadel, and my maſter was ordered on board to ſuperintend the landing of all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials neceſſary for carrying on the ſiege; in which ſervice I moſtly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him. While I was there I went about to different parts of the iſland; and one day, particularly, my curioſity almoſt coſt me my life. I wanted very much to ſee the mode of charging the mortars and letting off the ſhells, and for that purpoſe I went to an Engliſh battery that was but a very few yards from the walls of the citadel. There, indeed, I had an opportunity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely gratifying myſelf in ſeeing the whole operation, and that not without running a very great riſk, both from the Engliſh ſhells that burſt while I was there, but likewiſe from thoſe of the French. One of the largeſt of their ſhells burſted within nine or ten yards of me: there was a ſingle rock cloſe by, about the ſize of a butt; and I got inſtant ſhelter under it in time to avoid the fury of the ſhell. Where it burſt the earth was torn in ſuch a manner that two or three butts might eaſily

have gone into the hole it made, and it threw great quantities of ſtones and dirt to a conſiderable diſtance. Three ſhot were alſo fired at me and another boy who was along with me, one of them in particular ſeemed
<q>
                           <l>Wing'd with red lightning and impetuous rage;</l>
                        </q>
for with a moſt dreadful ſound it hiſſed cloſe by me, and ſtruck a rock at a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſtance, which it ſhattered to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. When I ſaw what perilous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances I was in, I attempted to return the neareſt way I could find, and thereby I got between the Engliſh and the French centinels. An Engliſh ſergeant, who commanded the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts, ſeeing me, and ſurpriſed how I came there, (which was by ſtealth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the ſeaſhore), reprimanded me very ſeverely for it, and inſtantly took the centinel off his poſt into cuſtody, for his negligence in ſuffering me to paſs the lines. While I was in this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation I obſerved at a little diſtance a French horſe, belonging to ſome iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders, which I thought I would now mount, for the greater expedition of getting off. Accordingly I took ſome cord which I had about me, and making a kind of bridle of it, I put it round
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:023353_0124_0FBF4B750DCF4B28"/>
the horſe's head, and the tame beaſt very quietly ſuffered me to tie him thus and mount him. As ſoon as I was on the horſe's back I began to kick and beat him, and try every means to make him go quick, but all to very little purpoſe: I could not drive him out of a ſlow pace. While I was creeping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, ſtill within reach of the enemy's ſhot, I met with a ſervant well mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on an Engliſh horſe, I immediately ſtopped; and, crying, told him my caſe; and begged of him to help me, and this he effectually did; for, having a fine large whip, he began to laſh my horſe with it ſo ſeverely, that he ſet off full ſpeed with me towards the ſea, while I was quite unable to hold or manage him. In this manner I went along till I came to a craggy precipice. I now could not ſtop my horſe; and my mind was filled with apprehenſions of my deplorable fate ſhould he go down the precipice, which he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fully diſpoſed to do: I therefore thought I had better throw myſelf off him at once, which I did immediately with a great deal of dexterity, and fortunately eſcaped unhurt. As ſoon as I found myſelf at liberty I made the beſt of my way for the ſhip, determined
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:023353_0125_0FBF4B767909C2C8"/>
I would not be ſo fool-hardy again in a hurry.</p>
                     <p>WE continued to beſiege the citadel till June, when it ſurrendered. During the ſiege I have counted above ſixty ſhells and carcaſes in the air at once. When this place was taken I went through the citadel, and in the bomb-proofs under it, which were cut in the ſolid rock; and I thought it a ſurpriſing place, both for ſtrength and building: notwithſtanding which our ſhots and ſhells had made amazing devaſtation, and ruinous heaps all around it.</p>
                     <p>AFTER the taking of this iſland, our ſhips with ſome others commanded by commodore Stanhope in the Swift-ſure, went to Baſſe road, where we blocked up a French fleet. Our ſhips were there from June till February fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; and in that time I ſaw a great many ſcenes of war, and ſtratagems on both ſides to deſtroy each others fleet. Sometimes we would attack the French with ſome ſhips of the line; at other times with boats; and frequently we made prizes. Once or twice the French attacked us by throwing ſhells with their bomb-veſſels; and one day as a French veſſel was throwing ſhells <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

behind the iſle of I de Re: the tide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing complicated, ſhe came within a gun ſhot of the Naſſau; but the Naſſau could not bring a gun to bear upon her, and thereby the Frenchman got off. We were twice attacked by their fire-floats, which they chained together, and then let them float down with the tide; but each time we ſent boats with graplings, and towed them ſafe out of the fleet.</p>
                     <p>WE had different commanders while we were at this place, Commodores Stanhope, Dennis, Lord Howe, &amp;c. From hence, before the Spaniſh war began, our ſhip and the W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>AFTER our ſhip was fitted out again for ſervice, in September ſhe went to Guernſey, where I was very glad to ſee my old hoſteſs, who was now a widow, and my former little charming com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, her daughter. I ſpent ſome time here very happily with them, till October, when we had orders to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to Portſmouth. We parted from each other with a great deal of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and I promiſed to return ſoon, and ſee them again; not knowing what all-powerful fate had determined for me. Our ſhip having arrived at Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, we went into the harbour, and remained there till the latter end of November, when we heard great talk about a peace; and, to our very great joy, in the beginning of December we
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:023353_0128_0FBF4B827AED6F18"/>
had orders to go up to London with our ſhip to be paid off. We received this news with loud huzzas, and every other demonſtration of gladneſs; and nothing but mirth was to be ſeen throughout every part of the ſhip. I too was not without my ſhare of the general joy on this occaſion. I thought now of nothing but being freed, and working for myſelf, and thereby get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting money to enable me to get a good education; for I always had a great deſire to be able at leaſt to read and write; and while I was on ſhip-board I had endeavoured to improve myſelf in both. While I was in the Etna par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, the captain's clerk taught me to write, and gave me a ſmattering of arithmetic as far as the rule of three. There was alſo one Daniel Queen, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout forty years of age, a man very well educated, who meſſed with me on board this ſhip, and he likewiſe dreſſed and attended the captain. Fortunately this man ſoon became very much attached to me, and took very great pains to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct me in many things. He taught me to ſhave and dreſs hair a little, and alſo to read in the Bible, explaining many paſſages to me, which I did not comprehend. I was wonderfully ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:023353_0129_0FBF4B8408AA5A70"/>
to ſee the laws and rules of my own country written almoſt exactly here; a circumſtance which I believe tended to impreſs our manners and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms more deeply on my memory. I uſed to tell him of this reſemblance; and many a time we have ſat up the whole night together at this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In ſhort, he was like a father to me; and ſome even uſed to call me after his name; they alſo ſtyled me the black Chriſtian. Indeed I almoſt lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with the affection of a ſon. Many things I have denied myſelf that he might have them; and when I uſed to play at marbles or any other game, and won a few halfpence, or got any little money, which I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times did, for ſhaving any one, I uſed to buy him a little ſugar or tobacco, as far as my ſtock of money would go. He uſed to ſay, that he and I never ſhould part; and that when our ſhip was paid off, as I was as free as himſelf or any other man on board, he would inſtruct me in his buſineſs, by which I might gain a good livelihood. This gave me new life and ſpirits; and my heart burned within me, while I thought the time long till I obtained my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. For though my maſter had not
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:023353_0130_0FBF4B879BA95450"/>
promiſed it to me, yet, beſides the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances I had received that he had no right to detain me, he always treated me with the greateſt kindneſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in me an unbounded confidence; he even paid attention to my morals; and would never ſuffer me to deceive him, or tell lies, of which he uſed to tell me the conſequences; and that if I did ſo God would not love me; ſo that from all this tenderneſs, I had never once ſuppoſed, in all my dreams of freedom, that he would think of detaining me any longer than I wiſhed.</p>
                     <p>IN purſuance of our orders we ſailed from Portſmonth for the Thames, and arrived at Deptford the 10th of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, where we caſt anchor juſt as it was high water. The ſhip was up about half an hour, when my maſter ordered the barge to be manned; and all in an inſtant, without having before given me the leaſt reaſon to ſuſpect any thing of the matter, he forced me into the barge; ſaying, I was going to leave him, but he would take care I ſhould not I was ſo ſtruck with the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedneſs of this proceeding, that for ſome time I did not make a reply, only I made an offer to go for my
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:023353_0131_0FBF4B8D92B35E68"/>
books and cheſt of clothes, but he ſwore I ſhould not move out of his ſight; and if I did he would cut my throat, at the ſame time taking his hanger. I began, however, to collect myſelf; and, plucking up courage, I told him I was free, and he could not by law ſerve me ſo. But this only enraged him the more; and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to ſwear, and ſaid he would ſoon let me know whether he would or not, and at that inſtant ſprung him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the barge from the ſhip, to the aſtoniſhment and ſorrow of all on board. The tide, rather unluckily for me, had juſt turned downward, ſo that we quickly fell down the river along with it, till we came among ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward-bound Weſt Indiamen; for he was reſolved to put me on board the firſt veſſel he could get to receive me. The boat's crew, who pulled againſt their will, became quite faint, different times, and would have gone aſhore; but he would not let them. Some of them ſtrove then to cheer me, and told me he could not fell me, and that they would ſtand by me, which revived me a little; and I ſtill entertained hopes; for as they pulled along he aſked ſome veſſels to receive me, but they would
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:023353_0132_0FBF4B8E75F73368"/>
not. But, juſt as we had got a little below Graveſend, we came along ſide of a ſhip which was going away the next tide for the Weſt Indies; her name was the charming Sally, Captain James Doran; and my maſter went on board and agreed with him for me; and in a little time I was ſent for into the cabin. When I came there Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Doran aſked me if I knew him: I anſwered that I did not; "Then," ſaid he, "you are now my ſlave." I told him my maſter could not ſell me to him, nor to any one elſe. "Why," ſaid he, "did not your maſter buy you?" I confeſſed he did. <q>But I have ſerved him,</q> ſaid I, <q>many years, and he has taken all my wages and prize-money, for I had only got one ſixpence during the war; beſides this I have been baptized; and by the laws of the land no man has a right to ſell me:</q> And I added that I had heard a lawyer and others at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times tell my maſter ſo. They both then ſaid that thoſe people who told me ſo were not my friends; but I replied, <q>It was very extraordinary that other people did not know the law as well as they.</q> Upon this Captain Doran ſaid I talked too much
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:023353_0133_0FBF4B8FF8993648"/>
Engliſh; and if I did not behave my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf well, and be quiet, he had a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod on board to make me. I was too well convinced of his power over me to doubt what he ſaid; and my former ſufferings in the ſlave-ſhip preſenting themſelves to my mind, the recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them made me ſhudder. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, before I retired I told them that as I could not get any right among men here I hoped I ſhould hereafter in Heaven; &amp; I immediately left the cabin, filled with reſentment and ſorrow. The only coat I had with me my maſter took away with him, and ſaid, <q>If your prize-money had been 10,000l. I had a right to it all, and would have taken it.</q> I had about nine guineas, which, during my long ſea-faring life, I had ſcraped together from trifling perquiſites and little ventures; and I hid it that inſtant, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="127" facs="unknown:023353_0134_0FBF4B966C3CE3E0"/>
all my hopes were baffled, and the hour of my deliverance was as yet far off. My maſter, having ſoon conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his bargain with the captain, came out of the cabin, and he and his people got into the boat and put off; I followed them with aching eyes as long as I could, and when they were out of ſight I threw myſelf on the deck, with a heart ready to burſt with ſorrow and anguiſh.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THUS, at the moment I expected all my toils to end, was I plunged, as I ſuppoſed, in a new ſlavery; in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of which all my ſervice hitherto had been perfect freedom; and whoſe horrors, always preſent to my mind, now ruſhed on it with tenfold aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. I wept very bitterly for ſome time: and began to think that I muſt have done ſomething to diſpleaſe the Lord, that he thus puniſhed me ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely. This filled me with painful reflections on my paſt conduct; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected that on the morning of our arrival at Deptford I had raſhly ſworn
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:023353_0136_0FBF4B99F70EF0B0"/>
that as ſoon as we reached London I would ſpend the day in rambling and ſport. My conſcience ſmote me for this unguarded expreſſion: I felt that the Lord was able to diſappoint me in all things, and immediately conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my preſent ſituation as a judgment of Heaven on account of my preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſwearing: I therefore, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of heart, acknowledged my tranſgreſſion to God, and poured out my ſoul before him with unfeigned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and with earneſt ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I beſought him not to abandon me in my diſtreſs, nor caſt me from his mercy for ever. In a little time my grief, ſpent with its own violence, began to ſubſide; and after the firſt confuſion of my thoughts was over I reflected with more calmneſs on my preſent condition: I conſidered that trials and diſappointments are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for our good, and I thought God might perhaps have permitted this, in order to teach me wiſdom and reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for he had hitherto ſhadowed me with the wings of his mercy, and by his inviſible but powerful hand brought me the way I knew not. Theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections gave me a little comfort, and I roſe at laſt from the deck with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:023353_0137_0FBF4BA115253158"/>
and ſorrow in my countenance, yet mixed with ſome faint hope that the <hi>Lord would appear</hi> for my deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
                     <p>SOON afterwards, as my new maſter was going on ſhore, he called me to him, and told me to behave myſelf well, and do the buſineſs of the ſhip the ſame as any of the reſt of the boys, and that I ſhould fare the better for it; but I made him no anſwer. I was then aſked if I could ſwim, and I ſaid, No. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I was made to go under the deck, and was well watched. The next tide the ſhip got under way, and ſoon after arrived at the Mother Bank, Portſmouth; where ſhe waited a few days for ſome of the Weſt India convoy. While I was here I tried every means I could deviſe amongſt the people of the ſhip to get me a boat from the ſhore, as there was none ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to come alongſide of the ſhip; and their own, whenever it was uſed, was hoiſted in again immediately. A ſailor on board took a guinea from me on pretence of getting me a boat; and promiſed me, time after time, that it was hourly to come off. When he had the watch upon deck I watched alſo; and looked long enough, but all
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:023353_0138_0FBF4BA2289D52D8"/>
in vain; I could never ſee either the boat or my g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>inea again. And what I thought was ſtill the worſt of all, the fellow gave information, as I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found, all the while to the mates, of my intention to go off, if I could in any way do it; but, rogue like, he never told them he had got a guinea from me to procure my eſcape. However, after we had ſailed, and his trick was made known to the ſhip's crew, I had ſome ſatisfaction in ſeeing him deteſted and deſpiſed by them all for his behaviour to me, I was ſtill in hopes that my old ſhipmates would not forget their promiſe to come for me to Portſmouth: and, indeed, at laſt, but not till the day before we ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſome of them did come there, and ſent me off ſome oranges, and other tokens of their regard. They alſo ſent me word they would come off to me themſelves the next day or the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and a lady alſo, who lived in Goſport, wrote to me that ſhe would come and take me out of the ſhip at the ſame time. This lady had been once very intimate with my former maſter: I uſed to ſell and take care of a great deal of property for her, in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſhips; and in return ſhe always
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:023353_0139_0FBF4BA3784B02C0"/>
ſhewed great friendſhip for me, and uſed to tell my maſter that ſhe would take me away to live with her: but, unfortunately for me, a diſagreement ſoon afterwards took place between them; and ſhe was ſucceeded in my maſter's good graces by another lady, who appeared ſole miſtreſs of the Etna, and moſtly lodged on board. I was not ſo great a favourite with this lady as with the former; ſhe had conceived a pique againſt me on ſome occaſion when ſhe was on board, and ſhe did not fail to inſtigate my maſter to treat me in the manner he did<note n="*" place="bottom">Thus was I ſacrificed to the envy and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this woman for knowing that the lady whom ſhe had ſucceeded in my maſter's good graces deſigned to take me into her ſervice; which, had I once got on ſhore, ſhe would not have been able to prevent. She felt her pride alarmed at the ſuperiority of her rival in being attended by a black ſervant: it was not leſs to prevent this than to be revenged on me, that ſhe cauſed the captain to treat me thus cruelly.</note>.</p>
                     <p>HOWEVER, the next morning, the 30th of December, the wind being briſk and eaſterly, the Aeolus frigate, which was to eſcort the convoy, made a ſignal for ſailing. All the ſhips then got up their anchors; and, before any of my friends had an opportunity to
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:023353_0140_0FBF4BA782FA2178"/>
come off to my relief, to my inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible anguiſh our ſhip had got under way. What tumultuous emotions agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated my ſoul when the convoy got un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In the firſt expreſſion of my grief I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached my fate, and wiſhed I had never been born. I was ready to curſe the tide that bore us, the gale that wafted my priſon, and even the ſhip that conducted us; and I called on death to relieve me from the horrors I felt and dreaded, that I might be in that place

My for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſlavery now roſe in dreadful, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view to my mind, and diſplayed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but miſery, ſtripes, and chains; and, in the firſt paroxyſm of my grief, I called upon God's thunder, and his avenging power, to direct the ſtroke of death to me, rather than permit me to become a ſlave, and be ſold from Lord to Lord.</p>
                     <p>IN this ſtate of my mind our ſhip came to an anchor, and ſoon after diſcharged her cargo. I now knew what it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me in my diſtreſs in that time, two of the ſailors robbed me of all my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and ran away from the ſhip. I had been ſo long uſed to an European climate, that at firſt I felt the ſcorching

Weſt India ſun very painful, while the daſhing ſurf would toſs the boat and the people in it frequently above high wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mark. Sometimes our limbs were broken with this, or even attended with inſtant death, and I was day by day mangled and torn.</p>
                     <p>ABOUT the middle of May, when the ſhip was got ready to ſail for England, I all the time believing that Fate's blackeſt clouds were gathering over my head, and expecting their burſting would mix me with the dead, Captain Doran ſent for me aſhore one morning, and I was told by the meſſenger that my fate was then determined. With trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſteps and fluttering heart I came to the captain, and found with him one Mr. Robert King, a quaker, and the firſt merchant in the place. The cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain then told me my former maſter had ſent me there to be ſold; but that he had deſired him to get me the beſt maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he could, as he told him I was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſerving boy, which Captain Doran ſaid he found to be true; and if he were to ſtay in the Weſt Indies he would be glad to keep me himſelf; but he could not venture to take me to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he was very ſure that when I came there I would leave him. I at

that inſtant burſt out a crying, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged much of him to take me to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland with him, but all to no purpoſe. He told me he had got me the very beſt maſter in the whole iſland, with whom I ſhould be as happy as if I were in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and for that reaſon he choſe to let him have me, though he could ſell me to his own brother-in-law for a great deal more money than what he got from this gentleman. Mr. King, my new maſter, then made a reply, and ſaid the reaſon he had bought me was on account of my good character; and as he had not the leaſt doubt of my good behaviour, I ſhould be very well off with him. He alſo told me he did not live in the Weſt Indies, but at Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, where he was going ſoon; and, as I underſtood ſomething of the rules of arithmetic, when we got there he would put me to ſchool, and fit me for a clerk. This converſation reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my mind a little, and I left thoſe gentlemen conſiderably more at eaſe in myſelf than when I came to them; and I was very thankful to Captain Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, and even to my old maſter, for the character they had given me; a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter which I afterwards found of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſervice to me.

again, and took leave of all my ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates; and the next day the ſhip ſailed. When ſhe weighed anchor I went to the waterſide and looked at her with a very wiſhful and aching heart, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her with my eyes until ſhe was totally out of ſight. I was ſo bowed down with grief that I could not hold up my head for many months; and if my new maſter had not been kind to me I believe I ſhould have died under it at laſt. And indeed I ſoon ſound that he fully deſerved the good character which Captain Doran had given me of him; for he poſſeſſed a moſt amiable diſpoſition and temper, and was very charitable and humane. If any of his ſlaves behaved amiſs he did not beat or uſe them ill, but parted with them. This made them afraid of diſobliging him; and as he treated his ſlaves bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any other man on the iſland, ſo he was better and more faithfully ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them in return. By this kind treatment I did at laſt endeavour to compoſe myſelf; and with fortitude, though moneyleſs, determined to face whatever fate had decreed for me. Mr. King ſoon aſked me what I could do; and at the ſame time ſaid he did not mean to treat me as a common ſlave.
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:023353_0146_0FBF4BBAA74A1EE8"/>
I told him I knew ſomething of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, and could ſhave and dreſs hair pretty well; and I could refine wines, which I had learned on ſhipboard, where I had often done it; and that I could write, and underſtood arithmetic tolerably well as far as the Rule of Three. He then aſked me if I knew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of guaging; and, on my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering that I did not, he ſaid one of his clerks ſhould teach me to guage.</p>
                     <p>Mr. King dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t in all manner of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, and kept from one to ſix clerks. He loaded many veſſels in a year; particularly to Philadelphia, where he was born, and was connected with a great mercantile houſe in that city. He had beſides many veſſels and droggers, of different ſizes, which uſed to go about the iſland; and others, to collect rum, ſugar, and other goods. I underſtood pulling and managing thoſe boats very well; and this hard work, which was the firſt that he ſet me to, in the ſugar ſeaſons uſed to be my conſtant employment. I have rowed the boat, and ſlaved at the oars, from one hour to ſixteen in the twenty-four; during which I had fifteen pence ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling per day to live on, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times only ten pence. However this
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:023353_0147_0FBF4BBB85160080"/>
was conſiderably more than was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to other ſlaves that uſed to work often with me, and belonged to other gentlemen on the iſland: thoſe poor ſouls had never more than nine-pence per day, and ſeldom more than ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, from their maſters or owners, though they earned them three or four piſterines<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe piſterines are of the valus of a ſhilling.</note>: for it is a common prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in the Weſt Indies for men to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe ſlaves though they have not plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations themſelves, in order to let them out to planters and merchants at ſo much a peice by the day, and they give what allowance they chuſe out of this produce of their daily work to their ſlaves for ſubſiſtence; this allowance is often very ſcanty. My maſter often gave the owners of theſe ſlaves two and a half of theſe pieces per day, and found the poor fellows in victuals himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thought their owners did not feed them well enough according to the work they did. The ſlaves uſed to like this very well; and, as they knew my maſter to be a man of feeling, they were always glad to work for him in preference to any other gentleman; ſome of whom after they had been paid for theſe poor people's labours,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:023353_0148_0FBF4BBCF96F9530"/>
would not give them their allowance out of it. Many times have I even ſeen theſe unfortunate wretches beaten for aſking for their pay; and often ſeverely flogged by their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>wners if they did not bring them their daily or weekly money exactly to the time; though the poor creatures were obliged to wait on the gentlemen they had worked for ſometimes for more than half the day before they could get their pay; and this generally on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, when they wanted the time for themſelves. In particular, I knew a countryman of mine who once did not bring the weekly money directly that it was earned; and though he brought it the ſame day to his maſter, yet he was ſtaked to the ground for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended negligence, and was juſt going to receive a hundred laſhes, but for a gentleman who begged him off fifty. This poor man was very induſtrious; and by his frugality, had ſaved ſo much money by working on ſhip-board, that he had got a white man to buy him a boat, unknown to his maſter. Some time after he had this little eſtate, the governor wanted a boat to bring his ſugar from different parts of the iſland; and, knowing this to be a negro-man's
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:023353_0149_0FBF474F10CD25C0"/>
boat, he ſeized upon it for himſelf, and would not pay the owner a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The man on this went to his maſter, and complained to him of this act of the governor; but the only ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction he received was to be damned very heartily by his maſter, who aſked him how dared any of his negroes to have a boat. If the juſtly-merited ruin of the governor's fortune could be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gratification to the poor man he had thus robbed, he was not without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. Extortion and rapine are poor providers; and ſome time after this the governor died in the King's Bench in England, as I was told, in great poverty. The laſt war favoured this poor negro-man, and he found ſome means to eſcape from his Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an maſter: he came to England; where I ſaw him afterwards ſeveral times. Such treatment as this often drives theſe miſerable wretches to deſpair, and they run away from their maſters at the hazard of their lives. Many of them, in this place, unable to get their pay when they have earned it, and fearing to be flogged, as uſual, if they return home without it, run away where they can for ſhelter, and a reward is often offered to bring them in dead or alive.
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:023353_0150_0FBF475137B71790"/>
My maſter uſed ſometimes, in theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to agree with their owners, and to ſettle with them himſelf; and thereby he ſaved many of them a flogging.</p>
                     <p>ONCE, for a few days, I was let out to fit a veſſel, and I had no victuals allowed me by either party; at laſt I told my maſter of this treatment, and he took me away from it. In many of the eſtates, on the different iſlands where I uſed to be ſent for rum or ſugar, they would not deliver it to me, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther negro; he was therefore obliged to ſend a white man along with me to thoſe places; and then he uſed to pay him from ſix to ten piſterines a day. From being thus employed, during the time I ſerved Mr. King, in going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the different eſtates on the iſland, I had all the opportunity I could wiſh for to ſee the dreadful uſage of the poor men; uſage that reconciled me to my ſituation, and made me bleſs God for the hands into which I had fallen,</p>
                     <p>I HAD the good fortune to pleaſe my maſter in every department in which he employed me; and there was ſcarcely any part of his buſineſs, or houſhold affairs, in which I was not occaſionally engaged. I often ſupplied the place of a clerk, in receiving and
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:023353_0151_0FBF475686FD71A8"/>
delivering cargoes to the ſhips, in tending ſtores, and delivering goods: and, beſides this, I uſed to ſhave and dreſs my maſter when convenient, and take care of his horſe; and when it was neceſſary, which was very often, I worked likewiſe on board of different veſſels of his. By theſe means I became very uſeful to my maſter; and ſaved him, as he uſed to acknowledge, above a hundred pounds a year. Nor did he ſcruple to ſay I was of more advantage to him than any of his clerks; though their uſual wages in the Weſt-Indies are from ſixty to a hundred pounds current a year.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE ſometimes heard it aſſerted that a negro cannot earn his maſter the firſt coſt; but nothing can be further from the truth. I ſuppoſe nine tenths of the mechanics throughout the Weſt-Indies are negro ſlaves; and I well know the coopers among them earn two dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars a day; the carpenters the ſame, and oftentimes more; as alſo the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſmiths, and fiſhermen, &amp;c. and I have known many ſlaves whoſe maſters would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ot take a thouſand pounds cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent for them. But ſurely this aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion refutes itſelf; for, if it be true, why do the planters and merchants pay
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:023353_0152_0FBF47580B8061B8"/>
ſuch a price for ſlaves? And, above all, why do thoſe who make this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion exclaim the moſt loudly againſt the abolition of the ſlave trade? So much are men blinded, and to ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent arguments are they driven by miſtaken intereſt! I grant, indeed, that ſlaves are ſometimes, by half-feeding, half-clothing, over-working &amp; ſtripes, reduced ſo low, that they are turned out as unfit for ſervice, and left to periſh in the woods, or expire on a dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill.</p>
                     <p>MY Maſter was ſeveral times offered by different gentlemen one hundred guineas for me; but he always told them he would not ſell me, to my great joy: and I uſed to double my diligence and care for fear of getting into the hands of thoſe men who did not allow a valuable ſlave the common ſupport of life. Many of them even uſed to find fault with my maſter for feeding his ſlaves ſo well as he did, although I often went hungry, and an Engliſhman might think my fare very indifferent; but he uſed to tell them he always would do it, becauſe the ſlaves thereby looked better and did more work.</p>
                     <p>WHILE I was thus employed by my maſter I was often a witneſs to cruelties
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:023353_0153_0FBF475983584ED8"/>
of every kind, which were exerciſed on my unhappy fellow ſlaves. I uſed frequently to have different cargoes of new negroes in my care for ſale; and it was almoſt a conſtant practice with our clerks, and other whites, to commit violent depredations on the chaſtity of the female ſlaves; and theſe I was, though with reluctance, obliged to ſubmit to at all times, being unable to help them. When we have had ſome of theſe ſlaves on board my maſter's veſſels to carry them to other iſlands, or to America, I have known our mates to commit theſe acts moſt ſhamefully, to the diſgrace, not of Chriſtians only, but of men. I have even known them gratify their brutal paſſion with females not ten years old; and theſe abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations ſome of them practiſed to ſuch ſcandalous exceſs, that one of our cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains diſcharged the mate and others on that account. And yet in Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerrat I have ſeen a negro man ſtaked to the ground, and cut moſt ſhocking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and then his ears cut off bit by bit, becauſe he had been connected with a white woman who was a common proſtitute: as if it were no crime in the whites to rob an innocent African girl of her virtue; but moſt henious in a
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:023353_0154_0FBF4760E8441718"/>
black man only to gratify a paſſion of nature, where the temptation was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one of a different colour, though the moſt abandoned woman of her ſpecies.</p>
                     <p>ONE Mr. D—told me that he had ſold 41000 negroes, and that he once cut off a negro-man's leg for run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away—I aſked him if the man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had died in the operation, how he as a chriſtian could anſwer for the horrid act before God? and he told me, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering was a thing of another world; what he thought and did were policy. I told him that the chriſtian doctrine taught us to do unto others as we would that others ſhould do unto us. He then ſaid that his ſcheme had the deſired ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect—it cured that man and ſome others of running away.</p>
                     <p>ANOTHER negro-man was half hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then burnt, for attempting to poiſon a cruel overſeer. Thus by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated cruelties are the wretched firſt urged to deſpair, and then murdered, becauſe they ſtill retain ſo much of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature about them as to wiſh to put an end to their miſery, and retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate on their tyrants! Theſe overſeers are indeed for the moſt part perſons of the worſt character of any denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:023353_0155_0FBF4763B0234DA0"/>
of men in the Weſt Indies. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately, many humane gentleman, by not reſiding on their eſtates, are obliged to leave the management of them in the hands of theſe human butchers, who cut and mangle the ſlaves in a ſhocking manner on the moſt trifling occaſions, and altogether treat them in every reſpect like brutes. They pay no regard to the ſituation of pregnant women, nor the leaſt atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the lodging of the field negroes. Their huts, which ought to be well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and the place dry where they take their little repoſe, are often open ſheds, built in damp places; ſo that, when the poor creatures return tired from the toils of the field, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract many diſorders, from being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the damp air in this uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſtate, while they are heated, and their pores are open. This neglect certainly conſpires with many others to cauſe a decreaſe in the births as well as in the lives of the grown negroes. I can quote many inſtances of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who reſide on their eſtates in the Weſt-Indies, and then the ſcene is quite changed; the negroes are treated with lenity and proper care, by which their lives are prolonged, and their maſters
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:023353_0156_0FBF4764C8C2F738"/>
profited. To the honour of humanity, I knew ſeveral gentlemen who managed their eſtates in this manner; and they found that benevolence was their true intereſt. And, among many I could mention in ſeveral of the iſlands, I knew one in Montſerrat<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Dubury, and many others, Montſerrat,</note> whoſe ſlaves looked remarkably well, and never needed any freſh ſupplies of negroes; and there are many other eſtates, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Barbadoes, which, from ſuch judicious treatment, need no freſh ſtock of negroes at any time. I have the honour of knowing a moſt worthy and humane gentleman, who is a native of Barbadoes, and has eſtates there<note n="†" place="bottom">Sir Philip Gibbes, Baronet, Barbadoes.</note> This gentleman has written a treatiſe on the uſage of his own ſlaves. He allows them two hours for refreſhment at mid-day; and many other indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and comforts, particularly in their lying; and, beſides this, he raiſes more proviſions on his eſtate than they can deſtroy; ſo that by theſe attentions he ſaves the lives of his negroes, and keeps them healthy, and as happy as the condition of ſlavery can admit. I myſelf, as ſhall appear in the ſequel, managed an eſtate, where, by thoſe
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:023353_0157_0FBF4766F77A50F8"/>
attentions, the negroes were uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly cheerful and healthy, and did more work by half than by the common mode of treatment they uſually do. For want, therefore, of ſuch care and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the poor negroes, and otherwiſe oppreſſed as they are, it is no wonder that the decreaſe ſhould require 20,000 new negroes annually to fill up the vacant places of the dead.</p>
                     <p>EVEN in Barbadoes, notwithſtanding thoſe humane exceptions which I have mentioned, and others I am acquainted with, which juſtly make it quoted as a place where ſlaves meet with the beſt treatment, and need feweſt recruits of any in the Weſt Indies, yet this iſland requires 1000 negroes annually to keep up the original ſtock, which is only 80,000. So that the whole term of a negroe's life may be ſaid to be there but ſixteen years<note n="*" place="bottom">Benezet's Account of Guinea, p. 16.</note>? And yet the climate here in every reſpect the ſame as that from which they are taken, except in being more wholeſome. Do the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh colonies decreaſe in this manner? And yet what a prodigious difference is there between an Engliſh and Weſt India climate?</p>
                     <p>WHILE I was in Montſerrat I know
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:023353_0158_0FBF476875D02750"/>
a negro man, named Emanuel Sankey, who endeavoured to eſcape from his miſerable bondage, by concealing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on board of a London ſhip: but fate did not favour the poor oppreſſed man; for, being diſcovered when the veſſel was under ſail, he was delivered up again to his maſter. This <hi>Chriſtian maſter</hi> immediately pinned the wretch down to the ground at each wriſt and ancle, and then took ſome ſticks of ſealing wax, and lighted them, and dropped it all over his back. There was another maſter who was noted for cruelty; and I believe he had not a ſlave but what had been cut, and had pieces fairly taken out of the fleſh: and after they had been puniſhed thus, he uſed to make them get into a long wooden box or caſe he had for that purpoſe, in which he ſhut them up during pleaſure. It was juſt about the height and breadth of a man; and the poor wretches had no room, when in the caſe to move.</p>
                     <p>IT was very common in ſeveral of the iſlands, particularly in St. Kitt's, for the ſlaves to be branded with the initial letters of their maſter's name; and a load of heavy iron hooks hung<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> about their necks. Indeed on the moſt
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:023353_0159_0FBF476D2DE71D28"/>
trifling occaſions they were loaded with chains; and often inſtruments of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were added. The iron muzzle, thumb-ſcrews, &amp;c. are ſo well known, as not to need a deſcription, and were ſometimes applied for the ſlighteſt faults. I have ſeen a negro beaten till ſome of his bones were broken, for only letting a pot boil over. Is it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing that uſage like this ſhould drive the poor creatures to deſpair, and make them ſeek a refuge in death from thoſe evils which render their lives intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble—while,
<q>
                           <l>With ſhudd'ring horror pale, and eyes aghaſt,</l>
                           <l>They view their lamentable lot, and find</l>

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>THIS they frequently do. A negro-man on board a veſſel of my maſter, while I belonged to her, having been put in irons for ſome trifling miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor, and kept in that ſtate for ſome days, being weary of life, took an opportunity of jumping overboard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſea; however, he was picked up without being drowned. Another, whoſe life was alſo a burden to him, reſolved to ſtarve himſelf to death, and refuſed to cat any victuals: this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him a ſevere flogging: and he alſo, on the firſt occaſion which offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:023353_0160_0FBF476E893131F8"/>
jumped overboard at Charleſ-Town, but was ſaved.</p>
                     <p>NOR is there any greater regard ſhewn to the little property than there is to the perſons and lives of the negroes. I have already related an inſtance or two of particular oppreſſion out of many which I have witneſſed; but the following is frequent in all the iſlands. The wretched field-ſlaves, after toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the day for an unfeeling owner, who gives them but little victuals, ſteal ſometimes a few moments from reſt or refreſhment to gather ſome ſmall portion of graſs, according as their time will admit. This they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly tie up in a parcel; either a bit's worth (ſixpence) or half a bit's worth; and bring it to town, or to the market, to ſell. Nothing is more common than for the white people on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to take the graſs from them without paying for it; and not only ſo, but too often alſo, to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, our clerks, and many others, at the ſame time have committed acts of violence on the poor, wretched, and helpleſs females; whom I have ſeen for hours ſtand crying to no purpoſe, and get no redreſs or pay of any kind. Is not this one common and crying ſin
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:023353_0161_0FBF477014E1E2E0"/>
enough to bring down God's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the iſlands? He tells us the oppreſſor and the oppreſſed are both in his hands; and if theſe are not the poor, the broken-hearted, the blind, the captive, the bruiſed, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſpeaks of, who are they? One of theſe depredators once, in St. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatia, came on board of our veſſel, and bought ſome fowls and pigs of me; and a whole day after his departure with the things, he returned again and wanted his money back: I refuſed to give it; and, not ſeeing my captain on board, he began the common pranks with me; and ſwore he would even break open my cheſt and take my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. I therefore expected, as my cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was abſent, that he would be as good as his word and he was juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to ſtrike me, when fortunately a Britiſh ſeaman on board, whoſe heart had not been debauched by a Weſt India climate, interpoſed and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. But had the cruel man ſtruck me I certainly ſhould have defended myſelf at the hazard of my life; for what is life to a man thus oppreſſed? He went away, however ſwearing and threatened that whenever he caught me
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:023353_0162_0FBF47769208D240"/>
on ſhore he would ſhoot me; and pay for me afterwards.</p>
                     <p>THE ſmall account in which the life of a negro is held in the Weſt Indies, is ſo univerſally known, that it might ſeem impertinent to quote the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extract, if ſome people had not been hardy enough of late to aſſert that negroes are on the ſame footing in that reſpect as Europeans. By the 329th Act, page 125, of the Aſſembly of Barbadoes, it is enacted <q>That if any negro, or other ſlave, under puniſhment by his maſter, or his order, for running away, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crime or miſdemeanor towards his ſaid maſter, unfortunately ſhall ſuffer in life or member, no perſon whatſoever ſhall be liable to a fine; but if any man ſhall out of <hi>wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or only of bloody-mindedneſs, or cruel intention, wilfully kill a negro, or other ſlave, of his own, he ſhall pay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the public treaſury fifteen pounds ſterling,</hi>
                        </q> And it is the ſame in moſt, if not all, of the Weſt India iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands. Is not this one of the many acts of the iſlands which call loudly for redreſs? And do not the aſſembly which enacted it deſerve the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ſavages and brutes rather
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:023353_0163_0FBF4779C1B8A0C8"/>
than of chriſtians and men? It is an act at once unmerciful, unjuſt, and unwiſe; which for cruelty would diſgrace an aſſembly of thoſe who are called barbarians; and for its injuſtice and <hi>inſanity</hi> would ſhock the morality and common ſenſe of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maide of Hottentot.</p>
                     <p>SHOCKING as this and many more acts of the bloody Weſt India code at firſt view appear, how is the iniquity of it heightened when we conſider to whom it may be extended! Mr. James Tobin, a zealous labourer in the vineyard of ſlavery, gives an account of a French planter of his acquaintance, in the iſland of Martinico, who ſhewed him many mulattoes working in the fields like beaſts of burden; and he told Mr. Tobin theſe were all the produce of his own loins! And I myſelf have known ſimilar inſtances. Pray, reader, are theſe ſons and daughters of the French planter leſs his children by being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten on black women? And what muſt be the virtue of thoſe legiſlators, and the feelings of thoſe fathers, who eſtimate the lives of their ſons, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever begotten, at no more than fifteen pounds; though they ſhould be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as the act ſays, <hi>out of wantonneſs
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:023353_0164_0FBF477B394C3A68"/>
and bloody-mindedneſs!</hi> But is not the ſlave trade entirely a war with the heart of man? And ſurely that which is be-begun by breaking down the barriers of virtue involves in its continuance deſtruction to every principle, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries all ſentiments in ruin!</p>
                     <p>I have often ſeen ſlaves, particularly thoſe who were meagre, in different iſlands, put into ſcales and weighed; and then ſold from three pence to ſix pence or nine pence a pound. My maſter, however, whoſe humanity was ſhocked at this mode, uſed to ſell ſuch by the lump. And at or after a ſale it was not uncommon to ſee negroes taken from their wives, wives taken from their huſbands, and children from their parents, and ſent off to other iſlands, and wherever elſe their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs lords chooſe; and probably never more during life ſee each other! Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times my heart has bled at theſe part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; when the friends of the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have been at the water ſide, and with ſighs and tears, have kept their eyes fixed on the veſſel, till it went out of ſight.</p>
                     <p>A poor Creole negro I knew well who, after having been often thus tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from iſland to iſland, at laſt reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:023353_0165_0FBF477DA134CF08"/>
in Montſerrat. This man uſed to tell me many melancholy tales of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Generally, after he had done working for his maſter, he uſed to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his few leiſure moments to go a fiſhing. When he had caught any fiſh, his maſter would frequently take them from him without paying him; and at other times ſome other white people would ſerve him in the ſame manner. One day he ſaid to me, very movingly, <q>Sometimes when a white man take away my fiſh I go to my maſer, and he get me my right; and when my maſer by ſtrength take away my fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, what me muſt do? I can't go to any body to be righted; then,</q> ſaid the poor man, looking up above, <q>I muſt look up to God Mighty in the top for right.</q> This artleſs tale moved me much, and I could not help feeling the juſt cauſe Moſes had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing his brother againſt the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian. I exhorted the man to look up ſtill to the God on the top, ſince there was no redreſs below. Though I little thought then that I myſelf ſhould more than once experience ſuch impoſition, and need the ſame exhortation hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in my own tranſactions in the iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands; and that even this poor man and
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:023353_0166_0FBF4783F5B8EE00"/>
I ſhould ſome time after ſuffer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame manner, as ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated hereafter.</p>
                     <p>NOR was ſuch uſage as this confined to particular places or individuals; for, in all the different iſlands in which I have been (and I have viſited no leſs than fifteen) the treatment of the ſlaves was nearly the ſame; ſo nearly indeed, that the hiſtory of an iſland, or even a plantation, with a few ſuch exceptions as I have mentioned, might ſerve for a hiſtory of the whole. Such a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency has the ſlave-trade to debauch men's minds, and harden them to every feeling of humanity! For I will not ſuppoſe that the dealers in ſlaves are born worſe than other men—No; it is the fatality of this miſtaken avarice, that it corrupts the milk of human kindneſs and turns it into gall. And, had the purſuits of thoſe men been different, they might have been as generous, as tender-hearted and juſt, as they are unfeeling, rapacious and cruel. Surely this traffic cannot be good, which ſpreads like a peſtilence, and taints what it touches! which violates that firſt natural right of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, equality and independency, and gives one man a dominion over his
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:023353_0167_0FBF47864E972350"/>
fellows which God could never intend! For it raiſes the owner to a ſtate as far above man as it depreſſes the ſlave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; and, with all the preſumption of human pride, ſets a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, immeaſurable in extent, and endleſs in duration! Yet how miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken is the avarice even of the planters. Are ſlaves more uſeful by being thus humbled to the conditions of brutes, than they would be if ſuffered to enjoy the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of men? The freedom which diffuſes health and proſperity through out Britan anſwers you—No. When you make men ſlaves you deprive them of half their virtue, you ſet them in your own conduct an example of fraud, rapine, and cruelty, and compel them to live with you in a ſtate of war; and yet you complain that they are not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt or faithful! You ſtupify them with ſtripes, and think it neceſſary to keep them in a ſtate of ignorance; and yet you aſſert that they are incapable of learning; that their minds are ſuch a barren ſoil or moor, that culture would be l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="161" facs="unknown:023353_0168_0FBF478741D45688"/>
incapable of enjoying the treaſures ſhe has poured out for him! An aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion at once impious and abſurd. Why do you uſe thoſe inſtruments of torture? Are they fit to be applied by one rational being to another? And are ye not ſtruck with ſhame and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, to ſee the partakers of your nature reduced ſo low?

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the preceeding chapter I have ſet before the reader a few of thoſe many inſtances of oppreſſion, extortion, and cruelty, which I have been a witneſs to in the Weſt indies: but, were I to enumerate them all, the catalogue would be tedious and diſguſting. The puniſhments of the ſlaves on every tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling occaſion are ſo frequent, and ſo well known together with the different inſtruments with which they are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, that it cannot any longer afford
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:023353_0170_0FBF478AF5CB4D20"/>
novelty to recite them; and they are too ſhocking to yield delight either to the writer or the reader. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hereafter only mention ſuch as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally befell myſelf in the courſe of my adventures,</p>
                     <p>IN the variety of departments in which I was employed by my maſter, I had an opportunity of ſeeing many cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſcenes in different iſlands; but, above all, I was ſtruck with a celebrated curioſity called Brimſtone-Hill, which is a high and ſteep mountain, ſome few miles from the town of Plymouth in Montſerat. I had often heard of ſome wonders that were to be ſeen on this hill, and I went once with ſome white and black people to viſit it. When we arrived at the top, I ſaw under different cliffs great flakes of brimſtone, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the ſtreams of various little ponds, which were then boiling natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the earth. Some of theſe ponds were as white as milk, ſome quite blue, and many other's of different co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. I had taken ſome potatoes with me, and I put them into different ponds, and in a few minutes they were well boiled. I taſted ſome of them, but they were very ſulphurous; and the ſilver ſhoe buckles, and all the other things
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:023353_0171_0FBF478ECE35C970"/>
of that metal we had among us, were, in a little time turned as black as lead.</p>
                     <p>SOME time in the year 1763, kind Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſeemed to appear rather more favourable to me. One of my maſter's veſſels, a Bermudas ſloop, about ſixty tons burthen was commanded by one Captain Thomas Farmer, an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lert and active man, who gained my maſter a great deal of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by his good management in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſengers from one iſland to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but very often his ſailors uſed to get drunk and run away from the veſſel, which hindered him in his buſineſs very much. This man had taken a liking to me; and many different times begged of my maſter to let me go a trip with him as a ſailor; but he would tell him he could not ſpare me, though the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ſometimes could not go for want of hands, for ſailors were generally very ſcarce in the iſland. However, at laſt, from neceſſity or force, my maſter was prevailed on, though very reluctantly, to let me go with this captain; but he gave him great charge to take care that I did not run away, for if I did he would make him pay for me. This being the caſe, the captain had for ſome time a ſharp eye upon me when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:023353_0172_0FBF479102CFDD28"/>
the veſſel anchored; and as ſoon as ſhe returned I was ſent for on ſhore again. Thus was I ſlaving as it were for life, ſometimes at one thing, and ſometimes at another: ſo that the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and I were nearly the moſt uſeful men in my maſter's employment. I alſo became ſo uſeful to the captain on ſhip-board, that many times, when he uſed to aſk for me to go with him, though it ſhould be but for twenty-four hours, to ſome of the iſlands near us, my maſter would anſwer he could not ſpare me, at which the captain would ſwear, and would not go the trip: and tell my maſter I was better to him on board than any three white men he had; for they uſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o behave ill in many reſpects, particularly in getting drunk; and then they frequently got the boat ſtove, ſo as to hinder the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel from coming back as ſoon as ſhe might have done. This my maſter knew very well; and at laſt, by the captain's conſtant entreaties, after I had been ſeveral times with him, one day to my great joy, told me the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain would not let him reſt, and aſked whether I would go aboard as a ſailor, or ſtay on ſhore and mind the ſtores, for he could not bear any longer to be
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:023353_0173_0FBF47928CFA4BD0"/>
plagued in this manner. I was very happy at this propoſal, for I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately thought I might in time ſtand ſome chance by being on board to get a little money, or poſſibly make my eſcape if I ſhould be uſed ill: I alſo expected to get better food, and in greater abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; for I had oftentimes felt much hunger, though my maſter treated his ſlaves, as I have obſerved, uncommon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well. I therefore, without heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, anſwered him, that I would go and be a ſailor if he pleaſed. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly I was ordered on board directly. Nevertheleſs, between the veſſel and the ſhore, when ſhe was in port, I had little or no reſt, as my maſter always wiſhed to have me along with him. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he was a very pleaſant gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and but for my expectations on ſhipboard I ſhould not have thought of leaving him. But the captain liked me alſo very much, aud I was entirely his right-hand man. I did all I could to deſerve his favour, and in return I received better treatment from him than any other I believe ever met with in the Weſt Indies in my ſituation.</p>
                     <p>AFTER I had been ſailing for ſome time with this captain, at length I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to try my luck and commence
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:023353_0174_0FBF479A67C84BB0"/>
merchant. I had but a very ſmall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital to begin with; for one ſingle half bit, which is equal to three-pence in England, made up my whole ſtock. However I truſted to the Lord to be with me; and at one of our trips to <hi>St. Euſtatia,</hi> a Dutch iſland I bought a glaſs tumbler with my half bit, and when I came to Montſerrat I ſold it for a bit, or ſix-pence. Luckily we made ſeveral ſucceſſive trips to St. Euſtatia (which was a general mart for the Weſt-Indies, about twenty leagues from Montſerrat) and in our next, finding my tumbler ſo profitable, with this one bit I bought two tumblers more; and when I came back I ſold them for two bits equal to a ſhilling ſterling. When we went again I bought with theſe two bits four more of theſe glaſſes, which I ſold for four bits on our return to Montſerrat: and in our next voyage to St. Euſtatia, I bought two glaſſes with one bit, and with the other three I bought a jug of Geneva, nearly about three pints in meaſure. When we came to Montſerrat, I ſold the gin for eight bits, and the tumblers for two, ſo that my capital now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted in all to a dollar, well huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded and acquired in the ſpace of a
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:023353_0175_0FBF479C40036718"/>
month or ſix weeks, when I bleſſed the Lord that I was ſo rich. As we ſailed to different iſlands, I laid this money out in various things occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and it uſed to turn to very good account, eſpecially when we went to Guadalope, Grenada, and the reſt of the French iſlands. Thus was I going all about the iſlands upwards of four years, and ever trading as I went, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which I experienced many inſtances of ill uſage, and have ſeen many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries done to other negroes in our dealings with whites: and, amidſt our recreations, when we have been dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and merry-making, they, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe have moleſted and inſulted us. Indeed I was more than once o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to look up to God on high, as I had adviſed the poor fiſherman ſome time before. And I had not been long trading for myſelf in the manner I have related above, when I experienced the like trial in company with him as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: This ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="169" facs="unknown:023353_0176_0FBF479DDBD2F878"/>
oranges in a bag; I had alſo my whole ſtock, which was about twelve-bits' worth of the ſame kind of goods, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate in two bags; for we had heard theſe fruits ſold well in that iſland. When we came there, in ſome little convenient time he and I went aſhore with our fruits to ſell them; but we had ſcarcely landed when we were met by two white men, who preſently took our three bags from us. We could not at firſt gueſs what they meant to do; and for ſome time we thought they were jeſting with us; but they too ſoon let us know otherwiſe; for they took our ventures immediately to a houſe hard by, and adjoining the fort, while we followed all the way begging of them to give us our fruits, but in vain. They not only refuſed to return them but ſwore at us, and threatened if we did not immediately depart they would flog us well We told them theſe three bags were all we were worth in the world, and that we brought them with us to ſell when we came from Montſerrat, and ſhewed them the veſſel. But this was rather againſt us, as they now ſaw we were ſtrangers, as well as ſlaves. They ſtill therefore ſwore, and deſired us to be gone, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

took ſticks to beat us; while we, ſeeing they meant what they ſaid, went off in the greateſt confuſion and deſpair. Thus, in the very minute of gaining more by three times than I ever did by any venture in my life before, was I deprived of every farthing I was worth. An unſupportable misfortune! but how to help ourſelves we knew not. In our conſternation we went to the commanding officer of the fort, and told him how we had been ſerved by ſome of his people; but we obtained not the leaſt redreſs: he anſwered our complaints only by a volley of impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations againſt us, and immediately took a horſe-whip, in order to chaſtiſe us ſo that we were obliged to turn out much faſter than we came in. I now, in the agony of diſtreſs and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, wiſhed that the ire of God in his forked lightning might transfix theſe cruel oppreſſors among the dead. Still however we perſevered; went back again to the houſe, and begged and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought them again and again for our fruits, till at laſt ſome other people that were in the houſe aſked if we would be contented if they kept one bag and gave us the other two. We, ſeeing no remedy whatever, conſented to this;
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:023353_0178_0FBF47A63AB52CC0"/>
and they, obſerving one bag to have both kinds of fruit in it, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to my companion, kept that; and the other two, which were mine they gave us back. As ſoon as I got them, I ran as faſt as I could, and got the firſt negro man I could to help me off; my companion, however, ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little longer to plead; he told them the bag they had was his, and likewiſe all that he was worth in the world; but this was of no avail, and he was obliged to return without it. The poor old man wringing his hands, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bitterly for his loſs; and, indeed, he then did look up to God on high, which ſo moved me with pity for him, that I gave him nearly one third of my fruits. We then proceeded to the markets to ſell them; and Providence was more favourable to us than we could have expected, for we ſold our fruits uncommonly well; I got for mine about thirty-ſeven bits. Such a ſurpriſing reverſe of fortune in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time ſeemed like a dream, and proved no ſmall encouragement for me to truſt the Lord in any ſituation. My captain afterwards frequently uſed to take my part, and get me my right, when I have been plundered or uſed
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:023353_0179_0FBF47A854125610"/>
ill by theſe tender Chriſtian depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; among whom I have ſhuddered to obſerve the unceaſing blaſphemous execrations which are wantonly thrown out by perſons of all ages and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not only without occaſion, but even as if they were indulgencies and pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>AT one of our trips to St. Kitt's, I had eleven bits of my own; and my friendly captain lent me five more, with which I bought a Bible. I was very glad to get this book, which I ſcarcely could meet with any where. I think there was none ſold in Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerrat; aud, much to my grief, from being forced out of the Etna in the manner I have related, my Bible, and the Guide to the Indians, the two books I loved above all others, were left behind.</p>

                        </gap>LE I was in this place, St. Kitt's, a very curious impoſition on human nature took place:—A white man wanted to marry in the church a free black woman that had land and ſlaves in Montſerrat: but the clergyman told him it was againſt the law of the place to marry a white and a black in the church. The man then aſked to be married on the water, to which the
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:023353_0180_0FBF47A9B82784D0"/>
parſon conſented, and the two lovers went in one boat, and the parſon and clerk in another, and thus the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was performed. After this the loving pair came on board our veſſel, and my captain treated them extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well, and brought them ſafe to Montſerrat.</p>
                     <p>The reader cannot but judge of the irkſomeneſs of this ſituation to a mind like mine, in being daily expoſed to new hardſhips and impoſitions, after having ſeen many better days, and been as it were, in a ſtate of freedom and plenty; added to which, every part of the world I had hitherto been in, ſeemed to me a paradiſe in campariſon of the Weſt-Indies. My mind was therefore hourly replete with inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and thoughts of being freed, and, if poſſible, by honeſt and honourable means; for I always remembered the old adage; and I truſt it has ever been my ruling principle, that <q>Honeſty is the beſt policy;</q> and likewiſe that other golden precept—<q>To do unto all men as I would they ſhould do unto me.</q> However, as I was from early years a predeſtinarian, I thought whatever fate had determined muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ver come to paſs; and therefore,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:023353_0181_0FBF47B04D464CD8"/>
if ever it were my lot to be freed nothing could prevent me, although I ſhould at preſent ſee no means or hope to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my freedom; on the other hand if it were my fate not to be freed I never ſhould be ſo, and all my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for that purpoſe would be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. In the midſt of theſe thoughts I therefore looked up with prayers anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to God for my liberty; and at the ſame time uſed every honeſt means, and did all that was poſſible on my part to obtain it. In proceſs of time I became maſter of a few pounds, and in a fair way of making more, which my friendly captain knew very well; this occaſioned him ſometimes to take liberties with me; but whenever he treated me waſpiſhly I uſed plainly to tell him my mind, and that I would die before I would be impoſed upon as other negroes were, and that to me life had loſt its reliſh when liberty was gone. This I ſaid although I foreſaw my then well-being or future hopes of freedom (humanly ſpeaking) depended on this man. However, as, he could not bear the thoughts of my not ſailing with him, he always became mild on my threats. I therefore continued with him; and, from my great attention to
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:023353_0182_0FBF47B188C5F4D8"/>
his orders and his buſineſs, I gained him credit, and through his kindneſs to me I at laſt procured my liberty. While I thus went on, filled with the thoughts of freedom, and reſiſting oppreſſion as well as I was able my life hung daily in ſuſpence, particularly in the ſurfs I have formerly mentioned, as I could not ſwim. Theſe are extremely violent throughout the Weſt Indies, and I was ever expoſed to their howling rage and devouring fury in all the Iſlands. I have ſeen them ſtrike and toſs a boat right up an end, and maim ſeveral on board. Once in the Grenada iſlands, when I and about eight others were pulling a large boat with two punche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of water in it, a ſurf ſtruck us, and drove the boat and all in it about half a ſtone's throw, among ſome trees, and above the high water mark. We were obliged to get all the aſſiſtance we could from the neareſt eſtate to mend the boat, and launch it into the water again. At Montſerrat one night in preſſing hard to get off the ſhore on board, the punt was overſet with us four times; the firſt time I was very near being drowned; however the jacket I had on kept me up above water a little ſpace of time, while I called on a man near me who
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:023353_0183_0FBF47B2C96A7238"/>
was a good ſwimmer, and told him I could not ſwim; he then made haſte to me, and, juſt as I was ſinking, he caught hold of me, and brought me to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ounding, and then he went and brought the punt alſo. As ſoon as we had turned the water out of her leſt we ſhould be uſed ill for being abſent, we attempted again three times more, and as often the horrid ſurfs ſerved us as at firſt; but at laſt, the fifth time we attempted, we gained our point, at the eminent hazard of our lives. One day alſo, at Old Road in Montſerrat, our captain, and three men beſides myſelf, were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a large canoe in queſt of rum and ſugar, when a ſingle ſurf toſſed the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe an amazing diſtance from the water, and ſome of us, near a ſtone's throw from each other: moſt of us were very much bruiſed; ſo that I and many more often ſaid, and really thought, that there was not ſuch another place under the heavens as this. I longed therefore much to leave it, and daily wiſhed to ſee my maſter's promiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of going to Philadelphia.</p>
                     <p>WHILE we lay in this place a very cruel thing happened on board our ſloop which filled me with horror; though I found afterwards ſuch prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:023353_0184_0FBF47B4391C8B60"/>
were frequent. There was a very clever and decent free young mulatto-to-man who ſailed a long time with us: he had a free woman for his wife, by whom he had a child; and ſhe was then living on ſhore, and all very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Our captain and mate, and other people on board, and ſeveral elſewhere, even the natives of Bermudas, all knew this young man from a child that he was always free, and no one had ever claimed him as their property: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as might too often overcomes right in theſe parts, it happened that a Bermudas captain, whoſe veſſel lay there for a few days in the road, came on board of us, and ſeeing the mulatto-man, whoſe name was Joſeph Clipſon, he told him he was not free, and that he had orders from his maſter to bring him to Bermudas. The poor man could not believe the captain to be in earneſt; but he was very ſoon unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, his men laying violent hands on him; and although he ſhewed a certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate of his being born free in St. Kitt's, and moſt people on board knew that he ſerved his time to boat-build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and always paſſed for a free man, yet he was forcibly taken out of our veſſel. He then aſked to be carried
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:023353_0185_0FBF47BC5CD48DE0"/>
aſhore before the ſecretary or magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates, and theſe infernal invaders of human rights promiſed him he ſhould: but, inſtead of that, they carried him on board of the other veſſel: and the next day, without giving the poor man any hearing on ſhore, or ſuffering him even to ſee his wife or child, he was carried away, and probably doomed never more in this world to ſee them again. Nor was this the only inſtance of this kind of barbarity I was a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to. I have ſince often ſeen in Jamaica and other iſlands, free men, whom I have known in America, thus villainouſly trepanned and held in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. I have heard of two ſimilar prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices even in Philadelphia: and were it not for the benevolence of the quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in that city, many of the ſable race, who now breathe the air of liberty, would, I believe, be groaning indeed under ſome planter's chains. Theſe things opened my mind to a new ſcene of horror to which I had been before a ſtranger. Hitherto I had thought only ſlavery dreadful; but the ſtate of a free negro appeared to me now equally ſo at leaſt, and in ſome reſpects even worſe, for they live in conſtant alarm for their liberty; which is but nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:023353_0186_0FBF47BDC0FFDC00"/>
for they are univerſally inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and plundered without the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of redreſs; for ſuch is the equity of the Weſt Indian laws, that no free negro's evidence will be admitted in their courts of juſtice. In this ſituation is it ſurpriſing that ſlaves, when mildly treated, ſhould prefer even the miſery of ſlavery to ſuch a mockery of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? I was now completely diſguſted with the Weſt Indies, and thought I never ſhould be entirely free until I had left them.</p>

                     <p>I determined to make every exertion to obtain my freedom, and to return to Old England. For this purpoſe I thought a knowledge of navigation might be of uſe to me; for, though I did not intend to run away unleſs I ſhould be ill uſed; yet, in ſuch a caſe, if I underſtood navigation, I might attempt my eſcape in our ſloop, which was one of the ſwifteſt ſailing veſſels in the Weſt Indies, and I could be at no loſs for hands to join me: and if I
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:023353_0187_0FBF47BEC0663BE0"/>
ſhould make this attempt, I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have gone for England; but this, as I ſaid, was only to be in the event of my meeting with any ill uſage. I therefore employed the mate of our veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to teach me navigation, for which I agreed to give him twenty-four dollars, and actually paid him part of the money down; though when the captain, ſome time after, came to know that the mate was to have ſuch a ſum for teaching me, he rebuked him, and ſaid it was a ſhame for him to take any money from me. However, my progreſs in this uſeful art was much retarded by the conſtancy of our work. Had I wiſhed to run away I did not want op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, which frequently preſented themſelves; and particularly at one time, ſoon after this. When we were at the iſland of Gaurdeloupe there was a large fleet of merchantmen bound for Old France; and, ſeamen then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſcarce, they gave from fifteen to twenty pounds a man for the run. Our mate, and all the white ſailors, left our veſſel on this account, and went on board of the French ſhips. They would have had me alſo to go with them, for they regarded me; and ſwore to protect me, if I would
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:023353_0188_0FBF47C037E9BC68"/>
go: and, as the fleet was to ſail the next day, I really believe I could have got ſafe to Europe at that time. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as my maſter was kind, I would not attempt to leave him; ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering the old maxim, that "ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty is the beſt policy," I ſuffered them to go without me. Indeed my captain was much afraid of my leaving him and the veſſel at that time, as I had ſo fair an opportunity: but, I thank God, this fidelity of mine turned out much to my advantage hereafter, when I did not in the leaſt think of it; and made me ſo much in favour with the captain, that he uſed now and then to teach me ſome parts of navigation himſelf; but ſome of our paſſengers, and others, ſeeing this, found much fault with him for it, ſaying it was a very dangerous thing to let a negro know navigation; thus I was hindred again in my purſuits. About the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the year 1764, my maſter bought a larger ſloop, called the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, about ſeventy or eighty tons, of which my captain had the command. I went with him into this veſſel, and we took a load of new ſlaves for Georgia and Charles Town. My maſter now left me entirely to the captain, though
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:023353_0189_0FBF47C7B5B11E00"/>
he ſtill wiſhed for me to be with him; but I, who always much wiſhed to loſe ſight of the Weſt Indies, was not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle rejoiced at the thoughts of ſeeing any other country. Therefore, rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the goodneſs of my captain, I got ready all the little venture I could; and, when the veſſel was ready, we ſailed to my great joy. When we got to our deſtined places Georgia and Charles Town, I expected I ſhould have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſelling my little property to advantage: but here, particularly in Charles Town, I met with buyers, white men, who impoſed on me as in other places. Notwithſtanding, I was reſolved to have fortitude; thinking no lot or trial too hard when kind Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is the rewarder.</p>
                     <p>WE ſoon got loaded again, and returned to Montſerrat; and there, amongſt the reſt of the iſlands, I ſold my goods well; and in this manner I continued trading during the year 1764—meeting with various ſcenes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, as uſual After this, my maſter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>itted out his veſſel for Philadelphia, in the year 1765; and during the time we were loading her, and getting ready for the voyage, I worked with redoubled alacrity, from the hope of
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:023353_0190_0FBF47C947F097C0"/>
getting money enough by theſe voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to buy my freedom, in time, if it ſhould pleaſe God; and alſo to ſee the town of Philadelphia, which I had heard a great deal about for ſome years paſt; beſides which, I had always longed to prove my maſter's promiſe the firſt day I came to him. In the midſt of theſe elevated ideas, and while I was about getting my little merchandize in readineſs, one Sunday my maſter ſent for me to his houſe. When I came there I found him and the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain together; and, on my going in, I was ſtruck with aſtoniſhment at his telling me he heard that I meant to run away from him when I got to Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia: <q>And therefore, ſaid he, 'I muſt ſell you again: you coſt me a great deal of money, no leſs than forty pounds ſterling: and it will not do to loſe ſo much. You are a valuable fellow, continued he; &amp;c I can get any day for you one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred guineas, from many gentlemen in this iſland.</q> And then he told me of Captain Doran's brother-in law a ſevere maſter, who ever wanted to buy me to make me his overſeer. My captain alſo ſaid he could get much more than a hundred guineas for me
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:023353_0191_0FBF47CAC4778630"/>
in Carolina. This I knew to be a fact; for the gentleman that wanted to buy me came off ſeveral times on board of us, and ſpoke to me to live with him, and ſaid he would uſe me well. When I aſked what work he would put me to, he ſaid, as I was a ſailor, he would make me a captain of one of his rice veſſels. But I refuſed: and fearing at the ſame time, by a ſudden turn I ſaw in the captain's temper, he might mean to ſell me, I told the gentleman I would not live with him on any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and that I certainly would run away with his veſſel: but he ſaid he did not fear that, as he would catch him again: and then he told me how cruelly he would ſerve me if I ſhould do ſo. My captain, however, gave him to underſtand that I knew ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of navigation; ſo he thought better of it; and, to my great joy, he went away. I now told my maſter I did not ſay I would run away in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia; neither did I mean it, as he did not uſe me ill, nor yet the captain: for if they did I certainly would have made ſome attempts before now; but as I thought that if it were God's will I ever ſhould be freed it would be ſo, and, on the contrary, if it was not his
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:023353_0192_0FBF47CE2817A430"/>
w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ll it would not happen; ſo I hoped if ever I were freed, whilſt I was uſed well, it ſhould be by honeſt means; but as I could not help myſelf, he muſt do as he pleaſed; I could only hope and truſt to the God of Heaven: and at that inſtant my mind was big with inventions and full of ſchemes to eſcape. I then appealed to the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether he ever ſaw any ſign of my making the leaſt attempt to run away; and aſked him if I did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways come on board according to the time for which he gave me liberty; and, more particularly, when all our men left us at Gaurdeloupe and went on board of the French fleet, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed me to go with them, whether I might not, and that he could not have got me again: To my no ſmall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and very great joy, the captain confirmed every ſyllable that I had ſaid; and even more: for he ſaid he had tried different times to ſee if I would make any attempt of this kind, both at St. Euſtatia and in America, and he never found that I made the ſmalleſt: but on the contrary, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways came on board according to his orders; and he did really believe, if I ever meant to run away, that, as I
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:023353_0193_0FBF47D0B98D6600"/>
could never have had a better oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, I would have done it the night the mate and all the people left our veſſel at Guardeloupe The captain then informed my maſter, who had been thus impoſed on by our mate, (though I did not know who was my enemy,) the reaſon the mate had for impoſing this lie upon him; which was, becauſe I had acquainted the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the proviſions the mate had given away or taken out of the veſſel. This ſpeech of the captain was like life to the dead to me, and inſtantly my ſoul glorified God; and ſtill more ſo on hearing my maſter immediately ſay that I was a ſenſible fellow, and he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did intend to uſe me as a common ſlave; and that but for the entreaties of the captain, and his character of me, he would not have let me go from the ſtores about as I had done: that alſo, in ſo doing, he thought by carrying one little thing or other to different places to ſell I might make money. That he alſo intended to encourage me in this, by crediting me with half a puncheon of rum and half a hogſhead of ſugar at a time; ſo that, from being careful, I might have money enough, in ſome time, to purchaſe my freedom;
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:023353_0194_0FBF47D4859E27F8"/>
and, when that was the caſe, I might depend upon it he would let me have it for forty pounds ſterling money, which was only the ſame price he gave for me. This ſound gladdened my poor heart beyond meaſure; though indeed it was no more than the very idea I had formed in my mind of my maſter long before, and I immediately made him this reply: <q>Sir, I always had that very thought of you, indeed I had, and that made me ſo diligent in ſerving you.</q> He then gave me a large piece of ſilver coin, ſuch as I never had ſeen or had before, and told me to get ready for the voyage, and he would credit me with a tierce of ſugar, and another of rum; he alſo ſaid that he had two amiable ſiſters in Philadelphia, from whom I might get ſome neceſſary things. Upon this my noble captain deſired me to go a board; and, knowing the African metal, he charged me not to ſay any thing of this matter to any body; and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that the lying mate ſhould not go with him any more. This was a change indeed; in the ſame hour to feel the moſt exquiſite pain, and in the turn of a moment the fulleſt joy. It cauſed in me ſuch ſenſations as I was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

able to expreſs in my looks; my heart was ſo overpowered with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that I could have kiſſed both of their feet. When I left the room I immediately went, or rather flew, to the veſſel, which being loaded, my maſter, as good as his word, truſted me with a tierce of rum, and another of ſugar, when we ſailed, and arrived ſafe at the elegant town of Philadelphia. I ſold my goods here pretty well; and in this charming place I found every thing plentiful and cheap.</p>
                     <p>WHILE I was in this place a very extraordinary occurrence befel me. I had been told one evening of a <hi>wiſe</hi> woman, a Mrs. Davis, who revealed ſecrets, foretold events, &amp;c. I put little faith in this ſtory at firſt, as I could not conceive that any mortal could foreſee the future diſpoſals of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, nor did I believe in any other revelation than that of the Holy Scriptures; however, I was greatly aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at ſeeing this woman in a dream that night, though a perſon I never before beheld in my life; this made ſuch an impreſſion on me, that I could not get the idea the next day out of my mind, and I then became as anxious to ſee her as I was before indifferent; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:023353_0196_0FBF47DAFA584F50"/>
in the evening, after we left off working, I enquired where ſhe lived, and being directed to her, to my inexpreſſible ſurpriſe, beheld the very woman in the very ſame dreſs ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me to wear in the viſion. She immediately told me I had dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of her the preceding night; related to me many things that had happened with a correctneſs that aſtoniſhed me; and finally told me I ſhould not be long a ſlave: this was the more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able news, as I believed it the more readily from her having ſo faithfully related the paſt incidents of my life. She ſaid I ſhould be twice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

After ſtaying here ſome time till our veſſel was loaded, and I had bought in my little traffic, we ſailed from this agreeable ſpot for Montſerrat, once more to encounter the raging ſurfs.</p>
                     <p>WE arrived ſafe at Montſerrat, where we diſcharged our cargo; and ſoon after that we took ſlaves on board for St. Euſtatia, and from thence to Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia. I had always exerted myſelf and did double work, in order to make
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:023353_0197_0FBF47DD922CAA08"/>
our voyages as ſhort as poſſible; and from thus overworking myſelf while we were at Georgia I caught a fever and ague. I was very ill for eleven days and near dying; eternity was now exceedingly impreſſed on my mind, and I feared very much that awful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. I prayed the Lord therefore to ſpare me; and I made a promiſe in my mind to God, that I would be good if ever I ſhould recover. At length from having an eminent doctor to attend me, I was reſtored again to health; and ſoon after we got the veſſel loaded, and ſet off for Montſerrat. During the paſſage, as I was perfectly reſtored, and had much buſineſs of the veſſel to mind, all my endeavours to keep up my integrity, and perform my promiſe to God, began to fail; and, in ſpite of all I could do, as we drew nearer and nearer to the iſlands, my reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more and more declined, as if the very air of that country or climate ſeemed fatal to piety. When we were ſafe arrived at Montſerrat, and I had got aſhore, I forgot my former reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.—Alas! how prone is the heart to leave that God it wiſhes to love! and how ſtrongly do the things of this world ſtrike the ſenſes and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:023353_0198_0FBF47DF04CE4150"/>
the ſoul!—After our veſſel was diſcharged, we ſoon got her ready, and took in, as uſual, ſome of the poor oppreſſed natives of Africa, and other negroes; we then ſet off again for Georgia and Charlſtown. We arrived at Georgia, and, having landed part of our cargo, proceeded to Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town with the remainder. While we were there I ſaw the town illuminated; the guns were fired, and bonfires and other demonſtrations of joy ſhewn, on account of the repeal of the ſtamp act. Here I diſpoſed of ſome goods on my own account; the white men buying them with ſmooth promiſes and fair words, giving me, however, but very indifferent payment. There was one gentleman particularly who bought a puncheon of rum of me, which gave me a great deal of trouble; and, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I uſed the intereſt of my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly captain, I could not obtain any thing for it; for, being a negro man, I could not oblige him to pay me. This vexed me much, not knowing how to act; and I loſt ſome time in ſeeking after this Chriſtian; and though, when the ſabbath came (which the negroes uſually make their holiday) I was much inclined to go to public worſhip, I
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:023353_0199_0FBF47E170E60160"/>
was obliged to hire ſome black men to help to pull a boat acroſs the water to go in queſt of this gentleman. When I found him, after much entreaty, both from myſelf and my worthy captain, he at laſt paid me in dollars; ſome of them, however, were copper, and of conſequence of no value; but he took advantage of my being a negro man, and obliged me to put up with thoſe or none, although I objected to them. Immediately after, as I was trying to paſs them in the market, amongſt other white men, I was abuſed for offering to paſs bad coin; and, though I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them the man I got them from, I was within one minute of being tied up and flogged without either judge or jury; however, by the help of a good pair of heels, I ran off, and ſo eſcaped the baſtinadoes I ſhould have received. I got on board as faſt as I could, but ſtill continued in fear of them until we ſailed, which I thanked God we did not long after; and I have never been amongſt them ſince.</p>
                     <p>WE ſoon came to Georgia, where we were to complete our lading; and here worſe fate than ever attended me: for one Sunday night, as I was with ſome negroes in their maſter's yard in the
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:023353_0200_0FBF47E6A7F6D5C0"/>
town of Savannah, it happened that their maſter, one Doctor Perkins, who was a very ſevere and cruel man, came in drunk; and not liking to ſee any ſtrange negroes in his yard, he and a ruffian of a white man, he had in his ſervice, beſet me in an inſtant, and both of them ſtruck me with the firſt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons they could get hold of. I cried out as long as I could for help and mercy; but, though I gave a good account of myſelf, and he knew my captain, who lodged hard by him, it was to no purpoſe. They beat and mangled me in a ſhameful manner, leaving me near dead. I loſt ſo much blood from the wounds I received, that I lay quite motionleſs, and was ſo benumbed that I could not feel any thing for many hours. Early in the morning they took me away to the jail. As I did not return to the ſhip all night, my captain, not knowing where I was, and being uneaſy that I did not then make my appearance, he made enquiry after me; and having found where I was, immediately came to me. As ſoon as the good man ſaw me ſo cut and mangled, he could not forbear weeping; he ſoon got me out of jail to his lodgings, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:023353_0201_0FBF47E7F427DE20"/>
ſent for the beſt doctors in the place, who at firſt declared it as their opinion that I could not recover. My captain on this went to all the lawyers in the town for their advice, but they told him they could do nothing for me as I was a negro. He then went to Doctor Perkin's the hero who had van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed me, and menanced him, ſwearing he would be revenged of him, and challenged him to fight.—But cowardice is ever the companion of cruelty—and the Doctor refuſed. However, by the ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of one Doctor Brady of that place, I began at laſt to amend: but, although I was ſo ſore and bad with the wounds I had all over me that I could not reſt in any poſture, yet I was in more pain on account of the captain's uneaſineſs about me than I otherwiſe ſhould have been. The worthy man nurſed and watched me all the hours of the night: and I was, through his attention and that of the doctor, able to get out of bed in about ſixteen or eighteen days. All this time I was very much wanted on board, as I uſed frequently to go up and down the river for rafts, and other parts of our cargo, and ſtow them, when the mate was ſick or abſent. In about four weeks I was able to go on duty; and in a fortnight after, having got in all our lading, our veſſel ſet ſail for Montſerrat; and in leſs than three weeks we arrived there ſafe tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards the end of the year. This ended my adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in 1764; for I did not leave Montſerrat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain till the beginning of the following year.</p>

                     <p>EVERY day now brought me nearer my freedom, and I was impatient till we proceeded again to ſea that I might have an opportunity of getting
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:023353_0206_0FBF47F4E3ACDBB8"/>
a ſum large enough to purchaſe it. I was not long ungratified; for, in the beginning of the year 1766, my maſter bought another ſloop, named the Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the largeſt I had ever ſeen. She was partly laden, and was to proceed to Philadelphia; our Captain had his choice of three, and I was well pleaſed he choſe this, which was the largeſt; for, from his having a large veſſel, I had more room, and could carry a larger quantity of goods with me. Accordingly, when we had delivered our old veſſel, the Prudence, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted the lading of the Nancy, having made near three hundred per cent, by four barrels of pork I brought from Charlſtown, I laid in as large a cargo as I could, truſting to God's providence to proſper my undertaking. With theſe views I ſailed for Philadelphia. On our paſſage, when we drew near the land, I was for the firſt time ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at the ſight of ſome whales, having never ſeen any ſuch large ſea monſters before; and as we ſailed by the land, one morning I ſaw a puppy whale cloſe by the veſſel; it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the length of a wherry boat, and it followed us all the day till we got within the Capes. We arrived ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="3" facs="unknown:023353_0207_0FBF47F8E8E252E8"/>
and in good time at Philadelphia, and I ſold my goods there chiefly to the Quakers. They always appeared to be a very honeſt diſcreet ſort of people, and never attempted to impoſe on me; I therefore liked them, and ever after choſe to deal with them in preference to any others.</p>
                     <p>ONE Sunday morning while I was here, as I was going to church, I chanced to paſs a meeting-houſe. The doors being open, and the houſe full of people, it excited my curioſity to go in. When I entered the houſe, to my great ſurpriſe, I ſaw a very tall woman ſtanding in the midſt of them, ſpeaking in an audible voice ſomething which I could not underſtand. Having never ſeen any thing of this kind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſtood and ſtared about me for ſome time, wondering at this odd ſcene. As ſoon as it was over, I took an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to make inquiry about the place and people, when I was informed they were called Quakers. I particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly aſked what that woman I ſaw in the midſt of them had ſaid, but none of them were pleaſed to ſatisfy me; ſo I quitted them, and ſoon after, as I was returning, I came to a church crowded with people; the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:023353_0208_0FBF47FC7A296F50"/>
was full likewiſe, and a number of people were even mounted on lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders looking in at the windows. I thought this a ſtrange ſight, as I had never ſeen churches, either in England or the Weſt-Indies, crowded in this manner before. I therefore made bold to aſk ſome people the meaning of all this, and they told me the Rev. Mr. George Whitfield was preaching. I had often heard of this gentleman, and had wiſhed to ſee and hear him; but I had never before had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. I now therefore reſolved to gratify myſelf with the ſight, and preſſed in amidſt the multitude. When I got into the church I ſaw this pious man exhorting the people with the greateſt fervour and earneſtneſs, and ſweating as much as I ever did while in ſlavery on Montſerrat beach. I was very much ſtruck and impreſſed with this; I thought it ſtrange I had never ſeen divines exert themſelves in this manner before, and was no longer at a loſs to account for the thin congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they preached to.</p>
                     <p>WHEN we had diſcharged our cargo here and were loaded again, we left this fruitful land once more, and ſet ſail for Montſerrat. My traffic had
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:023353_0209_0FBF47FDD5633C28"/>
hitherto ſucceeded ſo well with me, that I thought, by ſelling my goods when we arrived at Montſerrat, I ſhould have enough to purchaſe my freedom. But as ſoon as our veſſel arrived there, my maſter came on board, and gave orders for us to go to St. Euſtatia, and diſcharge our cargo there, and from thence proceed for Georgia. I was much diſappointed at this; but thinking, as uſual, it was of no uſe to encounter with the decrees of fate, I ſubmitted without repining, and we went to St. Euſtatia. After we had diſcharged our cargo there we took in a live cargo, (as we call a cargo of ſlaves.) Here I ſold my goods tolerably well; but, not being able to lay out all my money in this ſmall iſland to as much advantage as in many other places, I laid out only part, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, I brought away with me near. We ſailed from hence for Georgia, and I was glad when we got there, though I had not much reaſon to like the place from my laſt adventure in Savannah; but I longed to get back to Montſerrat and procure my freedom, which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be able to purchaſe when I returned. As ſoon as we arrived here I waited on my careful doctor, Mr. Brady,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023353_0210_0FBF47FF5B661960"/>
to whom I made the moſt grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgments in my power for his former kindneſs and attention during my illneſs.</p>
                     <p>WHILE we were here, an odd cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance happened to the Captain and me, which diſappointed us both a good deal. A ſilverſmith, whom we had brought to this place ſome voyage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, agreed with the Captain to return with us to the Weſt Indies, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed at the ſame time to give the Captain a great deal of money, having pretended to take a liking to him, and being, as we thought, very rich. But while we ſtayed to load our veſſel this man was taken ill in a houſe where he worked, and in a week's time became very bad. The worſe he grew the more he uſed to ſpeak of giving the Captain what he had promiſed him, ſo that he expected ſomething conſiderable from the death of this man, who had no wife or child, and he attended him day and night. I uſed alſo to go with the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, at his own deſire, to attend him; eſpecially when we ſaw there was no appearance of his recovery: and, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to recompenſe me for my trouble, the Captain promiſed me ten pounds, when he ſhould get the man's property.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023353_0211_0FBF4800C2D26D68"/>
I thought this would be of great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to me, although I had nearly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney enough to purchaſe my freedom, if I ſhould get ſafe this voyage to Montſerrat. In this expectation I laid out above eight pounds of my money for a ſuit of ſuperfine clothes to dance in at my freedom, which I hoped was then at hand. We ſtill continued to attend this man, and were with him even on the laſt day he lived, till very late at night, when we went on board. After we were got to bed, about one or two o'clock in the morning, the Captain was ſent for, and informed the man was dead. On this he came to my bed, and, waking me, informed me of it, and deſired me to get up and procure a light, and immediately go with him. I told him I was very ſleepy, and wiſhed he would take ſomebody elſe with him; or elſe, as the man was dead, and could want no further at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, to let all things remain as they were till the next morning. <q>No, no, ſaid he, we will have the money to-night, I cannot wait till to morrow; ſo let us go.</q> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly I got up and ſtruck a light, and away we both went and ſaw the man as dead as we could wiſh. The Captain
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023353_0212_0FBF4807A5B48EB0"/>
ſaid he would give him a grand burial, in gratitude for the promiſed treaſure; and deſired that all the things belonging to the deceaſed might be brought forth. Among others, there was a neſt of trunks of which he had kept the keys whilſt the man was ill, and when they were produced we opened them with no ſmall eagerneſs and expectation; and as there were a great number with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one another, with much impatience we took them one out of the other. At laſt, when we came to the ſmalleſt, and had opened it, we ſaw it was full of papers, which we ſuppoſed to be notes; at the ſight of which our hearts leapt for joy; and that inſtant the Captain, clapping his hands, cried out, <q>Thank God, here it is.</q> But when we took up the trunk, and began to examine the ſuppoſed treaſure and long-looked for bounty, (alas! alas! how uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and deceitful are all human af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs!) what had we found? while we thought we were embracing a ſubſtance we graſped an empty nothing. The whole amount that was in the neſt of trunks, was only one dollar and a half; and all that the man poſſeſſed would not pay for his coffin. Our ſudden and exquiſite joy was now ſucceeded by as
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023353_0213_0FBF4809C5B019B8"/>
ſudden and exquiſite pain; and my Captain and I exhibited, for ſome time moſt ridiculous figures—pictures of chagrin and diſappointment! We went away greatly mortified, and left the deceaſed to do as well as he could for himſelf, as we had taken ſo good care of him when alive for nothing. We ſet ſail once more for Montſerrat, and arrived there ſafe; but much out of humour with our friend the ſilverſmith. When we had unladen the veſſel, and I had ſold my venture, finding myſelf maſter of about forty-ſeven pounds—I conſulted my true friend, the Captain, how I ſhould proceed in offering my maſter the money for my freedom. He told me to come on a certain morning, when he and my maſter would be at breakfaſt together. Accordingly, on that morning I went, and met the Captain there, as he had appointed. When I went in I made my obeiſance to my maſter, and with my money in my hand, and many fears in my heart, I prayed him to be as good as his offer to me, when he was pleaſed to promiſe me my freedom as ſoon as I could pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it. This ſpeech ſeemed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found him; he began to recoil; and my heart that inſtant ſunk within me.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023353_0214_0FBF480C5E6FA810"/>
                        <q>What, ſaid he, give you your freedom? Why, where did you get the money? Have you got forty pounds ſterling? Yes, ſir, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. How did you get it?</q> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he. I told him, very honeſtly. The Captain then ſaid he knew I got the money very honeſtly and with much induſtry, and that I was particularly careful. On which my maſter repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I got money much faſter than he did; and ſaid he would not have made me the promiſe he did if he had thought I ſhould have got money ſo ſoon. "Come, come," ſaid my worthy cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, clapping my maſter on the back, <q>Come, Robert, (which was his name) I think you muſt let him have his freedom;—you have laid your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney out very well; you have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved good intereſt for it all this time, and here is now the principal at laſt. I know Guſtavas has earned you more than an hundred a-year, and he will ſtill ſave you money, as he will not leave you:—Come, Robert, take the money.</q> My maſter then ſaid he would not be worſe than his promiſe; and, taking the money, told me to go to the Secretary at the Regiſter Office, and get my manumiſſion drawn up. Theſe
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023353_0215_0FBF480D81CFA368"/>
words of my maſter were like a voice from heaven to me: in an inſtant all my trepidation was turned into unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable bliſs; and I moſt reverently bowed myſelf with gratitude, unable to expreſs my feelings, but by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of my eyes, and a heart replete with thanks to God; while my true and worthy friend the Captain, congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated us both with a peculiar degree of heart-felt pleaſure. As ſoon as the firſt tranſports of my joy were over, and that I had expreſſed my thanks to theſe my worthy friends in the beſt manner I was able, I roſe with a heart full of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reverence, and left the room, in order to obey my maſter's joyful mandate of going to the Regiſter Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. As I was leaving the houſe I called to mind the words of the Pſalmiſt, in the 126th Pſalm, and like him, <q>I glorified God in my heart, in whom I truſted.</q> Theſe words had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on my mind from the very day I was forced from Deptford to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hour, and I now ſaw them, as I thought, fulfilled and verified. My imagination was all rapture as I flew to the Regiſter Office; and, in this reſpect, like the apoſtle Peter,<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xii. 9.</note> (whoſe deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

from priſon was ſo ſudden and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, that he thought he was in a viſion) I could ſcarcely believe I was awake. Heavens! who could do juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to my feelings at this moment! Not conquering heroes themſelves, in the midſt of a triumph—Not the tender mother who has juſt regained her long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſt infant, and preſſes it to her heart—Not the weary hungry mariner, at the ſight of the deſired friendly port—Not the lover, when he once more embraces his beloved miſtreſs, after ſhe has been raviſhed from his arms! All within my breaſt was tumult, wildneſs, and delirium! My feet ſcarcely touched the ground, for they were winged with joy, and, like Elijah, as he roſe to Heaven, they <q>were with lightning ſped as I went on.</q> Every one I met I told of my happineſs, and blazed about the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of my amiable maſter and captain.</p>
                     <p>WHEN I got to the office and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Regiſter with my errand, he congratulated me on the occaſion, and told me he would draw up my manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for half price, which was a guinea. I thanked him for his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and, having received it and paid him, I haſtened to my maſter to get him to ſign it, that I might be fully releaſed.

appearance as I thought. Some of the ſable females, who formerly ſtood aloof, now began to relax and appear leſs coy; but my heart was ſtill fixed on London, where I hoped to be ere long. So that my worthy captain and his owner my late maſter, finding that the bent of my mind was towards London, ſaid to me, <q>We hope you won't leave us, but that you will ſtill be with the veſſels.</q> Here gratitude bowed me down; and none but the generous mind can judge of my feelings, ſtruggling between in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and duty.

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023353_0220_0FBF481BC1C24D58"/>
what the Lord had done for me in ſo ſhort a time, inſtead of being, as he might perhaps ſuppoſe, under the cruel yoke of ſome planter. With theſe kind of reveries I uſed often to entertain my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſhorten the time till my return; and now, being as in my original free African ſtate, I embarked on board the Nancy, after having got all things ready for our voyage. In this ſtate of ſerenity we ſailed for St. Euſtatia; and having ſmooth ſeas and calm weather, we ſoon arrived there: after taking our cargo on board, we proceeded to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah in Georgia, in Auguſt, 1766. While we were there, as uſual, I uſed to go for the cargo up the rivers in boats; and on this buſineſs have been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently beſet by Alligators, which were very numerous on that coaſt; and ſhot many of them when they have been near getting into our boats; which we have with great difficulty ſometimes prevented, and have been very much frightened at them. I have ſeen a young one ſold in Georgia alive for ſix pence.</p>
                     <p>DURING our ſtay at this place, one evening a ſlave beloning to Mr. Read, a merchant of Savannah, came near our veſſel, and began to uſe me very ill. I
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023353_0221_0FBF481D34DCCE70"/>
entreated him, with all the patience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was maſter of, to deſiſt, as I knew there was little or no law for a free negro here; but the fellow, inſtead of taking my advice, perſevered in his inſults, and even ſtruck me. At this I loſt all temper, and fell on him and beat him ſoundly. The next morning his maſter came to our veſſel as we lay alongſide the wharf, and deſired me to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore that he might have me flogged all round the town, for beating his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro ſlave. I told him he had inſulted me, and had given the provocation, by firſt ſtriking me. I had told my cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain alſo the whole affair that morning, and wiſhed him to have gone along with me to Mr. Read, to prevent bad conſequences; but he ſaid that it did not ſignify, and if Mr. Read ſaid any thing he would make matters up, and deſired me to go to work, which I accordingly did The Captain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on board when Mr. Read came and applied to him to deliver me up, he ſaid he knew nothing of the matter, I was a free man. I was aſtoniſhed and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rightened at this, and thought I had better keep were I was than go aſhore and be flogged round the town, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out judge or jury. I therefore refuſed
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023353_0222_0FBF4824CF3D0BF8"/>
to ſtir; and Mr. Read went away, ſwearing he would bring all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables in the town, for he would have me out of the veſſel. When he was gone, I thought his threat might prove too true to my ſorrow; and I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in this belief, as well by the many inſtances I had ſeen of the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of free negroes, as from a fact that had happened within my own knowledge here a ſhort time before.</p>
                     <p>THERE was a free black man, a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, that I knew, who for aſking a gentleman that he worked for, for the money he had earned, was put into goal; and afterwards this oppreſſed man was ſent from Georgia, with falſe accuſations, of an intention to ſet the gentleman's houſe on fire, and run away with his ſlaves. I was therefore much embarraſſed, and very apprehenſive of a flogging at leaſt. I dreaded, of all things, the thoughts of being ſtriped, as I never in my life had the marks of any violence of that kind. At that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant a rage ſeized my ſoul, and for a little I determined to reſiſt the firſt man that ſhould offer to lay violent hands on me, or baſely uſe me without a trial; for I would ſooner die like a free man, than ſuffer myſelf to be ſcourged by the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023353_0223_0FBF482646D97E88"/>
hands of ruffians, and my blood drawn like a ſlave. The captain and others, more cautious, adviſed me to make haſte and conceal myſelf; for the ſaid Mr. Read was a very ſpiteful man, and he would ſoon come on board with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables and take me. At firſt I refuſed this counſel, being determined to ſtand my ground; but at length, by the prevailing entreaties of the Captain and Mr. Dixon, with whom he lodged, I went to Mr. Dixon's houſe, which was a little out of town, at a place called <hi>Yea-ma-chra.</hi> I was but juſt gone when Mr. Read, with the conſtables, came for me, and ſearched the veſſel; but, not finding me there, he ſwore he would have me dead or alive. I was ſecreted about five days; however, the good character which my captain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways gave me as well as ſome other gentlemen who alſo knew me, procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me ſome friends. At laſt ſome of them told my Captain that he did not uſe me well, in ſuffering me thus to be impoſed upon, and ſaid they would ſee me redreſſed, and get me on board ſome other veſſel. My Captain, on this, immediately went to Mr. Read, and told him, that ever ſince I eloped from the veſſel his work had been neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023353_0224_0FBF4827B709D800"/>
and he could not go on with her loading, himſelf and mate not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well; and, as I had managed things on board for them, my abſence muſt retard his voyage, and conſequently hurt the owner; he therefore begged of him to forgive me, as he ſaid he never heard any complaint of me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, during the ſeveral years I had been with him. After repeated entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Mr. Read ſaid I might go to hell, and that he would not meddle with me; on which my Captain came im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to me at his lodging, and telling me how pleaſantly matters had gone on, deſired me to go on board.</p>
                     <p>SOME of my other friends then aſked him if he had got the conſtable's war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from them; the Captain ſaid, No. On this I was deſired by them to ſtay in the houſe; and they ſaid they would get me on board of ſome other veſſel before the evening. When the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain heard this he became almoſt diſtracted. He went immediately for the warrant, and, after uſing every exertion in his power, he at laſt got it from my hunters; but I had all the expences to pay.</p>
                     <p>AFTER I had thanked all my friends for their kindneſs, I went on board a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023353_0225_0FBF482F69C35090"/>
to my work, of which I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways plenty. We were in haſte to complete our lading, and were to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry twenty head of cattle with us to the Weſt-Indies, where they are a very profitable article. In order to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me in working, and to make up for the time I had loſt, my Captain promiſed me the privilege of carrying two bullocks of my own with me; and this made me work with redoubled ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. As ſoon as I had got the veſſel loaded, in doing which I was obliged to perform the duty of the mate as well as my own work, and that the bullocks were near coming on board, I aſked the Captain leave to bring my two, according to his promiſe; but to my great ſurpriſe, he told me there was no room for them. I then aſked him to permit me to take one; but he ſaid he could not. I was a good deal mortified at this uſage, and told him I had no notion that he intended thus to impoſe on me; nor could I think well of any man that was ſo much worſe than his word. On this we had ſome diſagreement, and I gave him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that I intended to leave the veſſel. At this he appeared to be very much dejected; and our mate who
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023353_0226_0FBF48324F340B48"/>
had been very ſickly, and whoſe duty had long devolved upon me, adviſed him to perſuade me to ſtay: in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which he ſpoke very kindly to me, making many fair promiſes, telling me, that, as the mate was ſo ſickly, he could not do without me; and that, as the ſafety of the veſſel and cargo depended greatly upon me, he therefore hoped that I would not be offended at what had paſſed between us, and ſwore he would make up all matters when we arrived in the Weſt-Indies; ſo I conſented to ſlave on as before. Soon after this, as the bullocks were coming on board, one of them ran at the Captain, and butted him ſo furiouſly in the breaſt, that he never recovered of the blow. In order to make me ſome amends for his treatment about the bullocks, the Captain now preſſed me very much to take ſome turkeys, and other fowls with me, and gave me liberty to take as many as I could find room for: but I told him he knew very well I had never carried any turkeys before, as I always thought they were ſuch tender birds that they were not fit to croſs the ſeas. However, he continued to preſs me to buy them for once; and what
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023353_0227_0FBF4833C28C6B88"/>
ſeemed very ſurpriſing to me, the more I was agaiſt it, the more he urged my taking them, inſomuch that he enſured me from all loſſes that might happen by them, and I was prevailed on to take them; but I thought this very ſtrange, as he had never acted ſo with me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. This, and not being able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of my paper-money any other way, induced me at length to take four dozen. The turkeys, however, I was ſo diſſatisfied about that I determined to make no more voyages to this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor with this captain; and was very apprehenſive that my free voyage would be the worſt I had ever made.</p>
                     <p>WE ſet ſail for Montſerrat. The cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and mate had been both complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſickneſs when we ſailed, and as we proceeded on our voyage they grew worſe. This was about November, and we had not been long at ſea before we began to meet with ſtrong notherly gales and rough ſeas; and in about ſeven or eight days all the bullocks were near being drowned, and four or five of them died. Our veſſel, which had not been tight at firſt, was much leſs ſo now: and, though we were but nine in the whole, including five ſailors and myſelf, yet we were obliged to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023353_0228_0FBF4835389E1078"/>
to the pumps every half or three quarters of an hour. The captain and mate came on deck as often as they were able, which was now but ſeldom; for they declined ſo faſt, that they were not well enough to make obſervations above four or five times the whole voyage. The whole care of the veſſel reſted, therefore upon me, and I was obliged to direct her by mere dint of reaſon, not being able to work a traverſe. The captain was now very ſorry he had not taught me navigation, and proteſted, if ever he ſhould get well again, he would not fail to do ſo; but in about ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days his illneſs increaſed ſo much, that he was obliged to keep his bed, continuing ſenſible, however, till the laſt, conſtantly having the owner's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt at heart; for this juſt and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent man ever appeared much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about the welfare of what he was intruſted with. When this dear friend found the ſymtoms of death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, he called me by my name; and, when I came to him, he aſked (with almoſt his laſt breath) if he had ever done me any harm? <q>God forbid I ſhould think ſo, replied I, I ſhould then be the moſt ungrateful of wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to the beſt of benefactors.</q> While I
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023353_0229_0FBF483D42211310"/>
was thus expreſſing my affection and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row by his bedſide, he expired without ſaying another word; and the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing we committed his body to the deep. Every man on board loved him, and regretted his death; but I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly affected at it, and found that I did not know, till he was gone, the ſtrength of my regard for him. Indeed I had every reaſon in the world to be attached to him; for, beſides that he was in general mild, affable, generous, faithful, benevolent, and juſt, he was to me a friend and father; and had it pleaſed Providence, that he had died about five months before, I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I ſhould not have obtained my freedom when I did; and it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that I might not have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to get it at any rate afterwards.</p>
                     <p>THE captain being dead, the mate came on the deck, and made ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations as he was able, but to no purpoſe. In the courſe of a few days more, the few bullocks that remained were found dead; but the turkies I had, though on the deck, and expoſed to ſo much wet and bad weather, did well, and I afterwards gained near three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred per cent, on the ſale of them; ſo that in the event it proved a happy
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023353_0230_0FBF483E6115BA00"/>
circumſtance for me that I had not bought the bullocks I intended, for they muſt have periſhed with the reſt; and I could not help looking on this, otherwiſe trifling circumſtance, as a particular providence of God, and was thankful accordingly. The care of the veſſel took up all my time, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged my attention entirely. As we were now out of the variable winds, I thought I ſhould not be much puzzled to hit upon the iſlands. I was perſuaded I ſteered right for Antigua, which I wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reach, as the neareſt to us; and in the courſe of nine or ten days we made this iſland, to our great joy; and the day after we came ſafe to Montſerrat.</p>
                     <p>MANY were ſurpriſed when they heard of my conducting the ſloop into the port, and I now obtained a new ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelation, and was called Captain. This elated me not a little, and it was quite flattering to my vanity to be thus ſtyled by as high a title as any freeman in this place poſſeſſed. When the death of the captain became known, he was much regretted by all who knew him; for he was a man univerſally reſpected. At the ſame time the ſable Captain loſt no fame; for the ſucceſs I had met with increaſed the affection of my friends in no ſmall meaſure.</p>

                     <p>AS I had now, by the death of my captain, loſt my great benefactor
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:023353_0232_0FBF484152669A10"/>
and friend, I had little inducement to remain longer in the Weſt Indies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept my gratitude to Mr. King, which I thought I had pretty well diſcharged in bringing back his veſſel ſafe, and delivering his cargo to his ſatisfaction. I began to think of leaving this part of the world, of which I had been long tired, and returning to England, where my heart had always been; but Mr. King ſtill preſſed me very much to ſtay with his veſſel; and he had done ſo much for me that I found myſelf unable to refuſe his requeſts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to go another voyage to Georgia, as the mate, from his ill ſtate of health, was quite uſeleſs in the veſſel. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly a new captain was appointed, whoſe name was William Phillips, an old acquaintance of mine; and, having refitted our veſſel, and taken ſeveral ſlaves on board, we ſet ſail for St. Euſtatia, where we ſtayed but a few days: and on the 30th of January 1767, we ſteered for Georgia. Our new cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain boaſted ſtrangely of his ſkill in navigation and conducting a veſſel; and in conſequence of this he ſteered a new courſe, ſeveral points more to the weſtward than we ever did before; this appeared to me very extraordinary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="unknown:023353_0233_0FBF4844F68F7010"/>
ON the fourth of February, which was ſoon after we had got into our new courſe, I dreamt the ſhip was wrecked amidſt the ſurfs and rocks, and that I was the means of ſaving every one on board; and on the night following I dreamed the very ſame dream. Theſe dreams however made no impreſſion on my mind; and the next evening, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my watch below, I was pumping the veſſel a little after eight o'clock, juſt before I went off the deck, as is the cuſtom; and being weary with the duty of the day, and tired at the pump, (for we made a good deal of water) I began to expreſs my impatience, and uttered with an oath, <q>Damn the veſſel's bottom out.</q> But my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience inſtantly ſmote me for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. When I left the deck I went to bed, and had ſcarcely fallen aſleep when I dreamed the ſame dream again about the ſhip as I had dreamt the two preceeding nights. At twelve o'clock the watch was changed; and, as I had always the charge of the captain's watch, I then went upon deck. At half after one in the morning the man at the helm ſaw ſomething under the lee-beam that the ſea waſhed againſt, and he immediately called to me that
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023353_0234_0FBF4849CDC42B80"/>
there was a grampus, and deſired me to look at it. Accordingly I ſtood up and obſerved it for ſome time; but, when I ſaw the ſea waſh up againſt it again and again, I ſaid it was not a fiſh but a rock. Being ſoon certain of this, I went down to the Captain, and, with ſome confuſion, told him the danger we were in, and deſired him to come upon deck immediately. He ſaid it was very well, and I went up again. As ſoon as I was upon deck, the wind, which had been pretty high, having abated a little, the veſſel began to be carried ſide ways towards the rock, by means of the current. Still the captain did not appear. I therefore went to him again, and told him the veſſel was then near a large rock, and deſired he would come up with all ſpeed. He ſaid he would, and I returned to the deck. When I was upon the deck again I ſaw we were not above a piſtol ſhot from the rock, and I heard the noiſe of the breakers all around us. I was exceedingly alarmed at this; and the captain having not yet come on the deck I loſt all patience; and, growing quite enraged, I ran down to him again, and aſked him why he did not come up, and what he could mean by all this?
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:023353_0235_0FBF484CC00E7338"/>
                        <q>The breakers, ſaid I are round us, and the veſſel is almoſt on the rock.</q> With that he came on the deck with me, and we tried to put the veſſel about, and get her out of the current, but all to no purpoſe, the wind being very ſmall. We then called all hands up immediately; and after a little we got up one end of a cable, and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened it to the anchor. By this time the ſurf was foamed round us, and made a dreadful noiſe on the breakers, and the very moment we let the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor go the veſſel ſtruck againſt the rocks. One ſwell now ſucceeded an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as it were one wave calling on its fellow; the roaring of the billows increaſed, and, with one ſingle heave of the ſwells, the ſloop was pierced and transfixed among the rocks! in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a ſcene of horror preſented itſelf to my mind, ſuch as I never had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or experienced before. All my ſins ſtared me in the face; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, I thought that God had hurled his direful vengeance on my guilty head for curſing the veſſel on which my life depended. My ſpirits at this forſook me, and I expected every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to go to the bottom: I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined if I ſhould ſtill be ſaved that I
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023353_0236_0FBF484E07F54AE0"/>
would never ſwear again. And in the midſt of my diſtreſs, while the dreadful ſurfs were daſhing with unremitting fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry among the rocks, I remembered the Lord, though fearful that I was unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of forgivneſs, and I thought that as he had often delivered he might yet deliver; and, calling to mind the many mercies he had ſhewn me in times paſt, they gave me ſome ſmall hope that he might ſtill help me. I then began to think how we might be ſaved; and I believe no mind was ever like mine ſo replete with inventions and confuſed with ſchemes, though how to eſcape death I knew not. The captain immediately ordered the hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to be nailed down on the ſlaves in the hold, where there were about twenty, all of whom muſt unadvoidably have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed if he had been obeyed. When he deſired the man to nail down the hatches I thought that my ſin was the cauſe of this, and that God would charge me with theſe people's blood. This thought ruſhed upon my mind that inſtant with ſuch violence, that it quite overpowered me, and I fainted. I recovered juſt as the people were about to nail down the hatches; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving which, I deſired them to ſtop.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:023353_0237_0FBF484F80C622A8"/>
The captain then ſaid it muſt be done: I aſked him why? He ſaid that every one would endeavour to get into the boat, which was but ſmall, and thereby we ſhould be drowned; for it would not have carried above ten at the moſt. I could no longer reſtrain my emotion and I told him he deſerved drowning for not knowing how to navigate the veſſel; and I believe the people would have toſſed him overboard if I had given them the leaſt hint of it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the hatches were not nailed down; and, as none of us could leave the veſſel then on account of the darkneſs, and as we knew not where to go, and were convinced beſides that the boat could not ſurvive the ſurfs, we all ſaid we would remain on the dry part of the veſſel, and truſt to God till day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light appeared, when we ſhould know better what to do.</p>
                     <p>I then adviſed to get the boat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared againſt morning, and ſome of us began to ſet about it; but others aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned all care of the ſhip and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and fell to drinking. Our boat had a piece out of her bottom near two feet long, and we had no mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials to mend her; however, neceſſity being the mother of invention, I took
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:023353_0238_0FBF48564A2179B0"/>
ſome pump leather and nailed it to the broken part, and plaſtered it over with tallow-greaſe. And, thus prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the utmoſt anxiety of mind we watched for day-light, and thought every minute an hour till it appeared. At laſt it ſaluted our longing eyes, and kind Providence accompanied its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach with what was no ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to us; for the dreadful ſwells be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſubſide; and the next thing that we diſcovered to raiſe our droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits, was a ſmall key or deſolate iſland, about five or ſix miles off; but a barrier ſoon preſented itſelf; for there was not water enough for our boat to go over the reefs, and this threw us again into a ſad conſternation; but there was no alternative, we were therefore obliged to put but few in the boat at once; and, what was ſtill worſe, all of us were frequently under the neceſſity of getting out to drag and lift it over the reefs. This coſt us much labour and fatigue; and, what was yet more diſtreſſing, we could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void having our legs cut and torn very much with the rocks. There were only four people that would work with me at the oars; and they conſiſted of three black men and a Dutch creole
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:023353_0239_0FBF4859393A2D50"/>
ſailor; and, though we went with the boat five times that day, we had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to aſſiſt us. But, had we not worked in this manner, I really believe the people could not have been ſaved; for not one of the white men did any thing to preſerve their lives; indeed they ſoon got ſo drunk that they were not able, but lay about the deck like ſwine, ſo that we were at laſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to lift them into the boat, and carry them on ſhore by force This want of aſſiſtance made our labour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerably ſevere; inſomuch, that, by going on ſhore ſo often that day, the ſkin was partly ſtript off my hands.</p>
                     <p>HOWEVER, we continued all the day to toil and ſtrain our exertions, till we had brought all on board ſafe to the ſhore, ſo that out of thirty-two people we loſt not one.</p>
                     <p>MY dream now returned upon my mind with all its force; it was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in every part; for our danger was the ſame I had dreamt of; and I could not help looking on myſelf as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal inſtrument in effecting our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; for, owing to ſome of our people getting drunk, the reſt of us were obliged to double our exertions; and it was fortunate we did, for in a
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:023353_0240_0FBF485B2756D4D0"/>
very little time longer the patch of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the boat would have been worn out, and ſhe would have been no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger fit for ſervice. Situated as we were, who could think that men ſhould be ſo careleſs of the danger they were in? for, if the wind had but raiſed the ſwell as it was when the veſſel ſtruck, we muſt have bid a final fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel to all hopes of deliverances, and though, I warned the people who were drinking, and entreated them to embrace the moment of deliverance, nevertheleſs they perſiſted, as if not poſſeſſed of the leaſt ſpark of reaſon. I could not help thinking, that, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe people had been loſt, God would charge me with their lives, which, perhaps, was one cauſe of my labouring ſo hard for their preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and indeed every one of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſeemed ſo ſenſible of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice I had rendered them, that while we were on the key I was a kind of chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian amongſt them. I brought ſome limes, oranges, and lemons aſhore; and, finding it to be a good ſoil where we were, I planted ſeveral of them as a token to any one that might be caſt away hereafter. This key, as we afterwards found, was one of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hama
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:023353_0241_0FBF485D402D16F8"/>
iſlands, which conſiſt of a cluſter of large iſlands with ſmaller ones or keys, as they are called, interſperſed among them. It was about a mile in circumference, with a white ſandy beach running in a regular order along it. On that part of it where we firſt attempted to land there ſtood ſome very large birds, called flamingoes: theſe, from the reflection of the ſun, appeared to us at a little diſtance as large as men; and, when they walked backwards and forwards, we could not conceive what they were: our captain ſwore they were cannibals. This created a great panic among us; and we held a conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation how to act. The captain wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to go to a key that was within ſight, but a great way off; but I was againſt it, as in ſo doing we ſhould not be able to ſave all the people; 'And therefore,' ſaid I, <q>let us go on ſhore here, and perhaps theſe cannibals may take to the water.</q> Accordingly we ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards them; and when we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached them, to our very great joy and no leſs wonder, they walked off one after the other very deliberately; and at laſt they took flight and relieved us entirely from our fears. About the key there were turtles and ſeverel ſorts
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:023353_0242_0FBF485F3549A1D0"/>
of fiſh in ſuch abundance that we caught them without bait, which was a great relief to us after the ſalt proviſions on board. There was alſo a large rock on the beach, about ten feet high, which was in the form of a punch-bowl at the top; this we could not help thinking Providence had ordained to ſupply us with rain water; and it was ſomething ſingular that, if we did not take the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when it rained, in ſome little time after it would turn as ſalt as ſea-water.</p>
                     <p>OUR firſt care after refreſhment, was to make ourſelves tents to lodge in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which we did as well as we could with ſome ſails we had brought from the ſhip. We then began to think how we might get from this place, which was quite uninhabited; and we deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to repair our boat, which was very much ſhattered, and to put to ſea in queſt of a ſhip or ſome inhabited iſland. It took us up however eleven days before we could get the boat ready for ſea in the manner we wanted it, with a ſail and other neceſſaries. When we had got all things prepared, the captain wanted me to ſtay on ſhore while he went to ſea in queſt of a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to take all the people off the key; but this I refuſed; and the captain and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:023353_0243_0FBF48652A810EC8"/>
myſelf, with five more, ſet off in the boat towards New Providence. We had no more than two muſket load of gun-powder with us if any thing ſhould happen; and our ſtock of proviſions conſiſted of three gallons of rum, four of water, ſome ſalt beef ſome biſcuit; and in this manner we proceeded to ſea.</p>
                     <p>ON the ſecond day of our voyage, we came to an iſland called Abbico, the largeſt of the Bahama iſlands. We were much in want of water; for by this time our water was expended, and we were exceedingly fatigued in pulling two days in the heat of the ſun; and it being late in the evening, we hauled the boat aſhore to try for water and remain during the night; when we came aſhore we ſearched for water, but could find none. When it was dark, we made a fire around us for fear of the wild beaſts, as the place was an entire thick wood, and we took it by turns to watch. In this ſituation we found very little reſt, and waited with impatience for the morning. As ſoon as the light appeared we ſet off again with our boat, in hopes of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſiſtance during the day. We were now much dejected and weakened
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:023353_0244_0FBF48668CF87AF8"/>
by pulling the boat; for our ſail was of no uſe, and we were almoſt famiſhed for want of freſh water to drink. We had nothing left to eat but ſalt beef, and that we could not uſe without water. In this ſituation we toiled all day in ſight of the iſland, which was very long; in the evening, ſeeing no relief, we made ſhore again, and faſtened our boat. We then went to look for freſh water, being quite faint for the want of it; and we dug and ſearched about for ſome all the remainder of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but could not find one drop, ſo that our dejection at this period became exceſſive, and our terror ſo great, that we expected nothing but death, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us. We could not touch our beef, which was ſalt as brine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out freſh water; and we were in the greateſt terror from the apprehenſion of wild beaſts. When unwelcome night came we acted as on the night before; and the next morning we ſet off again from the iſland in hopes of ſeeing ſome veſſel. In this manner we toiled as well as we were able till four o'clock, during which we paſſed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral keys, but could not meet with a ſhip; and, ſtill famiſhing with thirſt, went aſhore on one of thoſe keys again
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:023353_0245_0FBF48677B1409E8"/>
in hopes of finding ſome water. Here we found ſome leaves with a few drops of water in them, which we lapped with much eagerneſs; we then dug in ſeveral places, but without ſucceſs. As we were digging holes in ſearch of water there can forth ſome very thick and black ſtuff, but none of us could, touch it, except the poor Dutch Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ole, who drank above a quart of it as eagerly as if it had been wine. We tried to catch fiſh, but could not: and we now began to repine at our fate, and abandon ourſelves to deſpair; when in the midſt of our murmuring, the captain all at once cried out <q>A ſail! a ſail! a ſail!</q> This gladdening ſound was like a reprieve to a convict, and we all inſtantly returned to look at it; but in a little time ſome of us began to be afraid it was not a ſail. However, at a venture, we embarked and ſteered after it; and, in half an hour to our unſpeakable joy, we plainly ſaw that it was a veſſel. At this our drooping ſpirits revived, and we made towards her with all the ſpeed imaginable. When we came near to her, we found ſhe was a little ſloop, about the ſize of a Graveſend hoy, and quite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ull of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; a circumſtance which we could;
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:023353_0246_0FBF43FBCECD3710"/>
not make out the meaning of. Our captain, who was a Welſhman, ſwore that they were pirates, and would kill us. I ſaid, be that as it might, we muſt board her if we were to die by it; and if they ſhould not receive us kindly, we muſt oppoſe them as well as we could; for there was no alternative between their periſhing and ours. This coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel was immediately taken; and I real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe that the Captain, myſelf, and the Dutchman, would then have faced twenty men. We had two cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes and a muſket, that I brought in the boat; and in this ſituation, we rowed alongſide, and immediately boarded her. I believe there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout forty hands on board; but how great was our ſurpriſe, as ſoon as we got on board, to find that the major part of them were in the ſame predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as ourſelves.</p>
                     <p>THEY belonged to a whaling ſchoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that was wrecked two days before us about nine miles to the north of our veſſel. When ſhe was wrecked ſome of them had taken to their boats and had left ſome of their people and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty on a key, in the ſame manner as we had done; and were going like us to New-Providence in queſt of a ſhip,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:023353_0247_0FBF43FD45736A90"/>
when they met with this little ſloop, called a wrecker; their employment in thoſe ſeas being to look after wrecks. They were then going to take the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the people belonging to the ſchooner; for which the wrecker was to have all things belonging to the veſſel, and likewiſe their people's help to get what they could out of her, and were then to carry the crew to New-Providence.</p>
                     <p>WE told the people of the wrecker the condition of our veſſel, and we made the ſame agreement with them as the ſchooner's people; and, on their complying, we begged of them to go to our key directly, becauſe our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were in want of water. They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, therefore, to go along with us firſt; and in two days we arrived at the key, to the inexpreſſible joy of the people that we had left behind, as they had been reduced to great extremities for want of water in our abſence. Luckily for us, the wrecker had now more people on board than ſhe could carry or victual for any moderate length of time; they therefore hired the ſchooner's people to work on the wreck, and we left them our boat, and embarked for New-Providence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="unknown:023353_0248_0FBF43FF86658AF0"/>
NOTHING could have been more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate than our meeting with this wrecker, for New-Providence was at ſuch a diſtance that we never could have reached it in our boat. The iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and of Abbico was much longer than we expected; and it was not till after ſailing for three or four days that we got ſafe to the farther end of it, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards New-Providence. When we arrived there we watered, and got a good many lobſters and other ſhell-fiſh; which proved a great relief to us, as our proviſions and water were almoſt exhauſted. We then proceeded on our voyage; but the day after we left the Iſland, late in the evening, and whilſt we were yet amongſt the Bahama keys, we were overtaken by a violent gale of wind, ſo that we were obliged to cut away the maſt. The veſſel was very near foundering; for ſhe parted from her anchors, and ſtruck ſeveral times on the ſhoals. Here we expected every minute that ſhe would have gone to pieces, and each moment to be our laſt; ſo much ſo, that my old captain and ſickly uſeleſs mate, and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, fainted; and death ſtared us in the face on every ſide. All the ſwearers on board now began to call on the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:023353_0249_0FBF44010F69E088"/>
God of Heaven to aſſiſt them: and, ſure enough, beyond our comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he did aſſiſt us, and in a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous manner delivered us! In the very height of our extremity the wind lul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for a few minutes; and, although the ſwell was high beyond expreſſion, two men, who were expert ſwimmers, attempted to go to the buoy of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, which we ſtill ſaw on the water, at ſome diſtance, in a little punt that belonged to the wrecker, which was not large enough to carry more than two. She filled at different times in their endeavours to get into her alongſide of our veſſel; and they ſaw nothing but death before them, as well as we; but they ſaid they might as well die that way as any other. A coil of very ſmall rope, with a little buoy, was put in along with them; and, at laſt, with great hazard, they got the punt clear from the veſſel; and theſe two intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid water heroes paddled away for life towards the buoy of the anchor. Our eyes were fixed on them all the time, expecting every minute to be their laſt: and the prayers of all thoſe that remained in their ſenſes were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up to God, on their behalf, for a ſpeedy deliverance, and for our own,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:023353_0250_0FBF440746064C20"/>
which depended on them; and he heard and anſwered us! Theſe two men at laſt reached the buoy; and, having faſtened the punt to it, they tied one end of their rope to the ſmall buoy that they had in the punt, and ſent it adrift towards the veſſel. We on board obſerving this threw out boat-hooks an leads faſtened to lines, in order to catch the buoy: at laſt we caught it, and faſtened a hawſer to the end of the ſmall rope; we then gave them a ſign to pull, and they pulled the hawſer to them, and faſtened it to the buoy: which being done we hauled for our lives; and, through the mercy of God, we got again from the ſhoals into deep water, and the punt got ſafe to the veſſel. It is impoſſible for any to conceive our heart-felt joy at this ſecond deliverance from ruin, but thoſe who have ſuffered the ſame hardſhips. Thoſe whoſe ſtrength and ſenſes were gone, came to themſelves, and were now as elated as they were before depreſſed. Two days after this the wind ceaſed, and the water became ſmooth. The punt then went on ſhore, and we cut down ſome trees; and having found our maſt and mended it we brought it on board, and fixed it up. As ſoon as we had

done this we got up the anchor, and away we went once more for New Providence, which in three days more we reached ſafe, after having been above three weeks in a ſituation in which we did not expect to eſcape with life. The inhabitants here were very kind to us; and, when they learned our ſituation, ſhewed us a great deal of hoſpitality and friendſhip. Soon after this every one of my old fellow-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers that were free parted from us, and ſhaped their courſe where their inclination led them. One merchant, who had a large ſloop, ſeeing our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and knowing we wanted to go to Georgia, told four of us that his veſſel was going there; and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we would work on board and load her, he would give us our paſſage free. As we could not get any wages whatever, and found it very hard to get off the place, we were obliged to conſent to his propoſal; and we went on board and helped to load the ſloop, though we had only our victuals allowed us. When ſhe was entirely loaded, he told us ſhe was going to Jamaica firſt, where we muſt go if we went in her. This, however, I refuſed; but my fellow-ſuffers not having any money
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:023353_0252_0FBF440AC78DE620"/>
to help themſelves with, neceſſity obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them to accept of the offer, and to ſteer that courſe, though they did not like it.</p>
                     <p>WE ſtayed in New Providence about ſeventeen or eighteen days; during which time I met with many friends, who gave me encouragement to ſtay there with them, but I declined it; though, had not my heart been fixed on England, I ſhould have ſtayed, as I liked the place extremely, and there were ſome free black people here who were very happy, and we paſted our time pleaſantly together, with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious ſound of the catguts, under the lime and lemon trees. At length Captain Phillips hired a ſloop to carry him and ſome of the ſlaves that he could not ſell to Georgia; and I agreed to go with him in this veſſel, meaning now to take my farewel of that place. When the veſſel was ready we all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked; and I took my leave of New Providence, not without regret. We ſailed about four o'clock the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a fair wind, for Georgia; and about eleven o'clock the ſame morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a ſudden and ſhort gale ſprung up and blew away moſt of our ſails; and, as we were ſtill among the keys, in
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:023353_0253_0FBF440C4035D540"/>
a very few minutes it daſhed the ſloop againſt the rocks. Luckily for us the water was deep; and the ſea was not ſo angry, but that, after having for ſome time laboured hard, and being many in number, we were ſaved, through God's mercy; and, by uſing our greateſt exertions, we got the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel off. The next day we returned to Providence, where we ſoon got her again refitted. Some of the people ſwore that we had ſpells ſet upon us by ſomebody in Montſerrat; and others that we had witches and wizzards amongſt the poor helpleſs ſlaves; and that we never ſhould arrive ſafe at Georgia. But theſe things did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me; I ſaid, <q>Let us again face the winds and ſeas, and ſwear not, but truſt to God, and he will deliver us.</q> We therefore once more ſet ſail; and with hard labour in ſeven days time, arrived ſafe at Georgia.</p>
                     <p>AFTER our arrival we went up to the town of Savannah; and the ſame even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I went to a friend's houſe to lodge, whoſe name was Moſa, a black man. We were very happy at meeting each other; and after ſupper we had a light till it was between nine and ten o'clock at night. About that time the watch
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:023353_0254_0FBF4413C11E29D0"/>
or patrol came by; and, diſcerning a light in the houſe, they knocked at the door: we opened it; and they came in and ſat down and drank ſome punch with us; they alſo begged ſome limes of me, as they underſtood I had ſome, which I readily gave them. A little after this they told me I muſt go to the watch-houſe with them: this ſurpriſed me a good deal, after our kindneſs to them; and I aſked them, Why ſo? They ſaid that all negroes who had a light in their houſes after nine o'clock were to be taken into cuſtody, and either pay ſome dollars or be flogged. Some of thoſe people knew that I was a free man; but, as the man of the houſe was not free, and had his maſter to protect him, they did not take the ſame liberty with him they did with me. I told them that I was a free man, and juſt arrived from Providence; that we were not making any noiſe, and that I was not a ſtranger in that place, but was very well known there: <q>Beſides, ſaid I, what will you do with me?—'That you ſhall ſee,</q> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied they, <q>but you muſt go to the watch-houſe with us.</q> Now whether they meant to get money from me or not I was at a loſs to know; but I
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:023353_0255_0FBF441545A121B0"/>
thought immediately of the oranges and limes at Santa Cruz: and ſeeing that nothing would pacify them I went with them to the watch-houſe, where I remained during the night. Early the next morning theſe impoſing ruffians flogged a negro-man and woman that they had in the watch-houſe, and then they told me that I muſt be flogged too. I aſked why? and if there was no law for free men? and told them if there was I would have it put in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>orce againſt them. But this only exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them the more, and inſtantly ſwore they would ſerve me as Doctor Perkins had done; and were going to lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands on me; when one of them, more humane than the reſt, ſaid that as I was a free man they could not juſtify ſtripping me by law. I then immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſent for Doctor Brady, who was known to be an honeſt and worthy man; and on his coming to my aſſiſtance they let me go.</p>
                     <p>THIS was not the only diſagreeable incident I met with while I was in this place; for one day, while I was a little way out of the town of Savannah, I was beſet by two white men, who meant to play their uſual tricks with me in the way of kidnapping. As ſoon as
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:023353_0256_0FBF4416C2837690"/>
theſe men accoſted me, one of them ſaid to the other, <q>This is the very fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low we are looking for, that you loſt:</q> and the other ſwore immediately that I was the identical perſon. On this they made up to me, and were about to handle me; but I told them to be ſtill and keep off; for I had ſeen thoſe kind of tricks played upon other free blacks, and they muſt not think to ſerve me ſo. At this they pauſed a little, and one ſaid to the other—it will not do; and the other anſwered that I talked two good Engliſh. I replied, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved I did; and I had alſo with me a revengeful ſtick equal to the occaſion; and my mind was likewiſe good. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily however it was not uſed; and, after we had talked together a little in this manner, the rogues left me.</p>
                     <p>I ſtayed in Savannah ſome time, anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly trying to get to Montſerrat once more to ſee Mr. King, my old maſter, and then to take a final farewell of the American quarter of the globe. At laſt I met with a ſloop called the Speed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, Captain John Bunton, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to Grenada, and was bound to Martinico, a French iſland, with a cargo of rice, and I ſhipped myſelf on board of her.</p>

                        <pb n="53" facs="unknown:023353_0257_0FBF44184C423EA0"/>
BEFORE I left Georgia, a black wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had a child lying dead, being very tenacious of the church burial ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and not able to get any white per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to perform it, applied to me for that purpoſe. I told her I was no parſon; and beſides, that the ſervice over the dead did not affect the ſoul. This however did not ſatisfy her; ſhe ſtill urged me very hard: I therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with her earneſt entreaties, and at laſt conſented to act the parſon for the firſt time in my life. As ſhe was much reſpected, there was a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany both of white and black people at the grave. I then accordingly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed my new vocation, and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the funeral ceremony to the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all preſent; after which I bade idieu to Georgia, and ſailed for Martinico.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>I THUS took a final leave of Georgia; for the treatment I had received in it diſguſted me very much againſt the place; and when I left it and ſailed for Martinico I determined never more to reviſit it. My new captain conducted
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:023353_0259_0FBF441FF4AB1010"/>
his veſſel ſafer than my former one; and, after an agreeable voyage, we got ſafe to our intended port. While I was on this iſland I went about a good deal, and found it very pleaſant: in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular I admired the town of St. Pierre, which is the principal one in the iſland, and built more like an European town than any I had ſeen in the Weſt Indies. In general alſo, ſlaves were better treated, had more holidays, and looked better than thoſe in the Engliſh iſlands. After we had done our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs here, I wanted my diſcharge, which was neceſſary; for it was then the month of May, and I wiſhed much to be at Montſerrat to bid farewel to Mr. King, and all my other friends there, in time to ſail for Old England in the July fleet. But, alas! I had put a great ſtumbling block in my own way, by which I was near loſing my paſſage that ſeaſon to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. I had lent my captain ſome money, which I now wanted to enable me to proſecute my intentions. This I told him; but when I applied for it, though I urged the neceſſity of my occaſion, I met with ſo much ſhuffl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ng from him, that I began at laſt to be afraid of loſing my money, as I could
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:023353_0260_0FBF44228AAE3120"/>
not recover it by law; for I have already mentioned, that throughout the Weſt Indies no black man's teſtimony is admitted, on any occaſion, againſt any white perſon whatever, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my own oath would have been of no uſe. I was obliged, therefore, to remain with him till he might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to return it to me. Thus we ſailed from Martinico for the Grenades. I frequently preſſing the captain for my money to no purpoſe; and, to render my condition worſe, when we got there, the captain and his owners quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled; ſo that my ſituation became daily more irkſome: for beſides that we on board had little or no victuals allowed us, and I could not get my money nor wages, as I could then have gotten my paſſage free to Montſerrat had I been able to accept it. The worſt of all was, that it was growing late in July, and the ſhips in the iſlands muſt ſail by the 26th of that month. At laſt, however, with a great many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, I got my, money from the captain, and took the firſt veſſel I could meet with for St, Euſtatia. From thence I went in another to Baſſeterre in St. Kitts, where I arrived on the 19th of July. On the 22d, having met with a
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:023353_0261_0FBF4423E36927B0"/>
veſſel bound to Montſerrat, I wanted to go in her; but the captain and others would not take me on board until I ſhould advertiſe myſelf, and give notice of my going off the iſland. I told them of my haſte to be in Montſerrat, and that the time then would not admit of advertiſing, it being late in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the veſſel about to ſail; but he inſiſted it was neceſſary, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he ſaid he would not take me. This reduced me to great perplexity; for if I ſhould be compelled to ſubmit to this degrading neceſſity, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very black freeman is under, of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing himſelf like a ſlave, when he leaves an iſland, and which I thought a groſs impoſition upon any freeman, I feared I ſhould miſs that opportunity of going to Montſerrat, and then I could not get to England that year. The veſſel was juſt going off, and no time could be loſt; I immediately therefore ſet about with a heavy heart, to try who I could get to befriend me in complying with the demands of the captain. Luckily I found in a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, ſome gentlemen of Montſerrat whom I knew; and having told them my ſituation, I requeſted their friendly aſſiſtance in helping me off the iſland,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:023353_0262_0FBF442A1410D740"/>
Some of them, on this, went with me to the captain, and ſatisfied him of my freedom; and, to my very great joy, he deſired me to go on board. We then ſet ſail, and the next day, 23d, I arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the wiſhed-for place, after an abſence of ſix months, in which I had more than once experienced the deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering hand of Providence, when all human means of eſcaping deſtruction ſeemed hopeleſs. I ſaw my friends with a gladneſs of heart which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by my abſence and the dangers I had eſcaped, and I was received with great friendſhip by them all, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by Mr. King, to whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the fate of his ſloop, the Nancy, and the cauſes of her being wrecked. I now learned with extreme ſorrow, that his houſe was waſhed away during my abſence, by the burſting of a pond at the top of a mountain that was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite the town of Plymouth. It ſwept great part of the town away, and Mr. King loſt a great deal of property from the inundation, and nearly his life. When I told him I intended to go to London that ſeaſon, and that I had come to viſit him before my departure, the good man expreſſed a great deal of affection for me, and ſorrow that I
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:023353_0263_0FBF442B06DA12F8"/>
ſhould leave him, and warmly adviſed me to ſtay there; inſiſting, as I was much reſpected by all the gentlemen in the place, that I might do very well, and in a ſhort time have land and ſlaves of my own. I thanked him for this inſtance of his friendſhip; but, as I wiſhed very much to be in London, I declined remaining any longer there, and begged he would excuſe me. I then requeſted he would be kind enough to give me a certificate of my behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our while in his ſervice, which he very readily complied with, and gave me the following:</p>

I wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a grateful and thankful heart to praiſe the Lord God on high for all his mercies! in this extaſy I ſteered the ſhip all night.</p>
                     <p>WE had a moſt proſperous voyage, and, at the end of ſeven weeks, arrived at Cherry-Garden ſtairs. Thus were my longing eyes once more gratified with a ſight of London, after having
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:023353_0265_0FBF4434A3FEFF10"/>
been abſent from it above four years. I immediately received my wages, and I never had earned ſeven guineas ſo quick in my life before; I had thirty-ſeven guineas in all, when I got cleared of the ſhip. I now entered upon a ſcene quite new to me, but full of hope. In this ſituation my firſt thoughts were to look out for ſome of my former friends, and amongſt the firſt of thoſe were the Miſs Guerins. As ſoon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as I had regaled myſelf I went in queſt of thoſe kind ladies, whom I was very impatient to ſee; and with ſome difficulty and preſeverance, I found them at May's-hill Greenwhich. They were moſt agreeably ſurpriſed to ſee me, and I quite overjoyed at meeting with them. I told them my hiſtory, at which they expreſſed great wonder, and freely acknowledged it did their couſin, Captain Paſcal, no honour. He then viſited there frequently; and I met him four or five days after in Greenwich park. When he ſaw me he appeared a good deal ſurpriſed, and aſked me how I came back? I anſwered, <q>In a ſhip.</q> To which he replied dryly, <q>I ſuppoſe you did not walk back to London on the water.</q> As I ſaw, by his manner, that he did not ſeem to be
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:023353_0266_0FBF44361D116BE8"/>
ſorry for his behaviour to me, and that I had not much reaſon to expect any favour from him, I told him that he had uſed me very ill, after I had been ſuch a faithful ſervant to him for ſo many years; on which, without ſaying any more, he turned about and went away. A few days after this I met Capt. Paſcal at Miſs Guerin's houſe, and aſked him for my prize-money. He ſaid there was none due to me; for, if my prize-money had been 10,000l. he had a right to it all. I told him I was informed otherwiſe: on which he bade me definance; and in a bantering tone, deſired me to commence a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit againſt him for it: <q>There are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers enough, ſaid he, that will take the cauſe in hand, and you had better try it.</q> I told him then that I would try it, which enraged him very much; however, out of regard to the ladies, I remained ſtill, and never made any farther demand of my right. Some time afterwards theſe friendly ladies aſked me what I meant to do with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and how they could aſſiſt me. I thanked them, and ſaid, if they pleaſed, I would be their ſervant; but if not, I had thirty-ſeven guineas, which would ſupport me for ſome time, I would be
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:023353_0267_0FBF4437127B3768"/>
much obliged to them to recommend me to ſome perſon who would teach me a buſineſs whereby I might earn my living. They anſwered me very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litely, that they were ſorry it did not ſuit them to take me as their ſervant, and aſked me what buſineſs I ſhould like to learn? I ſaid, hair-dreſſing, They then promiſed to aſſiſt me in this; and ſoon after they recommended me to a gentleman whom I had known before, one Capt. O'Hara, who treated me with much kindneſs, and procured me a maſter, a hair-dreſſer, in Coventry-court. Haymarket, with whom he placed me. I was with this man from Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber till the February following. In that time we had a neighbour in the ſame court who taught the French-horn. He uſed to blow it ſo well that I was charmed with it, and agreed with him to teach me to blow it. Accordingly he took me in hand, and began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct me, and I ſoon learned all the three parts. I took great delight in blowing on this inſtrument, the evenings being long; and beſides that I was fond of it, I did not like to be idle, and it filled up my vacant hours innocently. At this time, alſo I agreed with the Rev. Mr. Gregory, who lived in the
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:023353_0268_0FBF4438D31208C8"/>
ſame court, where he kept an academy and an evening-ſchool, to improve me in arithmetic. This he did as far as barter and alligation; ſo that all the time I was there I was entirely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. In February 1768, I hired myſelf to Dr. Charles Irving, in Pall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, ſo celebrated for his ſucceſsful experiments in making ſea water freſh; and here I had plenty of hair dreſſing to improve my hand. This gentleman was an excellent maſter; he was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly kind and good tempered; and allowed me in the evenings to attend my ſchools, which I eſteemed a great bleſſing; therefore I thanked God and him for it, and uſed all my diligence to improve the opportunity. This dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and attention recommended me to the notice and care of my three pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptors, who on their parts beſtowed a great deal of pains in my inſtruction, and beſides were all very kind to me. My wages, however, which were by two thirds leſs than ever I had in my life (for I had only 12l. per annum) I ſoon found would not be ſufficient to defray this extraordinary expence of maſters, and my own neceſſary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences; my old thirty-ſeven guineas had by this time worn all away to one.
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:023353_0269_0FBF443AE00EC980"/>
I thought it beſt, therefore, to try the ſea again in queſt of more money, as I had been bred to it, and had hitherto found the profeſſion of it ſucceſsful. I had alſo a very great deſire to ſee Turkey, and I now determined to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify it, Accordingly, in the month of May, 1768, I told the doctor my wiſh to go to ſea again, to which he made no oppoſition; and we parted on friendly terms. The ſame day I went into the city in queſt of a maſter. I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fortunate in my inquiry; for I ſoon heard of a gentleman who had a ſhip going to Italy and Turkey, and he wanted a man who could dreſs hair well, I was overjoyed at this, and went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately on board of his ſhip, as I had been directed, which I found to be fitted up with great taſte, and I already foreboded no ſmall pleaſure in ſailing in her. Not finding the gentleman on board, I was directed to his lodgings, where I met with him the next day, and gave him a ſpecimen of my d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>ſſing. He liked it ſo well that he hired me immediately, ſo that I was perfectly happy; for the ſhip, maſter, and voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, were entirely to my mind. The ſhip was called the Delawar, and my maſter's name was John Jolly, a neat

ſmart good humoured man, juſt ſuch an one as I wiſhed to ſerve. We ſailed from England in July following, and our voyage was extremely pleaſant. We went to Villa Franca, Nice, and Leghorn; and in all theſe places I was charmed with the richneſs and beauty of the countries, and ſtruck with the elegant buildings with which they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound. We had always in them plenty of extraordinary good wines and rich fruits which I was very fond of; and I had frequent occaſions of gratifying both my taſte and curioſity; for my captain always lodged on ſhore in thoſe places, which afforded me opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to ſee the country around. I alſo learned navigation of the mate, which I was very fond of. When we left Italy we had delightful ſailing among the Archipelago iſlands, and from thence to Smyrna in Turkey. This is a very ancient city; the houſes are built of ſtone, and moſt of them have graves adjoining to them; ſo that they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preſent the appearance of church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards. Proviſions are very plentiful in this city, and good wine leſs than a penny a pint. The grapes, pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, and many other fruits, were alſo the richeſt and largeſt I ever taſted.
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:023353_0271_0FBF444477687E78"/>
The natives are well looking and ſtrong made, and treated me always with great civility. In general I believe they are fond of black people; and ſeveral of them gave me preſſing invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to ſtay amongſt them, although they keep the franks, or Chriſtians, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, and do not ſuffer them to dwell immediately amongſt them. I was aſtoniſhed in not ſeeing women in any of their ſhops, and very rarely any in the ſtreets; and whenever I did they were covered with a veil from head to foot, ſo that I could not ſee their faces, except when any of them out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity uncovered them to look at me, which they ſometimes did. I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to ſee how the Greeks are, in ſome meaſure, kept under by the Turks, as the negroes are in the Weſt-Indies by the white people. The leſs refined Greeks, as I have already hinted, dance here in the ſame manner as we do in our nation.</p>
                     <p>On the whole, during our ſtay here, which was about five months, I liked the place and the Turks extremely well. I could not help obſerving one very remarkable circumſtance there: the tails of the ſheep are flat, and ſo very large, that I have known the tail even
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:023353_0272_0FBF444543646C68"/>
of a lamb to weigh from eleven to thirteen pounds. The fat of them is very white and rich, and is excellent in puddings, for which it is much uſed. Our ſhip being at length richly loaded with ſilk, and other articles, we ſailed for England.</p>
                     <p>In May 1769, ſoon after our return from Turkey, our ſhip made a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful voyage to Oporto in Portugal, where we arrived at the time of the carnival On our arrival, there were ſent on board of us thirty-ſix articles to obſerve with very heavy penalties if we ſhould break any of them; and none of us even dared to go on board any other veſſel or on ſhore, till the Inquiſition had ſent on board and ſearched for every thing illegal, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially bibles. Such as were produced, and certain other things were ſent on ſhore till the ſhips were going away; and any perſon in whoſe cuſtody a bible was found concealed, was to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned and flogged, and ſent into ſlavery for ten years. I ſaw here ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny very magnificent ſights, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the garden of Eden, where many of the clergy and laity went in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in their ſeveral orders with the hoſt, and ſung Te Deum. I had a great
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:023353_0273_0FBF4446C160DFF0"/>
curioſity to go into ſome of their churches, but could not gain admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance without uſing the neceſſary ſprinkling of holy water at my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. From curioſity, and a wiſh to be holy, I therefore complied with this ceremony, but its virtues were loſt upon me, for I found myſelf nothing the better for it. This place abounds with plenty of all kinds of proviſions: The town is well built and pretty, and commands a fine proſpect. Our ſhip having taken in a load of wine, and other commodities, we ſailed for Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and arrived in July following.</p>
                     <p>OUR next voyage was to the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean. The ſhip was again got ready, and we ſailed in September for Genoa. This is one of the fineſt cities I ever ſaw; ſome of the edifices were of beautiful marble, and made a moſt noble appearance; and many had very curious fountains before them. The churches were rich and magnificent, and curiouſly adorned both in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and out. But all this grandeur was in my eyes diſgraced by the galley ſlaves, whoſe condition both there and in other parts of Italy is truly pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and wretched. After we had ſtayed there ſome weeks, during which
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:023353_0274_0FBF4449A5C0D738"/>
we bought many different things we wanted, and got them very cheap, we ſailed to Naples, a charming city, and remarkably clean. The bay is the moſt beautiful I ever ſaw; the moles for ſhipping are excellent: I thought it extraordinary to ſee grand operas acted here on Sunday nights, and even attended by their majeſties. I too, like theſe great ones, went to thoſe ſights, and vainly ſerved God in the day while I thus ſerved mammon effectually at night. While we remained here, there happened an eruption of mount Veſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius, of which I had a perfect view. It was extremely awful; and we were ſo near that the aſhes from it uſed to be thick on our deck. After we had tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted our buſineſs at Naples, we ſailed with a fair wind once more for Smyrna, where we arrived in December. A ſeraſkier or officer, took a liking to me here, and wanted me to ſtay, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered me two wives; however I refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the temptation, thinking one was as much as ſome could manage, and more than others would venture on. The merchants here travel in caravans or large companies. I have ſeen many caravans from India, with ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of camels, laden with different
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:023353_0275_0FBF445103869680"/>
goods. The people of theſe caravans are quite brown. Among other articles they brought with them a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of locuſts, which are a kind of pulſe, ſweet and pleaſant to the palace, and in ſhape reſembling French beans, but longer. Each kind of goods is ſold in a ſtreet by itſelf, and I always found the Turks very honeſt in their dealings. They let no Chriſtians into their moſques or churches, for which I was very ſorry; as I was always fond of going to ſee the different modes of worſhip of the people wherever I went. The plague broke out while we were in Smyrna, and we ſtopped taking goods into the ſhip till it was over. She was then richly laden, and we ſailed in about March 1770, for England. One day in our paſſage we met with an accident which was near burning the ſhip. A black cook, in melting ſome fat, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet the pan into the fire under the deck, which immediately began to blaze, and the flame went up very high under the foretop. With the fright, the poor cook became almoſt white, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeechleſs. Happily however we got the fire out without doing much miſchief. After various delays in this
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:023353_0276_0FBF4452035706B8"/>
paſſage, which was tedious, we arrived in Standgate creek in July; and, at the latter end of the year, ſome new event occurred, ſo that my noble Captain, the ſhip, and I all ſeparated.</p>
                     <p>IN April 1771, I ſhipped myſelf as a ſteward with Capt. Wm. Robertſon of the ſhip Grenada Planter, once more to try my fortune in the Weſt Indies; and we ſailed from London for Madeira, Barbadoes, and the Grenades. When we were at this laſt place, having ſome goods to ſell, I met once more with my former kind of Weſt India cuſtomers.</p>
                     <p>A white man, an iſlander, bought ſome goods of me to the amount of ſome pounds, and made me many fair promiſes as uſual, but without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of paying me. He had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bought goods from ſome more of our people, whom he intended to ſerve in the ſame manner; but he ſtill amuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us with promiſes However, when our ſhip was loaded, and near ſailing, this honeſt buyer diſcovered no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſign of paying for any thing he had bought of us; but on the contrary, when I aſked him for my money he threatened me and another black man he had bought goods of, ſo that we found we were like to get more blows
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:023353_0277_0FBF4453969328D8"/>
than payment. On this we went to complain to one Mr. M'Intoſh, a juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the peace; we told his worſhip of the man's villainous tricks, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that he would be kind enough to ſee us redreſſed: but being negroes, although free, we could not get any remedy; and our ſhip being then juſt upon the point of ſailing, we knew not how to help ourſelves, though we thought it hard to loſe our property in this manner. Luckily for us however, this man was alſo indebted to three white ſailors, who could not get a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from him; they therefore readily joined us, and we all went together in ſearch of him. When we found where he was, I took him out of a houſe and threatened him with vengeance; on which, finding he was likely to be handled ronghly, the rogue offered each of us ſome ſmall allowance, but nothing near our demands. This exaſperated us much more; and ſome were for cutting his ears off; but he begged hard for mercy, which was at laſt granted him, after we had entirely ſtripped him. We then let him go, for which he thanked us, glad to get off ſo eaſily, and ran into the buſhes, after having wiſhed us a good voyage. We
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:023353_0278_0FBF445B5BDB4578"/>
then repaired on board, and ſhortly after ſet ſail for England. I cannot help remarking here a very narrow eſcape we had from being blown up, owing to a piece of negligence of mine, Juſt as our ſhip was under ſail, I went down under the cabin to do ſome buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and had a lighted candle in my hand, which, in my hurry, without thinking, I held in a barrel of gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder. It remained in the powder until it was near catching fire, when fortunately I obſerved it and ſnatched it out in time, and providentially no harm happened; but I was ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with terror that I immediately fainted at this deliverance.</p>
                     <p>IN twenty-eight days time we arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in England, and I got clear of this ſhip. But, being ſtill of a roving diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and deſirous of ſeeing as many different parts of the world as I could, I ſhipped myſelf ſoon after, in the ſame year, as ſteward on board of a fine large ſhip, called the Jamaica, Captain David Watt; and we ſailed from England in December 1771, for Nevis and Jamaica. I found Jamaica to be a very fine large iſland, well peopled, and the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable of the Weſt India iſlands. There was a vaſt number of negroes
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:023353_0279_0FBF445D43763B00"/>
here, whom I found as uſual exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly impoſed upon by the white peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the ſlaves puniſhed as in the other iſlands. There are negroes whoſe buſineſs it is to flog ſlaves; they go about to different people for employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the uſual pay is from one to four bits. I ſaw many cruel puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted on the ſlaves in the ſhort time I ſtayed here. In particular I was preſent when a poor fellow was tied up and kept hanging by the wriſts at ſome diſtance from the ground, and then ſome half hundred weights were fixed to his ancles, in which poſture he was flogged moſt unmercifully. There were alſo, as I heard, two different maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters noted for cruelty on the iſland, who had ſtaked up two negroes naked, and in two hours the vermin ſtung them to death. I heard a gentleman, I well knew, tell my captain that he paſſed ſentence on a negro man to be burnt alive for attempting to poiſon an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer. I paſs over numerous other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in order to relieve the reader by a milder ſcene of roguery. Before I had been long on the iſland, one Mr. Smith at Port Morant, bought goods of me to the amount of twenty-five pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; but when I demanded payment
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:023353_0280_0FBF445EF04DA190"/>
from him, he was going each time to beat me, and threatened that he would put me in goal. One time he would ſay I was going to ſet his houſe on fire; at another, he would ſwear I was going to run away with his ſlaves. I was aſtoniſhed at this uſage from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who was in the ſituation of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, but I had no alternative; and was therefore obliged to ſubmit. When I came to Kingſton, I was ſurpriſed to ſee the number of Africans who were aſſembled together on Sundays; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly at a large commodious place, called Spring Path. Here each differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nation of Africa meet and dance after the manner of their own country. They ſtill retain moſt of their native cuſtoms: they bury their dead, and put victuals, pipes and tobacco, and other things, in the grave with the corps, in the ſame manner as in Africa. Our ſhip having got her loading we ſailed for London, where we arrived in the Auguſt following. On my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to London, I waited on my old and good maſter, Dr. Irving, who made me an offer of his ſervice again. Being now tired of the ſea I gladly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted it. I was very happy in living with this gentleman once more; dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:023353_0281_0FBF446404158070"/>
which time we were daily employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in reducing old Neptune's domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions by purifying the briny element and making it freſh. Thus I went on till May 1773, when I was rouſed by the ſound of ſame, to ſeek new adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and find, towards the north pole, what our Creator never intended we ſhould, a paſſage to India. An expedition was now fitting out to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore a north-eaſt paſſage, conducted by the Honourable Conſtantine John Phipps, ſince Lord Mulgrave, in his Majeſty's ſloop of war the Race Horſe. My maſter being anxious for the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this adventure, we therefore prepared every thing for our voyage, and I attended him on board the Race Horſe, the 24th day of May, 1773. We proceeded to Sheerneſs, where we were joined by his Majeſty's ſloop the Carcaſs, commanded by Captain Lut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>widge. On the 4th of June, we ſailed towards our deſtined place, the pole; and on the 15th of the ſame month we were off Shetland. On this day I had a great and unexpected deliverance from an accident which was near blowing up the ſhip and deſtroying the crew, which made me ever after during the voyage uncommonly cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:023353_0282_0FBF4465805D0868"/>
The ſhip was ſo filled that there was very little room on board for any one, which placed me in a very auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſituation. I had reſolved to keep a journal of this ſingular and intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voyage; and I had no other place for this purpoſe but a little cabin, or the doctor's ſtore-room, where I ſlept. This little place was ſtuffed with all manner of combuſtibles, particularly with tow and aquafortis, and many other dangerous things. Unfortunately it happened in the evening as I was writing my journal, that I had occaſion to take the candle out of the lanthorn, and a ſpark having touched a ſingle thread of the tow, all the reſt caught the flame, and immediately the whole was in a blaze. I ſaw nothing but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent death before me, and expected to be the firſt to periſh in the flames. In a moment the alarm was ſpread, and many people who were near, ran to aſſiſt in putting out the fire. All this time I was in the very midſt of the flames; my ſhirt, and the handkerchief on my neck, were burnt, and I was almoſt ſmothered with the ſmoke. However, through God's mercy, as I was nearly giving up all hopes, ſome people brought blankets and mattreſſes
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:023353_0283_0FBF44671FED6E70"/>
and threw them on the flames, by which means in a ſhort time the fire was put out. I was ſeverely repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and menaced by ſuch of the officers who knew it, and ſtrictly charged never more to go there with a light: and, indeed, even my own fears made me give heed to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for a little time; but at laſt, not being able to write my journal in any other part of the ſhip, I was tempted again to venture by ſtealth with a light in the ſame cabin, though not without conſiderable fear and dread on my mind. On the 20th of June, we began to uſe Dr. Irving's apparatus for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalt water freſh; I uſed to attend the diſtillery: I frequently purified from twenty-ſix to forty gallons a day. The water thus diſtilled was perfectly pure, well taſted, and free from ſalt; and was uſed on various occaſions on board the ſhip. On the 28th of June, being in lat: 78, we made Greenland, where I was ſurpriſed to ſee the ſun did not ſet. The weather now became extremely cold; and as we ſailed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween north and eaſt which was our courſe, we ſaw many very high and curious mountains of ice; and alſo a great number of very large whales,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:023353_0284_0FBF446971AE2F78"/>
which uſed to come cloſe to our ſhip, and blow the water up to a very great height in the air. One morning we had vaſt quantities of ſea horſes about the ſhip, which neighed exactly like any other horſes. We fired ſome har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poon guns amongſt them, in order to take ſome, but we could not get any. The 30th, the captain of a Greenland ſhip came on board, and told us of three ſhips that were loſt in the ice; however we ſtill held on our courſe till July the 11th, when we were ſtopt by one compact impenetrable body of ice. We ran along it from eaſt to weſt above ten degrees; and on the 27th we got as far north as 80, 37; and in 19 or 20 degrees; eaſt longitude from London. On the 29th and 30th of July, we ſaw one continued plain of ſmooth unbroken ice, bounded only by the horizon; and we faſtened to a piece of ice that was eight yards eleven inches thick. We had generally ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, and conſtant daylight; which gave cheerfulneſs and novelty to the whole of this ſtriking, grand, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common ſcene; and, to heighten it ſtill more, the reflection of the ſun from the ice gave the clouds a moſt beautiful appearance. We killed many
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:023353_0285_0FBF44705502CCA8"/>
different animals at this time, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt nine bears. Though they had nothing in their paunches but water yet they were all very fat. We uſed to decoy them to the ſhip ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by burning feathers of ſkins. I thought them courſe eating, but ſome of the ſhip's company reliſhed them very m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ch. Some of our people once in the boat, fired at and wounded a ſea-horſe, which dived immediately: and in a little time after, brought up with it a number of others. They all joined in an attack upon the boat, and were with difficulty prevented from ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ing or overſetting her; but a boat from the Carcaſs having come to aſſiſt ours, and joined it, they diſperſed, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wreſted an oar from one of the men. One of the ſhip's boats had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been attacked in the ſame manner, but happily no harm was done. Though we wounded ſeveral of theſe animals we never got but one. We remained hereabouts until the 1ſt of Auguſt; when the two ſhips got com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely faſtened in the ice, occaſioned by the looſe ice that ſet in from the ſea. This made our ſituation very dreadful and alarming; ſo that on the 7th day, we were in very great apprehenſion of
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:023353_0286_0FBF44734A0D74B0"/>
having the ſhips ſqueezed to pieces. The officers now held a council to know what was beſt for us to do in order to ſave our lives; and it was determined that we ſhould endeavour to eſcape by dragging our boats along the ice towards the ſea; which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was farther off than any of us thought. This determination filled us with extreme dejection, and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with deſpair; for we had very little proſpect of eſcaping with life. However, we ſawed ſome of the ice about the ſhips, to keep it from hurting them; and thus kept them in a kind of pond. We then began to drag the boats as well as we could towards the ſea; but, after two or three days la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, we made very little progreſs; ſo that ſome of our hearts totally failed us, and I really began to give up my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for loſt, when I ſaw our ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing calamities. While we were at this hard labour, I once fell into a pond we had made amongſt ſome looſe ice, and was very near being drowned; but providentially ſome people were near who gave me immediate aſſiſtance, and thereby I eſcaped drowning. Our deplorable condition, which kept up the conſtant apprehenſion of our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:023353_0287_0FBF4474811E6850"/>
in the ice, brought me gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to think of eternity in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as I never had done before. I had the fears of death hourly upon me, and ſhuddered at the thoughts of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grim king of terrors in the <hi>natural</hi> ſtate I then was in, and was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly doubtful of a happy eternity if I ſhould die in it. I had no hopes of my life being prolonged for any time; for we ſaw that our exiſtence could not be long on the ice after leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhips, which were now out of ſight, and ſome miles from the boats. Our appearance now became truly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable; pale dejection ſeized every countenance; many, who had been before blaſphemers, in this our diſtreſs began to call on the good God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for his help; and in the time of our utter need he heard us, and againſt hope or human probability, delivered us! It was the eleventh day of the ſhips being thus faſtened, and the fourth of our drawing the boats in this manner, that the wind changed to the E. N. E. The weather immediately became mild, and the ice broke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſea, which was to the S. W. of us. Many of us on this got on board again, and with all our might
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:023353_0288_0FBF447603A8CC50"/>
we hove the ſhips into every open water we could find, and made all the ſail on them in our power: and now, having a proſpect of ſucceſs, we made ſignals for the boats and the remainder of the people. This ſeemed to us like a reprieve from death: and happy was the man who could firſt get on board of any ſhip, or the firſt boat he could meet. We then proceeded in this manner till we got into the open water again, which we accompliſhed in about thirty hours, to our infinite joy and gladneſs of heart. As ſoon as we were out of danger, we came to anchor and refitted; and on the 19th of Auguſt, we ſailed from this uninhabited extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the world, where the inhoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable climate affords neither food nor ſhelter, and not a tree or a ſhrub of any kind grows amongſt its barren rocks; but all is one deſolate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded waſte of ice, which even the conſtant beams of the ſun for ſix months in the year, cannot penetrate or diſſolve. The ſun now being on the decline, the days ſhortened as we ſailed to the ſouthward; and, on the 28th, in latitude 73, it was dark by ten o'clock at night. September the 10th, in latitude 58-59, we met a
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:023353_0289_0FBF447DAE4951C8"/>
very ſevere gale of wind and high ſeas, and ſhipped a great deal of water in the ſpace of ten hours. This made us work exceedingly hard at all our pumps a whole day; and one ſea, which ſtruck the ſhip with more force than any thing I ever met with of the kind before, laid her under water for ſome time, ſo that we thought ſhe would have gone down. Two boats were waſhed from the booms, and the long-boat from the chucks: all other moveable things on the decks were alſo waſhed away, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which were many curious things of different kinds which we had brought from Greenland; and we were obliged, in order to ligthen the ſhip, to toſs ſome of our guns over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board. We ſaw a ſhip at the ſame time, in very great diſtreſs, and her maſts were gone; but we were unable to aſſiſt her. We now loſt ſight of the Carcaſs till the 26th, when we ſaw land about Orfordneſs, of which place ſhe joined us. From thence we ſailed for London, and on the 30th came up to Deptford. And thus ended our Arctic voyage, to the no ſmall joy of all on board, after having been abſent four months; in which time, at the imminent hazard of our lives, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored

nearly as far towards the Pole as 81 degrees north, and 20 degrees eaſt longitude; being much farther, by all accounts, than any navigator had ever ventured before; in which we fully proved the impracticability of finding a paſſage that way to india.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>OUR voyage to the North Pole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, I returned to London with Doctor Irving, with whom I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſome time, during which I began ſeriouſly to reflect on the dangers I had eſcaped, particularly thoſe of my laſt voyage, which made a laſting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on my mind; and, by the grace of God, proved afterwards a mercy to me; it cauſed me to reflect deeply on myeternalſtate, and to ſeek the Lord with full purpoſe of heart ere it was too late. I rejoiced greatly; and heartily
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:023353_0292_0FBF448711328EB0"/>
thanked the Lord for directing me to London, where I was determined to work out my own ſalvation, and in ſo doing, procure a title to heaven; being the reſult of a mind blinded by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſin.</p>
                     <p>IN proceſs of time I left my maſter, Doctor Irving, the purifier of waters. I lodged in Coventry-court, Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market, where I was continually op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and much concerned about the ſalvation of my ſoul, and was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined (in my own ſtrength) to be a firſt-rate Chriſtian. I uſed every means for this purpoſe; and, not being able to find any perſon amongſt thoſe with whom I was then acquainted that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced with me in point of religion. or, in ſcripture language, that would ſhew me any good, I was much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and knew not where to ſeek relief; however<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I firſt frequented the neighbouring churches, St. Jame's, and others, two or three times a day, for many weeks: ſtill I came away diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: ſomething was wanting that I could not obtain, and I really found more heart-felt relief in reading my bible at home than in attending the church; and, being reſolved to be ſaved, I purſued other methods. Firſt I went
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:023353_0293_0FBF4488440914C0"/>
among the quakers, where the word of God was neither read or preached, ſo that I remained as much in the dark as ever. I then ſearched into the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man catholic principles, but was not in the leaſt edified. I at length had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Jews, which availed me nothing, as the fear of eternity daily haraſſed my mind, and I knew not where to ſeek ſhelter from the wrath to come. However this was my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, at all events, to read the four evangeliſts, and whatever ſect or party I found adhering thereto, ſuch I would join. Thus I went on heavily without any guide to direct me the way that leadeth to eternal life. I aſked dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent people queſtions about the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of going to heaven, and was told different ways. Here I was much ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, and could not find any at that time more righteous than myſelf, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo much inclined to devotion. I thought we ſhould not all be ſaved (this is agreeable to the holy ſcriptures) nor would all be damned. I found none among the circle of my acquaintance that kept wholly the ten command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. So righteous was I in my own eyes, that I was convinced I excelled many of them in that point, by keeping
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:023353_0294_0FBF448998C35B00"/>
eight out of ten; and finding thoſe who in general termed themſelves Chriſtians not ſo honeſt or ſo good in their morals as the Turks, I really thought the Turks were in a ſafer way of ſalvation than my neighbours: ſo that between hopes and ſears I went on, and the chief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts I enjoyed were in the muſical French horn, which I then practiſed and alſo dreſſing of hair. Such was my ſituation ſome months, experiencing the diſhoneſty of many people here. I determined at laſt to ſet out for Turkey, and there to end my days. It was now early in the ſpring 1774. I ſought for a maſter, and found a captain John Haghes, commander of a ſhip called Anglicanai, fitting out in the river Thames, and bound to Smyrna in Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key. I ſhipped myſelf with him as a ſteward; at the ſame time I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to him a very clever black man, John Annis, as a cook. This man was on board the ſhip near two months doing his duty: he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lived many years with Mr. William Kirkpatrick, a gentleman of the iſland of St Kitts, from whom he parted by conſent, though he afterwards tried many ſchemes to inveigle the poor man. He had applied to many cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:023353_0295_0FBF448B0064D868"/>
who traded to St. Kitts to trepan him; and when all their attempts and ſchemes of kidnapping proved abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Mr. Kirkpatrick came to our ſhip at Union Stairs, on Eaſter Monday, April the fourth, with two wherry boats and ſix men, having learned that the man was on board; and tied, and forcibly took him away from the ſhip, in the preſence of the crew and the chief mate, who had detained him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had information to come away. I believe this was a combined piece of buſineſs: but, be that as it may, it certainly reflected great diſgrace on the mate and captain alſo, who, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had deſired the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed man to ſtay on board, yet this vile act on the man who had ſerved him, he did not in the leaſt aſſiſt to recover or pay me a farthing of his wages, which was about five pounds. I proved the only friend he had, who attempted to regain him his liberty if poſſible, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known the want of liberty myſelf. I ſent as ſoon as I could to Graveſend, and got knowledge of the ſhip in which he was; but unluckily ſhe had ſailed the firſt tide after he was put on board. My intention was then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to apprehend Mr. Kirkpatrick,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:023353_0296_0FBF448CA6A37AC0"/>
who was about ſetting off for Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and, having obtained a <hi>habeas corpus</hi> for him, and got a tipſtaff to go with me to St. Paul's church-yard, where he lived, he, ſuſpecting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this kind, ſet a watch to look out. My being known to them, oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to uſe the following deception: I whitened my face, that they might not know me, and this had the deſired effect. He did not go out of his houſe that night, and next morning I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived a well plotted ſtratagem, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he had a gentleman in his houſe to perſonate him. My direction to the tipſtaff, who got admittance into the houſe, was to conduct him to a judge, according to the writ. When he came there, his plea was, that he had not the body in cuſtody, on which he was admitted to bail. I proceeded immediately to that well known phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropiſt, Granville Sharp, Eſq. who received me with the utmoſt kindneſs, and gave me every inſtruction that was needful on the occaſion. I left him in full hope that I ſhould gain the unhappy man his liberty, with the warmeſt ſenſe of gratitude towards Mr. Sharp, for his kindneſs; but alas! my attorney proved unfaithful; he
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:023353_0297_0FBF4491D31475E0"/>
took my money, loſt me many months employ, and did not do the leaſt good in the cauſe; and when the poor man arrived at St. Kitts, he was, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to cuſtom, ſtaked to the ground with four pins through a cord, two on his wriſts, and two on his ancles, was cut and flogged moſt unmercifully and afterwards loaded cruelly with irons about his neck. I had two very moving letters from him, while he was in this ſituation; and made at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to go after him at a great haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, but was ſadly diſappointed. I alſo was told of it by ſome very reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable families now in London, who ſaw him in St. Kitts, in the ſame ſtate, in which he remained till kind death releaſed him out of the hands of his tyrants. During this diſagreeable bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs I was under ſtrong convictions of ſin, and thought that my ſtate was worſe than any man's; my mind was unaccountably diſturbed; I often wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for death, though at the ſame time convinced I was altogether unprepared for that awful ſummons. Suffering much by villains in the late cauſe, and being much concerned about the ſtate of my ſoul, theſe things (but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the latter) brought me very low;
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:023353_0298_0FBF4494B3EA67C0"/>
ſo that I became a burden to myſelf, and viewed all things around me as emptineſs and vanity, which could could give no ſatisfaction to a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled conſcience. I was again deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to go to Turkey, and reſolved, at that time, never more to return to England. I engaged as a ſteward on board a Turkeyman (the Weſter Hall, Capt. Lina) but was prevented by means of my late captain, Mr. Hughes, and others. All this appeard to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and the only comfort I then experienced was, in reading the holy ſcriptures, where I ſaw that <q>there is no new thing under the ſun,</q> Eccleſ. 1. 9; and what was appointed for me I muſt ſubmit to. Thus I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to travel in much heavineſs, and frequently murmured againſt the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, particularly in his providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial dealings; and, awful to think! I began to blaſpheme, and wiſhed often to be any thing but a human being. In theſe ſevere conflicts the Lord anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me by awful <q>viſions of the night, when deep ſleep falleth upon men, in ſlumberings upon the bed,</q> Job xxxiii. 15. He was pleaſed, in much mercy, to give me to ſee, and in ſome meaſure underſtand, the great
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:023353_0299_0FBF44964F6DFF38"/>
and awful ſcene of the judgment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, that <q>no unclean perſon, no unholy thing, can enter into the kingdom of God,</q> Eph. v. 5. I would then, if it had been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, have changed my nature with the meaneſt worm on the earth; and was ready to ſay to the mountains and rocks "fall on me." Rev. vi. 16; but all in vain. I then in the greateſt agony requeſted the divine Creator, that he would grant me a ſmall ſpace of time to repent of my follies and vile iniquities, which I felt were grievous, The Lord, in his manifold mercies, was pleaſed to grant my requeſt, and being yet in a ſtate of time the ſenſe of God's mercies were ſo great on my mind when I awoke, that my ſtrength entirely fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me for many minutes, and I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly weak. This was the firſt ſpiritual mercy I ever was ſenſible of, and being on praying ground, as ſoon as I recovered a little ſtrength, and got out of bed and dreſſed myſelf, I invoked Heaven from my inmoſt ſoul, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently begged that God would never again permit me to blaſpheme his moſt holy name. The Lord, who is long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, and full of compaſſion to ſuch poor rebels as we are, condeſcended to
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:023353_0300_0FBF449B8EE18648"/>
hear and anſwer. I felt that I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unholy, and ſaw clearly what a bad uſe I had made of the faculties I was endowed with: they were given me to glorify God with; I thought, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I had better want them here, and enter into life eternal, than abuſe them and be caſt into hell fire. I prayed to be directed, if there were any holier than thoſe with whom I was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Lord would point them out to me. I appealed to the Searcher of hearts, whether I did not wiſh to love him more, and ſerve him better. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, the reader may eaſily diſcern, if a believer, that I was ſtill in nature's darkneſs. At length I hated the houſe in which I lodged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God's moſt holy name was blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed in it: then I ſaw the word of God verified, viz. <q>Before they call, I will anſwer; and while they are yet ſpeaking, I will hear.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I had a great deſire to read the bible the whole day at home; but not having a convenient place for retirement, I left the houſe in the day, rather than ſtay amongſt the wicked ones; and that day as I was walking, it pleaſed God to direct me to a houſe where there was an old ſea-faring man, who experienced
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:023353_0301_0FBF449D2219C450"/>
much of the love of God ſhed abroad in his heart. He began to diſcourſe with me; and, as I deſired to love the Lord, his converſation rejoiced me greatly; and indeed I had never heard before the love of Chriſt to believers ſet forth in ſuch a manner, and in ſo clear a point of view. Here I had more queſtions to put to the man than his time would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to anſwer: and in that memor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hour there came in a diſſenting miniſter; he joined our diſcourſe, and aſked me ſome few queſtions; among others, where I heard the goſpel preached? I knew not what he meant by hearing the goſpel; I told him I had read the goſpel: and he aſked where I went to church, or whether I went at all or not? To which I replied <q>I attended St. James's, St. Martin's, and St. Ann's Soho;—So, ſaid he, you are a churchman?</q> I anſwered, I was. He then invited me to a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſt at his chapel that evening. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the offer, and thanked him; and ſoon after he went away, I had ſome further diſcourſe with the old Chriſtian, added to ſome profitable read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which made me exceedingly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. When I left him he reminded me of coming to the feaſt; I aſſured him
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:023353_0302_0FBF44A3BAF4BA48"/>
I would be there. Thus we parted, and I weighed over the heavenly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation that paſſed between theſe two men, which cheered my then heavy and drooping ſpirit more than any thing I had met with for many months. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I thought the time long in going to my ſuppoſed banquet. I alſo wiſhed much for the company of theſe friendly men; their company pleaſed me much; and I thought the gentleman very kind in aſking me, a ſtranger, to a feaſt; but how ſingular did it appear to me, to have it in a chapel! When the wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for hour came I went, and happily the old man was there, who kindly ſeated me, as he belonged to the place. I was much aſtoniſhed to ſee the place filled with people, and no ſigns of eating and drinking. There were many miniſters in the company. At laſt they began by giving out hymns, and between the ſinging, the miniſters engaged in prayer: in ſhort, I knew not what to make of this ſight, having never ſeen any thing of the kind in my life before now. Some of the gueſts began to ſpeak their experience, agreeable to what I read in the Scriptures: much was ſaid by every ſpeaker of the providence of God, and his unſpeakable mercies, to
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:023353_0303_0FBF44A6D6CE0EF8"/>
each of them. This I knew in a great meaſure, and could moſt heartily join them. But when they ſpoke of a future ſtate, they ſeemed to be altogether cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of their calling and election of God; and that no one could ever ſeperate them from the love of Chriſt, or pluck them out of his hands. This filled me with utter conſternation, intermingled with admiration. I was ſo amazed as not to know what to think of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; my heart was attracted, and my affections were enlarged. I wiſhed to be as happy as them, and was perſuaded in my mind that they were different from the world <q>that lieth in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</q> 1 John v. 19. Their language and ſinging, &amp;c. did well harmonize; I was entirely overcome, and wiſhed to live and die thus. Laſtly, ſome perſons in the place produced ſome neat baſkets full of buns, which they diſtributed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; and each perſon communicated with his neighbour, and ſipped water out of different mugs, which they hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about to all who were preſent. This kind of Chriſtian fellowſhip I had never ſeen, nor ever thought of ſeeing on earth; it fully reminded me of what I had read in the holy ſcriptures, of the primitive Chriſtians, who loved each
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:023353_0304_0FBF44A842264330"/>
other and broke bread; in partaking of it, even from houſe to houſe. This entertainment (which laſted about four hours) ended in ſinging and prayer. It was the firſt ſoul feaſt I ever was preſent at. This laſt twenty-four hours pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me things, ſpiritual and temporal, ſleeping and waking, judgment and mercy, that I could not but admire the goodneſs of God, in directing the blind, blaſphemous ſinner in the path that he knew not of, even among the juſt; and inſtead of judgment he has ſhewed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and will hear and anſwer the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſupplications of every returning prodigal:
<q>
                           <l>O! to grace how great a debtor</l>
                           <l>Daily I'm conſtrain'd to be!</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>AFTER this I was reſolved to win Heaven if poſſible; and if I periſhed I thought it ſhould be at the feet of Jeſus, in praying to him for ſalvation. After having been an eye-witneſs to ſome of the happineſs which attended thoſe who feared God, I knew not how, with any propriety, to return to my lodgings, where the name of God was continually profaned, at which I felt the greateſt horror; I pauſed in my mind for ſome time, not knowing what to do; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:023353_0305_0FBF44A9D14F5DB0"/>
to hire a bed elſewhere, or go home again. At laſt fearing an evil report might ariſe, I went home, with a farewel to card-playing and vain jeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. I ſaw that time was very ſhort, eternity long, and very near; and I viewed thoſe perſons alone bleſſed who were found ready at midnight call, or when the judge of all, both quick and dead, cometh.</p>
                     <p>THE next day I took courage, and went to Holborn, to ſee my new and worthy acquaintance, the old man, Mr. C—; he, with his wife, a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious woman, were at work at ſilk weaving; they ſeemed mutually happy, and both quite glad to ſee me, and I more ſo to ſee them. I ſat down and we converſed much about ſoul matters, &amp;c. Their diſcourſe was amazingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, edifying, and pleaſant. I knew not at laſt how to leave this agreeable pair, till time ſummoned me away. As I was going they lent me a little book, entitled <q>The converſion of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.</q> It was in queſtions and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers. The poor man came over the ſea to London, to inquire after the Chriſtian's God, who, (through rich mercy) he found, and had not his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in vain. The above book was of
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:023353_0306_0FBF44AB56933C60"/>
greatuſe to me, and at that time was a means of ſtrengthening my faith; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in parting, they both invited me to call on them when I pleaſed. This delighted me, and I took care to make all the improvement from it I could; and ſo far I thanked God for ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and deſires. I prayed that the many evils I felt within might be done away, and that I might be weaned from my former carnal acquaintances. This was quickly heard and anſwered, and I was ſoon connected with thoſe whom the ſcripture calls the excellent of the earth. I heard the goſpel preached, and the thoughts of my heart and actions were laid open by the preachers, and the way of ſalvation by Chriſt alone was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently ſet forth. Thus I went on hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily for near two months; and I once heard, during this period, a reverend gentleman Mr. G. ſpeak of a man who had departed this life in full aſſurance of his going to glory I was much aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at the aſſertion; and did very deliberately inquire how he could get at this knowledge. I was anſwered fully, agreeable to what I read in the oracles of truth; and was told alſo, that if I did not experience the new birth, and the pardon of my ſins, through the
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:023353_0307_0FBF44B3B27B0CC8"/>
blood of Chriſt, before I died, I could not enter the kingdom of heaven. I knew not what to think of this report, as I thought I kept eight commandments out of ten; then my worthy interpreter told me I did not do it, nor could I; and he added, that no man ever did or could keep the commandments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offending in one point. I thought this ſounded very ſtrange, and puzzled me much for many weeks; for I thought it a hard ſaying. I then aſked my friend Mr. L—d, who was a clerk in a chapel, why the commandments of God were given, if we could not be ſaved by them? To which he replied, <q>The law is a ſchoolmaſter to bring us to Chriſt,</q> who alone could and did keep the commandments, and fufilled all their requirements for his elect people, even thoſe to whom he had given a living faith, and the ſins of thoſe choſen veſſels <hi>were already</hi> atoned for and forgiven them whilſt living<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if I did not experience the ſame before my exit, the Lord would ſay at that great day to me, "Go, ye curſed," &amp;c. &amp;c. for God would appear faithful in his judgments to the wicked, as he would be faithful in ſhewing mercy to thoſe were ordained to it before the
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:023353_0308_0FBF44B5C9681C90"/>
world was; therefore Chriſt Jeſus ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be all in all to that man's ſoul. I was much wounded at this diſcourſe, and brought into ſuch a dilemma as I never expected. I aſked him, if <hi>he</hi> was to die that moment, whether he was ſure to enter the kingdom of God? and added, "Do you <hi>know</hi> that your ſins are forgiven you?" He anſwered in the affirmative. Then confuſion, anger, and diſconted ſeized me, and I ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered much at this ſort of doctrine; it brought me to a ſtand, not knowing which to believe, whether ſalvation by works, or by faith only in Chriſt. I requeſted him to tell me how I might know when my ſins were forgiven me. He aſſured me he could not, and that none but God alone could do this. I told him it was very myſterious; but he ſaid it was really matter of fact, and quoted many portions of ſcripture immediately to the point, to which I could make no reply. He then deſired me to pray to God to ſhew me theſe things. I anſwered, that I prayed to God every day? he ſaid, <q>I perceive you are a churchman.</q> I anſwered I was. He then entreated me to beg of God to ſhew me what I was, and the true ſtate of my ſoul. I thought the prayer
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:023353_0309_0FBF44B740278D00"/>
very ſhort and odd; ſo we parted for that time. I weighed all theſe things well over, and could not help thinking how it was poſſible for a man to know that his ſins were forgiven him in this life. I wiſhed that God would reveal this ſelf ſame thing unto me. In a ſhort time after this I went to Weſtminſter chapel; the Rev. Mr. P—preached from Lam. iii. 39. It was a wonderful ſermon; he clearly ſhewed that a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man had no cauſe to complain for the puniſhments of his ſins; he evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtified the Lord in all his dealings with the ſons of men; he alſo ſhewed the juſtice of God in the eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wicked and impenitent. The diſcourſe ſeemed to me like a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged ſword cutting all ways; it afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me much joy, intermingled with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fears about my ſoul; and when it was ended, he gave it out that he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the enſuing week, to examine all thoſe who meant to attend the Lord's ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Now I thought much of my good works, and at the ſame time was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of my being a proper object to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſacrament; I was full of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation till the day of examining. However, I went to the chapel, and, though much diſtreſſed, I addreſſed the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:023353_0310_0FBF44BDDD6CB700"/>
reverend gentlemen, thinking if I was not right, he would endeavor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me of it. When I converſed with him, the firſt thing he aſked me, was, what I knew of Chriſt? I told him I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in him, and had been baptized in his name <q>Then, ſaid he, when were you brought to the knowledge of God? and how were you convinced of ſin?</q> I knew not what he meant by theſe queſtions; I told him I kept eight commandments out of ten; but that I ſometimes ſwore on board ſhip, and ſometimes when on ſhore, and broke the ſabbath. He then aſked me if I could read? I anſwered, 'Yes.'—'Then,' ſaid he, 'do you not read in the bible, he that offends in one point is guilty 'of all?' I ſaid, 'Yes.' Then he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me, that one ſin unatoned for was as ſufficient to damn a ſoul as one leak was to ſink a ſhip. Here I was ſtruck with awe; for the miniſter exhorted me much, and reminded me of the ſhortneſs of time, and the length of eternity, and that no unregenerate ſoul, or any thing unclean, could enter the kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>HE did not admit me as a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant; but recommended me to read the ſcriptures, and hear the word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:023353_0311_0FBF44BF15FEAD20"/>
not to neglect fervent prayer to God, who has promiſed to hear the ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of thoſe who ſeek him in godly ſincerity; ſo I took my leave of him, with many thanks, and reſolved to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his advice, ſo far as the Lord would condeſcend to enable me. During this time I was out of employ, nor was I likely to get a ſituation ſuitable for me, which obliged me to go once more to ſea. I engaged as ſteward of a ſhip called the Hope, Capt. Richard Strange, bound from London to Cadiz in Spain. In a ſhort time after I was on board I heard the name of God much blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, and I feared greatly, leſt I ſhould catch the horrible infection. I thought if I ſinned again, after having life and death ſet evidently before me, I ſhould certainly go to hell. My mind was uncommonly chagrined, and I mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured much at God's providential deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with me, and was diſcontented with the commandments, that I could not be ſaved by what I had done; I hated all things, and wiſhed I had never been born; confuſion ſeized me, and I wiſhed to be annihilated. One day I was ſtanding on the very edge of the ſtern of the ſhip, thinking to drown myſelf; but this ſcripture was inſtantly
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:023353_0312_0FBF44C04D803CE0"/>
impreſſed on my mind—<q>That no mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer hath eternal life abiding in him,</q> 1 John iii. 15. Then I pauſed, and thought myſelf the unhappieſt man liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Again I was convinced that the Lord was better to me than I deſerved, and I was better off in the world than many. After this I began to fear death; I fretted, mourned, and prayed, till I became a burden to others, but more ſo to myſelf. At length I concluded to beg my bread on ſhore rather than go again to ſea amongſt a people who feared not God, and I entreated the captain three different times to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge me; he would not, but each time gave me greater and greater encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to continue with him, and all on board ſhewed me very great civility: notwithſtanding all this I was unwilling to embark again. At laſt ſome of my religious friends adviſed me, by ſaying it was my lawful calling, conſequently it was my duty to obey, and that God was not confined to place, &amp;c. &amp;c. par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Mr G. S. the governor of Tothil-fields Bridewell, who pitied my caſe, and read the eleventh chapter of the Hebrews to me, with exhortations. He prayed for me, and I believed that he prevailed on my behalf, as my bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:023353_0313_0FBF44C1DC8F6E90"/>
was then greatly removed, and I found a heartfelt reſignation to the will of God. The good man gave me a pocket Bible and Alleine's Alarm to the Unconverted. We parted, and the next day I went on board again. We ſailed for Spain, and I found favour with the captain It was the fourth of the month of September when we ſailed from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; we had a delightful voyage to Cadiz, where we arrived the twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>third of the ſame month. The place is ſtrong, commands a fine proſpect, and is very rich. The Spaniſh galloons frequent that port, and ſome arrived whilſt we were there. I had many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of reading the ſcriptures. I wreſtled hard with God in fervent prayer, who had declared in his word that he would hear the groanings and deep ſighs of the poor in ſpirit. I found this verified to my utter aſtoniſhment and comfort in the following manner.</p>
                     <p>ON the morning of the 6th of October, (I pray you to attend) all that day, I thought I ſhould either ſee or hear ſomething ſupernatural. I had a ſecret impulſe on my mind of ſomething that was to take place, which drove me conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually for that time to a throne of grace. It pleaſed God to enable me to wreſtle
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:023353_0314_0FBF44C9B12905A0"/>
with him, as Jacob did: I prayed that if ſudden death were to happen, and I periſhed, it might be at Chriſt's feet.</p>
                     <p>IN the evening of the ſame day, as I was reading and meditating on the 4th chapter of the Acts, twelfth verſe, under the ſolemn apprehenſions of eternity, and reflecting on my paſt actions, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think I had lived a moral life, and that I had a proper ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I had an intereſt in the divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; but ſtill meditating on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, not knowing whether ſalvation was to be had partly for our own good deeds or ſolely as the ſovereign gift of God;—in this deep conſternation the Lord was pleaſed to break in upon my ſoul with his bright beams of heavenly light; and in an inſtant as it were, removing the veil, and letting light into a dark place, I ſaw clearly with the eye of faith the crucified Saviour bleeding on the croſs on mount Calvary: the ſcriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an unſealed book, I ſaw myſelf a condemned criminal under the law, which came with its full force to my conſcience, and when <q>the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came ſin revived, and I died.</q> I ſaw the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, loaded and bearing my reproach, ſin, and ſhame. I then clearly perceived
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:023353_0315_0FBF44CB81416940"/>
that by the deeds of the law no fleſh liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could be juſtified. I was then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that by the firſt Adam ſin came, and by the ſecond Adam (the Lord Jeſus Chriſt) all that are ſaved muſt be made alive. It was given me at that time to know what it was to be born again, John iii. 5. I ſaw the eighth chapter to the Romans, and the doctrines of God's decrees, verified agreeable to his eternal, everlaſting, and unchangeable purpoſes. The word of God was ſweet to my taſte, yea ſweeter than honey and the honeycomb. Chriſt was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to my ſoul as the chiefeſt among ten thouſand. Theſe heavenly moments were really as life to the dead, and what John calls an earneſt of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit<note n="*" place="bottom">John xvi. 13, 14, &amp;c.</note>. This was indeed unſpeakable, and I firmly believe undeniable by many. Now every leading providential cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that happened to me, from the day I was taken from my parents to that hour, was then in my view, as if it had but juſt then occurred. I was ſenſible of the inviſible hand of God, which guided and protected me when in truth I knew it not: ſtill the Lord purſued me although I ſlighted and diſregarded it; this mercy melted
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:023353_0316_0FBF44CD1BE196A8"/>
me down. When I conſidered my poor wretched ſtate I wept, ſeeing what a great debtor I was to ſovereign free grace. Now the Ethiopian was willing to be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt, the ſinner's only ſurety, and alſo to rely on none other perſon or thing for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Self was obnoxious, and good works he had none, for it is God that worketh in us both to will and to do. Oh! the amazing things of that hour can never be told—it was joy in the Holy Ghoſt! I felt an aſtoniſhing change; the burden of ſin, the gaping jaws of hell, and the fears of death, that weighed me down before, now loſt their horror; indeed I thought death would now be the beſt earthly friend I ever had. Such were my grief and joy as I believe are ſeldom expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced. I was bathed in tears, and ſaid, What am I that God ſhould look thus look on me the vileſt of ſinners? I felt a deep concern for my mother and friends, which occaſioned me to pray with freſh ardour; and in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſs of thought, I viewed the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted people of the world in a very awful ſtate, being without God and without hope.</p>
                     <p>IT pleaſed God to pour out on me the
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:023353_0317_0FBF44CF762A0338"/>
ſpirit of prayer and the grace of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, ſo that in loud acclamations I was enabled to praiſe and glorify his moſt holy name. When I got out of the cabin, and told ſome of the people what th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Lord had done for me, alas! who could underſtand me or believe my report!—None but to whom the arm of the Lord was revealed. I became a barbarian to them in talking of the love of Chriſt: his name was to me as ointment poured forth: indeed it was ſweet to my ſoul, but to them a rock of offence I thought my caſe ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and every hour a day until I came to London, for I much longed to be with ſome to whom I could tell of the wonders of God's love towards me, and join in prayer to him whom my ſoul loved and thirſted after. I had uncommon commotions within, ſuch as few can tell aught about. Now the bible was my only companion and comfort; I prized it much, with many thanks to God that I could read it for myſelf, and was not left to be toſſed about or led by man's devices and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions The worth of a ſoul cannot be told—May the Lord give the reader an underſtanding in this. Whenever I looked in the bible I ſaw things new,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:023353_0318_0FBF44D5C0F335B8"/>
and many texts were immediately applied to me with great comfort, for I knew that to me was the word of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſent. Sure I was that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which indited the word opened my heart to receive the truth of it as it is in Jeſus—that the ſame Spirit enabled me to act faith upon the promiſes that were precious to me, and enabled me to believe to the ſalvation of my ſoul. By free grace I was perſuaded that I had a part in the firſt reſurrection, and was enlightened with the "light of the living," Job xxxiii. 30. I wiſhed for a man of God with whom I might converſe: my ſoul was like the chariots of Aminadab, Canticles vi. 12 Theſe among others, were the precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that were ſo powerfully applied to me. <q>All things whatſoever ye ſhall aſk in prayer, believing, ye ſhall receive,</q> Mat. xxi. 22. <q>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,</q> John xiv. 27. I ſaw the bleſſed Redeemer to be the fountain of life, and the well of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. I experienced him to be all in all; he had brought me by a way that I knew not, and he had made crooked paths ſtraight. Then in his name I ſet up my Ebenezer, ſaying, Hitherto be
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:023353_0319_0FBF44D781140428"/>
hath helped me: and could ſay to the ſinners about me, Behold what a Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iour I have! Thus I was, by the teaching of that all-glorious Deity, the great One in Three, and Three in One, confirmed in the truths of the bible, thoſe oracles of everlaſting truth, on which every ſoul living muſt ſtand or fall eternally, agreeable to Acts iv. 12. <q>Neither is there ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any other, for there is none other name under heaven given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men whereby we muſt be ſaved, but only Chriſt Jeſus.</q> May God give the reader a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in theſe facts! <q>To him that believeth, all things are poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but to them that are unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing is pure,</q> Titus i. 15.</p>
                     <p>DURING this period we remained at Cadiz until our ſhip got laden. We ſailed about the fourth of November; and, having a good paſſage, we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in London the month following, to my comfort, with heartfelt grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to God for his rich and unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mercies.</p>
                     <p>ON my return I had but one text which puzzled me, or that the devil endeavoured to buffet me with, viz. Rom. xi. 6. and, as I had heard of
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:023353_0320_0FBF44D9017978D0"/>
the Rev. Mr. Romaine, and his great knowledge in the ſcriptures, I wiſhed much to hear him preach. One day I went to Blackfriars church, and, to my great ſatisfaction and ſurpriſe, he preached from that very text. He ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clearly ſhewed the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween human works and free election which is according to God's ſovereign will and pleaſure, Theſe glad tidings ſet me entirely at liberty, and I went out of the church rejoicing, ſeeing my ſpots were thoſe of God's Children. I went to Weſtminſter Chapel, and ſaw ſome of my old friends, who were glad when they perceived the wonderful change that the Lord had wrought in me, particularly. Mr. G—S—, my worthy acquaintance, who was a man of a choice ſpirit, and had great zeal for the Lord's ſervice. I enjoyed his correſpondence till he died in the year 1784 I was again examined at that ſame chapel, and was received into church fellowſhip amongſt them. I rejoiced in ſpirit, making melody in my heart to the God of all my mercies. Now my whole wiſh was to be diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to be with Chriſt—but, alas! I muſt wait mine appointed time.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WHEN our ſhip was got ready for ſea again, I was entreated by the captain to go in her once more; but as I felt myſelf now as happy as I could wiſh to be in this life, I for ſome time refuſed; however, the advice of my friends at laſt prevailed; and, in full reſignation to the will of God, I again embarked for Cadiz; in March 1775. We had a very good paſſage, without any material accident, until we arrived off the Bay of Cadiz? when one Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, juſt as we were going into the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the ſhip ſtruck againſt a rock and knocked off a garboard plank, which is the next to the keel. In an inſtant all hands were in the greateſt confuſion, and began with loud cries to call on God to have mercy on them. Although I could not ſwim, and ſaw no way of eſcaping death, I felt no
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:023353_0327_0FBF44EFB5C68678"/>
dread in my then ſituation, having no deſire to live. I even rejoiced in ſpirit, thinking this death would be ſudden glory. But the fulneſs of time was not yet come. The people near to me were much aſtoniſhed in ſeeing me thus calm and reſigned; but I told them of the peace of God, which through ſovereign grace I enjoyed, and theſe words were that inſtant in my mind:
<q>
                           <l>Chriſt is my pilot wiſe, my compaſs is his word:</l>
                           <l>My ſoul each ſtorm defies, while <hi>I</hi> have ſuch:</l>
                           <l>Lord.</l>
                           <l>I truſt his faithfulneſs and power,</l>
                           <l>To ſave me in the trying hour.</l>
                           <l>Though rocks and quickſands deep through all my paſſage lie.</l>
                           <l>Yet Chriſt ſhall ſafely keep and guide me with 'his eye,</l>
                           <l>How can I ſink with ſuch a prop,</l>
                           <l>That bears the world and all things up.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>AT this time there were many large Spaniſh flukers or paſſage-veſſels full of people croſſing the channel; who ſeeing our condition, a number of them came alongſide of us. As many hands as could be employed began to work; ſome at our three pumps, and the reſt unloading the ſhip as faſt as poſſible. There being only a ſingle rock called the Porpus on which we ſtruck; we ſoon
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:023353_0328_0FBF44F1210F5548"/>
got off it, and providentially it was then high water, we therefore run the ſhip aſhore at the neareſt place to keep her from ſinking. After many tides, with a great deal of care and induſtry, we got her repaired again. When we had diſpatched our buſineſs at Cadiz, we went to Gibraltar, and from thence to Malaga, a very pleaſant and rich city, where there is one of the fineſt cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals I had ever ſeen. It had been above fifty years in building, as I heard, though it was not then quite finiſhed; great parts of the inſide, however, was completed and highly decorated with the richeſt marble columns and many ſuperb paintings; it was lighted occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally by an amazing number of wax tapers of different ſizes, ſome of which were as thick as a man's thigh; theſe, however, were only uſed on ſome of their grand feſtivals.</p>
                     <p>I was very much ſhocked at the cuſtom of bull-baiting, and other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions which prevailed here on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day evenings, to the great ſcandal of Chriſtianity and morals. I uſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my abhorrence of it to a prieſt whom I met with. I had frequent conteſts about religion with the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend father, in which he took great
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:023353_0329_0FBF44F2BB3E0FB8"/>
pains to make a proſelyte of me to his church; and I no leſs to convert him to mine. On theſe occaſions I uſed to produce my Bible, and ſhew him in what points his church erred. He then ſaid he had been in England, and that every perſon there read the Bible, which was very wrong; but I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that Chriſt deſired us to ſearch the Scriptures. In his zeal for my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, he ſolicited me to go to one of the univerſities in Spain, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that I ſhould have my educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion free; and told me, if I got my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf made a prieſt, I might in time become even pope; and that Pope Benedict was a black man. As I was ever deſirous of learning, I pauſed for ſome time upon this temptation; and thought by being crafty I might catch ſome with guile; but I began to think that it would be only hypocriſy in me to embrace his offer, as I could not in con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cience conform to the opinions of his church. I was therefore enabled to regard the word of God, which ſays, "Come out from amongſt them," and refuſed Father Vincent's offer. So we parted without conviction on either ſide.</p>
                     <p>HAVING taken at this place ſome fine
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:023353_0330_0FBF44F3FA476348"/>
wines, fruits, and money, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to Cadiz, where we took about two ton's more of money, &amp;c. and then ſailed for England in the month of June. When we were about the north latitude 42, we had contrary wind for ſeveral days and the ſhip did not make in that time above ſix or ſeven miles ſtrait courſe. This made the captain exceeding fretful and peeviſh: and I was very ſorry to hear God's moſt holy name often blaſphemed by him. One day as he was in that impious mood, a young gentleman on board who was a paſſenger, reproached him, and ſaid he acted wrong; for we ought to be thankful to God for all things, as we were not in want of any thing on board; and though the wind was contrary for us, yet it was fair for ſome others, who, perhaps, ſtood in more need of it than we. I immediately ſeconded this young gentleman with ſome bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſaid we had not the leaſt cauſe to murmur, for that the Lord was better to us than we deſerved, and that he had done all things well. I expected that the captain would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry angry with me for ſpeaking, but he replied not a word. However, before that time on the following day, being
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:023353_0331_0FBF44F9434284B8"/>
the 21ſt of June, much to our great joy and aſtoniſhment, we ſaw the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential hand of our benign Creator, whoſe ways with his blind creatures are paſt finding out. The preceding night I dreamed that I ſaw a boat im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately off the ſtarboard main ſhrouds; and exactly at half paſt one o'clock, the following day at noon, while I was below, juſt as we had dined in the cabin, the man at the helm cried out, A boat! which brought my dream that inſtant into my mind, I was the firſt man that jumped on the deck; and looking from the ſhrouds onward, according to my dream, I deſcried a little boat at ſome diſtance; but as the waves were high, it was as much as we could do ſometimes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern her; we however ſtopped the ſhips way, and the boat, which was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſmall, came along ſide with eleven mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable men, whom we took on board immediately. To all human appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, theſe people muſt have periſhed in the courſe of one hour or leſs, the boat being ſmall, it barely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them. When we took them up they were half drowned, and had no victuals, compaſs, water, or any other neceſſary whatſoever, and had only one
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:023353_0332_0FBF44FAC8490860"/>
bit of an oar to ſteer with, and that right before the wind; ſo that they were obliged to truſt entirely to the mercy of the waves. As ſoon as we got them all on board, they bowed themſelves on their knees, and, with hands and voices lifted up to heaven, thanked God for their deliverance; and I truſt that my prayers were not wanting amongſt them at the ſame time. This mercy of the Lord quite melted me, and I recollected his words which I ſaw thus verified in the 107th Pſalm, <q>O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever. Hungry and thirſty, their ſouls fainted in them. They cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their diſtreſſes. And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. O that men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs and for his wonderful works to the children of men! For he ſatisfieth the longing ſoul, and filleth the hungry ſoul with goodneſs.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Such as fit in darkneſs and in the ſhadow of death:</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he ſaved them out
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:023353_0333_0FBF4502C97D0038"/>
of their diſtreſſes. They that go down to the ſea in ſhips; that do bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in great waters: theſe ſee the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep. Whoſo is wife and will obſerve theſe things, even they ſhall underſtand the loving kindneſs of the Lord.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The poor diſtreſſed captain ſaid, <q>that the Lord is good; for, ſeeing that I am not fit to die, he therefore gave me a ſpace of time to repent.</q> I was very glad to hear this expreſſion, and took an opportunity when conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of talking to him on the providence of God. They told us they were Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe, and were in a brig loaded with corn, which ſhifted that morning at five o'clock, owing to which the veſſel ſunk that inſtant with two of the crew; and how theſe eleven got into the boat (which was laſhed to the deck) not one of them could tell. We provided them with every neceſſary, and brought them all ſafe to London: and I hope the Lord gave them repentance unto life eternal.</p>
                     <p>I was happy once more amongſt my friends and brethren, till November, when my old friend, the celebrated Doctor Irving, bought a remarkable
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:023353_0334_0FBF45040877A9E0"/>
fine ſloop, about 150 tons. He had a mind for a new adventure in cultivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a plantation at Jamaica, and the Muſquito Shore; aſked me to go with him, and ſaid that he would truſt me with his eſtate in preference to any one. By the advice, therefore, of my friends, I accepted of the offer, knowing that the harveſt was fully ripe in thoſe parts, and hoped to be an inſtrument under God, of bringing ſome poor ſinner to my well beloved maſter, Jeſus Chriſt. Before I embarked, I found with the Doctor four Muſquito Indians, who were chiefs in their own country, and were brought here by ſome Engliſh tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for ſome ſelfiſh ends. One of them was the Muſquito king's ſon; a youth of about eighteen years of age; and whilſt he was here he was baptized by the name of George. They were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back at the government's expenſe, after having been in England about twelve months, during which they learned to ſpeak pretty good Engliſh. When I came to talk to them about eightdays before we ſailed, I was very much mortified in finding that they had not frequented any churches ſince they were here, to be baptized, nor was any attention paid to their morals. I
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:023353_0335_0FBF45054EB41190"/>
was very ſorry for this mock Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and had juſt an opportunity to take ſome of them once to church before we ſailed. We embarked in the month of November 1776, on board of the ſloop Morning Star, Captain David Miller, and ſailed for Jamaica. In our paſſage, I took all the pains that I could to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Indian prince in the doctrines of Chriſtianity, of which he was entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant; and, to my great joy, he was quite attentive, and received with gladneſs the truths that the Lord enabled me to ſet forth to him. I taught him in the compaſs of eleven days all the letters, and he could put even two or three of them together and ſpell them. I had Fox's Martyrology with cuts, and he uſed to be very fond of looking into it, and would aſk many queſtions about the papal cruelties he ſaw depict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, which I explained to him. I made ſuch progreſs with this youth, eſpecially in religion, that when I uſed to go to bed at different hours of the night, if he was in his bed, he would get up on purpoſe to go to prayer with me, without any other clothes than his ſhirt; and before he would eat any of his meals among the gentlemen in the cabin, he would firſt come to me to
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:023353_0336_0FBF4506E3B6D668"/>
pray as he called it. I was well pleaſed at this, and took great delight in him, and uſed much ſupplication to God for his converſion. I was in full hope of ſeeing da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ly every appearance of that change which I could wiſh; not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the devices of ſatan, who had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his emiſſaries to ſow his tares as faſt as I ſowed the good ſeed, and pull down as faſt as I built up. Thus we went on nearly four fifths of our paſſage, when ſatan at laſt got the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand. Some of his meſſengers, ſeeing this poor heathen much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in piety, began to aſk him whether I had converted him to Chriſtianity, laughed and made their jeſt at him, for which I rebuked them as much as I could; but this treatment cauſed the prince to halt between two opinions. Some of the true ſons of Belial, who did not believe that there was any hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, told him never to fear the devil, for there was none exiſting; and if ever he came to the prince, they deſired he might be ſent to them. Thus they teazed the poor innocent youth, ſo that he would not learn his book any more! He would not drink nor carouſe with theſe ungodly actors, nor would he be with me, even at prayers. This grieved
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:023353_0337_0FBF450DE94575D0"/>
me very much. I endeavored to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him as well as I could, but he would not come; and entreated him very much to tell me his reaſons for act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus At laſt he aſked me, <q>How comes it that all the white men on board who can read and write, and obſerve the ſun, and know all things, yet ſwear, lie, and get drunk, only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting yourſelf?</q> I anſwered him, the reaſon was, that they did not fear God; and that if any one of them died ſo they could not go to, or be happy with God. He replied, that if theſe perſons went to hell he would go to hell too. I was ſorry to hear this; and, as he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had the tooth-ach, and alſo ſome other perſons in the ſhip at the ſame time. I aſked him if their tooth-ach made his eaſy: he ſaid, No. Then I told him if he and theſe people went to hell together, their pains would not make his any lighter. This anſwer had great weight with him: it depreſſed his ſpirits much; and he became ever after, during the paſſage, fond of being alone. When we were in the latitude of Martinico, and near making the land, one morning we had a briſk gale of wind, and, carrying too much ſail, the main-maſt went over the ſide.
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:023353_0338_0FBF4510F33FF308"/>
Many people were then all about the deck, and the yards, maſts, and rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging came tumbling all about us, yet there was not one of us in the leaſt hurt, although ſome were within a hairs' breadth of being killed: and, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, I ſaw two men who, by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential hand of God, were moſt miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly preſerved from being ſmaſhed to pieces. On the fifth of January we made Antigua and Montſerrat, and ran along the reſt of the iſlands: and on the fourteenth we arrived at Jamaica. One Sunday while we were there I took the Muſquito Prince George to Church, where he ſaw the ſacrament adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. When we came out we ſaw all kinds of people, almoſt from the church door for the ſpace of half a mile down to the waterſide, buying and ſelling all kinds of commodities: and theſe acts afforded me great matter of exhortation to this youth, who was much aſtoniſhed. Our veſſel being ready to ſail for the Muſquito ſhore, I went with the Doctor on board a Guinea-man, to purchaſe ſome ſlaves to carry with us, and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate a plantation; and I choſe them all my own countrymen. On the 12th of February we ſailed from Jamaica, and on the eighteenth arrived at the
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:023353_0339_0FBF451201D20C98"/>
Muſquito ſhore, at a place called Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peupy. All our Indian gueſts now, after I had admoniſhed them and a few caſes of liquor given them by the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, took an affectionate leave of us, and went aſhore, where they were met by the Muſquito king, and we never ſaw one of them afterwards. We then ſailed to the ſouthward of the ſhore, to a place called Cape Gracias a Dios, where there was a large lagoon or lake, which received the emptying of two or three very fine large rivers, and abounded much in fiſh and land tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe. Some of the native Indians came on board of us here; and we uſed them well, and told them we were come to dwell amongſt them, which they ſeemed pleaſed at. So the Doctor and I, with ſome others, went with them aſhore; and they took us to different places to view the land, in order to chooſe a place to make a plantation of. We fixed on a ſpot near a river's bank, in a rich ſoil; and, having got our neceſſaries out of the ſloop, we began to clear away the woods, and plant different kinds of vegetables, which had a quick growth. While we were emyloyed in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, our veſſel went north ward to Black River to trade. While ſhe was there,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:023353_0340_0FBF4513CAF607C0"/>
a Spaniſh guarda coſta met with and took her. This proved very hurtful, and a great embarraſſment to us. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we went on with the culture of the land. We uſed to make fires every night all around us, to keep off wild beaſts, which, as ſoon as it was dark, ſet up a moſt hideous roaring. Our habitation being far up in the woods, we frequently ſaw different kinds of animals; but none of them ever hurt us, except poiſonous ſnakes, the bite of which the Doctor uſed to cure by giving to the patient as ſoon as poſſible, about half a tumbler of ſtrong rum, with a good deal of Cayenne pepper in it. In this manner he cured two natives and one of his own ſlaves. The indians were exceedingly fond of the Doctor, and they had good reaſon for it; for I believe they never had ſuch an uſeful man amongſt them. They came from all quarters to our dwelling; and ſome <hi>woolwow</hi> or flat-headed indians, who liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fifty or ſixty miles above our river, &amp; this ſide of the South Sea, brought us a good deal of ſilver in exchange for our goods. The principal articles we could get from our neighbouring indians, were turtle oil, and ſhells, little ſilk graſs, and ſome proviſions; but they would
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:023353_0341_0FBF451BA0D03908"/>
not work at any thing for us, except fiſhing; and a few times they aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cut ſome trees down, in order to build us houſes; which they did exactly like the Africans, by the joint labour of men, women, and children. I do not recollect, any of them to have had more than two wives. Theſe always accompanied their huſbands when they came to our dwelling, and then they generally carried whatever they brought to us, and always ſquatted down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their huſbands. Whenever we gave them any thing to eat, the men and their wives eat ſeperate. I never ſaw the leaſt ſign of incontinence amongſt them. The women are ornamented with beads, and fond of painting themſelves; the men alſo paint. even to exceſs, both their faces and ſhirts: their favourite colour is red. The women generally cultivate the ground, and the men are all fiſhermen and canoe makers. Upon the whole, I never met any nation that were ſo ſimple in their manners as theſe people, or had ſo little ornament in their houſes. Neither had they, as I ever could learn, one word expreſſive of an oath. The worſt word I ever heard amongſt them when they were quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, was one that they had got from the
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:023353_0342_0FBF451D0DE65598"/>
Engliſh, which was 'you raſcal. 'I never ſaw any mode of worſhip among them; but in this they were not worſe than their European brethren or neighbours, for I am ſorry to ſay that there was not one white perſon in our dwelling, nor any were elſe, that I ſaw, in different places I was at on the ſhore, that was better or more pious than thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enlightened indians; but they either worked or ſlept on Sundays: and, to my ſorrow, working was too much Sunday's employment with ourſelves, ſo much ſo, that in ſome length of time we really did not know one day from another. This mode of living laid the foundation of my decamping at laſt. The natives are well made and warlike; and they particularly boaſt of having never been conquered by the Spaniards. They are great drinkers of ſtrong liquors when they can get them. We uſed to diſtil rum from pine apples, which were very plentiful here, and then we could not get them away from our place.' Yet they ſeemed to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, in point of honeſty, above any other nation I was ever amongſt. The country being hot, we lived under an open ſhed, where we had all kinds of goods, without a door or a lock to any
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:023353_0343_0FBF451E0FAB2F48"/>
article; yet we ſlept in ſafety, and never loſt any thing, or were diſturbed. This ſurpriſed us a good deal; and the Doctor, myſelf, and others, uſed to ſay if we were to lie in that manner in Europe we ſhould have our throats cut the firſt night. The indian governor goes once in a certain time all about the province or diſtrict, and has a number of men with him as attendants and aſſiſtants. He ſettles all the differences among the people, like the judge here, and is treated with very great reſpect He took care to give us timely notice before he came to our habitation, by ſending his ſtick as a token, for rum, ſugar, and gunpowder, which we did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe ſending; and at the ſame time we made the utmoſt preparation to receive his honour and his train. When he came with his tribe, and all our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring chieftians, we expected to find him a grave reverend judge, ſolid and ſagacious; but inſtead of that, before he and his gang came in ſight, we heard them very clamorous; and they even had plundered ſome of our good neighbouring indians, having intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated themſelves with our liquor. When they arrived we did not know what to make of our new gueſts, and would
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:023353_0344_0FBF451F85CCC590"/>
gladly have diſpenſed with the honor of their company However, having no alternative, we feaſted them plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully all the day till the evening; when the governor, getting quite drunk, grew very unruly, and ſtruck one of our moſt friendly chiefs who was our neareſt neighbour, and alſo took his gold-laced hat from him. At this a great commotion taken place; and the Doctor interferred to make peace, as we could all underſtand one another, but to no purpoſe; and at laſt they became ſo outrageous that the Doctor, fearing he might get into trouble, left the houſe, and made the beſt of his way to the neareſt wood, leaving me to do as well as I could among them. I was ſo enraged with the governor, that I could have wiſhed to have ſeen him tied faſt to a tree and flogged for his behaviour; but I had not people enough to cope with his party. I therefore thought of a ſtratagem to appeaſe the riot. Recollecting a paſſage I had read in the life of Columbus, when he was amongſt the Indians in Mexico or Peru, where on ſome occaſion, he frightened them, by telling them of certain events in the Heavens, I had recourſe to the ſame expedient; and it ſucceeded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:023353_0345_0FBF452643D1D820"/>
my moſt ſanguine expectations. When I had formed my determination, I went in the midſt of them; and, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of the Governor, I pointed up to the Heaven I menanced him and the reſt: I told them God lived there, and that he was angry with them, and they muſt not quarrel ſo; that they were all brothers, and if they did not leave off, and go away quietly, I would take the book (point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Bible) read, and <hi>tell</hi> God to make them dead. This operated on them like magic.—The clamour im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ceaſed, and I gave them ſome rum and a few other things; after which they went away peaceably; and the Governor afterwards gave our neighbour, who was called Captain Plaſmahy, his hat again. When the Doctor returned, he was exceedingly glad at my ſucceſs in thus getting rid of our troubleſome gueſts. The Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quito people within our vicinity, out of reſpect to the Doctor, myſelf, and his people, made entertainments of the grand kind, called in their tongue <hi>tourrie</hi> or <hi>dryekbo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="142" facs="unknown:023353_0346_0FBF40E34BAB1750"/>
apples roaſted, and caſades chewed or beaten in mortars; which, after lying ſometime, ferments, and becomes ſo ſtrong as to intoxicate, when drank in any quantity. We had timely notice given to us of the entertainment. A white family, within five miles of us, told us how the drink was made, and I and two others went before the time to the village, where the mirth was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be held, and there we ſaw the whole art of making the drink, and alſo the kind of animals that were to be eaten there. I cannot ſay the ſight of either the drink or the meat were enticing to me. They had ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of pine apples roaſting, which they ſqueezed dirt and all, into a canoe they had there for the purpoſe. The caſade drink was in beef barrels, and other veſſels, and looked exactly like hog-waſh. Men, women and children, were thus employed in roaſting the pine apples, and ſqueezing them with their hands. For food they had many land torpins or tortoiſes, ſome dried turtle, and three large alligators alive, and tied faſt to the trees. I aſked the people what they were going to do with theſe alligators; and I was told they were to be eaten. I was much ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:023353_0347_0FBF40E585E2D218"/>
at this, and went home, not a little diſguſted at the preparations. When the day of the feaſt was come, we took ſome rum with us, and went to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed place, where we found a great aſſemblage of theſe people, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us very kindly The mirth had begun before we came; and they were dancing with muſic: and the muſical inſtruments were nearly the ſame as thoſe of any other ſable people; but, as I thought, much leſs melodious than any other nation I ever knew. They had many curious geſtures in dancing, and a variety of motions and poſtures of their bodies, which to me were in no wiſe attracting. The males danced by themſelves, and the females alſo by themſelves, as with us. The Doctor ſhewed his people the example, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately joining the women's party, though not by their choice. On per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the women diſguſted, he joined the males. At night there were great illuminations, by ſetting fire to many pine trees, while the drickbot went round merrily by calabaſhes or gourds: but the liquor might more juſtly be called eating than drinking One Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the oldeſt father in the vicinity, was dreſſed in a ſtrange and terrifying
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:023353_0348_0FBF40E7862A9148"/>
form. Around his body were ſkins adorned with different kinds of feathers, and he had on his head a very large and high head-piece, in the form of a gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadier's cap, with prickles like a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupine: and he made a certain noiſe which reſembled the cry of an alligator. Our people ſkipped amongſt them out of complaiſance, though ſome could not drink of their tourrie; but our rum met with cuſtomers enough, and was ſoon gone. The alligators were killed and ſome of them roaſted. Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of roaſting is by digging a hole in the earth, and filling it with wood, which they burn to coal, and then they lay ſticks acroſs, on which they ſet the meat. I had a raw piece of the alligator in my hand: it was very rich: I thought it looked like freſh ſalmon, and it had a moſt fragrant ſmell, but I could not eat any of it. This merry-making at laſt ended without the leaſt diſcord in any perſon in the company, although it was made up of different nations and complexions.</p>
                     <p>The rainy ſeaſon came on here about the latter end of May, which continued till Auguſt very heavily; ſo that the rivers were overflowed, and our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions then in the ground <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

away. I thought this was in ſome meaſure a judgment upon us for work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Sundays, and it hurt my mind very much. I often wiſhed to leave this place and ſail for Europe; for our mode of procedure and living in this heatheniſh form was very irk ſome to me. The word of God ſaith, <q>What does it avail a man if he gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</q> This was much and heavily impreſſed on my mind; and though I did not know how to ſpeak to the Doctor for my diſcharge, it was diſagreeable for me to ſtay any longer. But about the middle of June I took courage enough to aſk him for it. He was very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at firſt to grant my requeſt; but I gave him ſo many reaſons fot it, that at laſt he conſented to my going, and gave me the following certificate of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</p>

                     <p>THOUGH I was much attached to the Doctor, I was happy when he conſented. I got every thing ready for my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and hired ſome Indians, with a large canoe, to carry me off. All my poor countrymen, the ſlaves, when they heard of my leaving them, were very ſorry, as I had always treated them with care and affection, and did every thing I could to comfort the poor creatures, and render their condition eaſy. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken leave of my old friends and companions, on the 18th of June, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the Doctor, I left that ſpot of the world, and went ſouthward above twenty miles along the river. There I found a ſloop, the captain of which told me he was going to Jamaica. Having agreed for my paſſage with him and one of the owners, who was alſo on board, named Hughes, the Doctor and I parted, not without ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding tears on both ſides. The veſſel then ſailed along the river till night, when ſhe ſtopped in a lagoon within the ſame river. During the night a ſchooner
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:023353_0351_0FBF40F537B5CF70"/>
belonging to the ſame owners came in, and, as ſhe was in want of hands, Hughes, the owner of the ſloop aſked me to go in the ſchooner as a ſailor, and ſaid he would give me wages. I thanked him; but I ſaid I wanted to go to Jamaica. He then immediately changed his tone, and ſwore, and abuſed me very much, and aſked how I came to be freed. I told him, and ſaid that I came into that vicinity with Dr. Irving; whom he had ſeen that day. This account was of no uſe; he ſtill ſwore exceedingly at me, and curſed the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a fool that ſold me my freedom, and the Doctor for another in letting me go from him. Then he deſired me to go in the ſchooner, or elſe I ſhould not go out of the ſloop as a free-man. I ſaid this was very hard, and begged to be put on ſhore again; but he ſwore that I ſhould not. I ſaid I had been twice amongſt the Turks, yet had never ſeen any ſuch uſage with them, and much leſs could I have expected any thing of this kind among the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. This incenſed him exceedingly; and, with a volley of oaths and impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, he replied, <q>Chriſtians! damn you, you are one of St. Paul's men; but by G—, except you have St. Paul's or St. Peter's faith, and walk
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:023353_0352_0FBF40F825C10618"/>
upon the water to the ſhore, you ſhall not go out of the veſſel;</q> which I now learnt was going amongſt the Spaniards towards Carthagena, where he ſwore he would ſell me. I ſimply aſked him what right he had to ſell me? but, without another word, he made ſome of his people tie ropes round each of my ancles, and alſo to each wriſt, and another rope round my body, and hoiſted me up without letting my feet touch or reſt upon any thing. Thus I hung, without any crime committed, and without judge or jury; merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was a free man, and could not by the law get any redreſs from a white perſon in thoſe parts of the world. I was in great pain from my ſituation, and cried and begged very hard for ſome mercy; but all in vain. My tyrant, in a great rage brought a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet out of the cabin and loaded it before me and the crew, and ſwore that he would ſhoot me if I cried any more. I had now no alternative; I therefore remained ſilent, ſeeing not one white man on board who ſaid a word on my behalf. I hung in that manner from between ten and eleven o'clock at night till about one in the morning; when, finding my cruel abuſer faſt aſleep, I

begged ſome of his ſlaves to ſlack the rope that was round my body, that my feet might reſt on ſomething. This they did at the riſk of being cruelly uſed by their maſter, who beat ſome of them ſeverely at firſt for not tying me when he commanded them. Whilſt I remained in this condition, till be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween five and ſix o'clock next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I truſt I prayed to God to forgive this blaſphemer who cared not what he did, but when he got up out of his ſleep in the morning was of the very ſame temper and diſpoſition as when he left me at night. When they got up the anchor, and the veſſel was get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting under way, I once more cried and begged to be releaſed; and now, being fortunately in the way of their hoiſting the ſails, they releaſed me. When I was let down, I ſpoke to one Mr. Cox, a carpenter, whom I knew on board, on the impropriety of this conduct. He alſo knew the doctor, and the good opinion he ever had of me. This man then went to the captain, and told him not to carry me away in that manner; that I was the doctor's ſteward, who regarded me very highly, and would reſent this uſage when he ſhould come to know it. On which he deſired a
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:023353_0354_0FBF40FBD0E1C318"/>
young man to put me aſhore in a ſmall canoe I brought with me. This ſound gladdened my heart, and I got haſtily into the canoe and ſet off, whilſt my tyrant was down in the cabin; but he ſoon ſpied me out, when I was not above thirty or forty yards from the veſſel, and running upon the deck with a loaded muſquet in his hand, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it at me, and ſwore heavily and dreadfully, that he would ſhoot me that inſtant, if I did not come back on board. As I knew the wretch would have done as he ſaid, without heſitation I put back to the veſſel again; but, as the good Lord would have it, juſt as I was alongſide he was abuſing the captain for letting me go from the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; which the captain returned, and both of them ſoon got into a very great heat. The young man that was with me now got out of the canoe; the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel was ſailing on faſt with a ſmooth ſea: and I then thought it was neck or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo at that inſtant I ſet off again, for my life, in the canoe, towards the ſhore; and fortunately the confuſion was ſo great amongſt them on board, that I got out of the muſquet ſhot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed, while the veſſel ſailed on with a fair wind a different way; ſo that
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:023353_0355_0FBF40FD434F1F48"/>
they could not overtake me without tacking: but even before that could be done I ſhould have been on ſhore, which I ſoon reached, with many thanks to God for this unexpected de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. I then went and told the other owner, who lived near that ſhore (with whom I had agreed for my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage) of the uſage I had met with. He was very much aſtoniſhed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſorry for it. After treating me with kindneſs, he gave me ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, and three heads of roaſted Indian corn, for a voyage of about 18 miles ſouth to look for another veſſel. He then directed me to an Indian chief of a diſtrict, who was alſo the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quito admiral, and had once been at our dwelling; after which I ſet off with the canoe acroſs a large lagoon alone (for I could not get any one to aſſiſt me), though I was much jaded, and had pains in my bowels, by means of the rope I had hung by the night before. I was therefore at different times unable to manage the canoe, for the paddling was very laborious. However, a little before dark I got to my deſtined place, where ſome of the Indians knew me, and received me kindly. I aſked for the admiral; and
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:023353_0356_0FBF4107400ABE00"/>
they conducted me to his dwelling. He was glad to ſee me, and refreſhed me with ſuch things as the place afforded; and I had a hammock to ſleep in. They acted towards me more like Chriſtians than thoſe whites I was amongſt the laſt night, though they had been baptiſed. I told the admiral I wanted to go to the next port to get a veſſel to carry me to Jamaica; and requeſted him to ſend the canoe back which I then had, for which I was to pay him. He agreed with me, and ſent five able Indians with a large canoe to carry my things to my intended place, about fifty miles; and we ſet off the next morning. When we got out of the lagoon and went along ſhore, the ſea was ſo high that the canoe was oftentimes very near being filled with water We were obliged to go aſhore and drag acroſs different necks of land; we were alſo two nights in the ſwamps, which ſwarmed with muſquito flies, and they proved troubleſome to us. This tireſome journey of land and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ended, however, on the third day, to my great joy; and I got on board of a ſloop commanded by one Captain Jenning. She was then partly loaded, and he told me he was expecting daily
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:023353_0357_0FBF410944BC99C8"/>
to ſail for Jamaica; and having agreed with me to work my paſſage, I went to work accordingly. I was not many days on board before we ſailed; but to my ſorrow and diſappointment, though uſed to ſuch tricks, we went to the ſouthward along the Muſquito ſhore, inſtead of ſteering for Jamaica. I was compelled to aſſiſt in cutting a great deal of mahogany wood on the ſhore as we coaſted along it, and load the veſſel with it, before ſhe ſailed. This fretted me much; but, as I did not know how to help myſelf among theſe deceivers, I thought patience was the only remedy I had left, and even that was forced. There was much hard work and little victuals on board; except by good luck we happened to catch turtles On this coaſt there was alſo a particular kind of fiſh called manatee, which is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent eating, and the fleſh is more like beef than fiſh; the ſcales are as large as a ſhilling, and the ſkin thicker than I ever ſaw that of any other fiſh. Within the brackiſh waters along ſhore there were likewiſe vaſt numbers of alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators, which made the fiſh ſcarce. I was on board this ſloop ſixteen days, during which, in our coaſting, we came to another place, where there was a
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:023353_0358_0FBF410AC83C8540"/>
ſmaller ſloop called the Indian Queen, commanded by one John Baker. He alſo was an Engliſhman, and had been a long time along the ſhore trading for turtle ſhells and ſilver, and had got a good quantity of each on board. He wanted ſome hands very much; and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding I was a free man, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go Jamaica, he told me if he could get one or two, that he would ſail im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately for that iſland: he alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſhew me ſome marks of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and reſpect, and promiſed to give me forty-five ſhillings ſterling a month if I would go with him. I thought this much better than cutting wood for nothing. I therefore told the other captain that I wanted to go to Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica in the other veſſel; but he would not liſten to me; and, ſeeing me reſolved to go in a day or two, he got the veſſel to ſail, intending to carry me away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my will. This treatment mortified me extremely. I immediately, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to an agreement I had made with the Capt. of the Indian Queen, called for her boat, which was lying near us, and it came alongſide; and, by the means of a north-pole ſhipmate which I met with in the ſloop I was in, I got my things into the boat, and went on
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:023353_0359_0FBF410C41BC88C8"/>
board of the Indian Queen, July the 10th. A few days after I was there, we got all things ready and ſailed: but again, to my great mortification, this veſſel ſtill went to the ſouth, nearly as far as Carthagena, trading along the coaſt, inſtead of going to Jamaica, as the captain had promiſed me: and, what was worſt of all he was a very cruel and bloody minded man, and was a horrid bleſphemer. Among others, he had a white pilot, one Stoker, whom he beat often as ſeverely as he did ſome negroes he had on board One night in particular, after he had beaten this man moſt cruelly, he put him into the boat, and made two negroes row him to a deſolate key, or ſmall iſland, and he loaded two piſtols, and ſwore bitterly that he would ſhoot the negroes if they brought Stoker on board again. There was not the leaſt doubt but that he would do as he ſaid, and the two poor fellows were obliged to obey the cruel mandate; but, when the captain was aſleep, the two negroes took a blanket and carried it to the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Stoker, which I believe was the means of ſaving his life from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance of inſects. A great deal of entreaty was uſed with the captain the
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:023353_0360_0FBF4113B1AC6A58"/>
next day, before he would conſent to let Stoker come on board; and when the poor man was brought on board he was very ill, from his ſituation during the night, and he remained ſo till he was drowned a little time after. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> we ſailed ſouthward we came to many uninhabited iſlands, which were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with fine large cocoa nuts. As I was very much in want of proviſions, I brought a boat load of them on board, which laſted me and other for ſeveral weeks, and afforded us many a delicious repaſt in our ſcarcity One day, before this, I could not help ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the providential hand of God, that ever ſupplies all our wants, though in the way, and manner we know not. I had been a whole day without food, and made ſignals for boats to come off, but in vain. I therefore earneſtly prayed to God for relief in my need; and at the cloſe of the evening I went off the deck. Juſt as I laid down I heard a noiſe on the deck; and, not knowing what it meant, I went directly on the deck again, when what ſhould I ſee but a fine large fiſh about ſeven or eight pounds, which had jumped aboard! I took it, and admired, with thanks, the good hand of God; and, what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:023353_0361_0FBF4114DDBB1198"/>
as not leſs extraordinary, the captain, who was very avaricious, did not attempt to take it from me, there being only him and I on board; for the reſt were all gone aſhore trading. Sometimes the people did not come off for ſome days: this uſed to fret the captain, and then he would vent his fury on me by beating me, or making me feel in other cruel ways. One day eſpecially, in his wild, wicked, and mad career, after ſtriking me ſeveral times with different things, and once acroſs my mouth, even with a red burning ſtick out of the fire, he got a barrel of gunpowder on the deck, and ſwore that he would blow up the veſſel. I was then at my wit's end, and earneſtly prayed to God to direct me. The head was out of the barrel; and tho captain took a lighted ſtick out of the fire to blow himſelf and me up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was a veſſel then in ſight coming in, which he ſuppoſed was a Spaniard, and he was afraid of falling into their hands. Seeing this I got an axe, unnoticed by him, and placed myſelf between him and the powder, having reſolved in myſelf as ſoon as he attempted to put the fire in the barrel
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:023353_0362_0FBF41160D1C79D0"/>
to chop him down that inſtant. I was more than an hour in this ſituation; during which he ſtruck me often, ſtill keeping the fire in his hand for this wicked purpoſe. I really ſhould have thought myſelf juſtifiable in any other part of the world if I had killed him, and prayed to God, who gave me a mind which reſted ſolely on himſelf. I prayed for reſignation, that his will might be done: and the following two portions of his holy word, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to my mind, buoyed up my hope, and kept me from taking the life of this wicked man. <q>He hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the times before appointed, and ſet bounds to our habitations,</q> Acts xvii. 26. And, <q>Who is there among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his ſervant, that walketh in darkneſs and hath no light? let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God,</q> Iſaiah l. 20. And thus by the grace of God I was enabled to do. I found him a preſent help in the time of need, and the captain's fury began to ſubſide as the night approached: but I found,
<q>
                           <l>That he who cannot ſtem his anger's tide</l>
                           <l>Doth a wild horſe without a bridle ride.</l>
                        </q>
                        <pb n="159" facs="unknown:023353_0363_0FBF41178135EFC0"/>
The next morning we diſcovered that the veſſel which had cauſed ſuch a fury in the captain was an Engliſh ſloop. They ſoon came to an anchor where we were, and, to my no ſmall ſurpriſe, I learned that Doctor Irving was on board of her on his way from the Muſquito ſhore to Jamaica. I was for going immediately to ſee this old maſter and friend, but the captain would not ſuffer me to leave the veſſel. I then informed the Doctor, by letter, how I was treated, and begged that he would take me out of the ſloop: but he informed me that it was not in his power, as he was a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger himſelf; but he ſent me ſome rum and ſugar for my own uſe. I now learned that after I had left the eſtate which I managed for this gentleman on the Muſquito ſhore, during which the ſlaves were well fed and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, a white overſeer had ſupplied my place: this man through inhumanity and ill-judged avarice, beat and cut the poor ſlaves moſt unmercifully; and the conſequence was, that every one got into a large Puriogua canoe, and endeavored to eſcape; but not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where to go, or how to manage the canoe, they were all drowned; in conſequence of which the Doctor's
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:023353_0364_0FBF411EEFBC5640"/>
plantation was left uncultivated, and he was now returning to Jamaica to purchaſe more ſlaves, and ſtock it again.</p>
                     <p>On the 14th of October, the Indian Queen arrived at Kingſton in Jamaica. When we were u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>aded I demanded my wages, which amounted to eight pounds five ſhillings ſterling; but Captain Baker refuſed to give me one farthing, although it was the hardeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earned money I ever worked for in my life. I found out Doctor Irving upon this, and acquainted him of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's knavery. He did all he could to help me to get my money; and we went to every magiſtrate in Kingſton (and there were nine) but they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to do any thing for me, and ſaid my oath could not be admitted againſt a white man. Nor was this all; for Baker threatened that he would beat me ſeverely if he could catch me for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to demand my money; and this he would have done, but that I got, by means of Doctor Irving, under the protection of Captain Douglas, of the Squirrel man of war. I thought this exceeding hard uſage; though indeed I found it to be too much the practice there to pay free negro men for their labour in this manner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="161" facs="unknown:023353_0365_0FBF41201F567218"/>
One day I went with a free negro, taylor, named Joe Diamond, to one Mr. Cochran, who was indebted to him ſome trifling ſum; and the man, not being able to get his money, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to murmur. The other immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately took a horſe-whip to pay him with it, but, by the help of a good pair of heels, the taylor got off. Such op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as theſe made me ſeek for a veſſel to get off the iſland as faſt as I could: and by the mercy of God, I found a ſhip in November bound for England, when I embarked with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, after having taken a laſt farewell of Doctor Irving. When I left Jamaica he was employed in refining ſugars; and ſome months after my arrival in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland I learned, with much ſorrow, that this my amiable friend was dead, owing to his having eaten ſome poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned fiſh.</p>
                     <p>We had many very heavy gales of wind in our paſſage; in the courſe of which no material incident occurred, except that an American privateer, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in with the fleet, was captured and ſet fire to by his Majeſty's ſhip the Squir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.</p>
                     <p>On January the ſeventh, 1777, we
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:023353_0366_0FBF41214EA5EC78"/>
arrived at Plymouth. I was happy once more to tread upon Engliſh ground; and, after paſſing ſome little time at Plymouth and Exeter, among ſome pious friends, whom I was happy to ſee, I went to London with a heart replete with thanks to God for paſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>

                     <p>SUCH were the various ſcenes which I was a witneſs to, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune I experienced until the year 1777. Since that period, my life has been more uniform, and the incidents of it fewer, than in any other equal nnmber of years preceding; I therefore haſten to the concluſion of a narrative, which I fear the reader may think already ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently tedious.</p>

parts of the world, that I became heartily diſguſted with the ſea-faring life, and was determined not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to it, at leaſt for ſome time. I therefore once more engaged in ſervice ſhortly after my return, and continued for the moſt part in this ſituation until 1784.</p>
                     <p>SOON after my arrival in London, I ſaw a remarkable circumſtance relative to African complexion, which I thought ſo extraordinary, that I beg leave juſt to mention it: A white negro woman, that I had formerly ſeen in London and other parts, had married a white man, by whom ſhe had three boys, and they were every one mullattoes, and yet they had fine light hair. In 1779, I ſerved Governor Macnamara, who had been a conſiderable time on the coaſt of Africa. In the time of my ſervice, I uſed to aſk frequently other ſervants to join me in family prayer; but this only excited their mockery. However, the Governor, underſtanding that I was of a religious turn, wiſhed to know what religion I was of; I told him I was a proteſtant of the church of England, agreeable to the thirty-nine articles of that church; and that whomſoever I found to preach accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:023353_0369_0FBF412B6465A468"/>
to that doctrine, thoſe I would hear. A few days after this, we had ſome more diſcourſe on the ſame ſubject; when he ſaid he would, if I choſe, as he thought I might be of ſervice in converting my countrymen to the Goſpel faith, get me ſent out as miſſionary to Africa. I at firſt refuſed going, and told him how I had been ſerved on a like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by ſome white people the laſt voyage I went to Jamaica, when I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted (if it were the will of God) to be the means of converting the Indian prince; and ſaid I ſuppoſed they would ſerve me worſe than Alexander the copperſmith did St. Paul, if I ſhould attempt to go amongſt them in Africa. He told me not to fear, for he would apply to the Biſhop of London to get me ordained. On theſe terms I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Governor's propoſal to go to Africa in hope of doing good, if poſſible, amongſt my countrymen; ſo, in order to have me ſent out properly, we immediately wrote the following letters to the late Biſhop of London:</p>

                           <p>I HAVE reſided near five years on Senegambia on the coaſt of Africa, and have had the honour of filling very conſiderable employments in that province. I do approve of the within plan, and think the undertaking very laudable and proper, and that it deſerves your Lordſhip's protection and encouragement, in which caſe it muſt be attended with the intended ſucceſs.</p>

WITH theſe letters, I waited on the Biſhop by the Governor's deſire, and preſented them to his Lordſhip. He received me with much condeſcenſion and politeneſs; but from ſome certain ſcruples of delicacy, and ſaying the Biſhops were not of opinion of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new miſſionary to Africa, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to ordain me.</p>
                     <p>MY ſole motive for thus dwelling on this tranſaction, or inſerting theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, is the opinion which gentlemen of ſenſe and education, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Africa, entertain of the probability of converting the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of it to the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, if the attempt were countenanced by the legiſlature.</p>
                     <p>Shortly after this I left the Governor, and ſerved a nobleman in the Dorſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire militia, with whom I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped at Coxheath for ſome time; but the operations there, were too mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute and unintereſting to make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of.</p>
                     <p>IN the year 1783, I viſited eight counties in Wales, from motives of curioſity. While I was in that part of the country I was led to go down into a coal-pit in Shropſhire, but my curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:023353_0374_0FBF4134D5AE7DC8"/>
nearly coſt me my life; for while I was in the pit the coals fell in, and buried one poor man, who was not far from me: upon this I got out as faſt as I could, thinking the ſurface of the earth the ſafeſt part of it.</p>
                     <p>IN the ſpring of 1784, I thought of viſiting old ocean again. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this I embarked as ſteward on board a fine new ſhip called the London, commanded by Martin Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, and ſailed for New-York. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired this city very much; it is large and well-built, and abounds with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of all kinds. While we lay here a circumſtance happened which I thought extremely ſingular:—One day a malefactor was to be executed on a gallows; but with a condition that if any woman, having nothing on but her ſhift, married the man under the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, his life was to be ſaved. This extraordinary privilege was claimed; a woman preſented herſelf; and the marriage ceremony was performed.</p>
                     <p>OUR ſhip having got laden we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to London in January 1785. When ſhe was ready again for another voyage, the captain being an agreeable man, I ſailed with him from hence in the ſpring, March 1785, for Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:023353_0375_0FBF413ADCC77650"/>
On the 5th of April, we took our departure from the land's-end, with a pleaſant gale; and about nine o'clock that night the moon ſhone bright, and the ſea was ſmooth, while our ſhip was going free by the wind, at the rate of about four or five miles an hour.—At this time another ſhip was going nearly as faſt as we on the oppoſite point, meeting us right in the teeth, yet none on board obſerved either ſhip until we ſtruck each other forcibly head and head, to the aſtoniſhment and conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of both crews. She did us much damage, but I believe we did her more; for when we paſſed by each other, which we did very quickly, they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to us to bring to, and hoiſt out our boat, but we had enough to do to mind ourſelves; and in about eight minutes we ſaw no more of her. We refitted as well as we could the next day, and proceeded on our voyage, and in May arrived at Philadelphia.</p>
                     <p>I was very glad to ſee this favorite old town once more; and my pleaſure was much increaſed in ſeeing the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy quakers freeing and eaſing the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of many of my oppreſſed African brethren. It rejoiced my heart when one of theſe friendly people took me to
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:023353_0376_0FBF413C4C1C28A0"/>
ſee a free-ſchool they had erected for every denomination of black people, whoſe minds are cultivated here, and forwarded to virtue; and thus they are made uſeful members of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Does not the ſucceſs of this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice ſay loudly to the planters, in the language of ſcripture—"Go ye and do likewiſe!"</p>
                     <p>IN October 1785, I was accompanied by ſome of the Africans, and preſented this addreſs of thanks to the gentlemen called Friends or Quakers, in Grace-church-Court, Lombard Street:</p>
                     <p>GENTLEMEN, BY reading your book, entitled a Caution to Great-Britain and her Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, concerning the Calamitous State of the enſlaved Negroes: We part of the poor, oppreſſed, needy, and much degraded Negroes, deſire to approach you with this addreſs of thanks, with our inmoſt love and warmeſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment; and with the deepeſt ſenſe of your benevolence, unwearied labour, and kind interpoſition, towards break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the yoke of ſlavery, and to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter a little comfort and eaſe to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and tens of thouſands of very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>grievouſly afflicted, and too heavy burthened negroes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="173" facs="unknown:023353_0377_0FBF413FF6421B30"/>
GENTLEMEN, could you, by perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, at laſt be enabled under God, to lighten in any degree the heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of the afflicted, no doubt it would in ſome meaſure, be the poſſible means, under God, of ſaving the ſouls of many of the oppreſſors; and if ſo, ſure we are that the God, whoſe eyes are ever upon all his creatures, and always rewards every true act of virtue, and regards the prayers of the oppreſſed, will give to you and yours thoſe bleſſings which it is not in our power to expreſs or conceive, but which we as a part of thoſe captivated, oppreſſed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted people, moſt earneſtly wiſh and pray for.</p>
                     <p>THESE gentlemen received us very kindly, with a promiſe to exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on behalf of the oppreſſed Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, and we parted.</p>
                     <p>WHILE in town, I chanced once to be invited to a quaker's wedding. The ſimple and yet expreſſive mode uſed at their ſolemnizations is worthy of note. The following is the true form of it:</p>
                     <p>AFTER the company have met they have ſeaſonable exhortations by ſeveral of the members; the bride and bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom ſtand up, and, taking each other
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:023353_0378_0FBF4140CD6AD080"/>
by the hand in a ſolemn manner, the man audibly declares to this purpoſe:</p>
                     <p>"FRIENDS, in the fear of the Lord, and in the preſence of this aſſembly, whom I deſire to be my witneſſes, I take this my friend, M. N. to be my wife; promiſing, through divine aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to be unto her a loving and faithful huſband till death ſeparate us:" and the woman makes the like decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Then the two firſt ſign their names to the record, and as many more witneſſes as have a mind. I had the honour to ſubſcribe mine to a regiſter in Gracechurch-Court, Lombard-ſtreet.—My hand is ever free—if any female Debonair wiſhes to obtain it, this mode I recommend.</p>
                     <p>WE returned to London in Auguſt; and our ſhip not going immediately to ſea, I ſhipped as a ſteward in an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſhip called the Harmony, Capt. John Willet, and left London in March 1785, bound to Philadelphia. Eleven days after ſailing, we carried our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt away We had a nine weeks paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which cauſed our trip not to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed well, the market for our goods proving bad; and to make it worſe, my commander began to play me the like tricks as others too often practiſe
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:023353_0379_0FBF4143357E59E8"/>
on free negroes in the Weſt-Indies. But I thank God I found many friends here, who in ſome meaſure prevented him. On my return to London in Auguſt, I was very agreeably ſurpriſed to find that the benevolence of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had adopted the plan of ſome philanthropic individuals to ſend the Africans from hence to their native quarter; and that ſome veſſels were then engaged to carry them to Sierra Leona; an act which redounded to the honour of all concerned in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, and filled me with prayers and much rejoicing. There was then in the city, a ſelect committee of gentlemen for the black poor, to ſome of whom I had the honour of being known; and as ſoon as they heard of my arrival, they ſent for me to the committee. When I came there, they informed me of the intention of government; and as they ſeemed to think me quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to ſuperintend part of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, they aſked me to go with the black poor to Africa I pointed out to them many objections to my going; and particularly I expreſſed ſome difficulties on the account of the ſlave dealers, as I would certainly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their traffic in the human ſpecies
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:023353_0380_0FBF41496CEBF830"/>
by every means in my power. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever theſe objections were over-ruled by the gentlemen of the committee, who prevailed on me to conſent to go; and recommended me to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable commiſſioners of his Majeſty's Navy, as a proper perſon to act as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary for government in the intended expedition; and they accordingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed me in November 1786, to that office, and gave me ſufficient power to act for the government in the capacity of commiſſary, having received my warrant and the following order.</p>

I proceeded immediately to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of my duty on board the veſſels deſtined for the voyage, where I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the March following.</p>
                     <p>DURING my continuance in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of government, I was ſtruck with the flagrant abuſes committed by the agent, and endeavoured to remedy them, but without effect One inſtance, among many which I could produce, may ſerve as a ſpecimen. Government had ordered to be provided all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries (ſlops, as they are called, includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) for 750 perſons; however, not being able to muſter more than 426, I was ordered to ſend the ſuperfluous ſlops, &amp;c. to the king's ſtore's a Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth; but, when I demanded them for that purpoſe from the agent, it appeared they had never been bought, though paid for by government. But that was not all, government were not the only objects of peculation; theſe poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſuffered infinitely more; their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations, were moſt wretched; many of them wanted beds, and many more cloathing and other neceſſaries. For the truth of this, and much more, I do not ſeek credit from my own aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I appeal to the teſtimony of Capt. Thompſon, of the Nautilus, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyed
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:023353_0383_0FBF414F18F4A048"/>
us, to whom I applied in Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary 1787, for a remedy, when I had remonſtrated to the agent in vain, and even brought him to be a witneſs of the injuſtice and oppreſſion I complained of. I appeal alſo to a letter written by theſe wretched people, ſo early as the beginning of the preceding January, and publiſhed in the Morning Herald. on the 4th of that month, ſigned by twenty of their chiefs.</p>
                     <p>I could not ſilently ſuffer govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be thus cheated, and my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen plundered and oppreſſed, and even left deſtitute of the neceſſaries for almoſt their exiſtence. I therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Commiſſioners of the Navy of the agent's proceeding but my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was ſoon after procured, by means of a gentleman in the city, whom the agent, conſcious of his peculation, had deceived by letter, and who, moreover, empowered the ſame agent to receive on board, at the government expence, a number of perſons as paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, contrary to the orders I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. By this I ſuffered a conſiderable loſs in my property: however, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were ſatisfied with my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and wrote to Capt Thompſon, expreſſing their approbation of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="180" facs="unknown:023353_0384_0FBF41543B08EA40"/>
THUS provided, they proceeded on their voyage; and at laſt, worn out by treatment, perhaps not the moſt mild, and waſted by ſickneſs, brought on by want of medicine, cloaths, bedding, &amp;c. they reached Sierra Leona juſt at the commencement of the rains. At that ſeaſon of the year it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to cultivate the lands; their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions therefore were exhauſted before they could derive any benefit from agriculture; and it is not ſurpriſing that many, eſpecially the laſcars, whoſe conſtitutions are very tender, and who had been cooped up in ſhips from Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to June, and accommodated in the manner I have mentioned, ſhould be ſo waſted by their confinement as not to ſurvive it.</p>
                     <p>THUS ended my part of the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talked of expedition to Sierra Leona; an expedition which, however unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in the event, was humane and politic in its deſign, nor was its failure owing to government: every thing was done on their part; but there was evidently ſufficient miſmanagement at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the conduct and execution of it to defeat its ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould not have been ſo ample in my account of this tranſaction, had not

the ſhare I bore in it been made the ſubject of partial animadverſion, and even my diſmiſſion from my employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thought worthy of being made by ſome a matter of public triumph<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Public Advertiſer, July 14, 1787.</note>. The motives which might influence any perſon to deſcend to a petty conteſt with an obſcure African, and to ſeek gratification by his depreſſion, perhaps it is not proper here to inquire into or relate, even if its detection were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to my vindication; but I thank Heaven it is not. I wiſh to ſtand by my own integrity, and not to ſhelter myſelf under the impropriety of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and I truſt the behaviour of the Commiſſioners of the Navy to me enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle me to make this aſſertion; for after I had been diſmiſſed, March 24, I drew up a memorial thus:</p>

                           <p>THAT your Lordſhips memorialiſt was, by the Honorable the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of his Majeſty's Navy, on the 4th of December laſt, appointed to the above employment by warrant from that board;</p>
                           <p>THAT he accordingly proceeded to the execution of his duty on board of the Vernon, being one of the ſhips ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to proceed to Africa with the above poor;</p>
                           <p>THAT your memorialiſt, to his great grief and aſtoniſhment, received a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of diſmiſſion from the Honorable Commiſſioners of the Navy, by your Lordſhips orders;</p>
                           <p>THAT, conſcious of having acted with the moſt perfect fidelity and the greateſt aſſiduity in diſcharging the truſt repoſed in him, he is altogether at a loſs to conceive the reaſons of your Lordſhips having altered the favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opinion you were pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him, ſenſible that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips

would not proceed to ſo ſevere a meaſure without ſome apparent good cauſe; he therefore has every reaſon to believe that his conduct has been groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſrepreſented to your Lordſhips, and he is the more confirmed in his opinion, becauſe, by oppoſing mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of others concerned in the ſame expedition, which tended to defeat your Lordſhips humane intentions, and to put the government to a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able additional expence, he created a number of enemies, whoſe miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, he has too much reaſon to believe, laid the foundation of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. Unſupported by friends; and unaided by the advantages of a liberal education, he can only hope for redreſs from the juſtice of his cauſe, in addition to the mortification of having been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from his employment, and the advantage which he reaſonably might have expected to have derived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. He has had the misfortune to have ſunk a conſiderable part of his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle property in fitting himſelf out, and in other expences ariſing out of his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, an account of which he here annexes. Your memorialiſt will not trouble your Lordſhips with a vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of any part of his conduct, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knows not of what crimes he is accuſed; he, however, earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats

that you will be pleaſed to direct an enquiry into his behaviour during the time he acted in the public ſervice; and, if it be found that his diſmiſſion aroſe from falſe repreſentations, he is confident that in your Lordſhip's juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice he ſhall find redreſs.</p>
                           <p>YOUR petitioner therefore humbly prays that your Lordſhips will take his caſe into conſideration; and that you will be pleaſed to order payment of the above referred-to account, amounting to 32l 4s and alſo the wages intended which is moſt humbly ſubmitted.</p>

                     <p>THE negro conſolidated act, made by the aſſembly of Jamaica laſt year, and the new act of amendment now in agitation there, contain a proof of the exiſtence of thoſe charges that have been made againſt the planters relative to the treatment of their ſlaves.</p>

Theſe are concerns which do not perhaps belong to any particular office; but, to ſpeak more ſeriouſly to every man of ſentiment, actions like theſe are the juſt and ſure foundation of future fame; a reverſion, though remote, is coveted by ſome noble minds as a ſubſtantial good. It is upon theſe grounds that I hope and

expect the attention of gentlemen in power. Theſe are deſigns conſonant to the elevation of their rank, and the dignity of their ſtations: they are ends ſuitable to the nature of a free and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous government; and, connected with views of empire and dominion, ſuited to the benevolence and ſolid merit of the legiſlature.

                     <p>As the inhuman traffic of ſlavery is to be taken into the conſideration of the Britiſh legiſlature, I doubt not, if a ſyſtem of commerce was eſtabliſhed in Africa, the demand for manufactures will moſt rapidly augment, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inhabitants will inſenſibly adopt the Britiſh faſhions, manners, cuſtoms, &amp;c in proportion to the civilization, ſo will be the conſumption of Britiſh manufactures.</p>
                     <p>THE wear and tear of a continent,
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:023353_0393_0FBF416B99F99110"/>
nearly twice as large as Europe, and rich in vegetable and mineral produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is much eaſier conceived than calculated.</p>
                     <p>A CASE in point.—It coſt the Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigines of Britain, little or nothing in clothing, . The difference between their forefathers and the preſent gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, in point of conſumption, is literally infinite. The ſuppoſition is moſt obvious. It will be equally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe in Africa—The ſame cauſe, viz. civilization, will ever have the ſame effect.</p>
                     <p>IT is trading upon ſafe grounds. A commercial intercourſe with Africa opens an inexhauſtable ſource of wealth to the manufacturing intereſts of Great Britain, and to all which the ſlave trade is an objection.</p>
                     <p>IF I am not miſinformed, the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing intereſt is equal, if not ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, to the landed intereſt, as to the value, for reaſons which will ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear The abolition of ſlavery, ſo diabolical, will give a moſt rapid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of manufactures, which is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and diametrically oppoſite to what ſome intereſted people aſſert.</p>
                     <p>THE manufactures of this country muſt and will, in the nature and reaſon of things, have a full and conſtant em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy by ſupplying the African markets.</p>

POPULATION, the bowels and ſurface of Africa, abound in valuable and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful returns; the hidden treaſures of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies will be brought to light and into circulation. Induſtry, enterprize, and mining, will have their full ſcope, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably as they civilize. In a word, it lays open an endleſs field of commerce to the Britiſh manufactures and merchant adventurer. The manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing intereſt and the general inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts are ſynonymous. The abolition of ſlavery would be in reality an univerſal good.</p>
                     <p>TORTURES, murder, and every other imaginable barbarity and iniquity, are practiſed upon the poor ſlaves with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity. I hope the ſlave trade will be aboliſhed. I pray it may be an event at hand. The great body of manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, uniting in the cauſe, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably facilitate and expedite it; and as I have already ſtated, it is moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially their intereſt and advantage, and as ſuch the nation's at large, (except thoſe perſons concerned in the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing neck-yokes, collars, chains, hand-cuffs, leg-bolts, drags, thumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrews, iron muzzles, and coffins; cats, ſcourges, and other inſtruments of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture uſed in the ſlave trade).

                     <p>THIS I conceive to be a theory founded upon facts, and therefore an infallible one.

                     <p>I have only therefore to requeſt the reader's indulgence and conclude. I am far from the vanity of thinking there is any merit in this narrative: I hope cenſure will be ſuſpended, when it is conſidered that it was written by one

who was as unwilling as unable to adorn the plainneſs of truth by the colouring of imagination. My life and fortune have been extremely chequer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and my adventures various. Even thoſe I have related are conſiderably abridged. If any incident in this little work ſhould appear unintereſting and trifling to moſt readers, I can only ſay, as my excuſe for mentioning it, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every event of my life made an impreſſion on my mind, and influenced my conduct. I early accuſtomed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to look for the hand of God in the minuteſt occurrence, and to learn from it a leſſon of morality and religion; and in this light, every circumſtance I have related was to me of importance.
