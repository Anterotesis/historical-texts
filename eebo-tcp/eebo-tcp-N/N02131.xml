            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second favouring the good Purpoſe of our late Proprietary <hi>William Penn,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Regard to the Memory and Merits of his deceaſed Father, in

divers Services, was pleaſed by his <hi>Royal Charter</hi> to grant and confirm this Country, with certain Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Juriſdictions requiſite for the good Government thereof, to him the ſaid Proprietary and his Heirs for ever; Whereupon an ample Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony of honeſt, induſtrious and weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Perſons, removed themſelves and Families into this Province, and by the great Favour and Bleſſing of Divine Providence upon their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, made this conſiderable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the Engliſh Empire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Charge to the Crown, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to enjoy not only the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes and Immunities granted them by the ſaid Charter, but ſuch fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rights and Priviledges, as may beſt ſuit their Circumſtances, as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in ſome Points from other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, particularly in the Caſe of Swearing, which the ſaid Proprieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and firſt Purchaſers (ſome of whom were not <hi>Quakers</hi>) on the Fifth Day of the Month called <hi>May,

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002533_0004_0FDB5C3E6ED97820"/>
was reſtored to his Government in the Year 1696, which was ſince the Statute that firſt enacted the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Proprietary's reaſſuming his Government, the Laws were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed in 1700 and 1701, and this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the manner of giving Evidence, with divers others, were remitted to the Queen and Council in 1705, and was referr'd to the Conſideration of <hi>Northy,</hi> then Attorney General, who did not object to the Form of Words, or legal Effect of Solemnly Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> inſtead of an Oath, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Affirmation, but his Opinion was to repeal the ſaid Act, becauſe the Puniſhment of Wilfully Falſify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Solemn Promiſe, was exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded further than the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> required, which thereupon was repeal'd accordingly.</p>
            <p>Our Friends continued in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of this Fundamental Right

for above Twenty Years with good Succeſs, until the ſaid Repeal; ſince which we have labour'd under many Difficulties, and divers Eſſays have been made for reviving the aforeſaid Priviledge, which hitherto have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ineffectual: And now underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that our Repreſentatives in Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, have laid before the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour a Bill relating the Forms of Affirmation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> lately granted to our Brethren in <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the ſaid Bill being fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as we concieve, agreeable to the Governour's own Propoſal, and the Circumſtances of this Province, We humbly intreat that he will be pleas'd to paſs the ſaid Bill, now before him, into a Law, whereby we may all be render'd uſeful, not only to each other, but to others our Neighbours who may ſtand in need of our Evidence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>And it is evident, that the King and Parliament of <hi>Great Britain</hi> are of the ſame Opinion concerning us in this Caſe, otherwiſe after an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Twenty-five Years, they would not ſo generally accept our Solemn Promiſe in ſo important a Matter as a Teſt of our Allegiance and Fidelity to the King, and for abjuring the Pretender, at a Time when new Engagements are required of other Subjects in the ſame Caſes; And therefore, we hope our Fellow-Subjects will Acquieſce in the ſame Security, and not affect a great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence than our Superiours.
