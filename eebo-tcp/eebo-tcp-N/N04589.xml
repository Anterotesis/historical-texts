            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> my Brethren, may be call'd the Summary of both Teſtaments, there is in it ſo much of God and his Law, as well as of Chriſt and his Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The Word <hi>Pſalm,</hi> tho' it primarily ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>Praiſes,</hi> is doubtleſs of larger Extent, and intends all Compoſitions of Meeter that are fit to be ſung, whether of Hiſtory or Doctrine, of Prayer or Praiſe, becauſe many of them are really ſuch; and hence we are directed not only to praiſe God, but <hi>to teach one another in Pſalms, Hymns and ſpiritual Songs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly the third Perſon of the adorable Trinity, they contain <hi>the Words which the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005700_0004_1026C67F221F69A0"/>
Holy Ghoſt teacheth,</hi> and therefore are better fitted for the uſe of the Church, in every Age to the utmoſt period of Time, than any meer human Compoſure.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Penman</hi> of them, for the moſt part, was <hi>David</hi> the Son of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> who is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the <hi>Sweet Singer of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Scope</hi> of them, is principally to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame our <hi>Love</hi> to, and excite our <hi>Truſt</hi> in the bleſſed God, who is our Creator, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and Benefactor; and thus to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to univerſal <hi>Holineſs</hi> in Practice.</p>
            <p>But more particularly, the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> from which our Text is taken, was probably ſome <hi>Victory</hi> which <hi>Iſrael</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained over their Enemies. Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that it was pen'd when <hi>David</hi> had taken the ſtrong Hold of <hi>Zyon,</hi> and ſettled his Government there, <note n="*" place="bottom">This, ſayeth <hi>Muis,</hi> the latter part of the ſecond Verſe plainly ſignifies. And <hi>Maldonate</hi> obſerves, that this Pſalm is a form of Thankſgiving for ſome famous <hi>Victory,</hi> and myſtically contains the favour of God to his Church, and the Triumphs of the Chriſtian Faith over Heathen Princes. <hi>vid.

God and rejoice in him. <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord,</hi> i. e. Exalt and glorify him for all his Mercies. <hi>Sing unto the Lord a new Song,</hi> i. e, let your grateful Sentiments break forth into vocal Melody, and either compoſe a new Hymn of Praiſe upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſpecial Occaſion, or ſing with new and raiſed Affections, which makes the Song new to us, tho' we have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to uſe it before. <hi>And his Praiſe in the Congregation of Saints,</hi> i. e. Let not your thankful Senſe of Mercies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, be confin'd to your own Boſoms or Retirements, but expreſs it openly to the Honour of the Giver, in the moſt publick and ſolemn Aſſemblies, as thoſe that are neither afraid or aſham'd of doing your Duty, and as deſirous to excite others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence in it: The greater the Number is that joins in this ſacred grateful Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the more it reſembles the Choirs above, whoſe continual Buſineſs and Happineſs it is, to celebrate the Divine Praiſe.</p>
            <p>Now the Words of our Text, conſidered in their Connection, may be reſolv'd into this Propoſition, viz.</p>

            <p n="1">1ſt. As to the <hi>Mercies</hi> we ſhould <hi>praiſe God for,</hi> I may ſay, that every Benefit he vouchſafes, deſerves our grateful Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments, whether it be temporal or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, perſonal or publick, the leaſt Mercy we receive may juſtly be counted great in reſpect of us, who have by Sin forfeited a Right to all, and therefore merit none; and it is likewiſe <hi>the Will of God, that in every Thing we ſhould give Thanks;</hi> No Mercy that a gracious God vouchſafes, ſhould be paſſed over with a Stupid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſervant Neglect: And truly it is a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable and awful Sign of the Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of human Nature, that the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

            <p>But methinks thoſe Benefits which tend to promote the publick Intereſt, and ſafety of the Community to which we belong, and in which our Perſons and Properties, our civil and religious Liberties are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd, claim our peculiar Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for ſurely ſo much the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive any Good is, ſo much the more valuable it is. <note n="*" place="bottom">Bonum quo Communius, eo Melius.</note> Private Intereſt is no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excellent, than as it is conſiſtent with, and conducive to the Good of the Publick, which we are born to promote, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould be ſenſibly affected, when this noble End is in any Degree attained, which it certainly is, by notable Victories over the Enemies of our Religion and Liberties; and the more the Hand of God appears in bringing them to paſs, the ſtronger En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements we are under to praiſe him; this the Pſalmiſt ſignifies in the following emphatical Lines; <hi>O ſing unto the Lord a

               <q>It is our Duty and therefore Good in itſelf, it is our Intereſt and therefore Good for us, it is acceptable to our Creator, and anſwers the End of our Creation, the Law for it is Holy, Juſt and Good, and the Practice of it will turn to a good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</q> This enlarges and enobles our rational Powers by fixing them upon the ſublimeſt Objects, <hi>viz.</hi> The divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and Benefits; This Facilitates the Performance of other Duties, by increaſing the Springs of Love and Delight from which they proceed; this contents the Mind with preſent Circumſtances, and confirms our Expectation of Future Mercies: In this Way we may hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hope that a gracious God will rejoice over us to do us Good.</p>
            <p>But on the Contrary, Ingratitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaves
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005700_0028_1026C6C9E5C3D4D8"/>
us of preſent Mercies, and prevents future Benefits: When the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> took no thankful Notice of the Corn, and Wine and Oyl that God gave them, he threatned to take them away: <hi>She did not know,</hi> ſaith the Almighty by the Prophet, <hi>that I gave her Corn, and Wine, and Oyl, therefore will I return and take away my Corn in the Time thereof, and my Wine in the Seaſon thereof: And will recover my Wool and my Flax.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Hoſ. ii. 8, 9.</note> Likewiſe when <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> cry'd to God by Reaſon of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> the Lord an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd them in the following Manner, <hi>Did not I deliver you from the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>and from the</hi> Amorites, <hi>from the Children of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>and from the</hi> Philiſtines? <hi>The</hi> Zidoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>alſo and the</hi> Amalekites, <hi>and the</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onites <hi>did oppreſs you, and ye cry'd to me and I delivered you out of their Hand, yet ye have forſaken me and ſerved other Gods, wherefore I will deliver you no more, go and cry unto the God's ye have choſen, let them deliver you in the Time of your Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Judge. x. 11, 12, 13, 14.</note> But</p>

               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:005700_0029_1026C6CB6B4262F8"/>(2dly.) <hi>Praiſe</hi> ſays the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> is <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Joy,</hi> which is the <hi>Source</hi> of it, is Pleaſant to us as Men; and the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which is the <hi>Scope</hi> of it, is Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to us as Saints, who are devoted to his Honour.</q> Praiſing God is a Work which is its own Wages, that Love from which it proceeds is a pleaſing Paſſion, which gives every Thing its true Reliſh, and is as Oyl to the Wheels of Devotion. Praiſe unbends the pious Mind, which is never more gratify'd than in making Returns for Kindneſſes received: Praiſe gives a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Enjoyment of paſt Benefits by a Reflection upon them. In a Word, it is the exacteſt Emblem we have on Earth of the Temper and Employment of the Inhabitants of Heaven. Again,</p>
            <p n="3">(3dly) <hi>Praiſe</hi> is <hi>comely,</hi> it is rational and ornamental, it becomes us as Men, who are endowed with Reaſon and Reflection, which ſhould direct and induce us to take thankful Notice of Benefits, and to abhor the contrary Practice as baſe and brutiſh, and every Way unworthy of the human Nature. It becomes us as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005700_0030_1026C6CD136E8490"/>
who are under additional Engagements to this by Covenant, and under ſpecial Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages directing and inclining to it, by Goſpel Light and Grace. What is more amiable than a juſt Senſe of the divine Goodneſs, and a Celebration of it with adoring Reverence, and grateful <hi>Hoſannas?</hi> Surely Sirs our Tongues are never ſo much our Glory, as when employ'd in expreſſing the Divine Praiſe; and indeed Praiſe ſeems to be one of the moſt generous Parts of Divine Worſhip, while Prayer ſeeks a ſelfiſh Good, Praiſe attempts the requital of Benefits receiv'd, by rendering a tribute of Honour for them, agreeable to the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Reaſon and of God.</p>
            <p>I may add to what has been ſaid this Conſideration, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, has recommended the Duty of Praiſe and Thankſgiving, both by Precept and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he reprov'd the Nine Lepers for their Ingratitude, and commended the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan</hi> who glorified God on the Occaſion of his Cure; <hi>and Jeſus anſwering ſaid, were there not ten cleanſed? But where are the Nine? There are not found that return'd

to give Glory to God ſave this Stranger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke xvii. 17, 18.</note> The Life of our dear Lord was a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Thankfulneſs and Praiſe, and in this he was a true Son of <hi>David.</hi> When he rais'd <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Dead, he thank'd his Father that he heard him. <note n="†" place="bottom">John xi. 41.</note> Yea he didn't eat common Bread without firſt bleſſing of it by giving of Thanks. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mat. 14.18.</note> But I proceed to the Improvement of this Diſcourſe. And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> If it be an important Duty to praiſe God for Mercies receiv'd, then ſurely thoſe are to be reprov'd, who take no Notice of the divine Benefits, ſuch are more ſtupid than the Ox and Aſs, that know their Owner and Maſter's Crib; they reſemble the <hi>Swine,</hi> who greedily devour falling Fruit, but look not up to the Tree from whence they come.</p>
            <p>And ſuch are alſo to be reprov'd, who tho' they take ſome Notice of Mercies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, return but ſuperficial Praiſes for them: Such Hypocrites refuſe to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty the <hi>Male of their Flock, and offer

the Lame and the blind in Sacrifice:</hi> Thoſe the Almighty denounces a <hi>Curſe</hi> upon, and rejects their Service; for they draw nigh to God only with their Lips, but their Hearts are far from him.</p>
            <p>Farther: Such are to be reprov'd who tho' they have had ſome Senſe of the Mercy of God, do not retain the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Remembrance of them; nor are thereby induc'd to Repentance and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Life: The Almighty complains of ſuch in very affecting Language; <hi>O</hi> Ephraim <hi>what ſhall I do unto thee? O</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah <hi>what ſhall I do unto thee? For thy Goodneſs is as the Morning Cloud, and as the early Dew which ſoon paſſeth away. Ye did run well who hindred you.</hi> O Sirs! unleſs the Bloſſoms of our religious Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Reſolutions ripen into the Fruits of a holy Practice, we are ſtill unthankful and unfruitful in the Eye of God; and have reaſon to fear his eternal Indignation!</p>
            <p>Again: Such are alſo to be reprov'd, who arrogates the Honours of Mercies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd to themſelves, and ſo <hi>ſacrifice to their own Net, and burn Incence to their

            <p>Let us therefore, Dear Brethren! avoid thoſe Evils, and ſpeak in <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Language; <hi>Seeing that thou our God haſt puniſh'd us leſs than our Iniquities deſerve, and haſt given us ſuch a Deliverance as this, ſhould we again break thy Commandments? Would'ſt thou not be angry with us, till thou hadſt conſum'd us, ſo that there ſhould be no Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or eſcaping?</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Ezra ix. 13, 14.</note> But</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> Is it a Duty to praiſe God for Mercies receiv'd? Then let us be intreated to perform it with Speed and Sincerity, to this End think often on your Unworthineſs by reaſon of Sin; this tends to affect the Heart with every Mercy, and make us ſpeak in the Language of <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> who when <hi>David</hi> told him that he ſhould have his Lands, and eat Bread at his Table, <hi>bowed himſelf and ſaid, what is thy Servant, that thou ſhouldſt look upon ſuch a dead

Dog as I am?</hi> And ſeek for the Aſſiſtance and Influence of God's Holy Spirit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which ye cannot Praiſe God to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; <hi>Be not drunk with Wine wherein is Exceſs, but be filled with the Spirit, ſpeaking to your ſelves in Pſalms and Hymns, giving thanks always for all Things unto God and the Father, in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dear Brethren! ſhall we be ſtupid and inſenſible, and indulge a ſinful Silence, while we are encompaſſed with innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Mercies? Mercies</hi> freely vouchſafed without any Deſert of ours, yea contrary to our Deſert: <hi>Mercies</hi> ſeaſonably voucſafed in the very nick of Extremity: <hi>Mercies</hi> long continued after a vile Abuſe: <hi>Mercies</hi> diſtinguiſhing in their Kind: While many grope in the thickeſt Darkneſs, we enjoy the Light of the glorious Goſpel: While many are oppreſs'd by Tyranny and Want, we enjoy both civil and religious Liberty and Plenty. O the amazing Mercy of God! Let our Souls and all that is within us, bleſs his holy Name!</p>
            <p>Surely Sirs, there is no Diſpoſition more deeply engraven in the original Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005700_0035_1026C6DB89A0DFD0"/>
of Human Nature, than a Senſe of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits receiv'd; the very worſt of Men have ſome Remains of this; <hi>Do not the Publicans ſo?</hi> ſaid our Lord. Yea divers of the Beaſts who are devoid of the Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Reaſon, do by natural Inſtinct ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a Kind of Gratitude; <hi>the Ox knows his Owner, and the Aſs his Maſter's Crib;</hi> and not only the gentle and ſociable, but thoſe of a fiercer Kind, expreſs a Kindneſs to Benefactors; even the Lyon and the Tyger are not wholly loſt to a Senſe of this, if we may credit civil Story.</p>
            <p>And the inanimate Creatures ſeem not altogether inſenſible of Benefits; the Rivers return to the Ocean theſe Waters they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from it, by obſcure, meandrine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits; the Heavens return to the Earth in balmy Dews and fruitful Showers, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters exhal'd from it by the Sun's Influence, and the teeming Earth by its Fruits requites the Labours of the Husband Man.</p>
            <p>The Obligation to Praiſe and Gratitude is moſt rational; ſurely he unjuſtly aſks a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, who is not diſpos'd to requite it; we are indebted for what is freely given, as well as for what is lent; the Freeneſs of the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005700_0036_1026C6DEB85DDEE0"/>
Giver, does not diminiſh but increaſe the Debt to a generous and conſiderate Mind.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, <hi>Ingratitude</hi> is the Sin of Sins, it rebels againſt God's commanding Authority, is diſingenuous to his Love, and expoſes us to his fearful Diſpleaſure; it is like a froward Child's attempting to beat his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Breaſts, and kick his Father's Bowels.</p>
            <p>You are doubtleſs aware, my Brethren, that the Occaſion of this Diſcourſe, is the late me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable <hi>Succeſs</hi> with which it has pleas'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Heaven to crown his Majeſty's Arms, in the late Expedition againſt the City and Fortreſſes of <hi>Louisburgh</hi> on <hi>Cape Breton,</hi> on the Account of which this Town was ſo lately illuminated, and ſo juſtly and generally expreſſed a joyful Senſe of the Benefit.</p>
            <p>I need not inform you Sirs, of how great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance this Conqueſt is to all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions in general, and to this <hi>Engliſh Main</hi> in particular; hereby our Commerce is both protected and encreas'd, and a Barrier fix'd which may be of great Service to prevent the Inroads of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> upon the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Inhabitants of this Continent.</p>
            <p>But that which peculiarly enhances the Value of this Mercy is, that it gives ſome
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:005700_0037_1026C6E310A9DE80"/>
check to the ambitious Deſigns and cruel Intrigues of a proud and potent Prince, who unweariedly labours to rob us of our civil and religious Liberties, and bring us into the moſt wretched Vaſſalage to arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power and Church Tyranny. A Prince who diſturbs all <hi>Europe</hi> by his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and Arms, in order to erect a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Monarchy upon the Ruins of other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and States. How admirable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the Mercy of God in giving into our Hands this ſtrong Hold of the Enemy of our Religion and Liberties!</p>
            <p>What Cauſe have we, dear Sirs! to praiſe a gracious God, for his propitious Smiles on this <hi>Expedition?</hi> eſpecially when we conſider how remarkably divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has appear'd in it, by a Train of ſurprizing Incidents!</p>
            <p>That a City ſo well fortify'd by Nature and Art as <hi>Louisburgh,</hi> a City almoſt impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſhou'd be ſo ſoon reduc'd by ſo ſmall and unexperienced an Army, and that with ſo little Effuſion of Blood, is truly amazing!</p>
            <p>Altho' the prudent Council's of the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts</hi> Government, in forming the Plan of the Expedition, and the diſcreet Conduct
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:005700_0038_1026C6E6659B51C0"/>
and intrepid Courage of their Forces, in the Proſecution of it, in Conjunction with the Naval Armament, under the Command and Direction of <hi>brave</hi> Commodore WAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REN, are much to be commended. Yet ſurely it was the bleſſed God, my Brethren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that directed them to it, and ſpirited them for it: 'Twas He that conducted them in it, and gave the Succeſs: 'Twas He that enclin'd our gracious <hi>Sovereign</hi> to favour the prudent Project: 'Twas He who gave ſuch a Scene of uncommon, but agreeable Weather, as ſerv'd to accelerate the Deſign: 'Twas He who preſerv'd <hi>Health</hi> in the Camp and in the Fleet, and made their <hi>Councils harmonious:</hi> 'Twas He that prefac'd this memorable Event by the Capture of the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant:</hi>—And therefore to him let us aſcribe the Glory; <hi>Whoſe right Hand and holy Arm hath given us the Victory, and made us tread upon the high Places of our Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely the ſame ſuperintending <hi>Providence,</hi> that directed the Arrow to pierce between the Joynts of <hi>Ahab's Harnace,</hi> guided the <hi>Bombs</hi> to the Annoyance of the <hi>Iſland-Battery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither ſhould the ſeaſonable <hi>Juncture</hi> of the <hi>Surrender,</hi> be paſſed over in ſordid
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005700_0039_1026C6E7EB880B00"/>
Silence and ſtupid Neglect, when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that the very Day after it, news were brought to our Army of <hi>Two Thouſand five Hundred French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> within ſeven Miles of them, deſign'd for the Relief of <hi>Louis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh;</hi> which if they had heard of before the Surrender, would probably have encouraged them to a vigorous and obſtinate Reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>I may add my Brethren, that this merciful Succeſs has been given in anſwer to <hi>Prayer,</hi> which ſhould excite the more our Love and Praiſe; <hi>I love the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>becauſe he hath heard my Supplication, becauſe he hath enclin'd his Ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.</hi> The Army that Almighty God chiefly uſed in bringing to paſs this great Event, were a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Army; of which, as it is reported, <hi>General</hi> PEPPEREL gave them a noble Example!</p>
            <p>Sirs, when we conſider how much we have by Sin abus'd the paſt Mercies that a gracious God has vouchſaf'd upon us, we have Reaſon to be aſtoniſh'd at this additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal immerited and important Benefit! <hi>therefore, praiſe ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new Song, and his Praiſe in the Congregation of Saints. Let</hi> Iſrael <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:005700_0040_1026C6EB0118C300"/>
in him that made him: Let the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Zyon <hi>be joyful in their King. Let them Praiſe his Name in the Dance: Let them ſing Praiſes with the Timbrel and Harp; for the Lord taketh Pleaſure in his People: He will beautify the Meek with Salvation. Let the Saints be joyful in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Let them ſing aloud upon their Beds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD's People are eſpecially call'd upon to praiſe their God, with all proper Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Eſteem and Honour, both in their private Retirements and publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, from a Principle of Love to and Joy in him, becauſe of his Dominion over them, delight in them, and marvelous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for them, as well as gracious Deſigns to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them in after Time. He is a King that taketh Pleaſure in his Peoples Proſperity, and has made <hi>Iſrael</hi> what ſhe is in Point of Priviledge both Civil and Religious, and will beautify the Meek with Salvation, <hi>i. e.</hi> adorn the humble with temporal Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, crown their attempts with Succeſſes, and at laſt inſtate their Perſons in eternal Happineſs.
