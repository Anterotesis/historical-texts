            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE great light of the world, and the only living and true way to God and happineſs, having ſaid, as in Matt. vii. 13 and 14, <hi>Enter ye in at the ſtraight gate: For wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to deſtruction; and many there be which go in thereat: For ſtraight is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth to life; and few there be that find it.</hi> He then immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adds in the two next verſes, <hi>Beware of</hi> falſe prophets, <hi>which come to you in ſheep's cloathing; but inwardly they are ravening wolves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Ye ſhall know them by their fruits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE our divine teacher and maſter gives us to underſtand, that they are <hi>falſe prophets,</hi> or teachers, who encourage them, that <hi>enter the wide gate, and walk in the broad way to deſtruction,</hi> that <hi>they ſhalt all be ſaved:</hi> And He directs us to <hi>beware of ſuch falſe teachers,</hi> however fair and innocent they may appear: For they are inimical to the flocks of our Lord.</p>
            <p>AND, that ſo ſuch <hi>falſe teachers</hi> may be diſcovered; our Lord, who <hi>knew what was in man, and who indeed knew all men,</hi> acquaints us, that <hi>by their fruits ye ſhall know them;</hi> which may intend and mean, that ye ſhall not only <hi>know them by their own fruits,</hi> or from their own irregular, worldly and ſenſual lives and converſations; but <hi>ye ſhall know them</hi> alſo by <hi>the fruits of their doctrine:</hi> For their doctrine will ſurely produce thoſe <hi>fruits whereof</hi> the children of men <hi>may well be aſhamed;</hi> and of which they may well be afraid,—for <hi>the end of them will be death,</hi> and even everlaſting deſtruction.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE may <hi>theſe things be</hi> duly <hi>conſidered</hi> by us: <hi>And the Lord grant us underſtanding in all things</hi> to know and practice his will and our duty; that ſo, being found in <hi>this good old way,</hi> we may obtain and enjoy perfect and everlaſting <hi>reſt</hi> and happineſs;— while the ungodly and vicious ſhall be <hi>condemned in judgment, nor ſuffered an admiſſion into the congregation of the righteous.</hi>

            <head>An <hi>ANSWER</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Title Page noticed.</head>
               <p>THE charitable author of the pamphlet, intitled, <hi>Salvation for all Men,</hi> unhappily ſtumbles and falls at the threſhold of his performance: For even the title page is not without its er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.—It is this, <hi>Salvation for all men illuſtrated and vindicated as a ſcripture doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HAD the writer intended and ſaid, <hi>Salvation for all men revealed and offered</hi> in the goſpel; <hi>this</hi> would have paſſed well enough for a ſcriptural doctrine. But, that <hi>all men ſhall actually obtain ſalvation</hi> ſooner or later, which is the intent and meaning of this writer; <hi>this</hi> cannot be fairly illuſtrated from the ſacred writings; nor can it be truly and honeſtly vindicated as a <hi>ſcriptural doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT how is it propoſed to illuſtrate and vindicate <hi>this?</hi> Not, it ſhould ſeem, from the ſtudies and endeavours of this generous <hi>well-wiſher to all mankind;</hi> but <hi>in numerous extracts from a variety of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and learned men, who have purpoſely written on this ſubject; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their anſwer to the objections urged againſt it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE are not certain as to the <hi>piety and learning</hi> of theſe perſons, to be hereafter quoted by him. The extracts from them afford no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient evidence of the one or the other. But, were they ever ſo learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pious, they were only weak and fallible mortals, like their neighbours: And it will be found, upon due examination, that they have imbibed error, and endeavoured to promote it.</p>
               <p>THE author of this pamplet, or the collector of theſe various ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, is pleaſed to give himſelf <hi>the flattering title</hi> of <hi>One who wiſhes well to all mankind.</hi> But his whole farrago of <hi>extracts</hi> gives no ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory evidence of his being ſo: For it is probable, that his ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>racts may prove hurtful and ruinous to many: And, if they ſhould do ſo, <hi>his wiſhing them well</hi> will make no ſufficient amends for it.</p>
               <p>THE collector then quotes the ſpeech of <hi>the Angel</hi> to the Shepherds at <hi>Bethlehem.</hi>—And he is chargeable with a faulty miſapplication of it: For <hi>the good tidings of great joy,</hi> promulged by the Angel <hi>to all people,</hi> was <hi>the birth of the Saviour,</hi> the CHRIST of GOD: But if
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017603_0005_0FA1DA9F29821558"/>
this extractor meant to inſinuate, as he doubtleſs did, that the Angel declared <hi>univerſal ſalvation</hi> to be given <hi>to all people, as matter of great joy</hi> to them; as it is not true, we ſee not but that he muſt be taxed as <hi>handling the word of the Lord</hi> by his Angel <hi>deceitfully.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND now having got over the threſhold, we may go into <hi>the porch,</hi> or the preface, and give a few ſtrictures upon the ſame before we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the dome, that is conſtructed of traſh, errors and falſhoods.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Preface conſidered.</head>
               <p>THE preface begins, That <hi>mankind ſhall univerſally,</hi> in the final iſſue of the goſpel plan of mercy, <hi>be de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ivered from the bondage of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. and be admitted to the felicity of the ſons of GOD,</hi> is no novel doctrine, as many may be ready to imagine. It is very true, as he ſays, that <hi>it is no novel doctrine:</hi> But in truth it is an <hi>old error</hi> revived, that has been again and again refuted, and repeatedly exploded; and like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urd, it has <hi>come up in a night, and periſhed in a night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEN the preface goes on; it was, as ſome writers on the ſubject have obſerved, received as a revealed truth by <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Clemens of Alexandria,</hi> in the latter end of the ſecond century.</p>
               <p>IN anſwer to which it may be ſaid, that it is queſtionable whether <hi>Origen</hi> received this as a revealed truth, that <hi>all men will be ſaved,</hi> and even <hi>the Devils</hi> too; though he has often been taxed with hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this. For we are well aſſured, that one <hi>Ruffians</hi> has taken the unbecoming and licentious liberty with <hi>Origen</hi>'s works to leave out of them, and to add to them, as he pleaſed; which, as that learned and judicious writer of <hi>eccleſiaſtical hiſtory,</hi> Mr. <hi>Du Pin,</hi> has obſerved, has occaſioned ſome to doubt, whether a great part of thoſe works, publiſhed under his name, were <hi>Origen</hi>'s or no.</p>
               <p>AND as for <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> though he writes indeed of one <hi>Epheſies,</hi> who learned from barbarous philosophy, that <hi>there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgation by fire of them that have lived badly;</hi> yet we do not recollect that he any where writes this as his own ſentiment, and that he tho't all mankind would be finally happy. And although he writes in his fourth book of <hi>Stromes,</hi> that <hi>whenſoever ſinners do repent, whether here in this world, or in the next, they may be received to GOD's mercy;</hi> it muſt be ſaid, that nothing can be offered from the ſacred writings to ſupport it, as to the future world. —But this his aſſertion is not only contrary to the ſacred ſcriptures, but it ſhews a forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of what he had written before and is inconſiſtent with it: For he had before aſſerted, that <hi>after our calling to the knowledge of the truth, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>l; GOD might grant to them, that have ſinned a recovery into their former ſtate for once or twice by repentance: But if they ſhould fall oftener into ſin, then there is no more reſtitution to be expected or hoped for, but a fearful looking for a final judgment.—Clemens</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may here be ſet againſt <hi>Clemens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:017603_0006_0FA1DAA04CB3FFB8"/>BUT was it really fact, that both theſe fathers received and owned this tenet, <hi>the ſalvation of all,</hi> as an evangelical truth? It muſt be acknowledged however, that they were really but miſtaken mortals: And they have actually ſhewed themſelves to be ſo, by admitting <hi>as a revealed truth,</hi> if they have done ſo, a palpable error.</p>
               <p>IT is then added by the prefacer; <hi>It appears from</hi> Auſtin and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom, <hi>and other celebrated writers in their day, that it was not then a new or uncommon tenet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT this is a very fallacious account: And, if the writer of it was acquainted with <hi>Auſtin's and Jerom's</hi> works; he writes not honeſtly, but with a deſign to deceive: For many, by this account, would be led to think, that thoſe fathers were favourers of this tenet of <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſalvation:</hi> Whereas <hi>both</hi> of them have written plainly, explicitly and ſtrongly againſt it.</p>
               <p>THE prefacer then mentions <hi>a variety of books in various languages,</hi> publiſhed in favor of this doctrine; and particularly <hi>an ingenious piece</hi> written in French by a noble miniſter in the court of the King of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> ſtiled, <hi>A treatiſe on the univerſal reſtitution of the creation:</hi> What a pity it is, that our prefacer has not favored us with ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts from <hi>this ingenious piece?</hi>—But theſe writers that have been mentioned have never yet ſhewed themſelves able to prove, to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the wiſe and judicious, <hi>the univerſal ſalvation of men and of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>HEREUPON this new writer adds, that there is a <hi>conſiderable number of other books on the ſame ſubject now extant in</hi> Engliſh And what then? this is only telling us, what we knew before, that mankind are prone to errors; and they are apt too ſoon and eaſily both to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and to promote them, as far as they can, among others.</p>
               <p>BUT here our prefacer ſees cauſe to mention one or two, out of many others, as favourers of his charming <hi>doctrine of univerſal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe is "<hi>Jeremiah White,</hi> chaplain to <hi>Oliver Cromwell;</hi> (who, by the way, had no chaplain to his own particular family, nor wanted one; for he always <hi>bleſſed his own houſhold;</hi> though he had a <hi>chaplain</hi> for his ſtate family;) <hi>and an eminently pious good man, who has written a large book in vindication of God's goodneſs to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted at laſt in the recovery of the whole lower creation from the fall.</hi>" If by <hi>this lower creation,</hi> we underſtand the <hi>whole terraqueous globe; this</hi> will undoubtedly be recovered from its preſent morbid and languiſhing condition. But, if it is to be underſtood, that all the finally wicked and impenitent will be recovered to perfect hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; the pious good man has advanced an idle whim and an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous fancy.</p>
               <p>THEN after pious good <hi>White,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hartley</hi> is mentioned as a man of known ſerious piety, who, in his <hi>obſervations on man, has ſeveral chapters on the ſalvation of all men:</hi> And it is ſaid of him, that <hi>he
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017603_0007_0FA1DAA111C06B18"/>
was a diſciple of Mr.</hi> John Weſley; <hi>and, in common with him and all his followers, a believer in the reſtoration of all mankind in God's time and way to final happineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MR <hi>John Weſley</hi> may be a precious good man too, as well as the Doctor his diſciple; and the reſt of his diſciples may be precious good people alſo: With all our hearts.—But good people may hold errors; and with reſpect to the point of doctrine which they are ſaid to hold, we ſcruple not to ſay, it is an error that is held in common by them, and may endanger the happineſs of others, as well as their own.</p>
               <p>BUT why muſt good Dr. <hi>Hartley</hi> be introduced and commended for holding this error as a truth? If the real truth of the caſe had been known by this prefacer, he ſhould have been ſo fair and candid as to have informed his readers, that the good doctor was ſtrong in the opinion concerning <hi>fatality:</hi> and in order to ſupport this favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite doctrine, he found it neceſſary to bring forward, and plead for, the error of the <hi>univerſal ſalvation of men:</hi> And herein he has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played a conſiſtence in his errors: For if GOD be the cauſe or <hi>author</hi> of all the actions in the world, good and bad; does it not ſeem fit and right to render the <hi>doers of the bad actions,</hi> as well as good, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy? for they have acted by his impulſe and according to his will, when they have been diſobedient to his commandments.— Thus, we may ſee, that one error prepares the way for the ſupport of another; as indeed <hi>this doctrine of univerſal ſalvation</hi> opens the door for the reception and maintenance of other errors and deluſions: and therefore all conſiderate people have need to be on their guard againſt it.</p>
               <p>BUT let us now ſee, <hi>what</hi> our prefacer ſays, <hi>it may not be unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to add here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and this is, as follows: <hi>It is freely and fully acknowledged by all the above writers, that</hi> many among the ſons and daughters of <hi>Adam</hi> will <hi>paſs through a ſtate of unutterable miſery,</hi> before they will be prepared for and admited to, the joys of GOD'S preſence in the heavenly world.</p>
               <p>WHAT a fine diſcovery have we here! Though it is no novelty. Here are ſome perſons, that would be thought by themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who however are repreſented as declaring for the <hi>Popiſh</hi> doctrine of <hi>purgatory,</hi> though not in plain and explicit terms, yet in truth and reality: for they think, that the wicked, by paſſing through a <hi>ſtate of unutterable miſery,</hi> are to be <hi>prepared for a ſtate</hi> of perfect happineſs. And is not this <hi>ſtate of miſery</hi> then to be accounted <hi>purgatorial?</hi> Precious doctrine indeed, which can neither profit them that advance it, nor any others! There is however one thing wanting to complete the ſcheme; and this is, There ſhould be <hi>certain prieſts</hi> ſet apart to <hi>ſay maſſes</hi> for the <hi>reſt of their ſouls in</hi> purgatory, and <hi>their releaſe from it!</hi> And they ſhould do this kind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ice for them on the account of ſome pecuniary conſideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:017603_0008_0FA1DAA164FE8520"/>THIS <hi>ſtate of unutterable miſery,</hi> the prefacer judges it proper to mention as <hi>taking place before the reſtoration</hi> of the wicked to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; becauſe, as he acquaints us, <hi>a ſtranger</hi> under the aſſumed character of a preacher in direct contradiction, not only to all the writers before-mentioned, but to the whole tenor of the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment books, has <hi>held forth the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation; and, according to him, a man may go to heaven, notwithſtanding all the ſins that he has been guilty of in the courſe of his life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT <hi>wherein he judges another, does he not condemn his own ſelf?</hi> For is it not the plain and manifeſt tendency of the doctrine col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by our extracter to ſhew forth <hi>the univerſal ſalvation of men,</hi> and even the very worſt of them, after ſome intervening and <hi>unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able puniſhment:</hi> And where then is the mighty difference between <hi>this ſtranger</hi> and this novel extracter? For they converge and meet in the ſame point of doctrine, <hi>the ſalvation of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND yet our prefacer ſays, with a placid air and a great deal of aſſurance ſuch a doctrine <hi>looks very like an encouragement to liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm; and falls in with the ſcheme of too many in this degenerate age; who, under pretence of promoting religion, undermine it at the very root.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WITHOUT criticiſing here on the <hi>undermining of a root</hi> inſtead of a <hi>foundation;</hi> we will venture to ſay, that not only the doctrine of the wandering <hi>ſtranger</hi> but the <hi>ſtrange doctrine of our extracter,</hi> whether he has the <hi>real</hi> or <hi>aſſumed character of a preacher</hi> or not, <hi>not only looks like,</hi> but they both really and in fact are <hi>encouragements to libertiniſm:</hi> And, if they ſhould be generally received and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, they not only <hi>may,</hi> but certainly <hi>will, prove as hurtful to civil ſociety as to religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HEREUPON the preface writer delivers a pathetic wiſh; <hi>would to GOD it might be realized as an undoubted truth, that there is the ſame reaſon to believe there is a Hell, as a Heaven.</hi>—And may we not take leave to add our fervent wiſh? Would to GOD it might be realized, that there is the ſame reaſon from ſcripture to believe, that <hi>the puniſhment of the wicked in Hell will be eternal,</hi> as there is to believe, that <hi>the happineſs of the righteous</hi> in Heaven will be ſo? For the very ſame terms are uſed for the <hi>former</hi> as for the latter. And we unite with the preface writer in ſaying, that thoſe, who are <hi>infidels</hi> as to <hi>the former, would do well to take care, leſt they ſhould know from their own experience the horrors,</hi> and we add <hi>the eternal ones,</hi> of that dreadful place.</p>
               <p>THE prefacer lets us know, that the following doctrine, held forth in his extracts, <hi>is capable of being perverted and abuſed: Which,</hi> he ſays <hi>is the truth with every other doctrine.</hi>—And we are taught to conceive, that the chriſtian religion is <hi>the doctrine according to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs:</hi> And we have cauſe to be perſuaded, that <hi>every truth</hi> of this religion is calculated and adapted to promote piety and virtue: Whereas every error and falſhood has a contrary tendency: And
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017603_0009_0FA1DAA25BAB0200"/>
this verily is the eaſe of <hi>that particular error,</hi> which is held forth by our <hi>well wiſhing</hi> extracter. And, if any <hi>turn the grace,</hi> which our prefacer intends to magnify, <hi>into wantonneſs;</hi> while they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect proper <hi>

               <p>THE pamphlet, intitled, <hi>Salvation for all men,</hi> is aptly deſigned and accommodated to make bad men eaſy, and cauſe them to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue deceived and hardened in their wicked and vicious choices and ways; and to unhinge the minds of ſerious and well diſpoſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from the truth, on which they were ſettled, and to betray them into errors, iniquity and ruin.</p>
               <p>IT may probably therefore be of ſome conſequence and advantage to take this inſidious pamphlet into a ſerious and impartial conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and to ſhew the erroneous and wrong notions that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed in it and by it. And as this has been requeſted by a number of ſerious, virtuous and godly perſons; hence it has been underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
               <p>THE author of the pamphlet would have us to think him contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and oppoſite to the notion that has been carried about by a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from <hi>England,</hi> who, inſtead of following the buſineſs of the world, has been <hi>preaching up the general ſalvation of all mankind,</hi> without any future puniſhment at all for the wicked; for, according to him, as it is ſaid, their follies and crimes will be laid on <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:</hi> And he therefore alone will bear the puniſhment of them.</p>
               <p>BUT although this author appears to be averſe to the doctrine of this <hi>ſtranger;</hi> and he owns and profeſſes himſelf to be <hi>a believer of the puniſhment of the wicked in the future ſtate;</hi> yet he is plainly for <hi>confining this puniſhment,</hi> however ſevere and unutterable, <hi>to a limited ſeaſon:</hi> And he has ranſacked ſome books, and produced ſome authorities, to ſupport his hypotheſis and to gain it a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reception among mankind.</p>

               <p>THE doctrine of the future ſtate of puniſhment, as to <hi>the eternity of it,</hi> if not as to <hi>the extremity</hi> of it, ſeems by ſome accounts to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> and the learned Father <hi>Jerom.</hi> bare their teſtimony againſt it, as having an unhappy tendency to promote and encourage all manner of vice and wickedneſs and a continuance in the ſame.</p>
               <p>BUT ſince thoſe early times of chriſtianity, this doctrine of <hi>the eternal duration of the puniſhment</hi> of the wicked has been oppoſed at one time and another by ſome particular perſons; and it has been ſo particularly in the preſent century, as well as in that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding it: However it has not yet been ſubverted; but it has ſtood its ground; Nor is it to be overthrown by any thing we have yet ſeen advanced againſt it, nor will it be overturned: For <hi>the truth is great</hi> and ſtrong; and though for a ſeaſon there my be a running upon it and a ſtriving againſt it, <hi>it will ſurely prevail</hi> and ſtand ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</p>
               <p>BUT, in order to its ſtanding and prevailing againſt oppoſition, it is highly proper and requiſite, that ſome one or other ſhould ſet <hi>the preſent truth</hi> in a fair light, prove it a chriſtian doctrine, and endeavour to eſtabliſh wavering chriſtians in the faith of it, left, <hi>being led away with the error</hi> of the deceiving or <hi>the wicked, they ſhould fall from their ſtedfaſtneſs.</hi>

               <p>THIS fine introduction of Mr. ingenious <hi>White,</hi> which our collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſays <hi>breathes a ſpirit of piety and benevolence,</hi> is however only a ſpecious and plauſible repreſentation of error: nor is there any thing in it but fancy and flouriſh to ſupport and eſtabliſh the truth of it.</p>

               <p>THE firſt text that he produces is found, 1 Tim. ii. 3.4. <hi>God our Saviour, who will have all men to be ſaved, and come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth.</hi> Upon which Mr. <hi>White</hi> obſerves that the <hi>letter of this text is full and expreſs: God will have all men to be ſaved: And ſhould we preſs it, there are almoſt as many arguments as words.</hi> For 1ſt, it is not ſaid, that <hi>God would have all men to be ſaved by his good will,</hi> but that <hi>he authoritatively wills it; wills it</hi> as a being of ſupreme, uncontroulable power; a being, that will be obeyed in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpite of the corrupt diſpoſitions of men or the miſchievous arts of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils: It is <hi>a fixed, determinate immutable will, not tranſient nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokable: Thus powerfully and irreſiſtably does God will all men to be ſaved.</hi> This is all <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> freely ſaid of his own head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and has no truth in it: For God has no where ſaid in his word, that he <hi>authoritatively wills the ſalvation of all men,</hi> ſo as powerfully and irreſiſtably to effect it. But he goes on, <hi>As God wills the end, he wills the neceſſary means leading to it: he will have all men come to the knowledge of the truth:</hi> For, <hi>no man is or can be ſanctified and ſaved without the knowledge of the truth</hi> —And further <hi>he</hi> remarks that <hi>this will has its ground in the eſſential benevolence of the divine nature.</hi> And to what does this amount, but <hi>that God is not willing that any ſhould periſh?</hi> And he has therefore <hi>furniſhed them with the means of grace and ſalvation.</hi> But, as to God's abſolutely, powerfully and irreſiſtably willing it, ſo as that it ſhall certainly and infallibly take place, the <hi>word of God ſays no ſuch thing:</hi> and he not only <hi>adds to the word of God in ſaying as he has, but he palms an untruth</hi> upon it.—And yet to his corrupt fancy he applies, 1 Tim. vi. 13. that, <hi>God quickens all things:</hi> which intends and means, that <hi>he</hi> from his quickning influence <hi>maketh all things that are living, to be alive:</hi> which is nothing to his purpoſe. And then, ſays he, our ſaviour tells us, <hi>all things live to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> as in Luke xx. 38: which is in Greek <hi>Pantes, all,</hi> not things; but it means men, particularly the <hi>pious and faithful Patriarchs</hi> before mentioned: and this is far from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and meaning: but there is one thing, which follows, that is quite inexcuſeable. Mark, ſays he, <hi>who is this Saviour,</hi> i. e. of all men? <hi>It is GOD, and not CHRIST.</hi> Let us only look into 1 Tim. ii. 3, and we ſhall ſee who is <hi>God our Saviour:</hi> And we ſhall ſee, that in the <hi>Greek</hi> it runs, <hi>in the ſight of the Saviour our GOD:</hi> and ſervants are enjoined to <hi>ſhew all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of GOD our Saviour in all things,</hi> in Tit. ii. 10. But it is in the <hi>Greek,</hi> that <hi>they may adorn the doctrine of the Saviour, our GOD in all things:</hi> And how contrary is this to the interpretation of Mr. <hi>White,</hi> as well as other Arians. However it is <hi>the truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi> the ſaviour GOD, and <hi>worthy of acceptation.</hi>

               <p>OUR extracter then tells us, that our author Mr. <hi>White,</hi> further illuſtrates his reaſoning by the following words: <hi>For there is one God and one mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time;</hi> as at the 5th and 6th verſes. 1. <hi>There is one GOD,</hi> or more properly as he ſays, <hi>God is one.</hi> Though it is more literally and exactly in the Greek, <hi>one God</hi> This he ſtrangely explains, <hi>all men, reprobated as well as elect, have one and the ſelf ſame GOD.</hi> But, if he means, that <hi>GOD is the ſelf-ſame GOD to the reprobate,</hi> as well as to the elect, to bleſs them and make them eternally happy; he is groſly miſtaken himſelf, and he tries to deceive others by it.—Again, 2. <hi>The Mediator is alſo one:</hi> And he interprets it, that <hi>He is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between GOD and all men: He is not nearer to one party of the human race than another.</hi> But he ſays more than he has au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the text to ſay, and he ſinfully adds to it. —And, 3.

But although this mediator <hi>has given himſelf a ranſom for all:</hi> For it muſt be granted, that he has given <hi>a ſufficient ranſom and propitiation for all;</hi> and he <hi>will not caſt out abroad any,</hi> who penitently come to him as he requires, to gain and enjoy the benefit of it; yet it is no where ſaid that they, who <hi>will not come to him for life</hi> and happineſs <hi>ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the benefit of</hi> his ranſom and propitiation. And, whereas Mr. <hi>White,</hi> who may be called <hi>an interpreter, one of a thouſand</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting amiſs, has explained <hi>to be teſtified in due time</hi> that <hi>there ſhall a time come when the reconciliation ſhall finally operate on all,</hi> &amp;c. he has egregiouſly erred from the truth: For theſe words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to what went before: And according to the learned <hi>Grotius,</hi> they ſignify, that <hi>CHRIST gave himſelf to death as a ranſom</hi> in the proper ſeaſon; and that not merely that he might <hi>yield a teſtimony to the truth of his doctrine;</hi> but that he might lay down his life <hi>in the proper time and ſeaſon, of which the prophets predicted:</hi> And this appears to be all that is meant by it.</p>
               <p>AND then, there is another text, produced by our author that is, Mr. <hi>White,</hi> in 1 Tim. iv. 10, <hi>The living GOD, who is the Saviour of all men; eſpecially of thoſe that believe.</hi> Here he allows, <hi>that GOD is the common Saviour of the whole human race;</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of them that <hi>believe the goſpel of his ſon.</hi> But although <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have the advantage above other men;</hi> yet this does not prove that <hi>GOD is not their Saviour: Becauſe he condemne them to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, he has not caſt them off.</hi> His meaning is, that <hi>GOD will be their final and eternal Saviour.</hi>

               <p>THEN Mr <hi>White,</hi> according to our extractor, ſays, if we turn to 1 Cor xv 22 &amp;c. we ſhall ſee this matter cleared up. But, if we are not miſtaken, his interpretation will only <hi>enlighten our minds with a beam of darkneſs,</hi> as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n ancient writer has expreſſed it. The text is, <hi>As in Adam all die; ſo in CHRIST ſhall all be made alive:</hi> This is interpreted for us, that <hi>believers will be raiſed to everlaſting lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p>THERE is certainly nothing of this ſort ſaid in the text: nor is there any thing offered in it from which it may be juſtly argued. The moſt, that can be gathered from it is, that <hi>as in</hi> Adam <hi>all died, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive;</hi> i. e. by a <hi>reſurrection from the dead</hi> But it may be juſtly remarked here; that the latter clauſe may be read; ſo <hi>in Chriſt all,</hi> or, <hi>all in Chriſt ſhall be made alive.</hi> And the learned Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> has very well paraphraſed it; and we muſt be allowed to ſay, we think better than Mr. <hi>White,</hi> that <hi>all of his nature and ſpirit ſhall be made alive.</hi> And ſo indeed it follows: <hi>In CHSIST all ſhall be made alive.</hi> How? it follows, <hi>every man in his own order, Chriſt the firſt fruits; afterwards they that are Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>at his coming;</hi> and no others are mentioned.</p>
               <p>BY our collector we are referred to the ingenious <hi>White</hi> for his next quotation, and the ſenſe of it. This is out of Rom. v. from verſe 15 to 19.

               <p>
                  <hi>THE laſt quotation,</hi> ſays our extractor, <hi>I ſhall make from Mr. White,</hi> is his remarks on Epheſ. i 10. and Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſ 1.20 The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of theſe paſſages he makes to be that <hi>all men,</hi> all things, <hi>were originally made by CHRIST<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> headed by him,</hi> &amp;c <hi>There was no war, no fighting, no diſorder; theſe all came by ſin But GOD ſent his ſon to recover them out of this ſtate: And he has laid an effectual plan for it.</hi> And he ſums up the matter, <hi>that there is nothing in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or earth, which ſhall not be finally reconciled to GOD</hi> Thus <hi>there will be a recapitulation of all things under CHRIST and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal reſtoration to favor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHAT a fine ſtory is here; and how admirably is it adapted to pleaſe the fine fancy of the author, and gain upon the imagination of weak people! But let us now ſee, what more enlightened and wiſe interpreters have ſaid upon theſe ſcriptural paſſages.</p>
               <p>IT is the plain deſign of Epheſ. i. 10, to ſignify, that <hi>the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed are to be gathered together in to one flock, by Chriſt as their head, even the things in heaven and earth;</hi> which, as <hi>Grotius</hi> juſtly notes, the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call <hi>the ſuperior and inferior family of God.</hi> The <hi>Jews,</hi> as he obſerves, hated the Aliens as idolaters: And the <hi>Jews</hi> on the account of the diverſity of their inſtitutions, were diſagreeable to the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> but now <hi>they of both nations, as they come to Chriſt, will be friends, yea brethren,</hi> among themſelves, and together <hi>one people of God:</hi> And let it be noted, that they will be reduced under <hi>Chriſt their head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT the plain &amp; natural ſenſe of the words according to various learned authors, may be given thus, that it is the divine deſign and intention, under the <hi>diſpenſation of the goſpel,</hi> here called in the Greek, <hi>the diſpenſation of the filling up of the ſeaſons, to rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pitulate;</hi> to bring them by a penitent faith to a reconciliation to God, and ſo to good terms with all the heavenly beings, and to bring them thus to an union, and good agreement among themſelves: thus heaven and earth will be reconciled.: And they are thus in Chriſt, as <hi>the head</hi> recapitulated and gathered together in one. And it muſt be putting a ſtrange force on the words to make them ſignify <hi>the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of the wicked and impenitent to the divine favour and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſs: They are not adapted to convey any ſuch wrong apprehenſion, only to ſuch as are fond of errors and deluſions, and love deceit.</p>
               <p>BUT now let us hear inſtead of Mr. <hi>White,</hi> what the learned and judicious <hi>Beza</hi> has to ſay, on Col. i. 20. Now he underſtands it <hi>of the whole church,</hi> which, contains in it <hi>things in heaven and things in earth.</hi>

                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:017603_0016_0FA1DC935A9E0A88"/>ORIGIN, as it has been ſaid, gathered from <hi>this,</hi> but very unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly that it would ſome time come to paſs, <hi>that damned men and devils would be reconciled to God and ſaved.</hi> But the moſt diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing learned and judicous interpreters both <hi>Proteſtant and Roman Catholic,</hi> underſtand it, that <hi>God by the ſhedding of the blood of his ſon on the croſs, has reconciled all to himſelf both in heaven and earth, and men as well as angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND we may add here the interpretations which the learned and judicious Mr <hi>Dail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>é</hi> has given of this text: which is, <hi>the will of GOD was to reconcile things on earth and in Heaven by his ſon,</hi> and reduce all the parts of the univerſe unto good terms each with the other: This great work is begun; the foundations of it are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; the pledges of it are given us; but it will not be perfectly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed until the <hi>latter day;</hi> when the world, free from <hi>the bondage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which it yet groaneth</hi> ſhall be entirely changed; <hi>its new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and its new earth,</hi> and its new elements, with the angels and the ſaints, and all the other parts of the world, conſpiring together in eternal concord and in inviolable correſpondence to the glory of their common creator, who, as the apoſtle ſays, ſhall then <hi>be all in all.</hi> Thus he.</p>
               <p>AND it is very ſure and certain beſides, that the beſt expoſitors, both ancient and modern, whoſe expoſitions we need not tarry to annex to thoſe that we have mentioned have not given ſuch a <hi>lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>ANOTHER portion of ſcripture, proceeds our extractor, mentioned by another writer may be found in 1 Corinth. xv. from 24th to 28th verſe. And this writer thinks <hi>it is here moſt peremptorily affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that univerſal ſubjection to CHRIST ſhall be effected: And the affirmation,</hi> he ſays, is expreſſed in a variety of as ſtrong and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive terms as could have been uſed, as <hi>by putting down all rule, all authority, and all power; by putting all enemies and all things under his feet,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>BUT there are very learned men beſides <hi>Grotius,</hi> who, by <hi>the all rule, principality and power, that are to be put down,</hi> underſtand <hi>all
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017603_0017_0FA1DC941BDB2638"/>
the empires and kingdoms of the world, and all the leſſer governments.</hi> And when it is ſaid, that after the <hi>ſubjection of theſe the ſon himſelf will become ſubject:</hi> they underſtand the meaning of it to be, that the glorious ſon of GOD will be as <hi>an ambaſſador,</hi> who, having laid aſide the buſineſs and burthen of his embaſſy, will ſtill retain his priſtine dignity and glory.</p>
               <p>AND it may be adviſeable here to give out in a particular manner the ſentiments of the excellent <hi>Witſius,</hi> excellent and celebrated both for learning and piety: Now theſe are his thoughts, that the divine, eſſential and natural kingdom of the Meſſiah is nothing ſhort of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: Dan. iv. 34 That the manhood of the Meſſiah will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever perſonally united to his Godhead, and will therein enjoy a glory far above all the creatures of GOD: Phil 11 8: That the Meſſiah will be forever <hi>the head of the church;</hi> and conſidered, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and celebrated by it, as being <hi>the head,</hi> the moſt illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious member of that body; and finally, that there will be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting effects of the Meſſiah's mediatorial kingdom; ſuch as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulgence of the Divine majeſty and glory in the perſon of the GOD man, and the full deliverance of the people of GOD from all their enemies and afflictions; and eſpecially the full abolition of all their ſins. This bleſſedneſs of the people of GOD will be forever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as obtained by the Meſſiah and the ſpirit inhabiting the faithful. And our apoſtle makes it his deſign every where to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh theſe things. But, after the day of judgment, and <hi>at the end, the mediatorial kingdom</hi> of our Lord will come into other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. <hi>Firſt, the preſent oeconomy will be at an end: All rule,</hi> as it now is, <hi>ſhall be put down.</hi> Then, our Lord will give an account concerning the conſummation of his whole <hi>mediatorial undertaking</hi> to obtain and apply the ſalvation of his church, and preſent it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out defect to him, the Father: And this may be meant by <hi>deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the kingdom to GOD.</hi> And then, as <hi>all ſin,</hi> with all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of it, will be removed; there appears not to be any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need of a mediator, which <hi>there will be until then</hi> It ſeems therefore, that the Deity will now more immediately make its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications to the bleſſed, as unto the angels: which favor will be forever owned as owing to the merits of their Saviour: Thus <hi>GOD will be all in all.</hi> And in fine, our Lord in his human nature, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from his mediatorial function, that he had faithfully diſcharged, <hi>will be ſubject to GOD,</hi> with his brethren, and at the head of them, <hi>in the moſt excellent glory,</hi> and without any diminution of the glory, which he now enjoys. And we ſhall conclude with giving you the learned <hi>Witſius</hi>'s compariſon for it; <hi>As any ſon of a king, who goes from his father with the higheſt power to ſubdue rebels and vindicate citizens from the tyrannical uſurpation, having happily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed the buſineſs according to the pleaſure of the father, and laying aſide the laborious empire, of which there is now no further uſe; he will now and henceforth ſecurely live in the delights of the royal court.</hi> Thus <hi>the ſon himſelf will alſo become ſubject.</hi> And, as the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017603_0018_0FA1DC94DC23A4D0"/>
                  <hi>mediatorial kingdom</hi> of our Lord ſuppoſes and intimates ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in his church; <hi>this wiſe and good end of it,</hi> makes not for the diſhonor, but for <hi>the glory, of our bleſſed Lord</hi> and Saviour.</p>
               <p>WE have beſides at hand the accounts, which the Baron <hi>Puſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf,</hi> and ſundry others of eminence for learning and piety, have given of this place, that are quite different from the crude and looſe no ions of this author. But we apprehend, that truth enough has been offered to ſhew the error and falſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y of the notions of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known author.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THERE is another</hi> text, ſays our extracter, <hi>produced by the ſame author,</hi> which is <hi>the very firſt, that reveals the promiſe of a Saviour and ſummarily comprehends the whole of what has been ſaid concerning the reduction of mankind univerſally to an obedient ſubjection to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning will of GOD.</hi> Such, alas! is the ignorance and fooliſhneſs of ſome among mankind, that when they have embraced any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar notion and mere whimſy in religion, they ſoon contract a fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for it: And they will then apply as many paſſages of ſcripture as they can, and put them to the rack and torture, to make them confeſs their favorite opinion.</p>
               <p>THUS this unknown writer will have this paſſage in <hi>Geneſis</hi> to be underſtood as conveying his own ſenſe and corroborating of it; becauſe he has a mind that it ſhall do ſo; which ſenſe of his is, in a narrow compaſs, that <hi>ſin ſhall be totally deſtroyed by the reduction of all men under moral ſubjection to GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT there is not the leaſt countenance given to this fancy in the text: It is all the forgery of his own brain from it: All, that can be fairly and honeſtly gathered from this paſſage is, that after the apoſtacy, there <hi>was an enmity commenced between the woman and the ſerpent, and between his ſeed and hers.</hi> Now <hi>the ſeat,</hi> where in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy ariſing from <hi>this enmity</hi> will be maintained, is the preſent world. And the only queſtion is, who ſhall get the better? Now it is moſt certain, that <hi>the ſeed of the woman</hi> will be victorious over the devil; and he will <hi>deſtroy all the works of the devil:</hi> And when he comes to judge and rule the world at the laſt day; he will <hi>cauſe the earth and the works therein to be burnt up:</hi> When <hi>the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhall be conſumed out of the earth and the wicked be no more,</hi> as in Pſalm. civ. 34. And, after the conflagration, and the reſtoration of the earth to a paradiſaic ſtate, <hi>the earth will be a new one, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhall dwell righteouſneſs</hi> This is the ſenſe which the learned <hi>Comenius</hi> thinks, that this paſſage in <hi>Geneſis</hi> affords to us: And other learned men are very well ſatisfied with this interpretation of it: And it has certainly more truth in it, and is more worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception with us, than the bold and yet weak imagination and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of our extracted author.</p>
               <p>AND now we come to <hi>another text from this ſame writer and the laſt,</hi> ſays the extracter, <hi>that I ſhall bring to view:</hi> It is recorded Rev. v. 13. Theſe words, our author obſerves, <hi>evidently look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

to the completion of the ſcheme of GOD with reference to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, or the time of GOD's being all in all.</hi> But he evidently diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to us his ignorance of the matter: For the time to which this paſſage refers, is <hi>before the opening of the ſeven ſeals.</hi> And here <hi>ſaints and angels, and all creatures,</hi> are repreſented as making this acknowledgment, in the 13th verſe of this 5th of the Revelation, in order to ſignify, that <hi>GOD in CHRIST JESUS is the ſole object of worſhip and not</hi> any <hi>creature whatſoever.</hi> The ingenius Mr <hi>Wap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e</hi> and others have obſerved to this purpoſe; and it is worthy to be regarded. But, as CHRIST is now poſſeſſed of his kingdom, and his power and dominion will be acknowledged by all creatures; <hi>the opening of the ſeals of</hi> the ſealed book, or volume, hereupon follows: And conſequently this knowing and aſſuming author is egregiouſly miſtaken, when he declares, that it looks forward to the completion of GOD's ſcheme with reference to mankind: For it refers to the <hi>opening of the ſeals:</hi> And by the <hi>opening of the ſeals,</hi> it is ſhewed, that there are no creatures but what are ſubject and ſubſervient to CHRIST, the Lord and judge of this world in the conduct of his providence We ſee then, how little regard is to be paid to ſuch ſuperficial interpreters of the word of the living GOD.</p>
               <p>BUT our extracter is not yet ſatisfied: He is not contented with extracting from a number of writers <hi>the many texts they have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in favor of ſalvation for all men;</hi> but, out of his abundant kindneſs <hi>he will exhibit,</hi> as he tells us, a <hi>like extract from what they and others have offered in anſwer to the objections brought againſt the truth of this,</hi> i. e. his precious <hi>doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND here Mr. <hi>Joſeph Nicol Scot,</hi> is produced to anſwer the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>THIS is a very peremptory and bold aſſertion; and yet it muſt be confeſſed there is no truth in it: For after all his pretended care to examine all the paſſages of ſcripture relating to this matter it is certain, that he has not ſo carefully examined them as he ſhould; or he has not taken the genuine ſenſe and meaning of many of them.</p>

                  </hi> even in the <hi>ſingular</hi> ſometimes, is uſed to ſignify <hi>an interminable duration</hi> of puniſhment and miſery.

                  </gap>k <hi>It ſhall not be forgiven him either in this age or that to come.</hi> Where, by <hi>this age,</hi> we underſtand <hi>the age</hi> in which CHRIST lived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from <hi>that</hi> time to the end of the world; and <hi>by the age to come,</hi> we underſtand the lengthy age, <hi>the perpetual age,</hi> that is to ſucceed it: So, that <hi>this ſin will never be forgiven.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> has given the reaſon, why ſuch as are guilty of this ſin will never be forgiven: For writes he, in Heb. vi 4 &amp; 6 <hi>It is impoſſible to renew them again to repentance.</hi> And ſurely if it is impoſſible to recover them to repentance; it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that they ſhould be <hi>pardoned here or hereafter:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt undergo an <hi>eternal puniſhment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Greek word <hi>Aione,</hi> we have allowed, is ſometimes uſed for <hi>an age:</hi> But it is derived from the <hi>Greek</hi> adverb <hi>Aci,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>always</hi>—And we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> perſuaded, that the <hi>adjective</hi> from it, with, or without, Mr. Scot's leave, generally ſignifies <hi>everlaſting:</hi> Nor can we recollect any place, where it has a different ſignification.</p>
               <p>WITHOUT inſiſting here on this term, <hi>Aionios,</hi> as it is applied to the <hi>bleſſed GOD;</hi> and, when it is ſo, ſurely it cannot be aright un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>limited duration:</hi> For the Divine Being is <hi>without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning;</hi> and he is a <hi>never ending Being:</hi>—This term is often attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to things that <hi>had a beginning, and will never know a period.</hi> Thus, the terms <hi>eternal,</hi> or <hi>everlaſting,</hi> as <hi>adjectives</hi> are attributed, not only to <hi>angels,</hi> to <hi>the ſouls of men,</hi> and to the <hi>heavens and earth</hi> with regard to their ſubſtance; but to various other things in the book of GOD.</p>
               <p>IT is as certain as any thing can be, that the <hi>Greek</hi> word, which the knowing Mr <hi>Scot</hi> will not have to be ſignifying <hi>eternal,</hi> is uſed for <hi>eternal</hi> in numerous places, as we ſhall make plain and evident. Thus <hi>this adjective is adduced</hi> concerning the <hi>covenant of God;</hi> which is ſaid to be <hi>everlaſting;</hi> becauſe, according to the tenor of it, <hi>God will eternally be reconciled and favourable</hi> to them, that are in it. So <hi>the goſpel</hi> is called the <hi>everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing goſpel;</hi> which ſurely cannot mean of a temporary dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for, as it has had its influence and efficacy from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world; its influence and efficacy will alſo endure thro'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ages —So <hi>the redemption</hi> purchaſed and procured by CHRIST JESUS is expreſly called <hi>eternal redemption;</hi> foraſmuch as the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and efficacy of this redemption will <hi>laſt forever.—So the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that is conveyed by the goſpel and grace of our divine redeemer to renewed and gracious ſouls, is ſaid to be <hi>everlaſting:</hi> Why? They who are poſſeſſed of this <hi>everlaſting conſolation,</hi> will not enjoy it, merely for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eaſon; but they will never be deprived of it. So we read of enjoying in the heavenly world <hi>life eternal;</hi> and that the holy and gracious will have <hi>eternal ſalvation, eternal glory,</hi> and <hi>the things inviſible and eternal,</hi> in the <hi>everlaſting kingdom</hi> of God our Saviour. And what can this ſame adjective here over and over again
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017603_0021_0FA1DC971A3EFE80"/>
uſed, mean? Certainly it cannot mean any thing ſhort of a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual duration in any one of theſe places: And the term is adapted to convey that idea. And ſo we read of the <hi>eternal judgment</hi> in Heb. vi 2 <hi>Aioniou Krimatos.</hi> And why <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s it ſo called? From its effects and conſequences: for it will bring <hi>life eternal</hi> to the good and gracious; and <hi>eternal wretchedneſs and miſery</hi> to the wicked, unrighteous and uncharitable.</p>
               <p>BUT here is the inſurmountable difficulty: Mr. <hi>Nicol S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

Surely our Lord and judg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> intent and meaning could have told us, that <hi>the wicked ſhould go away into a temporary</hi> but unutterable <hi>puniſhment,</hi> and <hi>the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous into life eternal:</hi> but he has not given us any information in the te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of <hi>a temporary and limited puniſhment for the wicked</hi> And therefore we have not ſufficient reaſon to believe it: For our Lord was <hi>no deceiver, neither was guile ever found in his mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND further our Lord has given us to underſtand, by his apoſtle, that the devils are <hi>held in everlaſting chains under darkneſs:</hi> And we are aſſured from his own lips, that the wicked and ungracious, ſhall be ordered to <hi>depart accurſed into the everlaſting fire prepared for the devil and his angels:</hi> And here we would note, as it deſerves to be noted, that the words, rendered for us <hi>everlaſting fire,</hi> are more emphatical in the <hi>Greek, To Pur To Aionion;</hi> which plainly ſignify <hi>the are the everlaſting one.</hi> And the very ſame terms are uſed by our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord and judge, in Matt. xviii. 8. <hi>It is better to enter into life halt and maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be caſt into the fire, the everlaſting one.</hi> And we are taught of GOD our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, by his apoſtle, that the <hi>perdition of ungodly men</hi> will be <hi>an everlaſting deſtruction,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>NOW, from all the citations out of the ſcripture, does it not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the <hi>Greek</hi> adjective <hi>Aionios,</hi> in whatever caſe it is put uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly ſignifies <hi>eternal?</hi> Certainly then Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>BUT he goes further, and ſays, that there is not a text wherein it is neceſſarily <hi>implied.</hi> We think however that it is implied in that one text without mentionting any other, which ſays concerning <hi>Judas, that it had been good for that man, that he had never been born.</hi> For, if he went to Hell at his death, and ſhould continue there even to the end of the final judgment and then be recovered to life and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect happineſs; we think that it was, and it will be, <hi>good for him

that he was born:</hi> whereas our Lord affirms to the contrary. Some have quibbled about the preciſe meaning of thoſe words: But, if we collate and compare them with the ſaying of our Lord in Joh xvii. 12. When praying for his apoſtles, <hi>none of them is loſt, but the ſon of perdition:</hi> Will any preſume to ſay, that <hi>this ſon of perdition is not loſt,</hi> and even irrecoverably ſo?

               <p>WE have written of the ſubſtantive <hi>Aione.</hi> and the adjective <hi>Aio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nios:</hi> But we muſt now obſerve, that it is written of ſuch as give way to <hi>antichriſtian ſuperſtitions and idolatries,</hi> in Rev. xiv. 11. that <hi>the ſmoke of their torment aſſendeth forever and ever:</hi> But it is in the Greek <hi>for ages of ages</hi> And can there <hi>be a ſtronger way of expreſſing the perpetual duration of their torment</hi> and miſery? It is the very ſame form of expreſſion as is uſed for the Divine Being in Revel x 6, <hi>the living one for ages of ages.</hi> Let not any then flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves that only a <hi>temporary duration of puniſhment</hi> can be intended by it: For the form of expreſſion is too full and ſtrong to be thus confined and ſtraitened.</p>
               <p>THERE is one objection, which is taken, Mr. <hi>Extracter</hi> ſays, <hi>from thoſe words of our Saviour,</hi> in Mark ix which he juſtly notes are <hi>thrice ſolemnly repeated:</hi> And this ſolemn repetition of them <hi>thrice,</hi> we ſhall be all wed to ſay, ſhews them to be <hi>deſerving of a threefold attention and heeding</hi> by us. But Mr. <hi>Joſeph Nicol Scot</hi> has with a wet finger wiped way the difficulty; and from <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s prophecy, which he miſinterprets, he ſays, <hi>the worm preys on the wicked in Hell and the fire torments them: The one dieth not, and the other is not quenched till they have certainly effected the diſſolution or death of wicked men in the future ſtate</hi> It is obſervable, that Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> does not here grant, that the wicked will be <hi>finally and eternally happy,</hi> as might be expected according to our extracter, after the <hi>worm had preyed</hi> on them and <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Eternal death</hi> then and puniſhment <hi>is threatened</hi> againſt the wicked and impenitent: and <hi>the ſentence</hi> to it will moſt ſurely be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt them; and it may on very good grounds and for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial reaſons be expected, that the pronounced ſentence will <hi>be fulfilled</hi> on them.</p>
               <p>AS men, by their ſinning, <hi>go away from God</hi> and alienate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from him; and all the children of diſobedience unperſuadea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and impenitence practically ſay to the MOST HIGH, <hi>depart from us;</hi> hence it is moſt fit and right, that GOD our Saviour ſhould order them to <hi>depart from him;</hi> and that they ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly be ſeparated from him and utterly baniſhed from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and favour.

               <p>THE <hi>wrath of God</hi> is indeed <hi>revealed from heaven againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men:</hi> and even <hi>Pagans</hi> themſelves, from ſome notices of this, have had their apprehenſions and fears of it.

It may be anſwered that the threatening of ſuch a puniſhment muſt add weight and force and vaſt importance to the puniſhment threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened. For let men imagine and fancy as they pleaſe, neither <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory</hi> threatened, nor any place or ſtate of lengthy puniſhment, that is to have an end can be in reaſon ſo affrighting and terrifying, as a puniſhment, that is not only extreme, but of a perpetual duration. Therefore the puniſhment, to which impious, unjuſt, uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and impenitent tranſgreſſors are to be doomed, is called <hi>everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire;</hi> or that <hi>fire, the everlaſting one,</hi> as has already been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
               <p>AND as GOD is <hi>perfectly good and wiſe,</hi> as well as holy and juſt, in <hi>threatening puniſhment,</hi> and even <hi>eternal puniſhment;</hi> certainly he will ſtill be <hi>perfectly wiſe and good,</hi> as well as holy and juſt, in fulfilling his threatening. And his doing this will be but a fit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of his <hi>truth and faithfulneſs:</hi> For he will thus teſtify and evidence, that <hi>He is not a man, that He ſhould lie or deceive;</hi> and that it is indeed <hi>impoſſible for him to lie.</hi>—And is it not right and becoming, when audacious, impenitent and hardened ſinners, <hi>from the threatening of eternal puniſhment,</hi> inſolently laugh at it; and, inſtead of <hi>fearing the Almighty</hi> and the direful effects of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, challenge him after a ſort to do his worſt, and <hi>run on the thick boſſes of his buckler;</hi> that almighty GOD ſhould make them know that his threatenings are not <hi>deſpicable ſcarecrows;</hi> but they ſhall ſurely feel, in and from the execution of them, the tremendous effects of his holy diſpleaſure for ages of ages?</p>

And is it not contrary to reaſon and fitneſs, and indeed to common ſenſe, to think, that <hi>goodneſs itſelf</hi> ſhould bear to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in vain, and be continued forever to irreclaimably perverſe and obſtinate ſinners? It is readily granted, that <hi>goodneſs, forbearance and long ſuffering may,</hi> as indeed it does, <hi>bear long</hi> with deceived and hardened ſinners. But can it be reckoned <hi>goodneſs</hi> in GOD to <hi>bear always with ſuch ſinners?</hi> And as there is in truth no good reaſon for his doing ſo; there can be good reaſon aſſigned, why he ſhould not bear with them, when they have <hi>filled up the meaſure of their iniquities.</hi>

                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:017603_0027_0FA1DCA06182EF08"/>IT is a known truth and a ſtubborn fact, that the kindeſt and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt parent on earth, having a bad, profligate and abandoned ſon, when he has again and again rebuked and chaſtiſed him for his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and crimes; and at length he has threatened him in his high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, that, if he continues any longer in his exceſſes and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities he will diſinherit him and utterly have done with him: And yet the baſe wretch will not relinquiſh his wicked and vicious cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for there is no reclaiming him: And hence the diſpleaſed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, with grief of heart and tears in his eyes, fulfills his threatening, and gives up his ſon as a loſt vagabond: Nor yet does he ſhew any want of paternal affection to his ſon in ſo doing: No! He would give his whole eſtate and all the world for his ſon's recovery and ſalvation. And may we not argue in like manner concerning the love of the divine Being, <hi>the Father of mercies;</hi> and its proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and iſſuing after the like ſort with reſpect to his diſobedient, obſtinate and irreclaimable children? May it not be rationally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that he will <hi>ſwear in his wrath, that they ſhall never enter into his preſence and favor,</hi> and that he will fulfil his threatening oath againſt them?</p>
               <p>BUT ſome will inſiſt on it, that it is very hard for the wicked to have <hi>their bodies and ſouls forever tormented in hell fire.</hi> Now we cannot pretend to ſay, in what way and to what a degree the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal part of the impenitent may be puniſhed. However, it is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reaſonable, that the impenitent tranſgreſſor, who ſinned in and with <hi>the body,</hi> ſhould alſo <hi>ſuffer in it.</hi> And therefore the <hi>reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the dead</hi> is certified and aſſured to us. And it would be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable for all, who are wicked and vicious, when they are indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their luſts and vices, to think of that ſore puniſhment, which is hereafter to be inflicted on <hi>their bodies,</hi> as well as their ſouls and ſpirits, for what they are doing.</p>
               <p>AND yet it ſhould be remembered, that <hi>the fire,</hi> in which impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſinners are to be tormented, cannot be a groſs <hi>culinary fire:</hi> For it is ſaid to be <hi>the fire prepared for the devil and his angels.</hi> And it may be ſuppoſed, that <hi>the principal puniſhment</hi> of ſinning men may be intellectual and ſpiritual, and beyond the <hi>reach of any corporeal ſenſe.</hi>

               <p>IT is the <hi>will and choice</hi> of rational beings, who offend, which is the grand principle in action: And <hi>this</hi> in right conſtruction may be allowed to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WICKED and vicious perſons are ſo addicted to their wickedneſs and their vices, and ſo powerful and predominent are their luſts, that <hi>the threatening of the moſt extreme torments</hi> will not deter them from gratifying and purſuing their luſts and vices: And when <hi>eternity</hi> is added to the <hi>extremity</hi> of the puniſhment threatened; even <hi>this</hi> is not ſufficient to affright and reclaim them from their evil choices and purſuits. And, if ſuch a threatening will not anſwer this end, much leſs will the <hi>threatening of ſhorter puniſhments,</hi> however great, avail for this purpoſe. They are therefore no friends to mankind, who attempt to make them believe againſt the apparent diſcoveries of divine revelation, that after ſuffering conſiderably and unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably for a ſeaſon, they ſhall be brought, and even by means of their ſuffering, to perfect and endleſs happineſs.</p>
               <p>THERE are, however, ſome men, who go beyond them, that think the Almighty <hi>to be ſuch an one as themſelves;</hi> and who, by their manner of ſpeaking and writing, would make us believe, that they are <hi>more gracious and merciful than GOD himſelf:</hi> And becauſe they cannot find in their own hearts, that they or others ſhould be <hi>condemned to everlaſting puniſhments</hi> for their tranſient faults and follies; therefore they are not willing that GOD ſhould be incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and reſolved to condemn them to ſuch puniſhments, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his peremptory declarations and threatenings.</p>
               <p>BUT it is very weak and wrong to judge and conclude from the Divine benignity and infinite goodneſs, either that there is <hi>no place of torments and miſeries reſerved</hi> for the puniſhment of wicked and impenitent mortals; or that <hi>the puniſhments and torments</hi> of that place, however great, <hi>are of a ſhort duration:</hi> For the arguing in this manner is founded on error and falſhood: I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:017603_0029_0FA1DCA26EF73D38"/>AND what reaſon have any to think, that if ſinners were allowed a longer time and continued advantages for growing penitent and reformed, it would anſwer a happy end and reclaim the children of diſobedience and impenitence? That <hi>ſpace for repentance</hi> and thoſe continued advantages for turning and living to GOD if granted to ſtupid and hardened tranſgreſſors, would only embolden them to be more preſumptuous, obſtinate and vile ſtill, and render them more hardened in their wicked and vicious choices and ways: For ſo it is found in fact often.</p>
               <p>BUT <hi>how long ſhall GOD wait</hi> upon impenitent and hardened ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? And who ſhall ſet bounds and limits to the exerciſe of his goodneſs? If guilty wretches, if hardened criminals, could have their own will and way, the gracious GOD might <hi>wait forever</hi> for their penitence and amendment. But if preſumptuous mortals will think, that GOD has never ſufficiently tried and proved themſelves and others; they ſhould be informed, that <hi>his thoughts and ways are not as their's</hi> but infinitely above them: And that glorious GOD, who is <hi>a GOD by judgment, by whom actions are weighed,</hi> certainly knows beſt, and indeed he only knows, when he has ſufficiently tried and puniſhed them.</p>
               <p>AND ought not all the human race to acquieſce in the rectitude and juſtice of the Divine appointments and the executions of them? Has not <hi>the juſt judge of all the earth</hi> the undoubted prerogative and right to appoint both <hi>the time and manner</hi> of puniſhing the wicked and impenitent, and alſo the <hi>duration</hi> of all the torments and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to be endured by them?</p>
               <p>SOME have preſumed to ſpeak of it as cruel to inflict long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued torments on criminals, however deſerving of them. But <hi>at great ſuffering</hi> and much affliction is in the nature of things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with <hi>puniſhment;</hi> ſo indeed there cannot be puniſhment without it: And it is the deſign and end of anger and wrath to inflict it: We read therefore, that <hi>GOD diſtributes,</hi> that is in a proportional way, <hi>ſorrows in his anger.</hi> Now, as the writer <hi>of ſorrowful things</hi> mournfully ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>BUT if a truth be cleared and ſufficiently eſtabliſhed there is no need of indulging to imaginations, or laying any ſtreſs on ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for the ſupport of it.</p>
               <p>WE have ſeen, that the puniſhment threatened <hi>againſt impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in ſin and wickedneſs, is eternal:</hi> It is <hi>that fire that is eternal,</hi> ſuch as is prepared for the devil and his angels: <hi>Aeternus, nulliſque domabilis undis:</hi> It is <hi>an unquenchable fire.</hi> And nothing but what is idle and frivolous has been offered againſt the <hi>infliction of the threatened puniſhment.</hi>
