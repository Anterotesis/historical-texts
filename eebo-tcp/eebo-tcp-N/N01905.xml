            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Prop. 1. <hi>The Churches of Chriſt are compared to Candleſticks.</hi> Their being compared to <hi>Candleſticks,</hi> may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be in alluſion to the Seven <hi>Lamps</hi> or <hi>Lights,</hi> that were in the <hi>Golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick</hi> in the Tabernacle of old. That Golden Candleſtick had <hi>ſeven Lamps to give light,</hi> Exod. 25.37. Numb. 8.2. The Churches of Chriſt may be compared to Candleſticks.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From their <hi>receiving of Light.</hi> If we conſider a Candleſtick, as to the ſubſtance and matter of which it is made; it has no inlightning quality or efficacy, but 'tis, adapted or fitted
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002253_0054_0FDADB852ECA2640"/>
to <hi>receive Light,</hi> to <hi>receive</hi> a lighted Candle that is put into it: it has no light but what it receives. So all the true Churches, the true Followers of Chriſt, they <hi>receive light</hi> from him. As future Glory is called the Inheritance of the <hi>Saints in light,</hi> (Col. 1.12.) So the Saints themſelves while here on Earth, are called the <hi>Children of light</hi>; they are inlightened ones. 1 Theſ. 5.5. <hi>Ye are all the children of the light, and the children of the day; we are not of the night, nor of darkneſs.</hi> And from whence have the Saints and Churches of Chriſt their <hi>light,</hi> their knowledge and underſtanding in Spiritual Divine Things? Why, they have it from Chriſt himſelf! He is <hi>the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world,</hi> Joh. 1.9. Chriſt is the <hi>bright and morning Star,</hi> Rev. 22.16. <hi>The Day ſpring from on high,</hi> Luke 1.7, 8. the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> Mal. 4.2. He is the great Inlightener of the World, none teacheth like him. He makes known ſaving truths to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, delivering them from that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, blindneſs, ignorance that was in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002253_0055_0FDADBBFC9F81020"/>
them. Eph. 5.8. <hi>For ye were ſometimes darkneſs, but now are light in the Lord; walk as Children of light.</hi> The Lord Jeſus gives, or communicates <hi>Light</hi> to his People.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>By His written word.</hi> Of Old, God at <hi>Sundry times and in divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> made known his mind and will. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. but the revelations of his will concerning the Saving of Sinners, are now committed to <hi>Writing</hi>; and are contained in that Book, which by way of eminency is called <hi>the Bible,</hi> and <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> The <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> are compared to a <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Lamp,</hi> Pſal. 119.105. To a <hi>Light ſhining in a Dark place.</hi> 2. Pet. 1.19· Thoſe who live in this dark World, if they Beleive, Profeſs, Practiſe as the Bible teaches and directs them; they ſhall be Saved forever. For the <hi>Holy Scriptures are able to make wiſe to Salvation thro' Faith in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> 2. Tim. 3.15. Well, the Scriptures as they teſtifie of, or concerning Chriſt, Joh. 5.39. So they are the word of Chriſt. Let <hi>the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly.</hi> Col. 3.16. <hi>All Scripture is given by Inſpiration of God</hi>; the Spirit of God,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002253_0056_0FDADB8848FB5CB8"/>
of Jeſus Chriſt, Infallibly guided thoſe who wrote the Scripures, to ſhow men the way to Heaven. It's therefore a great and diſtinguſhing favour, to have <hi>Gods Oracles,</hi> his <hi>Word, Statutes, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments committed unto us.</hi> Pſal. 147.19, 20. Rom. 3.2. to have this gracious method taken, for the <hi>guiding our feet in the way of peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>By his Miniſters Preaching his Word.</hi> All true Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, are the <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt. Stewards of the myſteries of God.</hi> 1. Cor. 4.1. they are Chriſt's <hi>Gift</hi> for the good of men, Eph. 4.11, 12. they are his <hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi> 2. Cor. 5.20. they go on his Errand, are to declare his mind by preaching <hi>his Word.</hi> 2 Tim. 4.2. <hi>Preach the word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon, rebuke, reprove, exhort with all long ſuffering and doctrine.</hi> When Miniſters faithfully preach the Word, the Word of God; when they teach, exhort, rebuke, comfort, agreeably to the Holy Scriptures; then by them Chriſt is giving and communicating <hi>Light</hi> to thoſe under their Miniſtration.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="9" facs="unknown:002253_0057_0FDADBC704F2EC08"/>3. <hi>By his Holy Spirit.</hi> The third Perſon in the ever bleſſed Trinity, is the Spirit of the Father and of the Son. All that ſhall be Saved, are efficaciouſly Inlightned and renewed by this Spirit of Chriſt. They are not only taught Externally by the Word, but Internal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Spirit of Chriſt To them it is <hi>given</hi> to <hi>know</hi> the myſteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven (that is, in a Saving manner) but to others it is not given, Matt 13.11. Chriſt not only taught his Diſciples by word of mouth, or by <hi>Speaking to them,</hi> but he alſo <hi>opened their underſtandings</hi> to underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Luk. 24.45. All true beleivers, are Internally &amp; efficaciouſly taught by the Spirit of Chriſt, ſo as ſavingly to underſtand Divine revealed Truths; when <hi>Paul</hi> Preached, the <hi>Lord opened Lydia</hi>'s <hi>Heart</hi> rightly to entertain his Doctrine, Act. 16.16. There was Chriſts Miniſter teaching Externally, and his Spirit teaching Internally. Hence all true Saints, are ſaid <hi>to walk after the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>to be led by the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.1, 14. As the Churches of Chriſt may be compared to <hi>Candle-Candleſtick,</hi>
                        <pb n="10" facs="unknown:002253_0058_0FDADB89D4C85BB8"/>
for their <hi>receiving of Light.</hi> So they may,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>For their holding or retaining it.</hi> A perſon may take a lighted Candle in his Hand, and ſoon put it away again; but when it's put into a <hi>Candleſtick,</hi> the deſign commonly is, that it ſhould there <hi>abide</hi> and <hi>continue</hi> giving Light. Well, as the Churches of Chriſt <hi>receive</hi> light from him, ſo they ſhould <hi>retain</hi> it, hold it faſt; They ſhould <hi>Buy the Truth and Sell it not, alſo Wiſdom, and Inſtruction and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> Prov. 23.23.

Ezek. 36.31. <hi>Then ſhall ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your own evil wayes, and your doings that were not good; and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight, for your Iniquities and for your Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Do not boaſt of, nor triumph in, what you have done; that you have Built your Houſe, and brought
