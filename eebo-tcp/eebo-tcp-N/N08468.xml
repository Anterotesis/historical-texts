            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE pious and benevolent Founder of theſe lectures, having limited the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this ſecond in the ſeries, to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Chriſtianity in the moſt preciſe idea of it; we are called to review it, and diſcourſe upon it, as the plan of ſupreme wiſdom for the reſtoring a degenerate race to virtue and to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;—by enlightning human darkneſs;—by reclaiming the diſobedient to the wiſdom of the juſt;—by rendring the happineſs of offenders conſiſtent with the perfect purity of the ſupreme Governor;—by aboliſhing death, and reſtoring thoſe ſubjected to it to immortality; that plan "which eye had not before ſeen, nor ear heard, nor had it entred into the heart of man to conceive of;" a plan executed at ſuch a time, in ſuch a manner, and by ſuch inſtruments, as to Him, the all-perfect ſource of it, ſeemed beſt, and which is therefore on all accounts beſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:010827_0004_0F81D3792E2B3E90"/>
IN order to men's becoming partakers of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of this plan of grace, they muſt themſelves be active. Not indeed in completely informing themſelves, as from their own proper fund, of every article which conduces to their virtue or their hopes; (many of theſe muſt be derived immediately from him by whoſe good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure alone they exiſt, and offered from him to the human mind;) but in examining the evidence, by which what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever claims to be divine truth, ſupports its claim—in receiving it in the love of it—and in being ſanctified by it.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE thoſe who would attain the bleſſings of the goſpel, and experience it to be "the power of God unto ſalvation," muſt be perſuaded of the truth of <hi>Chriſtianity properly ſo called;</hi> and the queſtion ariſes, How ſhall men arrive to this perſuaſion, which is in our text termed <hi>faith?</hi> Now St. Paul affirms that this faith or perſuaſion hath not it's foundation on, or it's exiſtence in or by the "wiſdom of men, but the power of God."</p>
            <p>I SHALL at preſent take it for granted, that the phraſe, "the wiſdom of men," means the diſquiſitions of philoſophers, (eſpecially as retailed in the harangues of orators and rhetoricians;) the terms, "wiſe men of this world," "the ſcribe," "the diſputer," "the natural man," point out thoſe who refuſe to receive any thing as divine truth, but what they become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with in the ſame proceſs, thro' which they are informed of the principles of any other ſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:010827_0005_0F81D379EE376008"/>
I FURTHER aſſume here, and refer my hearers to the courſe of the former part of this epiſtle for the juſtice of the conſtruction; that the apoſtle intends by "faith" the aſſent of the mind to thoſe propoſitions which are offered to our aſſent from the fountain of truth, though their abſtract nature, reaſon and found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, did not before, or do not now, fully appear to the mind. (In other parts of the goſpel, however, 'tis plain that the word "faith" includes in it's idea an inward, cordial reception of, and reliance upon, Jeſus Chriſt, in all his offices; and in other places, in a yet larger ſenſe, the whole Chriſtian temper and life is deſcribed under this comprehenſive word "faith.")</p>
            <p>AND laſtly, I think it plain, that by the expreſſions, "the power of God," "demonſtration of the Spirit," and "ſpiritual diſcernment," he deſigns that evidence of miracles and it's influence, which the preachers of Chriſt adduced, as full proof of their being immediately employed of God to promulge thoſe truths, and upon which evidence thoſe they were ſent to were bound to embrace them, and act upon them.</p>
            <p>FROM this review of our context it may appear, that we are led to lay down ſome truths as premiſes, from which the juſtice of our text as a concluſion will follow. I lay it down then as clear, that the perſon who will aſſent to nothing but what he is intuitively certain of, or convinced of by abſtract reaſoning, muſt remain igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of many and very intereſting truths. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this ſtate of imperfection and ſin, men need to have much religious knowledge conveyed to them in
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010827_0006_0F81D37AAD0B4FA0"/>ſome other way. Chriſtianity fully relieves us under this unhappineſs, this neceſſity. It relieves us by "faith" in it as a divine revelation. And we are induced to this "faith" by the teſtimony of God; the exertion of his power to warrant the divine miſſion of its founders. Therefore it is "ſpiritually diſcerned." "Our faith ſtandeth not in the wiſdom of men, but the power of God."</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE firſt part of my buſineſs, then, will be to illuſtrate and confirm this point; That notwithſtanding the various avenues to religious knowledge, yet there are important articles of ſpeculation and motives to practice, which men in the beſt improvement of the powers of their minds cannot attain to; (to which I ſhall add) and many more, which, in a ſtate of nature, men had but little or no knowledge of.</p>
            <p>WE are beings, <hi>my hearers,</hi> of limited capacities; there are bounds we cannot paſs. Within thoſe bounds there are three dictinct avenues by which truth enters the mind, and is acknowledged by it. They are, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition, diſcuſſion or reaſoning, and teſtimony.</p>
            <p>INTUITION is the direct view the ſoul has of the truth and reality of any one, or the relation of any two or more ideas, that they are ſo immediate as neither to need nor admit of any reaſoning to diſcover it.<note n="*" place="bottom">THE propoſition, "I am," is intuitively certain; and to argue, "I think therefore I am," is trifling logick. And where one conceives juſtly of God and man, it lies equally clear in the mind, that men are the ſubjects of the moral government of God. Perhaps alſo the idea of cauſe and effect, is among all created things, as clear and unperplexed: The mind ſees without a courſe of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that nothing which begins to exiſt, can be without ſome agency to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it. There muſt therefore be ſome fixt and neceſſarily exiſting cauſe of it. So with regard to morality, right and wrong appear in many inſtances moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and he who labours by a courſe of ethical arguments to prove the obliquity of ingratitude, profaneneſs, murder, and the like, might be more uſefully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:010827_0007_0F81D37B6D2386D8"/>
WHEN ſelf-evident principles fail us, we apply to reaſoning, and come by an indefinite number of ſteps, in proportion as truth lies near or more remote from intuition, to low probability or moral certainty.</p>
            <p>BUT then, with reſpect to both theſe ſources of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, reflection on ourſelves, and the experience of mankind in general, compel us to own their deficincy in reſpects moſt deeply concerning our beſt welfare.</p>
            <p>AND though 'tis not intended, by any <hi>Eulogium</hi> on Chriſtianity, to deny that the human underſtandng, well improved, may attain to many prime truths reſpecting God and morality, yet it is to be obſerved that this will be the portion of but comparatively few. The extent of knowledge to which any one can arrive, depends on the original ſtandard of his intellectual powers, and on their being cultivated by education, expanded by enquiry and the inſtructions of the wiſe, and emancipated from the ſhackles of corporeal affection, which war againſt truth as well as virtue. So that ſome will need foreign aid beyond the operations of their own minds, much more than others, in order to their acquaintance with the ſame truths; and after all, there may be many, we are ſure there are many, and thoſe of great concern, which man at his beſt eſtate falls ſhort of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:010827_0008_0F81D37C35AF8BA8"/>
WHEREFORE, though we allow, that if all men were philoſophers, if all had capacity, leiſure and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition for ethical and metaphyſical ſpeculations; if the many were not diverted from cloſe thought, by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipations and cares of life; nor prejudiced againſt truth and virtue by vicious affections; a much better ſyſtem of theology, theoretical and practical, would have been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraly received than has been; yet it is fact, experience has proved it, that not only the untutored populace have, in the ſtate of nature, been groſsly ignorant of the great things which intimately concern virtue and happineſs; not only were philoſophers unable to make any great progreſs, in propagating the religion of nature; but theſe wiſe men of this world were far from agreeing among themſelves, in their ſentiments of the capital doctrines and rules of religion.</p>
            <p>ANCIENT hiſtory, as well as modern voyagers and travellers, give us credible evidence of the wretched ſtate of unenlightened, uncultivated nature, notwithſtanding all the efforts of the wiſdom of this world. St. Paul's account was not exaggerated, when he ſaid, "The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles walk in the vanity of their minds, having the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their hearts; who, being paſt feeling, have given themſelves over to laſciviouſneſs, to work all uncleanneſs with greedineſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">Epheſ. iv. 17.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE great God, the Lord of all, is a pure Spirit; and in proportion as the multitude are immerſed in
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010827_0009_0F81D37CE92F7500"/>ſenſe, their conceptions of him will be groſs and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and in ſuch proportion the motives to ſanctity will be weakned. Philoſophers have been few in any age, who have attained to ideas, in any meaſure juſt, of that great Being on whom all depend; and the arguments of thoſe few have been ſo ſubtle, that it is no wonder they had little ſucceſs in promoting true theiſm, to any very extenſive and happy effect.</p>
            <p>AS reſpect to God, is the formal idea of religion; ſo the fear and love of him, are the main motives to it. For a man may have a quick and lively ſenſe of moral good and evil; may clearly ſee beauty and proportion in the one, and ugly deformity in the other; may own an eternal fitneſs in the one, and that it's oppoſite is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the invariable relations of things, and yet may be a very profligate, and ſay, "What care I for fitneſs, beauty, reaſon and right: I gratify myſelf, and have my reward for deſpiſing theſe fine ſpun ſpeculations? What little hold then muſt ſuch refinements have on thoſe, who think God ſuch an one, or worſe, than themſelves?</p>
            <p>THE natural proofs of the immortality of the ſoul, are extremely abſtracted. The beſt genius's, even at this day, muſt labour if they would feel their weight — The reſurrection from the dead, nature never ſuſpected. How then ſhould the multitude be induced to live as heirs of immortality?</p>
            <p>THE chief rational baſis of the doctrine of future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments, is the preſent unequal diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Providence. But there are ſo many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010827_0010_0F81D38059E4E800"/>to be attended to, before that inequality is proved, that this kind of evidence is not eaſily or generally ſeen in a clear and ſtrong light. For how many never ſaw inſtances of this inequality? Who preciſely knows the moral characters of thoſe about him? Who is judge of the degree of happineſs attending conſcious virtue under ſufferings, or of the ſecret wretchedneſs of a profligate? Upon a penetrating mind, this argument has great force; but 'tis certain, that in times paſt it has not had a general, deep influence in theory or practice.</p>
            <p>WHAT man, concerned for his beſt intereſt, would not deſire to be aſſiſted, in emerging from the depths wherein the ſages of antiquity were plunged, concerning the chief good—the ſeat and nature of virtue and vice—fixt fate and free will—ſullen ſtoiciſm on the one ſide, and profane epicureiſm on the other? Who would not deſire a plain direction, "what he ſhould do to be ſaved."</p>
            <p>ESPECIALLY the great queſtion, what the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations of God are or ſhall be, reſpecting offending creatures, who have tranſgreſſed the divine law, and can have no hope of happineſs, but on the baſis of mere mercy? This capital enquiry, I ſay, is far beyond hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man inveſtigation. Whether there is with God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of the penal effects of ſin, natural or judicial—and on what terms—of how many ſins, and with what aggravations—and what degrees of happineſs are to be expected—and when and where: Reaſon at it's beſt eſtate is ſilenced here. Becauſe theſe things depend on the will of him, whoſe "ways are not as our's;" whoſe government reſpects not merely this little ſpot, but an interminable univerſe; for whoſe peace and order, ſeverity to offenders
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010827_0011_0F81D38111D3A8E0"/>might, for ought men could ſay, be of the higheſt utility. Nature might hope, but unaided nature muſt fear, and be ſubjected to an anxious bondage.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE, I ſay, that upon theſe conſiderations,</p>
            <p n="2">II. "FAITH" is a ſuitable, needful and comfortable method of receiving knowledge, reſpecting moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant points of doctrine, rules of life, and motives to right conduct.</p>
            <p>SOME minds may be under ſuch diſadvantages, ſo unable to determine for themſelves in weighty matters, that it may be their prudence to act upon the ſentiments of others wiſer than themſelves. In matters of fact which our own ſenſes have not been privy to, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of men deſerves ſuch credit, as we ought to hazard our beſt intereſts upon.</p>
            <p>BUT "if we receive the witneſs of men, the witneſs of God is greater." "When we are convinced that the fountain of truth has declared, "this propoſition is true," "this conduct is right"—"this is my method of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration"—"this it is my decree to do"—"that event you are to expect;" I ſay, ſo convinced, nothing remains for us, but to believe and do. And this is what I mean by "faith." A perſuaſion on that evidence, to which we ought in reaſon to give credit, that God has thus declared, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or forbidden, or that he has thus determined.</p>
            <p>IT may pleaſe God to reveal his truths or will <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</hi> For cannot the Father of Spirits, ever preſent with us, enlighten imperfect minds by his inward energy; and direct thoſe he ſo converſes with, how to diſtinguiſh
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010827_0012_0F81D381E3533E50"/>between divine communications, and the heights of an enthuſiaſtic fancy, or the illuſions of depraved ſpirits? He who denies this intercourſe between God and man, would or might, had he not ſenſible proof of the fact, ridicule it as an abſurd whimſy, that a particular modification and undulation of the air ſhould convey from one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mind, ideas of the moſt abſtract propoſitions.</p>
            <p>WHEN the Almighty <hi>mediately</hi> uſes inſtruments, like ourſelves, to convey his light and truth to us, they muſt be able to give convincing evidence, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their meſſages from God, and were ordered by him to publiſh them. The proof muſt be ſuch as ſhall be perceived by thoſe to whom it is offered, and leave them no reaſon to doubt, but that what theſe meſſengers deliver, is really the "teſtimony of God," or that which he in a wiſe and ſufficient manner teſtifies to the truth of.</p>
            <p>THERE is no other avenue of moral or religious truth, but what may be aided and rendered more perfect by "faith." Thus when the Pagans heard the pure ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of inſpiration concerning the one true God, which laid before, if at all, yet in dark confuſion in their minds, thoſe truths commanded their aſſent, not merely on the credit of the preacher, but of their own intuitive truth.<note n="‡" place="bottom">IN this view it is far from being true, that in order to one's receiving any benefit from holy ſcripture, he muſt be firſt convinced of it's divine authority, for they may be a means themſelves of proving their original, and opening the mind to a thorough conviction thereof.</note> Similar advantages may attend this way of communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truths, which tho' not before known, yet require but little tho't for conviction of their ſolid foundation.</p>
            <p>BUT in matters of reaſoning, the advantage of faith
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010827_0013_0F81D3822E1C2B30"/>is ſtill more clearly viſible. For ſuch is the natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of the mind, ſuch the depths of ignorance into which it may ſink, ſuch its dullneſs in thoſe who for want of leiſure or application are unuſed to rational proceſſes, that innumerable doubts are reſolved, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties removed, by the authority of a "thus ſaith the Lord," which might otherwiſe perplex the ſoul, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the practical influence of the moſt weighty doctrines and advices nothing at all. Eſpecially will the caſe be ſo with thoſe who cannot abſtract, nor enter into the reaſon of things. And how many are they?</p>
            <p>MOST of all, with reſpect to truths which depend on the ſovereign wiſdom of God for their exiſtence, relative to ſuch conduct of his, as we muſt have otherwiſe been ignorant of, and yet it may highly concern us to know; there we plainly ſee that revelation from him, is the only method whereby we can be informed of them.</p>
            <p>THE preſumption therefore would be ſtrong, previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to any trial, that if God in mercy ſhould appear this way for men, whereby truth ſhould enter their minds by an eaſy convincing proceſs, and motives to virtue preſs with their full weight; real religion would be promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and extended, in abundantly greater degrees, than by any different method. If therefore Chriſtianity in it's purity has had ſuch an effect, a ſtrong argument of its divinity ariſes.—But leaving preſumptions, I proceed,</p>
            <p n="3">III. Chriſtianity is a ſyſtem of truths, ſpeculative and practical, of the higheſt importance to men; our faith of which, <hi>properly ſo called,</hi> or in it's ſtricteſt definition, is
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010827_0014_0F81D38336CCBF60"/>founded, and ſtably ſounded, on the power of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered for the purpoſe of demanding and inducing that faith.</p>
            <p>THOUGH Chriſtianity is moſt firmly founded on ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, yet the goſpel is not merely a ſyſtem of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It takes for granted thoſe firſt principles, which muſt be fixed in the mind, before it can aſſent to any thing, as having the authority of a divine revelation. It offers itſelf as a meſſage from the God of all grace to a dark and degenerate world. Men of penetration will indeed much ſerve the cauſe of Chriſt, by their reſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es into the rational and moral foundation of many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed truths, but it is by a perſuaſion that they are the declarations of God, that we formally ſubmit to them and embrace them.</p>
            <p>CHRISTIANITY is built on this foundation, that there is one only true and eternal God, the creator, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter, ruler and judge of all, who is the "hater of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity," but the "rewarder of thoſe that diligently ſeek him", and that "man is his offspring."—And it teaches us that man was originally deſigned for immortality, while he maintained his innocence; but placed in ſuch a rank of beings that he might offend, the natural fruit of which would be the encreaſed power of vicious incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; the judicial effect, death.—It aſſures us, that man of his own free agency offended, vice propagated, and death took place.—But that in ſuch a deſperate ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the mercy of him who is preſented to us, not by terms which denote his abſtract, metaphyſical eſſence, but which inſpire reverence and confidence, tempering the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010827_0015_0F81D383BA302DE0"/>ſeverity of a judge with the bowels of a father, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a method worthy of himſelf, whereupon the whole human race ſhould again live, and be placed in various conditions of trial for an happy immortality.—That his ſupreme wiſdom, which in all his works within our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, uſes ſubordinate means and inſtruments to bring about his ends, appointed one perſon to be under him the ſaviour of ſinners, from the firſt ſtep of it in their being "turned from darkneſs to light," to his finally preſenting them to his Father, as worthy of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal honour and happineſs.</p>
            <p>THIS great perſon is characterized, in terms inſpiring reverence, love, and demanding all credit and confidence, as the "brightneſs of the Father's glory, the expreſs image of his perſon," who "was in the beginning with God, and is God." This Son of God in due time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came incarnate, and employed life to the moſt beneficent purpoſes of bringing men to God; which he eſpecially did, by inſtructing us in what it moſt of all concerned us to know, and none but a meſſenger from God could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of, viz. "That God was in him reconciling the world to himſelf," being diſpoſed to forgive ſinners, and reſtore them, on gracious and equitable terms, to ſuch bleſſings as even unſpotted innocence could not claim of right—that unfeigned repentance and the genuine fruits of it, "ſobriety, righteouſneſs and godlineſs," are the terms of that covenant of grace, whereby we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed to hope. He has furniſhed us with every motive which can work on a cautious or generous mind, above all with the proſpect of the future terrors of the Lord, and "the bleſſed hope of the glorious appearing of the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010827_0016_0F81D3847AE9D920"/>great God and our ſaviour Jeſus Chriſt. Theſe ſolemn futurities he has diſtinctly and frequently ſet before us.</p>
            <p>AND to the end that none ſhould from this diſplay of undeſerved mercy, preſume upon eaſy pardon, but might, when they gratefully own the benefits, reverence the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God and fear before him; for theſe, I ſay, among other intentions, the death of Chriſt, a moſt memorable event, is declared to be of the nature of a ranſom, a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which having been once offered to God, every meaſure of mercy thenceforth conſiſted with the recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral holineſs of the Lord of men and angels. At the ſame time the divine love of ſanctity has been illuſtriouſly ſhewn, in the noble reward of the perſevering obedience of Jeſus, who was therefore exalted to all power, that he might have full ſcope to exerciſe that ſublime friendſhip to men, which by dying for them he proved was near his heart.</p>
            <p>JESUS is "head over all things to the church." He promotes his cauſe by the wiſeſt means. He firſt ſent forth miniſters to propagate it, armed with the power of God. He fixed conſtitutions and ordinances, to derive on it all the advantages of religious ſociety. And he is the diſpenſer, under God, of that internal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, reſpecting the real diſpoſitions of men, whereby, in ſpite of weakneſs and corruption, they avail them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the means of repentance and virtue; whereby they are "born of God", and become, in the worthieſt ſenſe, the "Sons of God."</p>
            <p>THE immediate agent here, is a divine perſon, term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed "the Spirit of God", whoſe perfections and office demand our veneration and dependance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:010827_0017_0F81D385A99C5800"/>
THE exalted Jeſus is to maintain this poſt of dignity, till the ends of wiſdom in this ſtate of things is anſwered. Then the ſcene ſhall be cloſed; all theſe ſubordinations ſhall ceaſe; and "God ſhall be all in all."</p>
            <p>I HAVE given this <hi>compendium</hi> of Chriſtianity <hi>properly ſo called,</hi> to collect in one view thoſe important articles, which evidently need other proof than the "wiſdom of men"; they are the chief parts of the adminiſtrations of God, with which our welfare is connected. To aſk, why there are ſuch, rather than of a different nature or form, is a queſtion which only pride and petulance would dare to aſk. The only proper enquiry is, are they really ſuch? And the anſwer to this queſtion, which is our "faith, ſtandeth not in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God."</p>
            <p>THE wiſdom of man may be challenged to contrive a more proper way, to reveal ſuch things, and induce the belief of them, than the ſending meſſengers to declare them, and to give thoſe they were ſent to, full evidence that theſe miniſters of God were ſpecially charged with them by him; that what they ſpake was not their own, but his who ſent them. That this is the caſe with reſpect to Chriſtianity, I now proceed briefly to illuſtrate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, which will compleat our ſubject.</p>
            <p>THAT Jeſus, "the author and finiſher of our faith," (for I ſhall confine myſelf to him) wrought, not one or a few, but a continued ſeries of miraculous works, is a truth of fact as fully proved, as any one of that kind can be.—They were many,—indiſputably beſide the courſe
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010827_0018_0F81D38608134E78"/>of nature, and beyond human power,—done in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which evinced their reality,—in places of conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſort, and with public appeals to the ſpectators. And to complete the ſeries, he aroſe from the dead himſelf, according to his own prediction and declaration. Theſe were facts, which his worſt enemies who were contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary with them, ſagacious, engaged in intereſt and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to deny if they could, yet denied not. Numbers of more impartial minds, eye-witneſſes of them, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, for they became his diſciples. His own reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was by the effects of it eſpecially made ſo certain, that the continuance and ſucceſs of his cauſe can by no poſſibility be accounted for, but by the reality of that reſurrection. For conſidering the oppoſition of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, of philoſophy, of luſt, of the ſecular arm; thro' their combined influence it muſt have declined and died, if this capital fact had not been true; or, to adopt the ſingular language of a ſubtle enemy of our faith, it's ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs muſt have been an infinitely greater miracle than any on which it profeſſed to be founded; and therefore, according to the doctrine of Mr. <hi>Hume,</hi> the reality of theſe miracles muſt be aſſuredly believed.</p>
            <p>JESUS, when he wro't theſe works, ever affirmed that he did them by the power of God; and appealed to them as that evidence which the great God and Father of all offered, for the conviction of all who ſaw them, or ſhould have credible teſtimony of them; that all his doctrines and inſtructions were divine truths, and ſuch truths as God had commiſſioned him to publiſh to the world. The conſequence is ungainſayable; that if the power of God was therein manifeſted to the very end of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010827_0019_0F81D386AA755E98"/>inducing faith of the truth of Jeſus, we ought to hear him, to attend to, and embrace what he delivered, as firmly as though we heard them by "a voice from the heavenly glory."</p>
            <p>To prove that it was ſo, what ſhall be ſaid? Power far ſuperior to that of the viſible agent, was certainly exerted. The agent declared, that was "the power of God." And did Jeſus ever ſhew a ſymptom of deceit or falſhood? Did he not give the ſtrongeſt proofs of veracity and integrity? Was not the deſign and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of his ſyſtem worthy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> God to interpoſe in favour of? Superior beings, one at leaſt, were certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in theſe marvellous works. Were they evil ones? Read Chriſt's argument, infidel! in Matth. XV. 25. and be ſilent. Were they good ones? They could not then combine with an impoſtor. Nor would the God of love ſuffer an impoſition on his poor creatures, which they ſhould have no reaſonable means of detecting. They muſt therefore have been the miniſters of God; the power in the laſt reſort is his. Let any ſober mind reflect on the uniform, plain and high Tendency of Chriſtianity, to honour the God of purity and mercy, and to enlighten, purify, and ennoble the nature of men; let him review what it enjoins on us at preſent, and teaches us to expect hereafter; and will he, can he doubt whence it's origin, and who ſealed it's truth? Could we tranſport ourſelves back to the times and places, where he "who went about doing good," healed the ſick and raiſed the dead; could we then have mixed with the admiring multitude; could we have followed him, and hear the gracious words which proceeded from his
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010827_0020_0F81D389C16C26A8"/>lips; could we hear him ſay, "The words which I ſpeak are not mine, but the Father's which ſent me, and "if ye believe not for my words, yet believe for the work's ſake;" ſhould we not without heſitation have owned him in his true character, unleſs perhaps a yet depraved mind had tempted us, by ſubtle fineſſe and the ſophiſtic deceitfulneſs of ſin, to leave the plain ſentiments of common ſenſe and judgment, and to deceive our own ſelves. Would not infidelity have been beaten out of every entrenchment? Muſt we not have been forced to own, "ſurely this man is the Son of God?"</p>
            <p>THUS much muſt ſerve for the illuſtration and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of our text, ſo deſcriptive of the foundation of Chriſtianity, properly ſo called. Not that I would be ſuppoſed to ſet up miracles as the only proof of it's truth. The excellency of the moral part of our religion—the agreement of what is merely revealed with our natural ideas of the holineſs, mercy and ſovereign wiſdom of God—it's improving upon former diſpenſations of heaven—the accompliſhment of ancient prophecies— the propagation of this cauſe in ſpite of all oppoſition.— All theſe and others are arguments of great weight. But they exceed the bounds of one diſcourſe. And after all, this of miracles is the capital proof in the caſe, which the founder of our faith laid the greateſt ſtreſs upon. Take away this, the foundation is comparatively ſlender; lay this baſis, it will ſupport whatever you juſtly build upon it, though collateral props were removed. For hereby he who delivered things worthy of God, proved that he came from God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:010827_0021_0F81D38A7B370308"/>
THE credibility of the goſpel hiſtory, whereon we depend for the reality of theſe wonders, and all ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ones wrought by the firſt miniſters of Chriſt, is alſo a diſtinct ſubject, capable of convincing proof, but muſt be now omitted.</p>
            <p>I CONCLUDE with ſome REFLECTIONS.—And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. AN oppoſer of our religion might well be aſked, whether he could lay his hand on his heart, and ſay his deſign was friendly to mankind. If he ſhould ſucceed in his endeavours to evert it, has he a clearer ſyſtem of theology to propoſe, better rules of, or higher motives to private and ſocial virtue? Has he a more efficacious plan to lay, for promoting the honour of God, and good of men? Or can he relieve our ignorance, and point out the deſigns of God to us? Let the writings of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern infidels anſwer theſe queſtions. If then in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as one weakens the faith of Chriſtianity, he hurts the intereſts of peace and order, virtue and happineſs, is not the preſumption violent, that he is wrong? What a heart or what a head muſt he have, to labour to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the beſt foundation of virtue, and place in its ſtead a vague, heartleſs ſyſtem, which every one may garble, according to his taſte or prejudices. Men of this turn have reaſon to examine themſelves cloſely, what ſpirit they are of; for truth comes not "to deſtroy men, but to ſave them."</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT ought to be remarked as an inſtance of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſs of God, that the evidence of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles is extremely well adapted to the working faith in the plain and ſimple, and for them, as being the body of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010827_0022_0F81D38B2A62B158"/>mankind, the goſpel was chiefly deſigned. Had it been intended only for the "diſputer," "the wiſe man," it might perhaps have been confirmed in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But the people cannot abſtract much, they cannot draw far-fetched inferences, they are expoſed to err, and loſe themſelves when they attempt it. But they can ſee. Experience has informed them what is beyond human power. When, therefore, they ſee works done far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, and the agent ſays, "Theſe I do to prove that God is with me;" they can infer as certainly as the ſhrewdeſt philoſopher, "this is the finger of God"; this man could not do theſe things, except God were with him: And on the other hand, were ſuch proof adduced in favour of falſhood and hurtful opinions, they can ſay, either theſe are juggling frauds, or an enemy to God and goodneſs hath done this. But the nature of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity is ſuch, that this laſt comes not in queſtion; it's ſpirit breathes "glory to God in the higheſt, peace on earth, good will to and among men."</p>
            <p n="3">3. FROM this laſt remark, I am led to another, nor very foreign from it: It is this, Chriſtianity, properly ſo called, deals very little in metaphyſics or any abſtruſe ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It is deſigned for the high benefit of thoſe of common underſtanding, of babes. Of "God the eternal ſpirit," it declares not the phyſical eſſence, but his attributes; it preſents him to us as a creator, lord, judge and father; and from our ideas of theſe relations, excites us to every becoming affection towards him. "The bleſſed Trinity" is not therein deſcribed by the doctrine of triangles, or of the emanation of light from the ſun; but it teaches us the perſonal properties of the Sacred Three, whom we
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010827_0023_0F81D38BEB987A08"/>adore, and on whom we depend. Beyond theſe we ought not, nor can we proceed in our ſpeculations. The goſpel relieves entirely under philoſophical perplexities, concerning moral liberty and neceſſity; for when one, by applying the properties of mechanical powers to the reaſonable mind, has argued himſelf or others out of all ſenſe of moral obligation, and reduced himſelf or them to be the paſſive ſubjects of foreign impulſe; if then he turn to the goſpel, he will find ſuch a manner of addreſs to himſelf and all, as is agreeable to that freedom he was intuitively conſcious of, until too abſtracted reveries cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed "the light within him to be darkneſs." Jeſus proved himſelf to be the way, the truth, and the life; his authority is deciſive; the limits of his diſcoveries the wiſeſt. And here may I take the liberty to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it, as an uſeful caution to <hi>my young brethren,</hi> the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of this ſociety, eſepcially thoſe who are deſigned for the pulpit, to beware of relying on the wiſdom of men, or the reſearches of human ſagacity, where revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to be their only guide. There was a time when the <hi>Dogma's</hi> of ſchoolmen and monks were deemed ſound rules of expoſition of the goſpel. Departure from them was conſtrued to be a departure from the analogy of faith. Their uſurpation has declined. We ſhall act as wrong, and hazard as much, if we put in their place the <hi>Dogma's</hi> of philoſophy. Fix therefore in your minds the deſign and extent of revelation, and receive it's truths from the mouth of its divine author. Particularly in the article juſt now referred to. There has been a good deal of controverſy of late, reſpecting human power and weakneſs, of the unregenerate in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; and here and there a text has been ſuppoſed to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010827_0024_0F81D38CAF0815B8"/>favour metaphyſical tenets, contrary to the general tenor of the goſpel, as well as to our own intimate conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Let others perplex themſelves about an unfruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeries of motives operating on the mind; but do you ſtudy the whole goſpel; aſk yourſelves, who was its author? whom does he addreſs? and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? and you will be quite eaſy. He who ſpeaks there, could not uſe a vain, deceitful or enſnaring addreſs. The conſequence is plain. Come to Chriſt then for light. None teacheth like him. Preach as he did, and you will be "workers together with him". You will have no drawbacks upon your zeal in perſuading ſinners to repentance; nor pull down with one hand, what you build up with the other.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let us be grateful to God for his diſtinguiſhing goodneſs to us, that we have ſuch a ſure foundation of our faith, ſuch high advantages for virtue and happineſs. To this end, let us compare our ſituation with that of thoſe who lived before Chriſt appeared, or who now "ſit in darkneſs." And whatever infidels may ſuggeſt, we may have ſuch reſentment, without any diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble imputation on the ſovereign diſpenſer of his own gifts. "Shall our eye be evil, becauſe he is good"? Inſtead of praiſing him for what we enjoy, ſhall we tax him with cruelty becauſe all enjoy not the ſame? How baſe! Shall an angel murmur, becauſe man ranks not ſo high as he! A man, becauſe he is preferred to brutes! One man becauſe he has a better capacity, or more external goods, than another;! "Is it not right that the Lord of all ſhould do what he will with his own"! But the goſpel does not leave us here. It is the doctrine
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010827_0025_0F81D38DA9383B18"/>of Chriſtianity, <hi>properly ſo called,</hi> that Chriſt died for all, that all the human race may have great benefit from his redemption. This is not inferred from the word <hi>All,</hi> not from a ſingle, detached word, but from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed deſign of his undertaking for men; which was, according to the will of the univerſal Father and Lord, to procure a general reſurrection, to the end that all may be tried (in the manner the wiſdom of God ſees fit) and be judged according to the deeds done in the body. Different religious advantages are various talents put into men's hands to improve. Some have one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, ſome ten. Fidelity in the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one, will be accepted and rewarded. The good improvement of ten, will receive a much more excellent reward. If any improve not the one talent, God will be righteous when he judgeth. May he not indulge alſo to generous benevolence. Leave then our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to God, and ſtop not the ſprings of gratitude by gloomy, uncertain ſpeculations.</p>
            <p>LASTLY, Let us aim at juſt apprehenſions of the nature and evidence of Chriſtianity, that it may lie clearly in our minds; that we may be able to defend it ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully againſt gain-ſayers; and that it may become the power of God unto ſalvation to us. Let us therefore apply to ſerious conſideration, and ſearch the ſcriptures; eſpecially deliberately ſtudy the goſpel of Chriſt; and to all our endeavours add conſtant prayers to the Father of lights, to enlighten and direct us, that we may be made wiſe to ſalvation. Tho' I do not think that the apoſtle, in our text, meant, by the "power of God," an inward influence upon the mind, yet it is a Chriſtian
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010827_0026_0F81D38E2A1DB530"/>doctrine, that "if any man lack wiſdom, he ſhould aſk it of God, who giveth his ſpirit of light and truth to thoſe who aſk him." Eſpecially let us ſee to it, if we would be under his direction, that our aims be right and good. The great end of ſpeculation is that practice may be guided and influenced. And our Lord has promiſed. "if any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine whether it be of God."<note n="*" place="bottom">John xvii. 7.</note> Let that then be our chief inducement in labouring to be grounded in the faith, which was the chief deſign of the goſpel hiſtory itſelf; theſe books were written, that ye might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ye might have life thro' him." John xx. 31.</p>
