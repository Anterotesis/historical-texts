         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> PRESUME, my <hi>Brethren,</hi> I need not mention the <hi>ſorrowful Occaſion,</hi> of ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Portion of Scripture, for the Subject of my Diſcourſe, this Day:— An Occaſion quite <hi>new,</hi> as well as very <hi>awful;</hi> ſuch as, I think, has not occur'd among us, till now, ſince I came into this Place:<note n="*" place="bottom">Which is now, almoſt the Space of <hi>Fifty-ſeven Years.</hi>
               </note> And I pray God, that we may never ſee the like again!</p>
            <p>THE Words now read ſtand in a fair <hi>Connection</hi> with the preceeding, as appears by the <hi>illative</hi> Particle, <hi>For:</hi>—The Apoſtle is here exhorting to the faithful Diſcharge of relative Duties:—And particularly, that <hi>Huſbands</hi> and <hi>Wives</hi> be very careful to perform the Duties, which are mutually incumbent each on other. And as to the <hi>Huſband,</hi> the Apoſtle ſays, ver. 28. <hi>So ought Men to love their Wives, as their own Bodies: He that loveth his Wife, loveth himſelf.</hi> Then it follows,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010740_0004_0F81752703985D48"/>
as in my <hi>Text; For, no Man ever yet hated his own Fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it.</hi> Q. D. In like manner, ought Huſbands to diſcover their Love to their Wives, by nouriſhing and cheriſhing them: For, the Wife being <hi>made One</hi> with her Huſband, <hi>that is,</hi> in a civil and relative ſenſe, therefore he ſhould love her, with as cordial and unfeigned Affection, as he loveth himſelf. And the Apoſtle here refers to the Words of <hi>Adam,</hi> when <hi>Eve</hi> was given to him for a meet help. Gen. 2.24. <hi>Therefore ſhall a Man leave his Father and Mother, and ſhall cleave unto his Wife, and they ſhall be one Fleſh.</hi> ver. 31. of my Context. By which, "we are not to underſtand, that a Man's Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to his other Relatives, as Father and Mother in particular, is wholly made void upon his Marriage; but only, that this Relation is to be <hi>prefer'd</hi> to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; there being a <hi>nearer Union</hi> betwixt theſe two, than betwixt any others."</p>
            <p>BUT I am not, at this Time, about to diſcourſe on the reſpective Duties of Huſbands and Wives towards each other: But only on the Words <hi>introduc'd</hi> by the Apoſtle, as a <hi>Medium,</hi> for the <hi>Illuſtration</hi> of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and which is here laid down as an <hi>inconteſtable</hi> Propoſition, <hi>viz. That no Man ever yet hated his own Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. Q. D. Whatever ſhow or appearance of this, there may ſometimes have been, yet, <hi>no Man ever did,</hi> in Reality, <hi>hate his own Fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NO <hi>Man,</hi> i. e. no one conſider'd <hi>as a Man,</hi> or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the <hi>Name</hi> of a Man, or as anſwering to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Definition</hi> of a Man, <note n="*" place="bottom">Man is a <hi>reaſonable</hi> Creature: Or, as ſome chooſe to ſay, He is a <hi>religious</hi> Creature, having in his <hi>Nature,</hi> ſome Senſe, Belief and Dread of the <hi>Deity.</hi>—Now, <hi>no ſuch Man,</hi> did ever yet hate his own Fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it.</note> 
               <hi>did ever yet hate his own
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010740_0004_0F81752703985D48"/>
Fleſh,</hi> or his own Body; nay, but he is ſo from hating, that <hi>he nouriſheth and cheriſheth it;</hi> being very deſirous to have the Life of it prolonged —So that we may make this OBSERVATION from the Words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT it is an unqueſtionable Truth, that <hi>no Man, while in his right Senſes,</hi> and <hi>ſo long as he retain'd the Reaſon and Underſtanding of a Man,</hi> ever yet hated his own Fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it.</p>
            <p>I SUPPOSE, I need to ſay but little for the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Doctrine; the <hi>Improvement</hi> of it is what I eſpecially intend.—However, it is proper that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be offer'd in <hi>Proof</hi> of the Point.—Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">ſt.</hi> THE Truth of the Doctrine appears from the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Self-preſervation,</hi> which is implanted in the <hi>Nature</hi> of Man, as well as of the Bruits.—This Law of Nature, implanted <hi>by the God of Nature,</hi> inclines and urges every Man, <hi>while in his right Mind,</hi> to endeavour the lengthening out of his own Life, as alſo that he may enjoy the Comforts of Life. Nothing in the World is ſo near and dear to him as himſelf, and his own Life: And this is owing to his <hi>Nature</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and therefore <hi>is tranſmitted</hi> from Generation to Generation: So that, it is a Truth, altho' ſpoken by the Father of Lies, and of Lyars (for Lyars ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpeak the Truth) <hi>viz. Skin for Skin, yea, all that a Man hath, will he give for his Life.</hi> Job 2.4. Men commonly love themſelves, more than their neareſt Relatives, even, than their own Children, tho' they be pieces of themſelves: And moreover, they will not only hazard their Eſtates, but give them away, to ſave their Lives.—And the true Reaſon of this, is, becauſe Self-preſervation is a powerful, commanding <hi>Principle</hi> in the Hearts of Men, ſo long as they retain their right Senſes. And,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:010740_0005_0F817527C016C808"/>2<hi rend="sup">dly.</hi> THE Truth of the Doctrine further appears from our own <hi>Obſervation</hi> and <hi>Experience:</hi>—As for <hi>inſtance,</hi> how ſtrenuouſly will Men <hi>oppoſe</hi> an <hi>Adverſary,</hi> when endeavouring to deprive them of their Lives? They will kill one, yea, many, if poſſible, rather than be kill'd themſelves: Nor is it uncommon for Men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice and glory in the Slaughter of thoſe who ſeek their Lives.—And I may add, that when any are <hi>taken Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> by a barbarous Enemy, they (and alſo their Friends) think nothing too much to be given for their Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe they are daily in fear of loſing their Lives.—And then, as to <hi>the Means</hi> of <hi>ſupporting</hi> the Body; becauſe Men find, that the Body ſtands in need of Meat, Drink and Cloathing, and cannot, in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Way, ſubſiſt without them; therefore they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with all Diligence, and ſtrain every Nerve, to procure the ſame; inſomuch, that ſome Men need to be call'd upon to ſlack their Pace, and to be more moderate in the Purſuit of theſe Things: They don't conſider the Danger of exceſſive and immoderate La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; but uſe their Bodies, as tho' their Strength was the Strength of Stones, and as tho' they thought their Fleſh was Braſs: Alas! how many, while they labour for the Body, are, by their Imprudence, actually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying it; and yet, all the while, they toil <hi>in Love</hi> to the <hi>Body,</hi> and to the Supports and Conveniences of the preſent Life.—And furthermore, if a Limb be <hi>broken,</hi> or if the Body be ſeiz'd with ſome <hi>Diſtemper,</hi> which threatens it's Diſſolution, then, the <hi>Phyſician</hi> or the <hi>Surgeon</hi> is call'd for in great haſte, and no Coſt ſhall be ſpar'd for the obtaining of Relief: And the true Reaſon of all this, is, becauſe, commonly ſpeaking, nothing is ſo dreaded by Mankind, as Death; and therefore, <hi>Death</hi> is ſtiled <hi>the King of Terrors.</hi> Job 18.14. Yea, Death is ſo terrible to Nature, that many are <hi>all their Life-time, ſubject unto Bondage, thro' fear of Death.</hi> Heb.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010740_0005_0F817527C016C808"/>
2.15. The very ſight of a <hi>Corp's</hi> is gaſtly; <hi>Abraham</hi> therefore ſought to bury the dead Body of his well-beloved <hi>Sarah out of his Sight.</hi> Gen. 23.4. But when we <hi>feel our own</hi> Souls about to leave the Body, how great Reluctance ſhall we then find?—Yea, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf, when Death was approaching, pray'd, ſaying, Mat. 26.39. <hi>O my Father, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me!</hi> For, <hi>as Man,</hi> he cou'd not but be averſe to Suffering and Death: This ſhows, that He was touch'd with the feeling of our Infirmities, and that He was tempted as we are, <hi>yet without Sin;</hi> for, He refer'd himſelf intirely <hi>to his Father's Will.</hi>—In ſhort, ſo ſtrict is the Union between Soul and Body, that whatever affects the Body, affects the Soul alſo: For, the Body is not only the Soul's intimate Friend, but even it's Houſe and Habitation; as alſo it's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, by which it doth it's Buſineſs in the World, both natural and religious.</p>
            <p>BUT probably, ſome will <hi>object</hi> and ſay, there are ſeveral Paſſages of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which ſeem to <hi>contradict</hi> what has been now advanced.—As for <hi>inſtance; Job</hi> ſaid, Chap. 10.1. <hi>My Soul is weary of my Life</hi> —To which I <hi>reply,</hi> that this was owing to <hi>a fit of Impatience:</hi> And yet it ſhould be remark'd, that he did not intend, that he was weary of his Life <hi>ſimply conſider'd;</hi> but only, that he was weary of ſuch a Life of Pain and Trouble: So that, tho' he was weary of his Affliction, yet ſtrictly ſpeaking, not of his Life.—Again, it is alſo written in Prov. 8. ult. <hi>All they that hate me, love Death.</hi>—I <hi>anſwer,</hi> the meaning of this is, that they love Death <hi>in it's Cauſes,</hi> i. e. they love that which will <hi>end</hi> in Death, and put that away from them which would <hi>end</hi> in Life.—Again, it is ſaid in Heb. 11.35. <hi>Some were tortur'd, not accepting Deliverance:</hi> And in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we read in Rev. 12.11. <hi>They loved not their Lives unto the Death.</hi>—I <hi>reply,</hi> this intends, that they would
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010740_0006_0F8175287B159858"/>
not accept Deliverance <hi>on the Terms propoſed, viz.</hi> to renounce the true Religion, and embrace a falſe one: Their Love to their own Lives was <hi>overcome</hi> by a ſtronger Affection to Chriſt, inſomuch, that <hi>in his Cauſe,</hi> they could freely lay them down: And agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, Acts 20.24. <hi>I count not my Life dear to my ſelf, ſo that I may finiſh my Courſe with Joy.</hi> He was willing, not only to ſpend his Life in Labour, but alſo to lay it down in <hi>Martyrdom:</hi> And of the ſame mind were all the other holy <hi>Martyrs;</hi> for, tho' Life was ſweet to them, yet they were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to die for Chriſt, rather than to deny him, and actually did ſo; and therein comply'd with the Term of Diſcipleſhip, laid down by Chriſt, in Luk. 14.26.— So that the Law of Self-preſervation did bear <hi>Rule</hi> in them, until it was <hi>over-rul'd</hi> by another and higher Law.</p>
            <p>IF it be further ſaid by way of <hi>Objection,</hi> that ſome Perſons <hi>make an higher account</hi> of their <hi>Honour,</hi> than of their own <hi>Lives;</hi> namely, ſuch Men who agree to decide their Controverſy <hi>by way of Duel.</hi>—I <hi>reply</hi> briefly, that both he who makes, and he that accepts the Challenge, are <hi>infatuated:</hi> So far from being in the <hi>regular</hi> Exerciſe of Reaſon, that their unbridled Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and Paſſions have the <hi>Empire</hi> over Reaſon and Conſcience.—But then I ſhall add, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Madneſs is in their Hearts,</hi> yet their <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> is in no meaſure diminiſhed; for, doubtleſs, each one nouriſheth in himſelf a fond Deſire and <hi>Hope,</hi> that he ſhall vanquiſh and <hi>ſurvive</hi> his Antagoniſt.</p>
            <p>ONCE more, it may perhaps ſeem very <hi>inconſiſtent,</hi> that <hi>Self-preſervation</hi> ſhould be <hi>a Principle in Nature,</hi> and yet ſome Perſons actually deſtroy their own Lives, <hi>for fear only</hi> of being <hi>reduced</hi> to <hi>Penury.</hi>—I <hi>reply,</hi> that all thoſe Perſons (if there have been any ſuch) were <hi>too thoughtful</hi> for the Body, and the Life that now is; and the <hi>continued</hi> Thoughtfulneſs and Anxiety of their
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010740_0006_0F8175287B159858"/>
Minds, ariſing partly from bodily Infirmities, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Loſſes and Diſappointments, was ſo very great and <hi>perplexing,</hi> as <hi>in Conjunction</hi> with the Suggeſtions of the buſy Adverſary, to <hi>over-balance</hi> the ſaid Law of Self-preſervation, and even all their intellectual Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and then, if God permits, they are led captive by that malicious Enemy of their's, at his Will: And thus, <hi>the Sorrow of the World worketh Death.</hi> 2 Cor. 7.10.—But I haſten to that which I chiefly intend, <hi>viz.</hi> the</p>
            <div type="improvement">
               <head>IMPROVEMENT.</head>
               <p>FIRST, We may here ſee the <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and the <hi>Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> in <hi>putting</hi> a <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Self-preſervation,</hi> in the <hi>Nature</hi> of Man.—This, certainly, ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged with all <hi>Thankfulneſs;</hi> for, if Men were careleſs of their own Lives, they would be void of any Motive to regular Actions: But now, they have <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves</hi> a conſtant <hi>Spur</hi> to Diligence in ſome law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Calling, that ſo, the <hi>beloved Body</hi> may be ſupported, and be continued in a Capacity for Service: And thus, not only Individuals, but the Common-wealth is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held and preſerved in due Order: Whereas, without this Principle in Man's Nature, all things would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go into Confuſion.—True indeed, this Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by reaſon of Corruption within, and of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from without, is often <hi>exceedingly perverted</hi> (and the like may be ſaid of every other Talent) for alas! how irregular and ſinful is <hi>Self-love</hi> in the moſt of Men! For, <hi>ſelf,</hi> yea, <hi>carnal ſelf</hi> is their <hi>Idol:</hi> They love to gratifie their own Luſts; and are Lovers of Pleaſures, more than Lovers either of God or Man: They make Proviſion for the Fleſh, <hi>that ſo,</hi> they may fulfil the Luſts thereof: And this brings in a long Train of Sins and Miſchiefs; as may be learn'd from 2 Tim. 3. begin.—And yet, if Man was <hi>wholly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> of the principle of Self-love, and Self-preſervation,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010740_0007_0F817529360C0388"/>
this World would be in reality, no better than a larger <hi>Bedlam.</hi>—In a Word, it highly concerns us all to beg of God, that He would be pleaſed, to turn <hi>Self-love</hi> into a <hi>right Channel:</hi> That is, that He would, by his Grace, diſpoſe and enable us to have and maintain a due Regard to our own <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> as well as temporal Weal: And that, for this End, "He would put his Fear in our Hearts; or, that we may be his Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus, unto good Works."</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, From what has been ſaid, we alſo learn, that it becomes <hi>each of us</hi> to be very <hi>thankful</hi> to God, for his <hi>continuing</hi> to us, <hi>our Reaſon</hi> and Underſtanding, and ſo, a <hi>Deſire</hi> of our own Preſervation in Life.— This is wholly owing to the divine Goodneſs: And a very great Favour it is; for, what Pleaſure could we take in Life, if we were become indifferent, whether we enjoy it, or not? But it would be ſtill much more ſad, if Life was become a Burden to us —<hi>Job</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, not only, that God had granted him Life; but moreover, that by the divine Viſitation, <hi>his Spirit was preſerved.</hi> Chap. 10.12. That is, God not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his bodily Life, but alſo <hi>continued</hi> to him his Powers of <hi>Reaſon.</hi> For, God is the <hi>Father of our Spirits;</hi> and as He has endued us with intellectual Faculties, ſo we are indebted to Him, for <hi>Power</hi> to exerciſe and improve the ſame. And agreeably, when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, in Acts 17.28. <hi>In Him we live and move.</hi>—His meaning is, all our <hi>Springs</hi> of Motion and Action, both as we are <hi>living</hi> Creatures, and as we are <hi>moral</hi> Agents, are from God: And indeed, the regular Motion of the Mind depends, under God, very much on the good Conſtitution and <hi>Health</hi> of the <hi>Body;</hi> and therefore, the Diſorder of the Mind, when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>habitual,</hi> is commonly owing to ſome Indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Body: So then, when we acknowledge God, as the Health of our Countenances, we may not omit
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010740_0007_0F817529360C0388"/>
to praiſe Him alſo, for the Order and Vigour of our Minds.—You are ſenſible, <hi>my Hearers,</hi> that many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, of each Sex, have, in hope of finding Relief, been bro't from other Towns, <hi>into this Pariſh,</hi> who were <hi>diſorder'd</hi> in their Intellectuals.— Which I now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>to excite us</hi> unto <hi>Thankfulneſs,</hi> for the Enjoyment of <hi>our own</hi> Underſtanding; for, what more lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Objects than thoſe above-mentioned, can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented <hi>before us?</hi> Surely, the <hi>Loſs</hi> of our <hi>Reaſon</hi> is to be dreaded and deprecated, much more than Poverty, or Pain, or any other bodily Calamity: Becauſe, if <hi>this</hi> ſhould be our unhappy Caſe, we ſhall then become a Burden, if not a Terror, both to ourſelves and others; and conſequently unfit for the Service both of God and Man.—You remember the Story of King <hi>Nebuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadnezzar,</hi> how he was puniſhed for his Pride and Haughtineſs: Deprived, not only of his Honour as a King, but even as a Man alſo; for he became a Brute in the Shape of a Man: <hi>A Beaſt's Heart was given to him,</hi> i. e. the Inclination and Appetite of a Beaſt; and accordingly, <hi>his Dwelling was with the Beaſts of the Field, and he fed on Graſs as the Oxen.</hi> See Dan. 4th Chap.—And it is <hi>alike eaſy</hi> for the moſt High, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive any, yea, <hi>all of us,</hi> of this invaluable Talent, <hi>viz.</hi> the Reaſon and Underſtanding of Men, and to rank <hi>us alſo</hi> among the Beaſts of the Field.—And O, that <hi>we may not abuſe our Reaſon,</hi> to the Indulgence of <hi>Pride,</hi> or of any <hi>other Luſt,</hi> leſt God be provoked to deprive us of it! But, on the other hand, let us be adviſed to uſe and improve it to the beſt Purpoſes, even to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for Eternity, now,</hi> while we are in good bodily Health; and this <hi>the rather,</hi> becauſe it is very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, whether we ſhall, by a fit of Sickneſs, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious <hi>Notice given to us,</hi> of our Diſſolution: And if <hi>this</hi> ſhall be our Caſe, yet, how common is it for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, at ſuch a Time, to be ſeized with a <hi>Delirium,</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010740_0008_0F81752A40F27268"/>
thereby render'd uncapable of ſerious Reflection, and ſincere Repentance and of every thing, that has a Tendency to promote the Welfare of our never-dying Souls.—<hi>To-day,</hi> therefore, <hi>if you will hear his Voice, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not your Hearts, as in the Provocation.</hi> Heb. 3.7, 8.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, We may further infer from what has been ſaid, that commonly ſpeaking, ſuch Perſons who <hi>offer Violence to their own Lives, have not at that time, the due Exerciſe of their Reaſon.</hi>—They are deſtitute of natural Affection; have loſt, not only, that Love which they once had to their Relatives and other Friends, but even <hi>to themſelves</hi> alſo: And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, they degrade themſelves, even below the Rank of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> that periſh: For, it is <hi>natural</hi> to <hi>theſe,</hi> in their ſeveral Kinds, to protect both themſelves and their Young, as much as lays in their Power.</p>
               <p>AND now, it may not be tho't amiſs to <hi>digreſs</hi> ſo far as to ſay ſomething here of the Folly and <hi>Madneſs</hi> of <hi>all wilful Sinners</hi> Eccl. 9.3. <hi>Madneſs is in their Heart while they live; and after that they go to the dead.</hi>— You may juſtly look upon it, as an Evidence of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Madneſs, for a Perſon to <hi>hang</hi> or <hi>drown</hi> himſelf; and is it not an high Degree of Madneſs, for Perſons, by their ſhameful <hi>Intemperance,</hi> or <hi>any other Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of Life, to beget and nouriſh ſuch <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> in the Body, and quite contrary to all Advice, as will prove <hi>the Cauſe</hi> of it's <hi>Overthrow;</hi> altho' not ſo ſuddenly, yet <hi>as certainly,</hi> as though it was effected by ſome bloody Weapon?—But then, their Folly and <hi>Madneſs</hi> appears, not only in deſtroying their own Health and Lives, but moreover in deſpiſing and even <hi>deſtroying their own Souls.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9, 10 —Yea the Reaſon why the <hi>more ſober part</hi> of Mankind are ſo <hi>negligent</hi> of their <hi>Souls,</hi> is, becauſe they <hi>don't improve</hi> the Underſtanding which God has given them, as they ought, nor as they might: Altho' they know better, yet inſtead of <hi>minding the One
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010740_0008_0F81752A40F27268"/>
thing needful,</hi> they <hi>poſtpone</hi> the ſame to their ſecular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, and uſe Religion as a thing only by the Bye: And <hi>theſe,</hi> tho' <hi>not ſcandalous as others,</hi> yet are in the Way to utter Ruin. Mat. 5.20. <hi>Except your Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſhall exceed the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no Caſe, enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>—Ah! 'tis matter of the deepeſt Lamentation, that ſo large a Number <hi>of each Sort</hi> remain in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Lethargy;</hi> and tho' they are often advertiſed of their Danger, yet perſiſt in their evil Way.—O, that we may all <hi>ſhow ourſelves Men,</hi> by walking up to that Light which God is giving to us! For, <hi>otherwiſe,</hi> we may be ſaid to <hi>deſtroy ourſelves,</hi> and our Blood will be on our own Heads.—But I muſt haſten on to ſay,</p>
               <p>FOURTHLY, From what we have heard, let us be adviſed to be <hi>very cautious,</hi> leſt we give juſt Occaſion unto any to ſay <hi>concerning us,</hi> that we are <hi>ſo unnatural,</hi> as to <hi>hate,</hi> or even to <hi>neglect, our own Bodies.</hi>—Altho' the <hi>Soul</hi> demands and deſerves our <hi>firſt</hi> and principal Care and Concern, as was, juſt now obſerved, yet the <hi>Body</hi> may <hi>not be diſregarded.</hi>—Indeed, it muſt be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>while</hi> we are making Proviſion for the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Soul, we are alſo acting a wiſe part, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the <hi>Body;</hi> becauſe, as to the <hi>true Believer,</hi> his whole Man, "the <hi>Body</hi> as well as the Soul, is united to Chriſt, and partakes in the Benefits of his Purchaſe: 'Tis bought with the ſame Price, ſanctified by the ſame holy Spirit, intereſted in the ſame Promiſes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the ſame Glory:" So that, altho' it muſt <hi>ſleep</hi> for a Seaſon in the <hi>Duſt;</hi> yet, ſhall be <hi>raiſed again,</hi> and <hi>be faſhioned</hi> in ſome Degree, or, according to it's Meaſure, <hi>like to the Saviour's glorious Body:</hi> And in Conjunction with the Soul, ſhall partake in the Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the heavenly Paradiſe.—But notwithſtanding this, yet, we may not take upon us, like <hi>Hermits,</hi> to retire from the World, and devote ourſelves to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010740_0009_0F81752AECB0C3F0"/>
                  <hi>Solitude;</hi> but muſt conſider the Body, as conſiſting of Fleſh and Blood, &amp;c. and provide for it according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Our <hi>heavenly Father knoweth that we have need of all theſe things;</hi> theſe <hi>neceſſary</hi> things, Food and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and He allows us Time, and has alſo enjoined it upon us, as our Duty, by Diligence in our Calling, and an humble Dependance on his Bleſſing, to provide for the Body.—Self-preſervation (I ſay) is enjoined by the Law of Nature, and of Scripture too; both of which are the Law of God: And therefore, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle fitly ſtiles ſuch as were idle, <hi>diſorderly</hi> Perſons; and alſo gave in Commandment, <hi>that if any would not work, neither ſhould he eat.</hi> 2 Theſſ. 3.10, 11.—In a Word, all ſuch who take not a due Care to <hi>provide for themſelves, and for their Families;</hi> but indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſantering from Houſe to Houſe, <hi>have deny'd the Faith, and are worſe than Infidels.</hi> 1 Tim 5.8.</p>
               <p>BUT to come at that which I further intend, and which <hi>the late ſorrowful Event</hi> obliges me, to take a more <hi>ſpecial</hi> Notice of, <hi>namely,</hi> ſeeing it is a Sin (only) to <hi>neglect</hi> to make ſuitable Proviſion for the Body, it is eaſy to infer and conclude, that it is a <hi>very heinous Tranſgreſſion, actually to deſtroy the Life of it.</hi>—'Tis Sin, in the ſight of <hi>God,</hi> for any in a Paſſion, to <hi>wiſh</hi> for Death; or even to entertain and <hi>indulge</hi> in ourſelves, any <hi>Thought</hi> relating to <hi>Self-Murder:</hi> For, ſuch a Thought ought to be rejected <hi>immediately,</hi> and with the <hi>utmoſt Deteſtation,</hi> leſt it ſpread, <hi>like the Cloud</hi> (1 Kings 18.44, 45.) which appear'd at the firſt, no larger than a Man's hand, but in a little Time, black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the whole Heaven.—Which leads me to ſay, that it is ſtill <hi>more</hi> heinous, when Perſons begin to <hi>purpoſe,</hi> or intend to do the thing; and then, to deviſe or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive</hi> in what Way and Manner, and in what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Place, they had beſt to effect it.—But then, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>actually</hi> to <hi>perpetrate</hi> the Crime, is heinous and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010740_0009_0F81752AECB0C3F0"/>
horrible in the <hi>higheſt</hi> Degree; the moſt barbarous and inhuman of all bodily Murders.</p>
               <p>BUT that we may clearly diſcern the <hi>horrid Evil</hi> of this Sin, I ſhall offer a few things to Conſideration, from thoſe Topicks, which are commonly made uſe of.— Particularly,</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">ſt.</hi> 'TIS a Sin "directly <hi>contrary</hi> to the Law of <hi>Self-preſervation;</hi>" which, as I ſaid before, is the Law of God: For, <hi>God put into Man,</hi> in his <hi>original</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, an Inclination to love Life, and a Deſire to preſerve it; and therefore it is unnatural, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſinful, for any to go about to deſtroy it.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">dly.</hi> 'TIS alſo repugnant to the <hi>written</hi> and revealed Will of God; the <hi>ſixth</hi> Commandment in the moral Law, you know, is, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> And this, as <hi>our Catechiſm</hi> well expreſſes it, <hi>forbids the taking away of our own Life, or the Life of our Neighbour unjuſtly, or whatſoever tendeth thereunto.</hi> Now, here, the glorious Law-giver, who has ſtrictly forbidden the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Life of our Neighbour <hi>unjuſtly;</hi> has alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, <hi>on any Conſideration whatever,</hi> the taking away of <hi>our own Life:</hi> For, tho' we are commanded to love our Neighbour <hi>as ourſelves,</hi> yet <hi>not more</hi> than ourſelves: And therefore, if we may not kill him, then ſurely, we may not kill ourſelves. And further,</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">dly.</hi> 'TIS not only a practical Rebellion againſt the Commandment, "but moreover againſt the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of God." 'Tis a taking of his Work into our own Hands; when, we are not our own, but <hi>His;</hi> and ought to be willing to be at his Diſpoſal in the World, and not go about to diſpoſe of our Lives at our own Pleaſure.—It is worthy to be remembered, that the moſt High <hi>retains his Propriety</hi> in his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; <hi>all Souls,</hi> ſays He, <hi>are mine.</hi> Ezek. 18.4. <hi>The Earth is the Lord's and the Fulneſs thereof; the World
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010740_0010_0F81752BB1B69FA0"/>
and they that dwell therein.</hi> Pſal. 24.1 —In ſhort, He that <hi>made</hi> us, is moſt <hi>rightfully</hi> the Lord of our Lives; and it is moſt fit that our Times ſhould be in His Hands, and not in our own: How dare any then, to <hi>aſſume</hi> to themſelves <hi>his Prerogative,</hi> ſo as to cut off their own Lives? Surely, ſo to do, is no leſs than a deſpiſing of his Authority and Dominion; and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to ſay, we are our own Lords, and will not be controul'd, no, not by God Himſelf; which is the very Spirit and Language of the <hi>Devil</hi> and his Angels.</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi rend="sup">thly.</hi> THIS Sin carries in it, not only undutifulneſs to God, and a trampling on his Authority and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; "but moreover, <hi>the blackeſt Ingratitude:</hi>"— 'Tis a vile <hi>Abuſe</hi> of the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Kindneſs</hi> of <hi>God</hi> towards Man: For, Life is certainly a great Favour, ſuch as we ought to be very thankful for, unto Him, who vouchſafes the ſame unto us, who is no other but the moſt High; and therefore, one of his Titles is, that He is <hi>the Preſerver of Men:</hi>—Nor indeed, may any worldly Enjoyment be prefer'd before it. Tho' <hi>the loving Kindneſs of God is better than Life,</hi> even in it's beſt Eſtate; yet no earthly Accommodations may be compared with it: <hi>All that a Man hath will he give for his Life:</hi> Now, <hi>the greater</hi> any <hi>Kindneſs</hi> is, the <hi>more heinous</hi> is their <hi>Sin,</hi> who caſt <hi>Contempt</hi> upon it: And this is what <hi>they</hi> are moſt flagrantly guilty of, who offer Violence to their own Lives.—Moreover,</p>
               <p n="5">5<hi rend="sup">thly.</hi> THE Heinouſneſs of this Sin appears, in that it implies in it, "the greateſt <hi>Diſreſpect</hi> and <hi>Unkindneſs</hi> towards our <hi>Relatives,</hi> and even to the <hi>whole Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> or Society, unto which we belong."—No man is born for himſelf alone, but alſo for the Benefit of the Family, and of the Community, of which he is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and unto which he is, or ought to be, in ſome Degree ſerviceable.—But now, by deſtroying his own Life, he wholly deprives both the Family and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth

                  <hi>rebelling</hi> againſt God; and in <hi>ſoliciting</hi> the Children of Men ſo to do. Being abandoned by God, for his firſt act of Rebellion, he became an avowed Enemy unto God, and to all that is good.—And now, ſeeing he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights <hi>only</hi> in <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Miſchief,</hi> we may fairly infer, that it is moſt highly pleaſing to him, when he can prevail with any Perſon, to deſtroy his own Life; for, <hi>this</hi> fatal Act is <hi>big</hi> with <hi>both</hi> theſe kinds of Evil: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, he is ſaid to be, not only a Lyar, but a <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer from the Beginning:</hi> Not only <hi>at the Beginning,</hi> by tempting our firſt Parents to eat the forbidden Fruit; and truly <hi>that</hi> very Sin bro't Death into the World; for, <hi>by one Man, Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin; and ſo Death paſſed upon all:</hi> And therefore <hi>Satan</hi> was, in effect, the Murderer of all Mankind.— But moreover, he is a Murderer <hi>from the Beginning,</hi> i. e. as he was, ſo <hi>he continues</hi> to be the Murderer of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: Altho' he knows, that all the Children of Men are under the <hi>Sentence</hi> of Death, yet, is not content therewith; and therefore ſeeks to <hi>haſten on</hi> the Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of one and another, and if poſſible, by the moſt <hi>unnatural</hi> Means; hoping thereby, to deſtroy both Body and Soul, at one Blow: And agreeably, he is ſtiled our <hi>Adverſary,</hi> and is ſaid <hi>to walk about, ſeeking whom he may devour:</hi> And in this reſpect, he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to <hi>roaring Lion,</hi> hungry, ſtrong and cruel. 1 Pet. 5.8. His whole Deſign is to prey upon, and <hi>devour</hi> the Children of Men; and is therefore <hi>reſtleſs</hi> in his malicious Endeavours.—Now, I ſay, ſeeing this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate Spirit, this firſt Rebel, is <hi>moſt highly gratify'd,</hi> when he can prevail with any Perſon, to deſtroy his own Life; we may from thence conclude, that the Sin is very heinous: For, the <hi>greater</hi> the <hi>Sin</hi> is, <hi>the more</hi> is <hi>he delighted</hi> at the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> of it.—Once more,</p>

And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably, we read in 1 Joh. 3.15. <hi>Ye know, that no Murderer hath eternal Life abiding in him.</hi> That is, a Murderer has not <hi>the Principle</hi> of eternal Life abiding in him.—And ſeeing this is the Caſe of him, who, <hi>in his Heart,</hi> deſtroys his Brother, what Reaſon has the Man who deſignedly and actually deſtroys his own Life, to imagine, that he has a <hi>living</hi> or an holy Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple within himſelf? For ſurely, he ought to ſet as high a Value on his own Life, as on the Life of his Brother: For, altho' we are commanded to love our Neighbour as ourſelves, yet, not more than ourſelves, as was before obſerved.</p>

                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:010740_0012_0F81752CF6194DE0"/>SO then, altho' I am perſuaded, that when Perſons are betrayed into the ſaid unnatural Crime, they are, by one Means or other, generally diſorder'd in Mind, yet, I dare not ſend abroad any thing which ſhall have even the remoteſt Tendency to abate the Horror, with which we ought to view <hi>every Attempt</hi> of this Nature: For, if any thing be offer'd to the Public, tending, in the leaſt Meaſure, to extenuate the Guilt of this Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, tho' ever ſo cautiouſly expreſſed, there may be great Danger, that in time to come, ſome Perſons in extreme Dejection of Mind, will improve the ſame to their own Wounding. Or, that they will, upon pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſing the ſame, be, by reaſon thereof, <hi>the more eaſily</hi> induced by the buſy and ſubtle Adverſary, to give way to his Temptation.—Tho' nothing can be ſaid that will be to the future Advantage of the <hi>dead,</hi> for they are gone to their long home; yet all poſſible Care ſhould be taken, and the utmoſt Caution uſed, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the <hi>living,</hi> to prevent their being taken in the Snare of the Devil.</p>
               <p>BUT then, I ſhall add, that altho' the ſaid <hi>Crime</hi> ſhould be deſcribed in all it's awful and terrible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, that ſo, every Thought which leads to it, may be rejected immediately, and with the greateſt Abhorrence, as being unnatural, and <hi>diabolical;</hi> and moreover, tho' in ſpeaking of the Crime, a Reference is unavoidably had to the Criminals <hi>in general:</hi> Yet, whenever mention is made of this, and the other <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons,</hi> who have been, in this manner, <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of Evil,</hi> it ſeems moſt ſafe, and beſt becoming a Chriſtian, to be <hi>ſilent</hi> with reſpect to their fixed and <hi>everlaſting</hi> State, and to be content <hi>to leave them to their Judge;</hi> who, we are ſure, will never do the leaſt Wrong to any of his Creatures.—And let us all learn to look at home, and to examine our own State, whether <hi>we</hi> be, as yet, paſſed from Death to Life: 'Tis truly a

dark Symptom on People, when they indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (which alas! is too common) in cenſuring and <hi>condemning</hi> others; and yet, can't but know, that themſelves are very guilty in ſome other reſpects. Jer. 8.6. <hi>I hearkned and heard, but they ſpake not aright: No Man repented him of his Wickedneſs, ſaying, what have I done? Every one turned into his Courſe, as the Horſe ruſheth into the Battle.</hi>—But this may ſuffice for the <hi>fourth</hi> Uſe.—To proceed,</p>
               <p>FIFTHLY, Seeing the ſaid Crime is unnatural and very heinous, we may infer, that thoſe <hi>Pleas</hi> or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes,</hi> which are advanced by any Perſons in favour of it, are quite vain and <hi>groundleſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HERE I ſhall make mention of three or four, which have occur'd, and endeavour to ſhow the <hi>Vanity</hi> of them.— For <hi>inſtance,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">ſt.</hi> SOME, it ſeems, plead, "that there are <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> upon Record, <hi>in the holy Scriptures,</hi> of ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who deſtroyed their own Lives," namely, King <hi>Saul,</hi> who fell on his own Sword: And <hi>Zimri,</hi> who ſeeing himſelf in eminent Hazard of being taken, and put to Death by <hi>Omri,</hi> he went into the Palace of the King's houſe, and burnt the King's houſe over him with fire, &amp; died. 1 Kin. 16.18.—And <hi>Ahithophel,</hi> who hang'd himſelf.—And <hi>Judas,</hi> who having <hi>ſtrangled himſelf,</hi> he <hi>fell headlong, and all his Bowels guſhed out.</hi> Acts 1.18.</p>
               <p>TO this I <hi>reply;</hi> we may not imagine, that theſe Examples are left on Record <hi>in the Scriptures,</hi> for our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or that we may imitate them: Nay, but <hi>for a Warning</hi> to all who ſhall read them, that we may not run into their Tranſgreſſions, or any other like them, and ſo periſh, as they did.—Examples are to be followed ſo far as they are good, but no further: For, we ought to be govern'd by the <hi>Precepts</hi> of God's Word, and not by the Examples therein recorded; but only
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010740_0013_0F81752F3424B588"/>
when thoſe Examples <hi>quadrate</hi> with the Precepts.— And it ſeems the more ſtrange, that any ſhould <hi>plead theſe</hi> Examples, as tho' they were worthy of Imitation, ſeeing they were all of them, <hi>ungodly</hi> Men; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the Character given of them, <hi>in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>—Nor do I remember, that we have an account <hi>in Scripture,</hi> of more than <hi>One,</hi> who may come under the Denomination of a <hi>good Man,</hi> that can be ſaid to put an end to his Life, namely, <hi>Sampſon.</hi>—But then, as to him, it may be ſaid, (1.) That his next or <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> Deſign was <hi>not</hi> to deſtroy himſelf, but his inveterate Enemies: And as he was a public Perſon, being <hi>Judge</hi> in Iſrael, he had a juſt <hi>Right</hi> to endeavour the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his own, and the People's Oppreſſors: But this, <hi>having loſt his Eyes,</hi> he had no Proſpect of effecting, unleſs he was willing to ſhare with them, and to loſe his own Life in the Overthrow; and therefore, <hi>Heroe,</hi> or <hi>Martyr</hi>-like, rather than let ſlip ſo fair an Opportunity, to teſtifie his Loyalty to the Moſt High, and Love to his Country, he readily <hi>reſigned</hi> his Life, and his All, <hi>to the Will of God.</hi> And accordingly (2.) He <hi>pray'd,</hi> that God would not only remember him, and ſtrengthen him to do Execution on his Enemies; but moreover, that he <hi>might die with them;</hi> i. e. he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, <hi>with Submiſſion to the Will of God,</hi> that he might, at that <hi>Time,</hi> and in that <hi>Manner,</hi> finiſh his Courſe. And (3.) <hi>God fulfilled</hi> his Requeſt; for, it was a Prayer of <hi>Faith,</hi> and of an ardent <hi>Zeal</hi> for the Glory of God, and the Deliverance of his People: As <hi>God had put in his Heart,</hi> to undertake the pulling down of the Houſe, ſo likewiſe <hi>diſpoſed</hi> him freely to reſign his own Life, and to <hi>pray</hi> as aforeſaid.—It appears evident to me, that for the <hi>Meſſiah's</hi> ſake, God pardon'd <hi>Sampſon's</hi> amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Follies, and all his other Tranſgreſſions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him into his Favour: And <hi>in Token</hi> thereof, He gave a gracious <hi>Anſwer</hi> to <hi>each</hi> of his Petitions.—
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010740_0013_0F81752F3424B588"/>
Once more (4.) It is acknowledged by all, that <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> was an eminent <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in that, he willingly reſigned his own Life for the Benefit of Iſrael, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did his Life in behalf of his People: And as <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> pulled down (as it is juſtly ſuppoſed) the Temple of <hi>Dagon,</hi> and at the ſame Time, and in the very ſame Act, died himſelf; ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> has, in effect, pulled down the <hi>Devil's</hi> Kingdom, and <hi>thro' his own Death, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed him that had the Power of Death, that is the Devil.</hi> Heb. 2.14.—Our Saviour, in his Life-time, caſt many Devils out of thoſe who were poſſeſſed: But at his Death, He obtained a moſt glorious Victory over all the Powers of Darkneſs; as it is ſaid concerning <hi>Sampſon,</hi> Judg. 16.30. That <hi>the dead which he ſlew at his Death, were more than they, which he ſlew in his Life.</hi>—Upon the whole, it is abuſive and ſlanderous for any, to indict <hi>Sampſon,</hi> as properly a <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> or, as obſtinately guilty of <hi>Self-Murder;</hi> and therefore <hi>this</hi> Example can be of no avail.</p>
               <p>AND if any ſhould be ſo weak, or rather wicked, as to make mention of our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf, in juſtification of any Perſons taking away their own Lives, <hi>pleading,</hi> that He ſaid, John 10.15, 18. <hi>I lay down my Life for the Sheep:—No Man taketh it from me; but I lay it down of myſelf,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I REPLY; that our Saviour's Deſign, in thoſe Words, is only to teach us, that He was perfectly free and <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary</hi> in his Sufferings and Death: And truly, if He had not been ſo, his offering would have been of no Value. None could demand his Life of Him in a due Courſe of Law; nor could any extort it from Him by <hi>Force:</hi> He laid it down <hi>of Himſelf,</hi> or, of his own <hi>free Will,</hi> and therefore He ſaid, <hi>Lo, I come to do thy Will, O God.</hi>—But now, altho' He freely ſurrendered himſelf, yet, He did <hi>not actually deſtroy</hi> his own Life, no; but this was done by the <hi>Jews,</hi> in Conjunction with the <hi>Romans;</hi> as all the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> teſtify.</p>
               <p>

Obſerve here, our Duty is to <hi>deny ourſelves,</hi> not murder ourſelves; no, but <hi>take up the Croſs;</hi> and not go out of the Way of Duty, either to meet, or to miſs it.—It moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly argues an high Degree, either of Pride, or of Impatience, or of both, for any (not wholly bereaved of Reaſon) to deſtroy their own Lives, <hi>becauſe of that Condition</hi> of Life, which the Judge of all the Earth has, in his all-governing Providence, ordered out unto them: Our Minds ought to be bro't to our Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and we may not murmur againſt God, nor offer Violence to ourſelves, becauſe of the Difficulties which attend us.—If our Circumſtances be not ſo eaſy and comfortable, as we would have them to be; yet, they are ſuch, as God will have them to be: And if we, as in Duty bound, ſhall reſign ourſelves to his Pleaſure and Wiſdom, we ſhall then be in the way to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported under all our Troubles, and alſo to have them ſanctified to us; and then they will prove to be Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; for many have had Reaſon to bleſs God for the <hi>Benefit</hi> receiv'd by Affliction.—And I ſhall add, that it ſeems very ſtrange, that any ſhould entertain <hi>a Tho't</hi>

of diſpatching their own Lives, for the ſake of getting out of the reach of the Troubles and Sorrows of this World: For, what can ſuch Perſons expect, but only <hi>to take a Leap,</hi> from one Fire to another; and from a leſſer, to one unſpeakably greater? For, while they are influenced by a ſelfiſh and mean Principle, their unhumbled Hearts are alſo, at the ſame Time, riſing up againſt the Providence and Government of God.— Let me <hi>forewarn</hi> my Hearers, that it is <hi>one of the Wiles of Satan, viz.</hi> to ſuggeſt, that it is much better for a Perſon, to put an End to his Days, than to live any longer in the midſt of ſo great Vexation and Sorrow; and alas! many have been overcome hereby:—But let us bear in mind, that while our Adverſary ſeeks to aggravate our Troubles, and to perplex our Minds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, much more than otherwiſe they would be; he, at the ſame time, is induſtrious <hi>to keep out of our View,</hi> the much greater Sorrows of the ſecond Death: The god of this World <hi>blinds the Minds</hi> of all thoſe, who are taken in this Snare:—Wherefore, as you have a Value for your own Souls, be intreated to preſerve in yourſelves, a <hi>ſteady Belief</hi> of the Scripture-Doctrine of a <hi>future State</hi> of Retribution, <hi>viz.</hi> both of Rewards and Puniſhments: In the One, <hi>the Righteous ſhall eat the Fruit of their Doings;</hi> and in the other, <hi>the Wicked ſhall have the Reward of their Hands given to them.</hi> Iſa. 3.10, 11.—Believe me, if you ſhall <hi>diſcredit,</hi> or if you only begin to <hi>entertain a Doubt</hi> in your own Minds, reſpecting the Truth of <hi>that</hi> Doctrine, you'll be in very great Danger of being, in a ſhort Time, <hi>taken captive by your Enemy, at his Will.</hi>—The very <hi>firſt</hi> Step, which the <hi>old Serpent</hi> took to ſeduce our Mother <hi>Eve,</hi> was, to lead her to <hi>diſcredit</hi> the Truth of the Threatn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaying, <hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely die:</hi> And he obſerves the <hi>ſame</hi> Method ſtill, with reſpect to <hi>her Children.</hi>— So then, let us adhere cloſely to the <hi>Voice of God,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

Now, it ought to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that the Act of Self-Murder is prohibited <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely,</hi> or, without any Toleration or Exception; and therefore we may not be our own Judges and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners, under the Pretence of a more eaſy, and a leſs public kind of Death.—If we have committed ſome Crime worthy of Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then it becomes us to <hi>yield</hi> ourſelves up to Juſtice: And if we ſuffer, or are in Danger of ſuffering <hi>unjuſtly</hi> or wrongfully, we ought to commit our Cauſe to the Judge of all the Earth, and leave it with Him, to do us Juſtice, in his own Way and Time, when we cannot, in a <hi>lawful</hi> Manner, obtain Redreſs from Men:—Nor may we doubt, if we ſuitably commit our Way to Him, and caſt our Burden on Him, but that He will, ſooner or later, <hi>bring forth our Righteouſneſs as the Light, and our Judgment as the Noon-day.</hi> Pſal. 37.5, 6.—We read in Acts 16.27.

               <p n="4">4<hi rend="sup">thly.</hi> SOME, it ſeems, have been inclined to think, whether it would not be much better for them, to put an End to Life, than to live longer, "becauſe they find, that <hi>they ſin every Day,</hi>" and ſo are continually increaſing their own Guilt, and at the ſame time, are doing Diſhonour to the Name of God.—To which I <hi>reply,</hi> that altho' this may appear more plauſible than thoſe before mentioned, yet, neither can <hi>this</hi> juſtify any Perſon in the ſaid foul and unnatural Act: For, as was obſerved above, it is forbidden <hi>abſolutely:</hi> That is, there is no Toleration or Liberty granted or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>to any Perſon, under any Pretence whatever,</hi> to do this evil Deed.—If we conſider the <hi>Felo de ſe</hi> as a <hi>bad</hi> Man, then, by deſtroying his own Life, he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally puts an End to his Day of Grace, and ſo puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of the Reach of Mercy: For Mercy itſelf will not ſave us in any other Way, but that only which is propounded and eſtabliſhed in the Goſpel, namely, the Way of Repentance towards God, and of Faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: And therefore the ſaid <hi>Murderer</hi> may truly be ſaid to deſtroy his own <hi>Soul,</hi> as well as his Body.—And I may proceed to ſay, that if he has <hi>been in Reputation</hi> for a <hi>good</hi> Man; yet, now there is Reaſon to fear,—becauſe he has unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deprived himſelf of any further Opportunity to ſerve and glorifie God <hi>in that way</hi> and manner, which he cannot do in Heaven: Inſtead of improving his Life to maintain a ſpiritual Warfare, and to ſerve his Generation according to the Will of God, he, by the ſaid <hi>Enormity,</hi> greatly diſhonours God, and highly gratifies his Adverſary, as alſo leaves a mark of Infamy on his

               <p>MY <hi>Friends,</hi> if your malicious Adverſary ſhall ever tempt any of you, to the ſaid horrible Crime of <hi>Suicide;</hi> and ſhall, at the ſame time, <hi>inſinuate,</hi> that <hi>your Aim</hi> and <hi>End is exactly right and good,</hi> provided, your Deſire is, that you may be wholly and forever delivered from that abominable thing <hi>(Sin)</hi> which the Soul of God hateth; and <hi>therefore,</hi> you ſhall <hi>certainly find Favour with Him.</hi>—If this (I ſay) ſhall, in time to come, be your Caſe, <hi>beware</hi> leſt you be deceived and enſnared by the ſaid plauſible Inſinuation; and therefore, let this true and weighty <hi>Maxim</hi> have a conſtant abode in your Minds, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>a good End can never juſtifie an evil Action,</hi> in order to attain that End.—I inſiſt upon it, that you never liſten to a Temptation, <hi>to do evil that good may come:</hi> And I urge this the rather, becauſe I look on <hi>this</hi> as <hi>the moſt dangerous</hi> of Satan's Devices, I mean with reſpect to <hi>ſuch</hi> Perſons who are <hi>ſoberly diſpoſed.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>SIXTHLY, and laſtly, Seeing it is unnatural and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for any Perſon to cut ſhort his Life, let us be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed carefully to <hi>avoid all Occaſions</hi> of, and whatever <hi>has a Tendency</hi> to lead us, thereunto. I ſhall inſtance here, in a few Particulars, by way of <hi>Direction:</hi>—As,</p>
               <p>DIRECT. 1ſt. Beware of <hi>expreſſing,</hi> and even of <hi>che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing</hi> in your own Breaſts, <hi>any bad Wiſhes.</hi>—Some Perſons, as I have been informed, have given ſo much the Looſe to their Tongues, as to <hi>wiſh they may die,</hi> or, that they may <hi>never ſpeak a Word more,</hi> and the like, if what they affirmed, be not the Truth; and yet, by what afterwards appeared, 'tis evident, that themſelves <hi>knew it</hi> to be a Falſhood: —If ſo, how abominable is this!—And now, as to ſuch Perſons, it is a Wonder of Mercy, that the God of their Lives did not ſtrike them dead on the Spot, in token of his Wrath and Vengenance; not only for their wronging the Truth; but moreover, becauſe of their <hi>appealing</hi> to Him, <hi>in whoſe Hand their Breath is,</hi> for the Confirmation of their <hi>known</hi> Falſhood.—But altho' their Lives be ſpar'd to them for the preſent, yet they may juſtly expect to be followed with a Curſe, on their Names, or Eſtates, or both: And if not given up to the Will of their Adverſary, and <hi>left to deſtroy their own Lives, which they have made ſo very light of;</hi> yet, to die an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon kind of Death:—Sin and Puniſhment lay at their Door, and will find them out ſooner or later, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they go: For, it is written in Prov. 28.13. <hi>He that covereth his Sins, ſhall not proſper.</hi> And more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, ſuch who cover them with a <hi>Lye,</hi> and adjoin <hi>an Imprecation,</hi> or the wiſhing of a Curſe to themſelves, if they ſpeak falſely: Doubtleſs, <hi>their own Tongues,</hi> that is, the Sins thereof, <hi>ſhall fall upon them,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010740_0017_0F81753179536270"/>
them, unleſs a ſeaſonable and ſincere Repentance ſhall prevent it.—And if there be any ſuch Perſon or Perſons <hi>in this Aſſembly.</hi> I ſolemnly exhort and beſeech you, to go and humble yourſelves; and in the Way preſcribed in the Goſpel, <hi>agree</hi> with Him, whom you have made to be your Adverſary; and do it <hi>quickly,</hi> leſt He deliver you up to the Executioners of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and then, all Liberty for <hi>Bail</hi> will be at an End. Mat. 5.25, 26.—And let me further ſay, if you have injured or offended any of your <hi>Neighbours</hi> by your evil Conduct, whether by Word or Deed, delay not to give <hi>chriſtian</hi> Satisfaction: For, this will be, not only to the Honour of God and his holy Religion, but moreover to your own Credit and Reputation.— It argues Ignorance or Pride, or both, for People to be ſo averſe, as commonly they are, to confeſs their Faults one to another. As Sin is a Reproach and Diſgrace to any Perſon or People; ſo when a Man hath by Sin offended, he can't do <hi>himſelf</hi> a greater Honour, than to make an humble Confeſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Nature and Degree of his Offence, and then, to lead a new Life. James 5.16. <hi>Confeſs your Faults one to another.</hi> Prov. 28.13. <hi>He that confeſſeth and forſaketh, ſhall find Mercy.</hi>—But to return.</p>
               <p>I SHALL juſt add, that all ſuch who are of ſo <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled a Tongue,</hi> as thoſe above-mentioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do act, not only a very wicked, but alſo <hi>a very fooliſh</hi> part: For, no wiſe Man will give Credit to what they ſay, ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, as he would, provided they <hi>omit</hi> thoſe <hi>direful Wiſhes,</hi> and content themſelves to affirm their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, in a meek and moderate manner: Agreeable to the Direction of the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> chap. 5.12. <hi>Swear not—but let your Yea be Yea, and your Nay be Nay, leſt ye fall into Condemnation.</hi> That is, leſt you be afterwards <hi>condemned,</hi> both by God and your own guilty Conſciences. And our <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf has ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010740_0017_0F81753179536270"/>
commanded, ſaying, Matt. 5.37. <hi>Let your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication be Yea, Yea; Nay, Nay:</hi> Q. D. If there be Occaſion for it, <hi>double</hi> your <hi>Yea,</hi> or your <hi>Nay;</hi> but proceed no further in your common Converſation: And He gives this Reaſon for it, <hi>viz. For, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is more than theſe cometh of evil.</hi> i. e. it cometh from the evil One, and from an evil Heart, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers a reigning Vanity in the Mind.—I ſhall cloſe this Direction with the Words of the inſpired <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> in Pſal. 34.12, 13. <hi>What Man is he that deſireth Life, and loveth many Days,—Keep thy Tongue from evil, and thy Lips from ſpeaking Guile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>DIR. 2. Beware of a vain-glorious, or <hi>ſelf-confident</hi> frame of Spirit.—Some, it ſeems, are much inclined to cenſure their Neighbours, and to ſay (and probably, many ſay in their <hi>Hearts,</hi> who do not ſpeak out) that ſuch and ſuch Perſons have gone into groſs Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yea, ſuch a Man by Name, has lately <hi>deſtroyed his own Life:</hi> But I am <hi>determined,</hi> ſays one and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that <hi>I will never be guilty</hi> of ſo foul a Tranſgreſſion: And alas! at the ſame Time, they, probably, <hi>truſt in their Hearts,</hi> and place their <hi>Confidence</hi> entirely <hi>in their own Strength;</hi> and therefore, are in great Danger of being <hi>left</hi> to commit the <hi>ſame</hi> kind of Wickedneſs.— I have been told by one and another <hi>among us,</hi> that they tho't themſelves to be ſufficiently armed againſt a particular Sin, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Fornication,</hi> being fully determined in their Breaſts, that no Temptation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhould prevail with them, to offend in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and <hi>yet became guilty:</hi> And then, they were convinced of their Error, in having been <hi>ſelf-confident;</hi> and therefore readily acknowledged, that God was righteous in leaving them to their own Heart's Luſts, ſeeing they had neglected Him, and look'd no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to their own Strength &amp; Reſolution —And alas! the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> was a ſad Inſtance of the Sin
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:010740_0018_0F817532E9F48250"/>
and Folly of relying on his own Zeal and Reſolution: He was <hi>determin'd</hi> againſt <hi>that</hi> Sin in particular, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>denying</hi> his Lord and Maſter; yea, he ſolemnly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,</hi> that he would <hi>die</hi> with Him, rather than <hi>deny</hi> Him: And yet, within the Space of two or three Hours, <hi>he deny'd Him;</hi> and that, not once only, but <hi>twice,</hi> yea <hi>three times,</hi> ſucceſſively.—And his Sin was greatly aggravated, in that, he had fair Warning given him, of his Danger, by his Maſter himſelf: And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Provocation was but trifling; for, he was not examined by the Judge, or any of the Officers of the Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but only the Standers-by, from whom he had no Reaſon to fear any Harm:—But as then, ſo now, it is dangerous being in Company with thoſe who are Enemies to Chriſt: And this is written for <hi>Warning</hi> to us, that <hi>we be not ſelf-confident,</hi> and ſo be <hi>left</hi> to Sin, after the Similitude of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion. Verily, it concerns us to bear in mind the Words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, in 1 Cor. 10.12. <hi>Let him who thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> We can't be too diffident of ourſelves, nor place too great Confidence on the Lord Jeſus.—In a Word, whatever particular Sin, we reſolve againſt <hi>in our own Strength;</hi> we are in great Danger of being <hi>left</hi> to <hi>that</hi> very Sin, how heinous ſoever it be.</p>
               <p>DIR. 3. Let us alſo be adviſed to beware of an <hi>anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious Care</hi> for the <hi>Body.</hi>—Indeed, a moderate &amp; prudent Care ought to be taken of it: But a <hi>perplexing Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude</hi> is of a <hi>fatal</hi> Tendency; for, this will lead on to an <hi>inordinate</hi> Love of the World: And <hi>this kind of Love</hi> to the <hi>World,</hi> or to <hi>Money,</hi> is <hi>the Root of all Evil, which, while ſome have coveted after, they have err'd from the Faith, and pierced themſelves through with many Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.</hi> 1 Tim. 6.10.—And as <hi>this</hi> Love of <hi>Money,</hi> was formerly the Occaſion of the Apoſtacy of many from the Faith of Chriſt; even ſo, to this Day, it is at the Bottom of many other Sins, which bring on Miſchiefs
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:010740_0018_0F817532E9F48250"/>
without Number. For, <hi>they that will be rich</hi> (who are <hi>reſolved</hi> upon it) <hi>fall into Temptation, and a Snare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful Luſts, which drown Men in Deſtruction and Perdition.</hi> 1 Tim. 6.9 —And <hi>this</hi> is <hi>one</hi> of the Temptations and Snares, which ſome ſuch Men have fallen into, namely, to <hi>put an End to their Days:</hi> For, when a <hi>covetous</hi> Man meets with many Diſappointments, and great Loſſes, ſo as that he begins to imagine, that he ſhall be reduced to Penury; then, the ſubtle and malicious Adverſary, obſerving his <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected</hi> State, ſteps in, and <hi>with Vehemence</hi> ſuggeſts to him, that it is much better for him to deſtroy his own Life, than to live and beg his Bread, and be had in Contempt among Men: —And if the Man is ſo fallen into the <hi>Arrears,</hi> as to be in a conſtant <hi>Panick,</hi> leſt he be apprehended by the Officer, and be caſt into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; then, the Adverſary has a ſtill greater Advantage againſt him.—And <hi>ſome ſuch</hi> Perſons, it ſeems, have been ſo followed with Temptation, from Day to Day, till being <hi>weary of Life,</hi> have committed that enormous Wickedneſs, which Humanity and natural Conſcience ſtartle at.—What was it but the Sin of Covetouſneſs, or an inordinate Love to <hi>Money,</hi> that induc'd <hi>Judas</hi> to betray his Lord and Maſter? But when the <hi>Wretch</hi> ſaw that he was condemn'd by the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> or ſupreme Council, then, his own Conſcience condemn'd him for his Treachery, to that degree, that his <hi>thirty Pieces</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a <hi>Burden</hi> to him: Yea, and when he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd them, then <hi>his own Life</hi> was <hi>no leſs grievous;</hi> and therefore he <hi>ſoon put an End to it.</hi> The Love of the World was the <hi>firſt moving</hi> Cauſe of this piece of Wickedneſs, which bro't on his Deſtruction, and that by his own Hand: And the ſame cauſe, I perceive, has produced the like fatal Effect as to many others.— <hi>We</hi> have need therefore to beware, leſt the Things of the World gain the <hi>Aſcendence</hi> and <hi>Empire</hi> in our Souls;
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:010740_0019_0F8175339906B530"/>
for, if ſo, there is Danger, by reaſon of Temptations, of their being the means of <hi>choaking</hi> the Body, as well as of deſtroying the Soul.</p>
               <p>DIR. 4. Let us alſo beware of <hi>the Sin of Deſpair,</hi> leſt we be led thereby to deſtroy ourſelves.—What was it but a <hi>Deſpair</hi> of having their <hi>Lives</hi> ſpar'd, that mov'd King <hi>Saul,</hi> to fall on his Sword; and <hi>Ahithophel,</hi> to hang himſelf; and <hi>Zimri,</hi> to expoſe himſelf to the Flames? And it was an utter <hi>Deſperation</hi> of finding Mercy for his <hi>Soul,</hi> that hurried the Traitor <hi>Judas,</hi> to put an End to his own Life:—And by the ſame Means, the Adverſary has prevailed with many, to deſtroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſuggeſting to them, that their State is <hi>hopeleſs;</hi> till at length, Life becomes a meer Burden to them.— The <hi>Devils</hi> themſelves do wholly <hi>deſpair</hi> of Relief, and are looking for no other, but Judgment and fiery In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation: And ſo envious &amp; malicious are they, that they would gladly prevail with all the Children of Men, to entertain and cheriſh <hi>the ſame</hi> Apprehenſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning themſelves; hoping thereby, <hi>to haſten on</hi> the Deſtruction of Soul and Body together.—Let us be on our Watch therefore againſt <hi>this</hi> Temptation: And not fail of <hi>looking</hi> on <hi>the Goſpel-call</hi> and <hi>Invitation,</hi> as <hi>directed unto us,</hi> as well as unto others; and be <hi>giving Diligence,</hi> that ſo, by the Grace of God, we may <hi>now come to Chriſt,</hi> at his Call.—And this leads me to ſay, that if we would avoid being taken in the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Snare, we muſt <hi>beware of another,</hi> which the Enemy lays, in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, and is unweary'd in his Endeavours to <hi>lead</hi> People into, and to <hi>continue</hi> them in; and this is the <hi>Sin of Preſumption.</hi>—And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, nothing is more common than for <hi>this Deceiver</hi> to inſinuate, that becauſe God is merciful and gracious, therefore there <hi>needs no Haſte</hi> to trouble ourſelves, about making our Peace with Him: The <hi>Devil</hi> never tells any, that <hi>Now is the accepted Time, Now is the Day of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:010740_0019_0F8175339906B530"/>
But on the other Hand, he tempts People <hi>to idle away</hi> their Day of Grace, and <hi>Sabbath-days</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, either by drowſing away the Day at home, or if they come to the Houſe of God, then to ſpend much of the Time in ſleeping, or elſe in a very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Way &amp; Manner of hearing.—And alas! <hi>how many</hi> are led by their Corruptions, ſeconded and improved by the Tempter, to remain quite eaſy and <hi>content</hi> with only a <hi>formal</hi> going the round of Duty, until by means of the Word, or ſome Providence of God, they are <hi>awakened</hi> to conſider of their Ways, and to enquire the Way to Zion, with their Faces thitherward: Which the <hi>buſy Adverſary</hi> obſerving, he fails not to improve all his Skill, with a Deſign to diſcourage and terrify them; ſuggeſting, that now it is <hi>too late</hi> in the Day, for <hi>them</hi> to expect to find Mercy: And to give <hi>an Edge</hi> to his Temptations, he is won't to bring to their Minds, and enforce with all his Power, thoſe Texts of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which carry the moſt threatning &amp; <hi>affrightning</hi> Aſpects; and in particular, that in Prov. 1.24. and on.—And provided, they are thereby <hi>diverted</hi> from their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Purpoſe, and turn again to Folly, as is too often the Caſe; then, the Enemy ceaſeth to moleſt them. Luk. 11.21. <hi>When a ſtrong Man armed keepeth his Palace, his Goods are in Peace.</hi>—But if they <hi>continue</hi> to be ſolicitous to ſecure the Welfare of their immortal Souls, then he follows them with his Temptations, of one kind and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, ſuch as are common to the People of God; for, the <hi>Chriſtian's</hi> preſent State is a State of <hi>Warfare.</hi> Eph. 6.12.</p>
               <p>BUT then, I ſhall add, that having, by Obſervation, informed himſelf of the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, he diſcovers his Cunning, as alſo his Cowardize, in aſſaulting thoſe that are melancholy and <hi>timorous</hi> in a more <hi>violent</hi> Manner:—And if, at ſuch a time, they are attended with ſome <hi>bodily Malady,</hi> which affects the

                  <hi>Brain,</hi> as is not uncommon, they are in great Danger of being overcome, ſo as to lay violent Hands on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and therefore, a <hi>peculiar Care</hi> ought to be, by their Friends, exerciſed over them.—Upon the whole, <hi>the longer</hi> Perſons <hi>preſume</hi> on the Mercy of God, <hi>the more Advantage</hi> do they give to the Enemy againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: And therefore, as we value our own Souls; yea, if we <hi>love Life,</hi> and would ſee good Days, here in this World, let us not any longer <hi>perſiſt</hi> in <hi>turning the Grace of God into Wantonneſs;</hi> leſt, for our Obſtinacy, God be provoked to take his holy Spirit from us, and to leave us to the Will of the evil Spirits:—And if He ſhall once ſay, <hi>take 'em Devil;</hi> our Caſe will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>helpleſs,</hi> and it had been better for us, not to have been born.—<hi>He that hath Ears to hear, let him hear.</hi>— To proceed,</p>
               <p>DIR. 5. Let us beware of the Sin of <hi>Diſcontent,</hi> on <hi>any Account</hi> whatever: For, remember, <hi>this</hi> is the very Sin, which the Adverſary does, in a <hi>peculiar</hi> Manner, graffe his Temptation to <hi>Self-Murder</hi> upon; vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently inſinuating into the Minds of thoſe, who are under the <hi>Power</hi> of it, that they had much better bid adieu to Life, than to continue to live in ſo uneaſy and <hi>reſtleſs</hi> a Frame: <hi>Death</hi> (ſays he) will <hi>put a final Iſſue</hi> unto all this Anxiety and Perplexity, and for ever ſet you at perfect Liberty: And at the ſame time, he endeavours to hold them in Ignorance or <hi>Blindneſs,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the <hi>Conſequents</hi> of their Death: But if he finds, that they are attended with <hi>ſome Fear</hi> in that Regard, then he ſuggeſts to them, either that there is <hi>no ſuch Place as Hell;</hi> or elſe, if they will only cry, before they expire, <hi>Lord, have Mercy</hi> on us! It ſhall be well with them.—In this Manner, <hi>the god of this World blinds the Minds</hi> of Multitudes 2 Cor. 4.4.

true Light, he could never prevail with them, to act ſo <hi>inhuman</hi> a Part, as that of taking away their own Lives.—But now, alas! how many, by reaſon of their <hi>Diſcontent,</hi> and the <hi>enſuing Temptation,</hi> have been thrown into <hi>ſo great Confuſion</hi> in their own Minds, as wickedly to deſtroy their Lives, and hazard their Souls, in order to obtain a <hi>Deliverance</hi> from their <hi>preſent Vexation.</hi>— Wherefore; be intreated to ſhake off, or rather root out, all Appearance of, and Approach unto the ſaid <hi>dangerous</hi> Sin of <hi>Diſcontent,</hi> which has already been the Occaſion, doubtleſs, of the Deſtruction of the Lives of many thouſands.—It may not, no, not the leaſt <hi>Shadow</hi> of it, be indulged, ſo much as <hi>one Moment,</hi> leſt it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and the Adverſary get Advantage to your ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ruin.—What ſhall I ſay more? <hi>Avoid this Sin,</hi> as you would ſhun the <hi>Devil himſelf;</hi> for, it is, as I may ſay, <hi>his Paw,</hi> which being once admitted, he will ſoon gain a <hi>full Poſſeſſion</hi> of your whole Man.—So then, let us learn, and beg of God to teach us, that good Leſſon, which He taught the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 4.11. <hi>I have learned in whatſoever State I am, therewith to be content.</hi> And this agrees well with the Command, written in Heb. 13.5. <hi>Be content with ſuch things as you have.</hi> See alſo Lam. 3.22, 39.—But then, I ſhall add, that it is not ſufficient, to be <hi>only</hi> or barely content; but we muſt moreover, be very <hi>thankful to God,</hi> that it is ſo well with us as it is; for, <hi>this is the Will of God, in Chriſt Jeſus, concerning us, that in every thing we give Thanks.</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.18.

               <p>DIR. 6. Let us, when tempted to Sin, and to that of <hi>Self-Murder</hi> in particular, be cautioned againſt <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Devil's Counſel concealed:</hi> But be intreated to divulge the Temptation, or, make it known, at leaſt, to ſome <hi>particular Friend,</hi> who, as you have juſt Reaſon to think, is capable of giving you the moſt ſeaſonable Advice. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Our Neighbour,</hi> whoſe Death we now lament, <hi>was deficient,</hi> in this Reſpect: For, altho' he appear'd, of late, to ſome of his Neighbours, to diſcover <hi>a Turn of Mind,</hi> different from what was uſual; yet, it was not very much regarded. Nor did any Perſon (as I am inform'd) <hi>ſuſpect,</hi> that he was under the ſaid Temptation, until being miſſed, he was <hi>found Hanging in his own Barn.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>This,</hi> indeed, is what the Adverſary will ſtrenuouſly <hi>oppoſe</hi> your doing of, ſuggeſting, that it will be very much to your <hi>Diſhonour</hi> among Men, to have it <hi>come abroad,</hi> that you have entertained a Tho't, or had any Inclination, to deſtroy your own Life: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being pity'd and reliev'd <hi>(ſays he)</hi> you'll be pointed at and deſpiſed, all your Days.—But, <hi>my dear Friends,</hi> you muſt <hi>break thro'</hi> this, or any other Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that may be preſented for your Diſcouragement, and <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>fully</hi> unboſom your Caſe (as I ſaid) to ſome <hi>faithful Friend:</hi> And not only aſk, but alſo thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accept of the Advice, which may be given you; and with all Diligence, purſue and proſecute the ſame, <hi>notwithſtanding all</hi> that the Enemy may ſuggeſt to the contrary.—Let me tell you, that ſuch Perſons are in very great Hazard of being overcome, who gratify the Devil ſo far, as to <hi>keep this</hi> Temptation of his, <hi>burning</hi> in their own Breaſts: For, what elſe may they reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expect, but that the <hi>Fewel,</hi> or Corruption within,

               <p>DIR. 7. Be adviſed to beware of too free an Uſe of <hi>ſpiritous Liquors:</hi> And in all other reſpects, to exerciſe a prudent Care for the <hi>Continuance</hi> of your <hi>bodily Health:</hi> For, there is ſo ſtrict an Union between Soul and Body, that they mutually affect each other. "Whatever touches the Body, by way of Injury, affects the Soul alſo by Way of Sympathy:" Nothing is more evident, than that <hi>bodily Diſorders</hi> (tho' ſome more than others) bring on an Heavineſs and <hi>Melancholy</hi> of Mind, which gives to the Adverſary a very great Advantage; and therefore it concerns you to be <hi>tender of your own Health;</hi> and not, as ſome do, needleſly and fooliſhly expoſe it.—Indeed, many People do err in the <hi>Exceſs</hi> of Love to their Bodies, which is a criminal kind of Love, for they abuſe themſelves by their Intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;—but then, there are <hi>others,</hi> who are alſo worthy of Blame, by reaſon of their <hi>Defect</hi> in this Regard; for, thro' Inadvertance and Heedleſſneſs, they take ſuch Steps as deſtroy the good Conſtitution of their Bodies, and thereby do <hi>lay a Foundation</hi> for one or more afflictive Maladies, to the Prejudice of the <hi>Mind,</hi> as well as of the Body—And provided, <hi>this</hi> be <hi>already</hi> the Caſe of any under my Charge, let me intreat you to ſeek for Relief, as ſoon as poſſible: Don't ſay, as, I am ſenſible, ſome have done, <hi>viz.</hi> "That no Phyſician can relieve us, becauſe our Trouble is altogether a Trouble in Mind, and the Body is not at all affected."
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:010740_0022_0F81753535910B10"/>
Which is, as to many Perſons, a very great Miſtake; for, very often, this Trouble of Mind <hi>takes it's Riſe</hi> from bodily Maladies; and therefore unleſs the Body be relieved, and the dark Cloud which hangs over the Brain be ſcattered, it will be to little Purpoſe, to offer them the very beſt Inſtructions, becauſe they are, at preſent, <hi>uncapable</hi> of weighing Matters according to their true Value.—Neglect not therefore, in the Caſe of <hi>Melancholy,</hi> to conſult the <hi>Phyſician;</hi> and if he ſhall inform you, that <hi>the ſame</hi> is occaſioned by a Diſorder of Body, then ſubmit to his Preſcriptions.—And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, if you apprehend, that <hi>I may be helpful</hi> to you, then you (and even all others of the <hi>Pariſh</hi>) ſhall be welcome to my Study; and I ſhall be ready to aſſiſt you, as God ſhall enable me.—I may not omit to ſubjoin,</p>
