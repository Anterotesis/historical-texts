            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE falls of the People of God do darken their ſincerity: they are as a Cloud covering their uprightneſs: they do make their ſincerity queſtionable unto others: ſome that take notice of their falls are ready to ſuſpect, and others are ready to deny their ſincerity; ſtanders by are apt to impute their falls to their Hypocriſy and the reigning power of ſin; as if they had now proved themſelves to be Hypocrites. They are ready to ſay of them, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Doeg, Lo this is the man that made not God his trust.</hi> And their
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000853_0003_0FABA21418685E08"/>
falls make their ſincerity queſtionable to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: if they have ſeen ſomething of upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in themſelves before, now they fear, they were miſtaken: they think if there had been any Grace, that would have preſerved them from falling: their falls wound their Conſciences and diſturb their Peace. They think if God had loved them, he would not have ſuffered them to fall into ſuch ſin: it ſeems to them to be the fruit of Gods hatred: they are apt to think that their ſins have turned away the heart of God from them, and that he cannot delight in them: they think moreover that if they had loved God, they could not have been drawn to ſin ſo againſt him. Satan is wont to improve their falls unto their diſcouragement; and raiſes ſuch miſts, that day is turned into night unto them. Upon this occaſion Chriſt puts this queſtion to <hi>Peter</hi>: the Diſciples might be unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed with him, becauſe of his fall; and he might be diſſatisfyed with himſelf: but hereby Chriſt is leading of him into the Examination of his own ſincerity. You may conceive Chriſts meaning thus: <hi>Peter</hi> you have made a Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion many years: but in the time of my affliction, you ſhamefully denied me, you formerly profeſſed that you would dye with me, before you would deny me, but as ſoon as the Temptation came; you preſently denyed me: and as if it were not enough to do it once, you did it a ſecond
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000853_0004_0FABA21589BCFF08"/>

Many men ſeem to themſelves to walk in a way of Holineſs, yet don't certainly know that ever they did perform an act of ſaving grace; though all that make an high profeſſion don't ſeem to themſelves to lead an holy life, yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of them do: they are conſciencious of all their ways, have many religious affections; mourn for ſin, rejoyce in Sabbaths, are thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for mercies; are afflicted under the Tokens of Gods Anger, are deſirous of the Converſion of others: it ſeems to them, that they live in ſome degree as Saints of old did: they think they walk holily, yet many of theſe perſons don't cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know that ever they did perform one act of ſaving grace, ſeveral of them never did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form one act of ſaving grace, therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know that they have: and ſome that have done it, are in the dark about it; they are under doubts and uncertainties about it: the Queſtion is, Whether ſuch perſons can know from their Walk, that they are ſincere. This the Doctrine does deny, and it may thus be cleared up.</p>

                  <hi>Argument</hi> 1. It is the acting of Grace that makes and ſhews the Walk to be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>: it is not the orderlineſs of mens walk that ſhews it to be holy; nor the affectionateneſs of mens hearts in Religion, that ſhews their walk to be holy; nor the long continuance of good carriages, nor a good behaviour in a day of temptation; nor a ſavoury ſpirit; theſe things may all be, yet the walk not be holy: if there be the acting of love, faith and repentance, then the walk is holy: but all that men do is done in hypocriſy, if there be not the acting of grace: if there be no grace in their prayers, in their faſtings, in their diſcourſes; all is in hypocriſy: conſcienciouſneſs don't prove their walk to be ſincere: the young man in the Goſpel was conſcientious: Mat. 19.20. <hi>all theſe things have I done from my youth.</hi> Zeal don't prove it, a man may be zealous, yet not upright: <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2. they be the actings of grace that make and ſhew the walk to be holy; if it be not a life of faith and love, it is not a holy life: Gal. 2.20. <hi>the life that I live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God</hi>: therefore he that don't know that he has performed an act of grace, can't know that he has an holy walk: he that don't know that he has that which is the life of an holy walk, and eſſential to it, can't know that his walk is holy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is harder to know an holy walk than one act of grace: it is harder for any man to diſcern
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000853_0009_0FABA2194D8FFC20"/>
that he leads an holy life, then that he performs a gracious act: for an holy life does conſiſt of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gracious actions; and it is harder to diſcern that a man has done many, then that he has done one: it is harder to find out many profitable herbs in the field than one; harder to diſcern many grains of Wheat among the Chaff, than one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is harder to find many Evidences of a good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate than one; to the diſcerning of many acts of grace, there is required more obſervation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, then to the diſcerning of one act of grace; if it be difficult to find one, it will be more difficult to find two, ten, an hundred: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that don't know that he has performed one act of grace, does not know that he leads an holy life. I may allude to that, Jer. 12.5. <hi>if thou haſt run with the footmen and they have wearied thee, how wilt thou contend with horſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If the holineſs of mens actions can't be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned ſeverally, it can't be diſcerned in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: if a man looks upon his actions ſeverally, and cannot ſay that this or that or any one was an holy action; he cannot ſay concerning any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it was an act of ſaving ſaith, or ſaving love; how can he when he looks upon his carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges together, ſay they are holy, if there be no one action that he can ſay is ſincere; how can he ſay that his walk is ſincere: if a man ſees an heap of corn, how can he ſay, it is an heap of wheat, when he does not know, that there is one grain
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000853_0010_0FABA21A08FF96C0"/>
of wheat there: the ſincerity of his walk depends upon the ſincerity of particular actions; and if that be hidden from him, how can he ſay his walk is ſincere: if for ought he knows every pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and duty be done in hypocriſy; then for ought he knows, his whole life is a life of hypocriſy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he can inſtance in no action that is certainly otherwiſe, it may be ſo for ought that he knows; if he can't anſwer to this queſtion. <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.17. <hi>Loveſt thou me</hi>? or to that, <hi>Joh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 9.35. <hi>doſt thou believe on the Son of God</hi>? or ſome ſuch like; he cannot tell that he lives an holy life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore ſuch a man can't prove his ſincerity from his walk. No walk can be evidential, but what is made up of acts of grace; therefore if he ſees none, he can have no evidence from his walk.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If there be no act of grace, there is no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity; therefore if he ſees no act of grace, he ſees no ſincerity; when there is no act of grace, there is no principle of grace: though a man walk in print, yet there is no ſincerity; many carry themſelves very fairly, but if there be no grace, there is no uprightneſs in them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.42. <hi>I know you, that you have not the love of God in you</hi>; it is all counterfeit walk: they are like men upon the Stage, that perſonate other kind of men; ſo theſe men walk like Saints, and talk like Saints; but if there be no act of grace, they are no Saints, they want that which does conſtitute a Saint; therefore if a man do not know any act of grace
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000853_0011_0FABA21AB96004D0"/>
in himſelf, he can't know himſelf to be a Saint, though he walk like an Angel.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The multiplication of ſuch acts as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Saints and hypocrites, don't ſhew him to be ſincere; prayer is common to Saints and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34. <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him, they returned and enquired early after God</hi>; therefore if a man do this a thouſand times, it don't prove him to be a Saint; ſo morality is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Saints and hypocrites. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.20. and if a man carries morally, twenty years together, it don't ſhew him to be a Saint; ſo zeal, ſo delight in Sabbaths; if an hypocrite may do theſe things, then the multiplication of them, and walking in ſuch a way is no evidence; that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, let it be multiplied never ſo often, don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſaving: multiply cyphers, and they make no number: therefore there can be no evidence of a good eſtate from a mans walk, unleſs he knew ſome act of grace; if he can't diſcern ſome act of ſaving grace, he muſt be at a loſs about his ſincerity.</p>

               <p>See the reaſon why many Profeſſors are unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied about their ſincerity; though they have a pretty good converſation, are conſcientious, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate, zealous yet they are full of fears, they are often perplexed, and don't know what to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000853_0012_0FABA21B81619B70"/>
make of themſelves; it ſeems to them that their walk is pretty much according to rule, but they do not know that ever they did perform any act of ſaving grace; they can't anſwer to ſuch que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, <hi>Loveſt thou me?</hi> Joh. 21.17. <hi>Or doſt thou believe on the Son of God?</hi> Joh. 9.25. this does create a deal of perplexity to them; and they are afraid what will become of themſelves, after all their profeſſion. And there are three ſorts of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some Profeſſors never did ſee any act of grace in themſelves; they never had any: and therefore could not ſee any: they have had affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but no love; ſorrow, but not godly ſorrow, encouragement, but no faith. There be many Profeſſors that are utterly deſtitute of gracious car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, they have the reſemblance of them, but they never had any exerciſe of grace; they are <hi>ſpiritually dead,</hi> and never did perform any act of <hi>ſpiritual life</hi>; thus it was with <hi>Saul, Doeg, Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel, Judas</hi> and <hi>Demas,</hi> they were only the pictures of Saints, and imitated the actions of Spiritual Life, but did not perform them; <hi>an evil tree can't bring forth good fruit, men can't gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thiſtles:</hi> Mat. 7.16, 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they can't ſee acts of grace: men cannot ſee that which is not.</p>
               <p n="2">2: Some Profeſſors never did certainly know that they have performed any act of ſaving grace, they have diſcovered the workings of grace ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000853_0013_0FABA21C21A01FB0"/>
in themſelves, but not ſo plainly, as to be able to ſpeak roundly up to it, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt all things; thou knoweſt that I love thee?</hi> Joh. 21.17. they underſtand that there is a great deal that does reſemble grace, that is not grace; and ſo they doubt whether it be of the right kind: they know that there is a temporary faith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.13. <hi>ſome believe for a time, and then fall away</hi>; and there may be ſtrong deſires and delight, where there is no ſincere love; here may be great pangs of affection, without any up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, and the acts of grace were not ſo clear, as ſome others do ſpeak of, hence they are not fully ſatisfied; as when one ſees a man at a great diſtance, he is at ſome loſs whether it be a man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some have certainly ſeen the workings of grace, but through temptations ſince, they have loſt the certainty of that knowledge; at the time they knew they did believe in Chriſt, and that they loved God, and could ſay as <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 116.1. <hi>I love the Lord</hi>; and as, Pſal. 46.1. <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength and refuge:</hi> but afterwards they have not ſo full and clear a remembrance of it: and God brings them into affliction, and unbelief prevails, and now they are ſuſpicious that they were miſtaken; beſides, God don't hear their prayers, they have ſought him many a time for ſuch &amp; ſuch a mercy, and he has denied them at laſt: beſides, they find a dead heart, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtrong, and have had no ſuch plain working
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000853_0014_0FABA21D0247F430"/>
of Grace a pretty while, accordingly they are full of fears whether they are not miſtaken: they ſay, if there were no deceit in it, how comes it to be ſo and ſo with me?</p>

It is not good to depend upon the judgment of others, for they do not know, whether a man be ſincere or not. All the external acts of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Piety, Juſtice and Sobriety, may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a man that has no Grace; Prudence and Conſcience may produce them all: and one that has no Grace may carry as well in the eye of the world, as he that has it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>
                  <hi>Conſider</hi> 1. The inward actings of Grace are inviſible to others. A man may look into his own heart, and ſee the actings and workings that are there; but he can't look into the hearts of others; men can't tell what actings there be
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000853_0015_0FABA21DB1733DA0"/>
in their underſtandings and wills: men can't ſee when they act, nor what they act, nor what they act upon; nor how they act: men can't tell whether they chuſe or refuſe. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, who can know it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Men cannot by words or actions make the actings of grace ſo viſible to others, that they can diſtinguiſh them: if a man talk gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly and walk graciouſly, he can't make another certain that he does ſo: another that ſees the external action, can't certainly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from a formal action; if he ſatiſfy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, yet he can't aſſure another, that it is a gracious action: a man may ſpeak like an Angel, yet not have charity; <hi>he may give all his goods to feed the poor, and his body to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and yet not have charity,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.1, 2, 13.</p>

themſelves is, that they have a conſciencious care to do their duty, and are many times affected in a religious way, and hope, they do truſt in Chriſt and make the glory of God their end; and they find affection to the people of God: but this you may be ſure of, you can't conclude your ſincerity from your walk, unleſs you know that you have performed ſome act or acts of ſaving grace: if you do know that, then you have reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude your walk to be holy: where there is one act of ſaving grace, there will be more: there is the principle, but without this you cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſider</hi> 1. If you be ſincere, this confidence is meer flattery; good men ſometimes think they are good upon ſuch foundations as will not hold: as becauſe God does the things that they have prayed for; becauſe he ſmiles upon them in his Providence; becauſe others think they are Saints: ſo this is one way of flattery: if you be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, yet you can't tell it from your walk, if you do not know that you exerciſe grace: for ought any thing that you know, your life is a life of hypocriſy: men may do all that you know you do, and yet be hypocrites; your walk can't be evidential to you, if you do not ſee the acts of grace, your confidence is preſumption; men muſt go upon a ſure bottom, 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves, prove your own ſelves</hi>; &amp; this flattering &amp;

               <p n="2">2. If you be not ſincere, it may prove your ruine; ſome men that take notice of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſneſs do conclude themſelves godly, when they are ungodly: and fall ſhort of a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of grace: they are deſtitute of faith and love, Joh 5.42. <hi>I know you, that you have not the love of God in you:</hi> but becauſe they imagine that they are ſincere, they reſt in their preſent attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Joh. 9.41. <hi>becauſe you ſay we ſee, therefore your ſin remaineth:</hi> when they are ſtirred up to get ſincerity, they hope they have it already, they hope others will take the warning, and that their children will hearken, but they think themſelves are out of danger: counſels and warnings are loſt upon them, they bleſs themſelves in their preſent eſtate, they think their diſeaſe is cured, and ſo give over the uſe of means; they think they are provided for Eternity, and ſo they are at reſt: they are under ſome endeavours to get more knowledge and more grace, but not to be Converted: hence this work is neglected; when once they have taken up ſuch a conceit that they are godly, they have got their deaths wound, if mercy do not prevent: they live careleſly, and when they come to dye, they will be ſhut out of

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000853_0019_0FABA2311AE05F00"/>
right interpretation of the Scripture; though many ſigns that men give are very fallible: but if the ſigns be good, there is very good uſe to be made of them; though a man may ask ſigns of ſigns endleſsly; yet they are of good advantage to beget a probable knowledge of a mans good eſtate; many perſons are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and ſupported by them. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Hereby we know that we are paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the brethren</hi>: and they are a further confirmation to thoſe that have had Aſſurances of their ſincerity: when they find Scripture ſigns falling in with thoſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, which they have formerly received, they are further eſtabliſhed thereby.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the viſible actings of Grace will ſatisfy all ſorts of Chriſtians. We may diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Chriſtians into two ſorts; ſome are perſons of great underſtanding and knowledge, they have a deep inſight into thoſe ways of deceit and hypocriſy that the heart is ſubject to: and they are apt to be puzled with queſtions and doubts, that fly over the heads of others; they are afraid of ſuch deceits as other men don't ſuſpect: but when they have plain viſible workings of Grace, that they know to be Grace, this fully ſatisfyes them: <hi>Thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> Joh. 21.17. Others are weak and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and can't give many ſigns of true Grace,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000853_0020_0FABA23CF2219670"/>
nor diſtinctly take them up, when they are laid down: yet when they plainly ſee the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible actings of ſaving Grace, the thing is put beyond queſtion. A weak woman is as well ſatisfyed that ſhe loves her child as the wiſeſt man in the land, though ſhe can't make a large diſcourſe upon it, nor prove it by infallible ſigns, becauſe ſhe feels her love: ſo it is in this caſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though the viſible actings of Grace may be counterfeited, yet they that have them, may know that they have them. There is nothing but may be counterfeited, men may counterfeit themſelves to be great men and holy men: Gold and Silver, and Jewels may be counterfeited. So theſe viſible actings of Grace; men may have very ſtrong affections; where there is no love or godly ſorrow. <hi>Matt.</hi> 8.19. <hi>Maſter I will follow thee whither ſoever thou goest.</hi> 1 Sam. 24.16. <hi>Saul lift up his voice and wept.</hi> Men may ſay Hoſanna to day, and Crucify to morrow. Yet thoſe that have the viſible actings of Grace know it. He that dreams thinks he is awake, but he that is awake, knows he is awake: though there be counterfeits, yet the viſible actings may be known at the time.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If men have ſuch viſible actings of Grace but now and then, they will be of great uſe to them as long as they live: though they
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000853_0021_0FABA23E60CEB650"/>
may be after that Expoſed to great Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet theſe actings of Grace that they have ſeen, will be a ſtay to them: they will work an abiding hope in the heart; they will often have occaſion to call to mind the years of the right hand of the moſt high, and their Song in the night. If a man ſhould live many years after, he will not forget this. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.2. <hi>That I may ſee thy power and glory, ſo as I have ſeen thee in the Sanctuary.</hi> If he has great Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from deadneſs and from Gods with draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; this will come to mind, and ſo he will have hope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the more ſuch acts are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, the more advantage he is under to have a ſettled Aſſurance of his ſincerity.</p>
