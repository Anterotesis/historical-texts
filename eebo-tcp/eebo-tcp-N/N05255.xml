            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Continuation of the Calm and Diſpaſſionate Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>DISPUNTING on Points on Religion would be one of the moſt pleaſant as well as profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Entertainments of this imperfect State, if thoſe who engage in Controverſy would be but careful to maintain that good Nature and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that benevolent and kind Regard to their Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, which Chriſtianity obliges us to ſhow towards all Men: If a ſincere Zeal for Truth, and a fervent Love to one another did direct and animate our Enquiries and Diſquiſitions, they would certainly bring us nearer to one another in our Sentiments, if not cauſe us all to think and ſpeak the ſame Things.</p>
            <p>But if, inſtead of offering the Reaſons of our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with Meekneſs, and ſpeaking the Truth in Love, we uſe the moſt provoking and inſulting Language we can invent, and rake every Dunghill to find Scandal to fling at our Adverſaries, and care not whether it be true or fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, ſo it be but ſpiteful and diſgraceful, if inſtead of rectifying their Miſtakes we try to blaſt the Reputation of thoſe who differ from us, and repreſent them as hateful and ridiculous, as Men of no Conſcience or Reaſon, and ſtrain their Expreſſions to ſuch an ill Senſe as was never intended; though this kind of managing Controverſy may make Sport for Fools, yet it muſt needs do a World of Miſchief by <hi>ſouring</hi> Men's Tempers,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006637_0005_10297199DF367698"/>and propagating Malice and Ill Nature, which is the very Temper of the Devils; and ſo making Men much more the Children of Hell, than they would be, if they did remain ignorant of the Truth in Conteſt.</p>
            <p>We never have more need to remember the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our Bleſſed Maſter, to <hi>love our Enemies, and to bleſs them that curſe us,</hi> than while we are engaged with ſuch an unfair Diſputant, eſpecially if his Malice and Falſhood be maſked with <hi>Saintſhip</hi> and a pretended Zeal for <hi>Piety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſenſible Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> has the Advantage of me both as to his Matter and Manner of Writing; his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is to load us with Reproaches, and once in a while to ſhew the Sprightlineſs of his Wit by breaking of a bitter Jeſt upon us: And it is an old Obſervation, that Satyrs are more eagerly entertained, and read with more Applauſe than Vindications. And the <hi>Spectator</hi> obſerves, <q>Ill Nature among ordinary Obſerves, paſſes for Wit. A ſpiteful Saying gratifies ſo many little Paſſions in thoſe who hear it, that it generally meets with a good Reception. The Laugh riſes upon it, and the Man who uttered it, is looked upon as a ſhrew'd Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyriſt.</q> But I am ſo near to that World in which all are <hi>ſerious,</hi> that I ſhall leave him in the quiet Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that ſort of Arguments. I ſhall likewiſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look moſt of his perſonal Reflections, and <hi>cruel Mockings,</hi> which his Friend Mr. <hi>Dickinſon,</hi> ſays, <hi>are as really Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution as Bonds and Impriſonments,</hi> P. 168. And ſhall directly come to the Point in Diſpute.</p>
            <p>The Controverſy lies chiefly in theſe three Points.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. Whether there can be any true Miniſters of JESUS CHRIST without a Succeſſion?</item>
               <item>II. Whether the Succeſſion in the Church of <hi>England</hi> has ever been broken?</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:006637_0006_1029719B64FADBA0"/>
III. Whether the the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Miniſters in <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> have Authority from CHRIST by Succeſſions?</item>
            </list>
            <p>To begin with the firſt of theſe, when I ſay, that there can't be a <hi>lawful</hi> Miniſter without an uninterrupted Succeſſion; I mean, that in order to a Man's being a <hi>lawful</hi> Miniſter, he muſt be ordained or appointed to that Office by ſome Men who have received Authority to ordain, and they who have not received ſuch Author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, can not conſtitute and Embaſſador of Chriſt; and this Authority to ordain ſince the Apoſtles Time, is not immediately from Heaven, but by Men. And it is not material whether the Ordainers be called Biſhops, Prieſts, Deacons, or by any other Name, if they have had the Power of Ordination committed to them it is ſufficient.</p>
            <p>To prove this I cited Mr. <hi>Law</hi>'s Reaſoning, which I eſteem as clear a Demonſtration as ſuch Truths are capable of; who ſays thus "If there be no Succeſſion of Perſon authorized from CHRIST to ſend others to act in his Name, then both <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> and <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Preachers are equally <hi>Uſurpers,</hi> and as mere Lay-Men as any at all. For there can't be any other Difference between the Clergy and Laity, but as the one hath Authority derived from CHRIST, to perform Offices, which the other hath not. But this Authority can be no otherwiſe had, than by an uninterrupted Succeſſion of Men from CHRIST, impower'd to qualify others. For if the Succeſſion be once broke, People muſt either go into the Miniſtry of their own Accord, or be ſent by ſuch as have no more Power to ſend others than to go themſelves. And can theſe be called Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of CHRIST, or received as his Ambaſſadors? Can they be thought to act in his Name, who have no Authority from him? If ſo, then <hi>every chriſtian Slave,</hi> may ordain to as good Purpoſe as the beſt <hi>Biſhop in Old England or New.</hi> For it can only be objected to ſuch Actions, that they had no Authority
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006637_0007_1029719E5E3542D8"/>from CHRIST. And if there be no Succeſſion of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers from CHRIST, every one is equally qualified to ordain. — The Adminiſtring a Sacrament is an Action we have no Right to perform, conſidered ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Men, Gentlemen, or Scholars, or Members of the civil Society. Who then can have any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to interpoſe, but he that has it from CHRIST? And how that can be had from him, without a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Men from him, is not eaſily conceived. Should a private Perſon chooſe a Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> and declare his Authority good; would there be any Thing but Abſurdity, Impudence and Preſumption in it? But why he cannot as well Commiſſion a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to act, ſign and ſeal in the King's Name, as in the Name of CHRIST, is unaccountable.</p>
            <p>The Miniſters of CHRIST are as much poſitive Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances as the Sacraments, and we might as well think, that Sacraments no inſtituted by him, might be means of Grace, as thoſe paſt for his Miniſters, who have no Authority from him.</p>
            <p>Once more, all Things are either in Common in the Church of CHRIST, or they are not: if they are, then every one may Preach, Baptize, Ordain, &amp;c. If all Things are not thus common, but the adminiſtring the Sacraments and Ordination, &amp;c. are Offices appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to particular Perſons, then I deſire to know, how, in the preſent Age, or any other ſince the Apoſtles, Chriſtians can know their reſpective Duties, or what they may or may not do, with reſpect to the ſeveral Acts of Church Communion, if there be no uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Succeſſion of Perſons authorized from CHRIST? For till Authority from CHRIST appears to make a Difference between them, we are all alike, and any one may oſſiciate as well as another. Therefore to make a Jeſt of the uninterrupted Succeſſion, is to make a Jeſt of Ordiantion, to deſtroy the ſacred Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and to make all Pretenders to it, as good as thoſe who are ſent by CHRIST.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:006637_0008_1029719FE55017F0"/>
Now what Anſwer has Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> returned to this Reaſoning? Alas, he has paſt it over in profound Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. But why was this Neglect? Certainly it could not be an overſight, for it was the firſt Argument that ſtared him in the Face. Neither was it for want of Time or Paper, for after above a Year of Preparation, he has ſent us a large Piece of 172 Pages, pretending that it is an Anſwer to our Reaſons for our not being Diſſenters; and yet the moſt material are entirely overlook'd. Or laſtly, did he think this Reaſoning to be too weak and childiſh for him to take Notice of it? No, ſurely, for the weaker he accounts any Part of our Diſcourſe, the more he labour to expoſe it to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. It remains therefore that the only Reaſon muſt be, that he knew it was unanſwerable: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wiſeſt Courſe was to paſs by it in Silence; in which Manner he has treated moſt of our Arguments. But if he had anſwered this one ſingle Argument ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, it would have been of infinitely more Value than all his great Book without it. Had he cleared up but this one Point, and ſhewed how a Man who has no Authority from CHRIST, can conſtituted a true Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador for him, I would have returned him my hearty Thanks, and have joined immediately with the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, although I believe they have no <hi>Miſſion</hi> from CHRIST. But to be <hi>peſtered</hi> and <hi>teaſed</hi> from Time to Time with long and virulent <hi>Addreſſes,</hi> urging us to become Diſſenters with ſuch vehement Importunity, as though all we are worth to Eternity, as well as the Salvation of the Heathen World did depend upon it; and yet at the ſame Time not to afford one faint Endeavour to remove the Obſtacle out of the Way; really Mr. <hi>Hobart,</hi> this looks a little diſingenuous. Indeed, I blame no Man for not doing Impoſſibilites, as this is: I only blame him for boaſting ſo often that he had confuted us, when he knew, that our chief Arguments not only remained untouched, but were really unanſwerable. But though he cannot anſwer our plain Reaſons for the Neceſſity of a Succeſſion, yet he thinks to bear us down
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006637_0009_102971A459D075A0"/>by Authorities. Whereas I muſt let him know, that ten Thouſand Authorities in Matters of Religion are not equivalent to one plain Reaſon. And it will not excuſe my living in Error and Sin, to ſay, it was agreeable to the Opinion of ſuch a Divine, or ſuch a Church. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is the Birth Right of every Man, for the uſing of which he muſt be be accountable to the Author of it.</p>
            <p>However we will allow the Opinion of others its proper Weight and Influence. The firſt Authority he cites, is Article XXIII, of the Churh of <hi>England,</hi> which runs thus, <q>It is not lawful for any Man to take upon him the Office of publick Preaching, or miniſtering the Sacraments in the Congregation, before he be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called and ſent to execute the ſame. And thoſe we ought to judge lawfully called and ſent, which be choſen and called to this Work by Men who have publick Authority given into the Lord's Vineyard.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You will now eaſily perceive that this Article aſſerts the Neceſſity of a Succeſſion in the ſame Senſe as I have done, if you obſerve, that the World <hi>Congregation,</hi> when theſe Articles were compoſed, was uſed in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Senſe from what is annext to it at this Day. A <hi>Congregation</hi> now denotes a Number of Chriſtians who can meet to Worſhip in one Place, but in theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles it ſignifies the whole Catholick Church diſperſed all over the Earth; as you may ſee in Article XIX, where the Catholick Church is thus defined, <q>The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church of CHRIST is a Congregation of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Men, &amp;c.</q> Now, ſays this Article, none are to be accounted lawful Miniſters unleſs they have had an Ordination by ſuch Men as have received an outward Commiſſion or Authority in the Church, impowering them to call and ſend others. And he who is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by ſuch Men, who never had publick Authority committed unto them in the Church, to call and ſend Miniſters into the LORD's Vineyard, he is no lawful Miniſter. From hence it follows, that where there
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006637_0010_102971A8CB4E68C0"/>is no Succeſſion, there is no lawful Miniſter, and where the Ordainers never received Authority to call and ſend others, there the Ordination is a <hi>Nullity.</hi> Thus, if the Biſhop who ordained me had received no Authority to ordain, then I am no lawful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and the ſame is true of him, if his Ordainers had not received publick Authority, and the ſame holds true in all Ages. So that the Line of Succeſſion muſt reach up to the Apoſtles, otherwiſe there can be no lawful Miniſtry. So that according to this Article, the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or <hi>Independent</hi> Miniſters of <hi>New-England</hi> are no lawful Miniſters, for that Set of <hi>Prieſts</hi> who ſeparated from the Church of <hi>England</hi> and ordained them, never had received <hi>publick Authority in the Church</hi> to ordain or ſend others; whatever Authority they uſed, it was <hi>aſſumed</hi> or ſtolen, no ſuch publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was ever committed to them. Theſe Miniſters therefore <hi>entred not in by the Door, but climbed up another Way.</hi> How unlucky was Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> in producing this Article for Proof, that a Succeſſion is unneceſſary?</p>
            <p>His next Evidence is Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> P. 57. who ſays, <q>I do not find any one of the antient Fathers that makes the local, perſonal, viſible and a continued Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a neceſſary Sign or Mark of the true Church in any one Place.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But pray, what Succeſſion is this, which he ſays is not neceſſary? Is it a Succeſſion in the Chriſtian Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood or Miniſtry? No certainly: but a <hi>local, perſonal, viſible, continued</hi> Succeſſion of the Church, i. e. in one Place: This, be ſays, is not neceſſary, or a Mark of its being true. Thus, altho' there has not been a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible continued Succeſſion of what we call a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church in <hi>England</hi> in the Times of Popery, yet that is no certain Mark of Sign that this Proteſtant Church is not a true Church. This, I ſuppoſe was in Anſwer to the Papiſts, who inceſſantly demand, Where was your Proteſtant Church before <hi>Luther?</hi> But how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent was this to the Caſe before us? Dare Mr. <hi>Hobart ſay,</hi> that Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> was of Opinion that
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006637_0011_102971AA502A7550"/>the apoſtolick or miniſterial Authority was loſt in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> in the Times of Popery? Had he taught ſuch Doctrine as this, I dare ſay, the <hi>Red hot Zealots</hi> would not have cut off his Head for his Popery: nor would Mr. <hi>Neal,</hi> and other Diſſenters at this Day ſpeak of him as being more than a <hi>Devil.</hi> Surely he was hard put to it, to find Evidences, otherwiſe he would not have produced ſuch impertinent ones as theſe, and put them in <hi>Capitals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is difficult to bring all his Evidences together, they being ſcattered here and there at a great Diſtance. But I think there is but one more, P. 78. He cites Biſhop <hi>Hoadly,</hi> ſaying, <q>
                  <hi>This regular uninterrupted Succeſſion of Perſons, qualified and regularly ordained,</hi> is a Matter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be proved, &amp;c. And there is <hi>a Certainty that this Succeſſion hath often been interrupted.</hi>
               </q> In anſwer to which I would obſerve, his Lordſhip uſes the Words, <hi>This regular uninterrupted Succeſſion,</hi> in the Senſe of the <hi>Non-Jurors,</hi> againſt whom he was writing: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Evidence is nothing to the Purpoſe. We hold the Neceſſity of a Succeſſion in no other Senſe than is expreſt in Article xxiii. of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> that is, that they who ordain others muſt have Authority to do it, otherwiſe the Ordained are not lawful Miniſters: Whereas this Regular Succeſſion which the Non-Jurors contended for is broken, when ſome Biſhops are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived by the Civil Government, altho' they who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them are ordained by Men who have publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſo to do. Now this <hi>Regular Succeſſion</hi> (ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Non-Jurors) I freely own is not neceſſary; nay, it is certain, it has been interrupted in ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. But then theſe Interruptions (ſo called) have not at all impaired the Apoſtolick Authority which is continued ſtill by Ordinations performed by true Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. In other Words, a Breach in the Non-Jurors <hi>Regular Succeſſions,</hi> is no Breach at all in the real Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Succeſſion by Ordination, which we believe to be neceſſary.</p>
            <p>But if his Lordſhip really meant, (as I believe he did
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006637_0012_102971AD4BCDD1F0"/>not) that they who ordain others, may convey valid Orders, although they themſelves have no Authority to ordain; then I muſt beg leave to diſſent, and reply in his own Words,<note n="†" place="bottom">Defence of Epiſcopal Ordination, <hi>P. 406.</hi>
               </note> I hope he will not expect that I ſhould be led by Authorities of modern Authors, (when he himſelf hath ſo often declared againſt it) in a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of mere Judgment and Reaſoning ;or yield to great Names, without conſidering the Grounds upon which their Aſſertions are built. The Grounds of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Judgment, I have already given: and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Silence in ſuch an important Point, is a tacit Acknowledgment, that it is unanſwerable.</p>
            <p>I grant, that as Men may uſe the World <hi>Succeſſion</hi> in different Senſes, and view the Thing in different Lights, ſo there may be ſome Men of great Learning, who taking it in the Senſe of ſome <hi>Non-Jurors,</hi> may with Reaſon make a Jeſt of it. But I'm inclined to think there is no ſound <hi>Believer,</hi> much leſs learned Biſhop or Divine, who will ſay, that a Succeſſion, (as I uſe the Word) is unneceſſary; or in other Words, that it is not neceſſary that they who ordain ſhould have Authority ſo to do: which is all I now plead for.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I would obſerve, this ſame learned Divine, now Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> wrote a Treatiſe on Purpoſe to ſhew the Neceſſity of thoſe called <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters yielding to be ordained by true Biſhops, in order to their being accounted true Miniſters; in which he has carried the Matter as high, and done it as effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually as ever I could wiſh to ſee it done. And a Man's Judgment is to be diſcovered by the profeſt Deſign of his Writing, and not by a ſingle Sentence ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe are, I think, all the Authorities he has cited to prove the Non-Neceſſity of a Succeſſion in the Miniſtry; and whether they are ſufficient, I leave to the Reader to judge. I muſt confeſs it appears to me to be a very odd Way of Proceeding, to quote Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006637_0013_102971AF26D4DF48"/>and great Names to prove Contradictions to be Truths, and Impoſſibilities to be real Facts, which is really the Caſe here. For if a Succeſſion be not neceſſary, but Men may be true Ambaſſadors of CHRIST without it, then Men who have no Authority from CHRIST to go themſelves or to ſend others, yet have good Right to conſtitute Ambaſſadors for him, and thoſe ſo ſent without any Authority, yet have good Authority to Sign and Seal in CHRIST'S Name. Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> has ſaid a great deal, and with no ſmall degree of Aſſurance, which may ſerve to amuſe the Reader and puzzle the Cauſe, but every Man of plain common Senſe may with a very little Pains be fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied where the Truth lies. When Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> has tired himſelf with laughing at the Succeſſion, only ask him this plain Queſtion; ſuppoſing the Authority CHRIST gave to the Apoſtles is not contunied by a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Ordination, and that ſuch a Thing is needleſs, how can one Man have a better Right than another, to act in CHRIST'S Name, or as his Ambaſſador? If he ſhould ſay, ſome Men were ordained to that Office, but others were not: Ask him again, how came theſe Ordainers to have more Power to Ordain than every Body elſe? To this he muſt Anſwer, becauſe they themſelves had been ordained to the Miniſtry. And the like Anſwer he muſt return till you come up to our Bleſſed LORD JESUS who was the firſt Ordainer. In a Word, there is no Medium betwixt holding the Neceſſity of a Succeſſion, and laying the Miniſtry open and common, and aſſerting the Lawfulneſs of Lay-Ordination.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> is very angry with the <hi>New-Light</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, becauſe they are not ordained by Miniſters, which he ſuppoſes to be the only Method that GOD has appointed. And for that Reaſon he ſays, <hi>Chriſt will condemn them;</hi> and we <hi>ſhould not countenance</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them.</hi> Now if the Succeſſion ever was broke, and the Apoſtolick Power loſt, this muſt be the Caſe of all the Miniſters who aroſe after that Interruption, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006637_0014_102971B68263C548"/>began a new Succeſſion, for there could be no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters then to ordain them. And if all the Miniſters, for Inſtance, a Thouſand Years ago, undertook the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry without an Ordination by Miniſters, we my do ſo again, and again; it is no Matter how often; for the Apoſtolick Power being once loſt, is loſt for ever. And who in that Caſe has any Authority to begin a new Miniſtry? If ſome have a Right to begin a new Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, why have not every one the like Right? Why not <hi>New-Lights</hi> as well as <hi>Old-Lights?</hi> Indeed the Caſe is ſo exceeding plain and evident, that it ſhould ſeem like an Affront to a common Underſtanding to take any more Pains to prove, that a Succeſſion is neceſſary to make a lawful Miniſter.</p>
            <p>I am very ſorry to obſerve, that Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> inſtead of confuting this ſort of Reaſoning, has given himſelf an unaccountable Liberty to ſlander and miſrepreſent us, and imputes to us ſuch abſurd Tenets as we never had the leaſt Inclination to. Thus in his former <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs,</hi> he calls the peculiar Whims of the Non-Jurors, our <hi>Darling Principles,</hi> P. 120. And he would have it underſtood, that according to our Principles, the Civil Power had no Authority to deprive the Nor-juring Biſhops; with a great deal of the like Nature; which is ſo far from being true, that I ſincerely believe, that their <hi>Deprivation</hi> was both juſt and neceſſary, and that the <hi>State</hi> had a Right not only to deprive, but to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them; as <hi>Solomon</hi> did <hi>Abiathar.</hi> For the State certainly hath a Right to defend and preſerve etſelf, which it could not do, if its Enemies were allowed to hold the higheſt Dignities in the Church.</p>
            <p>The ſame untrue and unjuſt Repreſentation of our Principles he conſtantly makes in this laſt Addreſs, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing any Tenets to us, which he can eaſily confute, without any Regard to Truth or Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Thus ſays he, <q>We have already obſerved, that a Succeſſion of the Miniſtry in general will not ſatisfy Mr. <hi>Beach,</hi> but it is a Succeſſion in the particular
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006637_0015_102971B80888C0E0"/>Order of Biſhops, as ſuperior to Presbyters, which his Scheme makes neceſſary, P. 47.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Which is ſo far from being true, that as I declared before, and he knew it, ſo I ſay again, let the Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be called Biſhops, or Presbyters, or Deacons, or Ruling Elders, or Paſtors, let them be Superiors, or Inferiors, or all Equal, it alters not the Caſe ſo far as the preſent Controverſy is concerned: the only Thing I inſiſt upon here, is, that they who Ordain, ſhould have received Authority to ſend others, as our Article XXIII, requires.</p>
            <p>And yet almoſt all Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s Diſcourſe is pointed againſt this Tenet, which he falſly aſcribed to me. And therefore it is no Wonder he has done nothing towards convincing me of my Error, if I am in one.</p>
            <p>Again, he affirms, that <q>according to me, the Laity in their Communion aree in as bad a Situation,</q> 
               <hi>(as I ſhould have been in if I had remained with them, againſt the Dictates of my own Conſcience,)</hi> 
               <q>For their Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with GOD, abſolutely depends on ſuch a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in the Miniſtry as they are wholly deſtitute of.</q> P. 27. If this be true, I have certainly damned every <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> in <hi>New-England.</hi> And yet he often affirms that I ſay that Men's Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with GOD, <hi>abſolutely depends upon this Succeſſion.</hi> And at the ſame Time it is ſo far from being true, that I hold nothing is <hi>abſolutely</hi> neceſſary on our Part, but only <hi>Holineſs;</hi> I don't eſteem the Sacraments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be abſolutely neceſſary?</p>
            <p>With what Conſcience could Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> charge me with this ſtingy and uncharitable Opinion, when he ſaw with his own Eyes the clean Contrary in that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, part of which he cites? P. 42, where I uſed theſe Words, <q>Had I remained with you, and had the ſame Senſe of the Matter as I now have, and (I think) cannot help but have, I fear I ſhould have <hi>periſhed in the Gainſaying of Core,</hi> Jude 11.—In ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Things, I don't judge, cenſure, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn your Miniſters, or mean to inſinuate, that they
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006637_0016_102971B98D4DF1E0"/>cannot be ſaved. For that is a Sin of Ignorance in another, which in me would be a damning Crime. I am far from judging that your can't be ſaved in your Way, though erroneous.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Does this look like making Men's Salvation <hi>abſolutely to depend upon the Succeſſion?</hi> Does it appear like damning all the Diſſenters; as he repreſents it? He talks of uſing an <hi>honeſt Freedom;</hi> I'm thoroughly convinced of his uſing <hi>Freedom</hi> enough, I only wiſh we could ſee ſome Sign of his <hi>Honeſty.</hi> Let a Man take that Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> makes uſe of, and he will find no Difficulty to triumph over any Antagoniſt, and anſwer any Arguments without ever coming near them.</p>
            <p>And as to his ſaying ſo often, that it is a dreadful Thing to venture our Salvation upon a Succeſſion, as we do; I can ſee no Senſe in it: For we run no Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at all; but let it turn out which Way it will, we are as ſafe as they can be. If GOD don't require us to attend to a Succeſſion, then we have only taken a little more Pains to pleaſe him than was neceſſary: But if our Opinion be true, and GOD does require us to attend to the Succeſſion; then ſuch Men who have deſpiſed and neglected it, will appear to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted no ſmall Guilt.</p>
            <p>This Caſe is very much like that of the Chriſtian Religion; Infidels tell us, that we venture our Souls upon the Truth of the Goſpel, which perhaps may turn out to be a mere <hi>Cheat.</hi> To whom we reply, we don't run any Hazard at all by being Chriſtians. For if the Goſpel be a <hi>Fiction;</hi> our believing it to be true, and living up to it, can do us no hurt. But if it be true, as we have ſufficient Reaſon to believe it is, then <hi>Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi> are in amazing Danger. So it is here, our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is not at all endangered by our believing and regarding a Succeſſion in the Miniſtry, No, it is the only Way to be <hi>

               </hi> all the Danger lies in neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting it.</p>
            <p>And how this can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>troy a Man's Comfort, (as he ſays) is quite above my Comprehenſion: for we can
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006637_0017_102971BB2DCFC0B0"/>conſider, if there be a Succeſſion, no Church on Earth has a better Claim to it than the Church of <hi>England;</hi> And if there be no Succeſſion, or no need of it, then we are certainly ſafe, and in no Danger, whether we have it or not. So that we have the Comfort of being <hi>ſafe,</hi> which is no <hi>ſmall</hi> Conſolation. And every Man for the Peace of his own Conſcience ſhould make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Enquiry, whether the Miniſter of whoſe Hands he receives the Sacraments be indeed CHRIST'S <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</hi> And that Plea which ſome of the Laity make for their Careleſſneſs in this Affair, will not excuſe their Sloth before GOD, that is, <hi>let Miniſters diſpute this Point among themſelves; it don't belong to us to trouble our Heads about that Controverſy, who are lawful Miniſters.</hi> For he who is qualified to ſerve on a <hi>Jury</hi> to try Men's Titles to an Eſtate, can't pretend that he is not capable to form a Judgment in this Caſe. And to ſay that it will not be enquired in the Day of Judgment, whether we were Church Men or Presbyterians, is not true; for we are accountable for our careleſs Neglect of the leaſt Truth that we might have known. And the more diligent and faithful we have been to know, and do the Truth, the more acceptable we ſhall be to our great Maſter.</p>
            <p>As to his ſaying, that our Notion of a Succeſſion tends to Infidelity, it is equally groundleſs: for an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Succeſſion in the Miniſtry is a ſtanding Proof of the Truth of Chriſtianity. But it tempts Men to deſpiſe the Miniſters of the Goſpel, when they hear them call themſelves CHRIST'S <hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi> and pretend to be his <hi>Agents</hi> or <hi>Attornies,</hi> to <hi>act, ſign,</hi> and <hi>ſeal</hi> in CHRIST'S Name and Stead; and yet know, that CHRIST never ſent them, nor any impower'd by him. What Man of Senſe can reverence ſuch <hi>Pretenders</hi> as CHRIST'S <hi>Repreſentatives;</hi> when a Man can't be a <hi>Attorney</hi> for the pooreſt Fellow in the Land, without his own Act and Appointment? And when Miniſters are deſpiſed, and not eſteemed as CHRIST'S Ambaſſadors, Religion etſelf will fall into Contempt with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:006637_0018_102971BFA3D781B0"/>
The only Argument, I think, which he produces to prove that there is no Neceſſity of Succeſſion, is the want of Evidence that in Fact there has been a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. Now to prevent contending where we don't really deffer, I muſt obſerve, that he aſſerts the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a Succeſſion in the very ſame Senſe as I do. For, P. 55, 56, he affirms, a <hi>ſtanding Miniſtry is an Ordinance of</hi> CHRIST; which is the very ſame, as when I ſay, an uninterrupted Succeſſion in the Miniſtry is CHRIST'S Ordinance. He makes Impoſition of Hands by Goſpel Miniſters of Neceſſity to make a lawful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. And he ſays, <hi>it is diſorderly and ſinful to depart from this Method,</hi> P. 56. Now by <hi>Goſpel Miniſters,</hi> he means ſuch as have the Power of Ordination, for he thinks all Goſpel Minſters have this Power. And <hi>this</hi> (ſay he) <hi>is ſufficient to condemn the</hi> New-Light Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts <hi>with their Lay-Ordinations — Theſe diſorderly Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers have Reaſon to expect that</hi> CHRIST, <hi>inſtead of owning them as his Miniſters, will reject and condemn them for acting contrary to his Will, diſcovered by the Practice and Example of his Apoſtles, which he cauſed to be recorded for the Inſtruction of his Church in all Ages.</hi> And the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection given to the Churches of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>with Regard to ſuch diſorderly and irregular Perſons, is not to countenance, own or receive them, but on the contrary to diſcountenance and cenſure them.</hi> Now if this Doctrine be true, that CHRIST will condemn thoſe who act as Miniſters, and yet are not ordained by the <hi>Impoſition of commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onated Hands,</hi> as he affirms, then it neceſſarily follows, that if this unlawful Miniſter who was ordained by uncommiſſionated Hands Yeſter-day, ſhould ordain a ſecond Minſter To-day, CHRIST will condemn him too; becauſe all the Miniſterial Acts of the firſt, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned and condemned by CHRIST. And if this ſecond unlawful Miniſter ſhould To-morrow ordain a <hi>third,</hi> CHRIST will likewiſe diſown and condemn him too. And ſo on to the End, though they ſhould continue this <hi>diſorderly</hi> and <hi>irregular</hi> Practice a hundred, or a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years, yet CHRIST will never own them for his
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006637_0019_102971C413233738"/>Miniſters; neither ſhould his <hi>Churches countenance, but cenſure them.</hi> Wickedneſs by a long Duration will not become a Virtue. Thus Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> and I are entirely agreed, in the Neceſſity of a Succeſſion; only he is too much of a <hi>High-Flier</hi> for me, and is too rigid and ſevere towards them who have no Succeſſion; for he boldly affirms that CHRIST <hi>will reject and condemn them:</hi> Whereas I hope CHRIST will pardon their Miſtakes and Irregularities, and accept of their Sincerity; though at the ſame Time I ſhould not dare to venture upon ſuch an unlawful Practice, nor countenance thoſe who do, and that is the Reaſon of my leaving the Diſſenters. You ſee now, that after all Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s Exclamations againſt a Succeſſion, he differs from me about it in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but only in being more uncharitable, ſtingy and ſevere towards thoſe who have it not.</p>
            <p>If one were diſpoſed to be merry, it would be really diverting to obſerve how much Pains he takes to ſeem to differ from me; and yet after all his Toil and Sweat, he can't get one Inch from my Opinion. He delivers his Opinion thus, P. 56. <hi>Upon the whole; to make Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, meaning thereby, Impoſition of commiſſionated Hands, neceſſary in Point of Order, is a different Thing from making it eſſential to the miniſterial Character.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet juſt before in the ſame Page he had ſaid, that <hi>it is ſinful</hi> and <hi>diſorderly</hi> to neglect ſuch Ordination: that CHRIST will not <hi>own</hi> ſuch as do neglect it <hi>for his Miniſters, but reject and condemn them,</hi> and the Churches ſhould not <hi>countenance, own, or receive them, but diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and cenſure them.</hi> Now if it be not <hi>eſſential</hi> to a Miniſter, that he ſhould not enter upon the Work <hi>in a ſinful</hi> and <hi>diſorderly</hi> Manner, but come in at the Door, if it be not <hi>eſſential</hi> to a Minſter, that he ſhould be ſo ordained, as that CHRIST will <hi>own</hi> him for <hi>his Miniſter,</hi> and <hi>not reject and condemn him;</hi> if it be not <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the miniſterial Character,</hi> that he who pretends to it ſhould be ſo <hi>authorized</hi> as that the Churches ſhould not be obliged to <hi>diſown, diſcountenance,</hi> and <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> him; I ſay, if this be not <hi>eſſential, I wonder what
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006637_0020_102971C59837C0B8"/>is. But <hi>upon the whole,</hi> this I muſt ſay, let it be eſſential</hi> or <hi>circumſtantial,</hi> I don't think it ſafe to be in ſuch Miniſters Condition; ſince Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> ſays himſelf, CHRIST will not <hi>own</hi> but <hi>condemn</hi> them; and for fear of that I choſe to be ordained by <hi>commiſſionated Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed you may try it every Way, and as long as you pleaſe; and after all, you will find it impoſſible to condemn the <hi>New-Light</hi> Miniſtry, without aſſerting the Succeſſion. For what is wanting in their Miniſtry, but only that they who ordained them, had no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for it? And can we imagine that when a Man is ordained without any Authority, yet that he himſelf ſhould have good Authority to ordain? Or that his Succeſſor ſhould have it, though he had not? No ſurely. But as in <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> a thouſand <hi>Noughts</hi> in a Row make no Sum; ſo a thouſand ſuch Ordinations ſucceeding one another, will not make one lawful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, but CHRIST may condemn the laſt as well as the firſt.</p>
            <p>But to help Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s Charity towards the <hi>New-Light</hi> Miniſters, whom he in Scorn to us, calls our <hi>Brethren,</hi> I can tell him, that they are nearer a-kin to him than he is aware; for by converſing with ſome of them, I find, that they have a Mixture of a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> Ordination with their Lay-Orders, and ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have laid their Hands on them together with the Brethren; ſo that within a little Time the <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern-Mitten</hi> will be quite worn out with them too; and theirs will become very good and <hi>ſubſtantial Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Ordination.</p>
            <p>I come now to another Part of the Argument. I had ſaid, that GOD made it the Duty of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to attend to the Succeſſion in the Levitical Miniſtry, and it is equally neceſſary to attend to the Succeſſion in the Goſpel Miniſtry, and there is as much if not more Evidence to direct us as to the Goſpel Succeſſion, than there was to direct them about the <hi>Levitical.</hi> In An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this, he allows, that there was a Succeſſion in
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006637_0021_102971C76A827628"/>that Miniſtry and Prieſthood; But then he ſays, it was a <hi>legal Succeſſion,</hi> and it had a <hi>legal Proof,</hi> P. 62, 64, 65. But ſtill he very much <hi>defies</hi> that we ſhould pretend, that there is as <hi>clear</hi> Evidence of a Succeſſion under the Goſpel, as there was under the Law. Here then let us join Iſſue, and if I can't prove that there is the ſame kind of Evidence of the Succeſſion under the Goſpel, as there was under the Law, and if I can't pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as good Proof that I was ordained by one who had Authority from the Apoſtles by a ſucceſſive Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as an ordinary Prieſt at Chriſt's Birth could ſhew for his Deſcent from <hi>Aaron,</hi> then I'll contentedly bear his Reproach of <hi>Enthuſiaſm.</hi> To begin, he ſays, that the <hi>Aaronical Prieſts</hi> had a <hi>good legal Proof,</hi> and they had <hi>only a legal Succeſſion.</hi> And the ſame I ſay of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion under the Goſpel; a hidden and ſecret Succeſſion, and inviſible and ſecret Defects which are known only to GOD, I have no Concern with: <hi>ſecret Things belong unto GOD. What does not appear, is not.</hi> But what <hi>legal Proof</hi> had the <hi>Aaronical Prieſts</hi> at the Time of CHRIST'S coming in the Fleſh? Why, he tells us, P. 64. <hi>Authentick Regiſters of the Sacerdotal Family were kept among the Jews as long, and with as great Care as thoſe of the Royal Family.</hi> And this is the whole of his <hi>legal Proof.</hi> And if I ſhould allow it to be altogether true, it would not amount to any Proof at all, that theſe Prieſts were <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Deſcendents; for he don't pretend that theſe <hi>Regiſters</hi> were kept longer than thoſe of the Royal Family: and it was ſeveral hundred Years after <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Death before there was any <hi>Royal Family:</hi> How then could any Man know what Interruptions might happen in the Prieſthood between the Death of <hi>Aaron</hi> and the reign of King <hi>David?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that we may not be amuſed with empty Words, it is neceſſary that we ſhould conſider, what is meant by <hi>authentick Regiſters, kept</hi> of all the Deſcendents of <hi>Levi.</hi> And doubtleſs it muſt mean, that among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> there were Officers ſworn to record every Male Child of the Tribe of Levi, and that this Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006637_0022_102971CD53AA7450"/>was begun in <hi>Aaron's</hi> Life Time, and without any Interruption continued in all Places and in all Times of their Apoſtacy, Captivity and Diſperſions till CHRIST came. If Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> has Credulity enough to believe this to be fact, he can't meet with any difficulty in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving all the Jewiſh <hi>Fables</hi> and <hi>Oral Law,</hi> or all the Legends of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I grant, that the Jews ſome times made <hi>Regiſters,</hi> and ſo has the Chriſtian Church much more. Every Biſhop in <hi>England,</hi> has his Name in more than one <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Regiſter.</hi> Nay every <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Deacon</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtered. But then neither theſe nor the Jewiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters are <hi>everlaſting;</hi> but by accidents may be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Text he cites to prove that the Jews kept Regiſters is a full Proof of this. Ezra ii. 61, 62. <hi>The Children of Barzillai, which took a Wife of the Daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their Name: Theſe ſought their Regiſter among thoſe who were reckoned by Genealogy, but they were not found.</hi> Upon this Text, Dr. <hi>Patrick</hi> obſerves, <q>this Perſon, whoſoever he was, thought it ſo great an Honour to be deſcended from ſuch a noble Family as that of <hi>Barzillai,</hi> that he choſe to be called by that Name, which he preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own in the Family of the Prieſts: By which vain Ambition he loſt his Title to the Prieſthood, becauſe he could not make out his Pedigree from the Prieſts, but from <hi>Barzillai.</hi>
               </q> From hence it is evident, that though the Jews ſometimes made Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of their Prieſts, yet they did not conſtantly do ſo. No ſuch Thing was done in their Captivity: And the Regiſters they had before the Captivity, when the City and Temple were burnt, and the Remains of the People in the utmoſt Confuſion carried Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, even theſe were burnt or otherwiſe loſt; at leaſt in great Part. So that upon their return from <hi>Babylon</hi> they muſt know who were Prieſts by their retaining the Names of thoſe who had formerly executed the Prieſt Office in the Temple. So that if this Man had not exchanged his own Name in the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006637_0023_102971D050D5D080"/>Family of the Prieſts for his Wives more honourable Name, though he had no Regiſter to ſhow, yet he would not have been put by the Prieſthood. Regiſters they often had, which in all Probability were made by the help of Tradition, ſome hundred Years after ſome of the Perſons named in them were dead. And the Chriſtian Church abounds with ſuch <hi>authentick Regiſters.</hi> If you ſhould ask how the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> could know, who belonged to the <hi>Royal,</hi> who to the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Family, and ſo to every Tribe and Family in order to their quiet Enjoyment of the Land which GOD gave them by Lot; if there were no authentick Regiſters kept, how could they know, what <hi>Land,</hi> or what <hi>Offices</hi> belonged to each Man? I anſwer, they knew it by Poſſeſſion, by Tradition, by their retaining the Names of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Families, as other Nations do; but much leſs by <hi>authentick Regiſters</hi> and publick Records kept under Oath, than we do. And GOD never had appointed this Method; and if he did, they were far from care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerving it. The ignorant and barbarous <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> know very well, who among them are <hi>Sachems</hi> by Deſcent, and they have good legal Proof of it, without keeping <hi>authentick Regiſters.</hi> And the Iſraelites in the Time of their Idolatry and Ignorance uſed no better Methods to preſerve the Pedigree of their Prieſts <hi>clear,</hi> than the Indians do that of their <hi>Sachems,</hi> neither were they ſo careful and zealous about it, as will evidently appear, if we conſider, how often they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook the true GOD, and fell into the moſt ſottiſh Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. Among the ten Tribes, from the Diviſion of the Kingdom till their final Captivity, any Body was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to execute the Prieſts Office: It is therefore certain no <hi>authentick Regiſters</hi> of the true <hi>Prieſts</hi> were kept among them. In <hi>Judah,</hi> often, and for a long Time together, the Prieſt's Work was entirely laid aſide, and they undiſtinguiſhed from common Men. Nay ſo little Regard had they for the true Religion, that the Bible itſelf was not known among them. And when one was found, both the high Prieſt and King were mightily
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006637_0024_102971D1D6A637CO"/>ſurprized at what was contained in it. Now can we ſuppoſe, that they were extreamly careful to keep <hi>Regiſters</hi> of all the Males born in the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> when they were ſo ſtupid and careleſs as to loſe the Holy Bible, which contained all their Religion? Did ever ſuch ſtupid Negligence and ſottiſh Ignorance ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the Chriſtian Church? It is true, the Chriſtian Church did decline from their firſt Purity and Zeal; and the Weſtern Church fell into Superſtition and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: yet never were they without many Thouſand Copies of the Holy Scriptures. Never was the Chriſtian Church ſo careleſs, as to ſuffer Men to perform the ſacred Offices unleſs they had been ordained by <hi>commiſſionated Hands.</hi> Records and Hiſtories of every Age ſince Chriſt's Aſcention, afford a <hi>good legal Proof</hi> of this. But can we imagine, that the Jews were careful to keep the Prieſthood pure and unmixt, and <hi>authentick Regiſters,</hi> of all who were born to it, when they had no Worſhip of GOD at all among them; and were reſolved never to have again? For what End ſhould they preſerve the Prieſthood pure, when they never intended to make any Uſe of it? I may appeal to any Man who is not under the <hi>Influence of ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick Inſtinct,</hi> whether it is probable, that the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites kept <hi>authentick Regiſters</hi> of the true Prieſts, when <hi>there was no King in Iſrael, and every Man did what was right in his own Eyes?</hi> As Micah who himſelf ordained his own Son, and then a Levite for a Prieſt, when the whole Nation had loſt the Kowledge of GOD and his Prieſthood, and are thus deſcribed, 2 Chron. xv. 3. <hi>Now for a long Seaſon Iſrael hath been without the true GOD, and without a teaching Prieſt, and without Law.</hi> That Nation for a long Time was ſunk into ſuch Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Stupidity, that it is more probable, that not one Prieſt in a Thouſand could either read or write, than that they kept <hi>authentick Regiſters</hi> of all who were born to the Prieſthood. And one might almoſt as well look for <hi>authentick Regiſters</hi> among the wild <hi>Indians,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:006637_0025_102971D378372CA0"/>as to expect to find them in thoſe Ages of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Confuſion and Irreligion among the Iſraelites.</p>
            <p>How can it be thought, that this People were ſo exceeding careful to keep <hi>authentick Regiſters</hi> of all their Prieſts and their Children, when there was no officiating Prieſts among them, and they never intended that there ſhould be any? Yet this was often, for a long Time together the State of the Jewiſh Church. But was this, or any thing like it ever the Caſe of the Chriſtian Church; or of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it was not. But there always has been a <hi>Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and officiating Miniſtry.</hi> In a Word, whatever good <hi>legal Proof</hi> he ſhall find for the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Succeſſion, the ſame in kind, and much clearer I will produce for the Succeſſion under the Goſpel. But when he inſinuates that the Jewiſh Prieſts at Chriſt's Time could all of them produce <hi>authentick Regiſters</hi> of their Pedigree reaching up to <hi>Aaron,</hi> I muſt uſe the <hi>honeſt Freedom</hi> to tell him it is not only perfect Fiction and Romance, but plainly contradicted by the holy Scripture, <hi>Ezra</hi> ii. 62.</p>
            <p>And yet I allow that they had then, as we now have a good <hi>legal Proof</hi> of a Right by Succeſſion. We now have ſuch Evidence of our Title to the Miniſtry by Succeſſion, as all Nations, all Ages and Courts allow to be a good <hi>legal Proof</hi> of a good Title to an Eſtate. And there is no Man now in <hi>England</hi> proſſeſt of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Eſtate by Deſcent, who can give a <hi>better legal Proof</hi> of his <hi>legal</hi> Right to it, than every Biſhop can give of his Right to the Miniſterial Authority by a ſucceſſive Ordination.</p>
            <p>But as for his pretending that the Jews were more careful to keep <hi>authentick Regiſters</hi> than Chriſtians have been, which is all that he can offer on this Subject, it is perfectly impoſſible for me to believe it, while I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how much more Knowledge has prevailed in the Chriſtian, than in the Jewiſh Church; and how much more careful Chriſtians have been to preſerve the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ordinances pure, than the Jews were. The Jews
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006637_0026_10293BAC96DB6120"/>for many Years together wholly neglected GOD's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, Circumciſion, the Paſſover, &amp;c. and in a Manner forgot them. And is it likely that they were mighty careful about the Prieſthood? It is morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. But the Chriſtian Church never did deſpiſe and neglect Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper: But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obſerved them with great Veneration, they never were in any Age careleſs about the Oridination of their Clergy, ſo as to neglect it, or ſuffer it to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Lay-Men. If any Man denies this, let him name the Age, when the Chriſtian Church neglected theſe Ordinances of CHRIST. Whereas it is very eaſy to prove from holy Scripture that the Iſraelites wholly laid aſide and deſpiſed the Ordinances of their GOD, together with his Prieſts. I have now done with this Head, and I hope I have ſaid enough, if not more than enough to prove, that we have as good a Proof of our Succeſſion from the Apoſtles, as the Jewiſh Prieſts had of their Deſcent from <hi>Aaron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. I come now to the ſecond Enquiry, <hi>viz.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Succeſſion has been preſerved in the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> ſeems very angry with me for ſaying, that he had undertaken to prove that it was broken in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and now ſays, P. 67. that if I had been <hi>honeſt</hi> I ſhould have ſeen, that what he undertook to prove was, that <hi>the Succeſſion was not clear</hi> and <hi>indiſputable.</hi> Now wheter the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty is in me or Mr. <hi>Hobart;</hi> let the Reader judge, when he has obſerved that Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> in his firſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs uſes theſe very Words, P. 120. <hi>That the Line of Succeſſion was broken in theſe Inſtances is very clear.</hi> You ſee he does not expreſs it modeſtly, nor ſay, it was <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable;</hi> but affirms that he had clearly proved that it was broken. However, now he is aſhamed of it, and is become very modeſt, and I wiſh it might continue, although what is <hi>written is written.</hi> But now he is come a Peg lower, and only ſays, that our Succeſſion is <hi>diſputed,</hi> and <hi>abſolutely denied.</hi> And had he laid his
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006637_0027_102971DC730F6940"/>Charge no higher before, I ſhould not have taken any Pains to confute it: For there is not one Truth in Religion but what is <hi>diſputed</hi> and <hi>abſolutely denied</hi> by ſome Body or other. Some <hi>diſpute</hi> and <hi>abſolutely deny</hi> the Exiſtence of GOD. Muſt I then turn <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> or <hi>Sceptick?</hi> The Queſtion ſhould be, what Reaſon have they for diſputing or denying any Tenet? If they have no Reaſon for it, I hope we are not obliged to part with what ſome Men pleaſe to diſpute or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deny. I ſhall now examine his Reaſons for diſputing the Succeſſion in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And ſhall begin with an Argument he uſed in his firſt Addreſs, P. 121. which he thinks I did not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently attend to. I ſhall therefore now make ample Amends. He tells us Arch Biſhop <hi>Parker</hi> was ordained by four Biſhops who had been <hi>legally deprived</hi> in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign, and were not reſtored when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed this Action. This he ſays, <hi>renders</hi> Parker's <hi>Conſecration very doubtful, and indeed bids fair to nullify it.</hi> P. 74. and <hi>yet upon this,</hi> he ſays, <hi>all the Ordinations in the Church of England to this Day depend. And after all,</hi> he tells us, <hi>an Act of Parliament was procured to confirm</hi> Parker<hi>'s Conſecration about ſeven Years after it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi> Let us try now, whether we can't fairly get over theſe two Difficulties, and give ſuch an Account of the Affair as ſhall ſatisfy any reaſonable Perſon. The <hi>legal Deprivation</hi> which theſe Biſhops were under did not at all hinder their giving valid Orders. So the Government thought; othersiſe they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored them, before they employed them to conſecrate <hi>Parker.</hi> Can any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> of Senſe imagine, that a Papiſt Queen and Parliament could really and forever take away the Power of Ordination given by CHRIST to his Miniſters? if ſo, then the Heathen Kings and Emperors could have deprived the Apoſtles and all CHRIST'S Miniſters of that Authority he gave them, and have reduced them to the Condition of mere Lay-Men. I grant with his Author, that when theſe deprived Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were employed to conſecrate <hi>Parker,</hi> the <hi>Legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:006637_0028_102971DF6E3BA5C8"/>of their Proceedings were not ſo <hi>clear</hi> as might be wiſh'd for. But what then? One could not wiſh to have it <hi>clearer,</hi> that it was a <hi>valid canonical</hi> and <hi>regular</hi> Ordination according to the Goſpel: and that here is no room, to ſuſpect an Interruption; and this is all we contend for. And as to the <hi>legal</hi> Defect, it was <hi>purged</hi> away by the Queen's <hi>Warrant</hi> to them. So that all is exceeding <hi>clear</hi> here. And now as to the Act of Parliament to confirm <hi>Parker</hi>'s Conſecration ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Years after it was over, which makes the Matter look <hi>ſuſpiciouſly.</hi> The Caſe was thus, as Dr. <hi>Heylyn,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi> and all Hiſtorians that I ever ſaw agree,<q>All that was done, ſays <hi>Heylyn,</hi> was no more than this, and on ths Occaſion, a Queſtion had been made by captious and unquiet Men, and amongſt the reſt, by Dr. <hi>Bonner,</hi> ſometime Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> whether the Biſhops of thoſe Times were lawfully ordained or not; the Reaſon of the Doubt being this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Book of Ordination which was annulled and abrogated in the firſt of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> had not been yet reſtored and received by any legal Act of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time; which Cauſe being brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Parliament</hi> in the Eighth Year of her Reigh, the Parliament took Notice firſt, that their not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring that Book to the former Power in Terms ſignificant and expreſs, was but <hi>Caſus omiſſus;</hi> and the declare, that by the Statute fifth and ſixth of <hi>Edward</hi> VI, it had been added to the Book of Common Prayer and Adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments as a Member of it, or at leaſt as an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant to it, and therefore by the Statute 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 2. was reſtored again, together with the ſaid Book of Common Prayer intentionally at leaſt, if not in Terms. But being the Words in the ſaid Statute, were not clear enough to remove all Doubts, they therefore did revive now, and did accordingly enact, <hi>that whatſoever had been done by Virtue of that Ordination, ſhould be good in Law.</hi> This is the Total

               <hi>Validity</hi> of their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the Senſe of the Goſpel, but about its <hi>Legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity:</hi> or whether it was agreeable to the Laws of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> An Ordination may be <hi>valid,</hi> yea and <hi>canonical,</hi> and yet not ſtrictly <hi>legal.</hi> An Ordination by one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop is <hi>valid,</hi> an Ordination by three is <hi>canonical,</hi> but an Ordination is not <hi>legal</hi> in <hi>England</hi> unleſs the Form by which it is performed be eſtabliſhed by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Now all that the Parliament did in the Eighth of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was to declare that the Ordination of theſe Biſhops was <hi>legal</hi> or good in <hi>Law,</hi> ſince the Book by which they had been ordained was revived and eſtabliſhed by Parliament before they were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it. It is ſtrange that Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> who has for ſo many Years frequented the Courts, ſhould be quilty of ſuch an Inaccuracy as not to diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi> and <hi>Legality.</hi> But the Truth is, ſuch Miſtakes are abſolutely neceſſary to maintain a bad Cauſe.</p>
            <p>'Tis worth obſerving, that this Cavil inſtead of weakening, does very much confirm the Succeſſion and expell all Doubts: For can we imagine that the <hi>Papiſts</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:006637_0030_102971E28717DF48"/>who were ſo extreamly inclined to cavil againſt the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Biſhops, as to make a Clamour for ſuch a Trifle, would not have made a Parliament Buſineſs of it, if they had had any material Defect to object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them? Can we ſuppoſe, that if there had been any Pretence then of the <hi>Nag's Head</hi> Conſecration, or that the Ordainers had not been true Biſhops; they would not have made ſome Noiſe about it at that Time? Doubtleſs they would have made the Nation ring with it. But all that <hi>Bonner</hi> and other inveterate Enemies had to object, was this, that the Book of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination which the <hi>Papiſt</hi> Parliament had condemned, had not yet been legally revived by the Proteſtant Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which if it had been true (as it was falſe) yet it would have amounted to no more than a <hi>legal</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which would not at all have hurt their Character as Miniſters of CHRIST, and Biſhops of his Church. Neither CHRIST, nor his Apoſtles, nor any other of his Miniſters for three hundred Years, had any <hi>legal</hi> Right to officiate in any Nation on Earth: And if there is any Truth in what Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> ſays, that <hi>this bids fair to nullify</hi> Parker'<hi>s Ordination;</hi> it certainly bids much fairer to nullify all the authoritative Acts of CHRIST, and of all his Miniſters for the firſt three hundred Years, for it is certain, none of them were <hi>legal,</hi> or according to the Law of any Nation in which they officiated. What miſerable Shifts is this Writer driven to in order to prove that our Ordinations are <hi>diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> even ſuch as prove our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be equally, nay, more <hi>diſputable.</hi> Here I ſhall obſerve once for all, that the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> are to be conſidered in a twofold Capacity, either as to their ſpiritual Power, or as to their temporal Privileges and Honours. As to the Calling and Authority of Biſhops in ſpiritual Matters it is derived from CHRIST and his Apoſtles by Ordination, and from no other, neither King nor Parliament can give or take it away: But beſides this ſpiritual Authority, the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> have certain temporal Honours and Eſtates
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:006637_0031_102971E6F16D4A30"/>beſtowed on them by the King's Bounty, together with Juriſdiction in Caſes of Marriage, Wills and the like from continual Uſage, which are ratified and confirmed to them by <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> like the Eſtates and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of other Subjects of the Realm. Now theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Privileges depend upon the <hi>Legality</hi> of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination; ſo that if the Book by which they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, had been ever ſo agreeable to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet if it had not been eſtabliſhed by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, they could not be eſteemed Biſhops in Law, i. e. they could not have held their temporal Privileges, no, nor legally have exerciſed their ſpiritual Powers in <hi>England;</hi> and yet at the ſame Time their Authority as CHRIST'S Embaſſadors would have remained neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs certain and <hi>indiſputable.</hi> Now the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under Conſideration was not intended to put their <hi>ſpiritual Character</hi> out of Diſpute, but their temporal, <hi>that is,</hi> to declare that their Ordination was according to the Laws of the Land; ſo that they ſhould meet with no Oppoſition in obtaining their temporal Dues, or in exerciſing their eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, which by Law belonged to them, juſt as an Act of Parliament confirms any other Subjects in the peaceable Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Eſtates and Fortunes; when through ſome unreaſonable Pretences they have been liable to a Moleſtation in the Law.</p>
            <p>Now I hope I have ſaid enough to ſhew that <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>'s Conſecration ſtands as <hi>fair</hi> and as <hi>clear</hi> from all rational Exceptions in Point of <hi>Validity,</hi> as it is poſſible for any Ordination to be. By the Way, if any ſhould enquire, why did not Queen <hi>Elizabeth's Proteſtant</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament reſtore thoſe <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Biſhops whom Queen <hi>Mary's Papiſt</hi> Parliament had deprived of their Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks? Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi> gives us this Account of it,<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Abrid. V.</hi> 2. P. 330.</note> 
               <q>Some Bills were propoſed but not paſſed: One was for reſtoring the Biſhops deprived by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who were <hi>Barlow, Scory,</hi> and <hi>Coverdale;</hi> but the firſt
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:006637_0032_102971EB89CC1E20"/>of thoſe had been made to reſign, and the laſt being extreme old, reſolved to follow <hi>Latimer</hi>'s Example, and not to return to his See: So it was not thought worth the while to make an Act for <hi>Scory</hi> alone.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Queſtion lying betwixt us is this, whether the civil Powers, Kings, Parliaments, or Emperors can take away from CHRIST'S <hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi> that Authority which he gave them in Ordination, and abſolutely vacate his Commiſſion? He pretends to hold, that they can, and have done it. And I am proving that they cannot do it. I own they have a Right to put to Death, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh or deprive Biſhops of the Liberty of executing their ſpiritual Powers in their Dominions: but they cannot vacate their Commiſſion, or ſo deprive them, that they muſt ceaſe to the CHRIST'S Miniſters, and loſe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. Otherwiſe CHRIST'S Commiſſion from his Father, and the Apoſtles Commiſſion from CHRIST, might have been taken away from them by the civil Powers, under whom they lived. Theſe their implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enemies did all they could to <hi>deprive</hi> them, but they knew of no other Method than to impriſon, baniſh and kill them. But it ſeems, if Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> had lived at that Time he could have taught them a more eaſy and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Method, which was only to paſs an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and then it would have been all over with theſe Preachers; and CHRIST'S Kingdom would have been at an End. And doubtleſs if the civil Powers can deprive us of CHRIST'S Authority given in Ordination, they can deprive us of our Chriſtianity obtained in Baptiſm too. If they can <hi>unmake</hi> Men as Biſhops, they <hi>can unmake</hi> us as Chriſtians too. If they can diſannul Ordination, they can alſo diſannul Baptiſm. Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> ſays, our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion tempts Men to turn Infidels: But what can tempt Men more to deſpiſe CHRIST'S Kingdom and Religion, than to obſerve that there is nothing ſacred in it; but that all its Powers are given and taken away juſt as the State pleaſes? Nay, that the Enemies of CHRIST can when they pleaſe vacate his Commiſſion and nullify all
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:006637_0033_102971ED0F980508"/>his Authority? Again, if the Parliament's <hi>Deprivation</hi> did <hi>unmake</hi> the deprived Biſhops, then could they not be reſtored without a new Ordination: a ſecond Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration in that Caſe muſt be as abſolutely neceſſary as the firſt was. But ſuch a Thing was never heard of. So that I cannot think that a Man of Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s Senſe can poſſibly think that there is any Solidity in what he has ſaid to prove that the civil Powers did take away from CHRIST'S Miniſters the Authority committed to them in Ordination; and yet if he did not believe it himſelf, I'm at a loſs to account for his <hi>Honeſty</hi> in taking ſo much Pains to perſwade the ignorant that it was really ſo. And although the Act of <hi>Deprivation</hi> names <hi>Offices;</hi> yet that denotes no other <hi>Offices</hi> than what they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the State, not ſuch as they had received from CHRIST. The Office committed to them in Ordination they cannot reſign or part with, although they ſhould be ever ſo deſirous to part with it.</p>
            <p>And though theſe Biſhops had acknowledged that they had received their <hi>Spiritualities</hi> from the King, yet this means no more than that they were beholden to him for the Liberty of executing their ſpiritual Powers in his Dominions; or as it was expreſt in ſome Patents, <hi>to perform all Parts of the Epiſcopal Function, that by the Word of GOD were committed to Biſhops.</hi> Now theſe Offices and Liberties which the State had given, they juſtly took away from their Enemies. And whereas he ſuppoſes, that I expoſe myſelf to the Reſentment of my Superiors by this Plea; it is ſo far from the Truth, that it is the Plea that all the Friends of the Revolution and preſent <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> have ever made: And on the other Hand, his Pretence that the Act of <hi>Deprivation</hi> was deſigned to <hi>unmake</hi> the <hi>Non-juring</hi> Biſhops, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their Commiſſion from CHRIST, is one of the worſt Slanders that the moſt virulent Non-Jurors and <hi>Jacobites</hi> ever caſt upon the Government. And had I ſaid ſuch Things as he has done, I confeſs I ſhould have had ſome Apprehenſion of Danger. But as to Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> he
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006637_0034_102971F1876E1980"/>may write what he pleaſes without incurring any Danger at all in this World, that is the Privilege of the <hi>Lawleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Non-juring Biſhops in King <hi>William</hi>'s Reign, as our Succeſſion is not through them, ſo they were not ſo abſurd as to pretend that the Biſhops who ſucceeded in their <hi>Sees</hi> had not Authority by Virtue of their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration</hi> to confer valid Orders, they only ſaid that no other Biſhops had a Right to their <hi>Sees</hi> while they were alive, which whether true, or falſe, alters not our Caſe, nor hurts our Succeſſion. For our Ordinations are not like thoſe of the Independents, we are not ordained to this or that See, or Pariſh, or Flock; but Miniſters of JESUS CHRIST without any particular Relation to one Place more than another.</p>
            <p>And therefore ſuppoſing, with the <hi>Non Jurors,</hi> that Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> had no Right before GOD to be Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> while Dr. <hi>Sancroft</hi> was alive, yet that can raiſe no Diſpute about the Validity of his Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Conſecration; for he was not ordained to that <hi>See</hi> more than to any other.</p>
            <p>This Obſervation would be needleſs, if Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> did not undertake to write confidently about ſuch Things, as he has no proper Knowledge of. Now to ſum up the Evidence on both Sides, and leave it to the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's Judgment. Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> pretends, it is likely that the Succeſſion was broken when Dr. <hi>Parker</hi> was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated. The <hi>Nag's Head</hi> Story he now tells us he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways looked upon as a Falſhood, P. 74. But then <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> was ordained by four Biſhops who had been deprived by Act of Parliament under Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and not then reſtored, ſo that they <hi>were under a legal Incapacity,</hi> P. 75. To which I reply,</p>
            <p n="1">1. All the Biſhops who ordained <hi>Parker,</hi> were not under a <hi>Deprivation,</hi> and therefore ſuppoſing, that Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation had reduced them to the Condition of mere Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yet if but one of the four was a true Biſhop, that Ordination was valid.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:006637_0035_102971F30CC4D838"/>
2. This Deprivation was no more than the civil Power's reſtraining their acting as Biſhops in their own Dominions; and when this Reſtraint was by the civil Power taken off, that <hi>Deprivation</hi> then, and ſo far ceaſed. Now Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s granting a <hi>Warrant</hi> to theſe <hi>deprived</hi> Biſhops to conſecrate <hi>Parker,</hi> ſo far took off the <hi>Deprivation,</hi> and purged even the <hi>legal</hi> Defect.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nay, ſuppoſing they had had no <hi>Warrant</hi> from the civil Power to ordain, yet their ordaining <hi>Parker</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Goſpel, would have been very good and valid; though ever ſo much againſt the Will of the Government. For ſuch were all the Ordinations tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in the Church for three hundred Years after CHRIST, all being <hi>illegal,</hi> or againſt Law.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If <hi>Deprivation</hi> unmakes Biſhops, then they could never after do any Epiſcopal Act without a ſecond Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, a Reſtoration by Act of Parliament will not make a Biſhop of him who was not a Biſhop before that Act. Indeed I could not have believed, had I not ſeen it, that the Power of Prejudice ſhould be ſo great, as to make a wiſe Man continue ſuch a Noiſe about a civil Deprivation by a Papiſt Parliament, and call it <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making</hi> Biſhops, and I know not what. Suppoſe, that Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and her Parliament had baniſhed theſe <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Biſhops out of the Nation, and they had gone and ſettled in ſome other Parts of the Earth, can any Man ſuſpect that this Deprivation would have followed them to the Ends of the Earth, and have rendered them uncapable of acting as CHRIST'S Miniſters? And yet this Baniſhment is <hi>Deprivation,</hi> and a great deal more.</p>
            <p>From this Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> makes a ſtart back to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Time; and ſays, P. 76. <hi>Having thus taken a view of two or three Links at this End of the Chain, and ſeen how flawy and defective they look; let us now examine a few Links at the other End.</hi>—And here produces two Evidences to make it doubtful who were the firſt Biſhops in <hi>Rome:</hi> And adds his own Remark, P, 84. thus,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:006637_0036_102971F60AC93B00"/>
               <hi>I know of no other Scheme on which the Difficulties that occur in the Succeſſion of theſe Perſons can be ſolved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If he knows of none, I can acquaint him with one, which Mr. <hi>Bingham</hi> has given us,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Antigu. V.</hi> 1. P. <hi>57.</hi>
               </note> 
               <q>It is true, ſays he, there is a little Difference in the Account which theſe Authors give of the Succeſſion: for ſome reckon <hi>Linus</hi> firſt, then <hi>Anacletus,</hi> then <hi>Clemens;</hi> others begin with <hi>Clemens,</hi> and reckon him the firſt in Order from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but this is eaſily reconciled by learned Men; who make it appear that <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Anacletus</hi> died whilſt St. <hi>Peter</hi> lived; and that <hi>Clemens</hi> was ordained their Succeſſor by St. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo. So that we have two or three Perſons, by this Account, ordained ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> by the Hands of the Apoſtles.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But to prevent impertinent wrangling, I muſt obſerve again, that when we ſpeak of the Neceſſity of a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, we mean no more than what he ſays every Body allows. I <hi>ſuppoſe,</hi> ſays he, P. 82. <hi>every one will grant, that it was the Practice from the Times of the Apoſtles, for Miniſters to ordain Miniſters.</hi> And they who do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he ſays, are guilty of Sin and Diſorder, and CHRIST <hi>will not own but condemn them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is all we contend for, which yet he ſays, in us is the <hi>Height of Madneſs,</hi> P. 78. And yet our <hi>high</hi> and raving Madneſs is no worſe than this, we believe that the Apoſtles ordained Succeſſors, and they others to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them; and the ſame has been the Practice in every Age. So the Holy Scripture and the Hiſtory of all Places and Ages inform us; It is no Matter whether theſe Miniſters were <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> or both; if they were Miniſters of Ordination it will ſatisfy the <hi>Height of</hi> our <hi>Madneſs.</hi> And it is no Matter whether we know for certain, who were ordained by the Apoſtles, ſo long as we know they did ordain others, and this Cuſtom has always continued, as Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> affirms.
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:006637_0037_102971F9276B79F8"/>And thus we are agreed that there is a Succeſſion and good Evidence of it, after all that he has ſaid, to prove it <hi>the Height of Madneſs.</hi> What although <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> differ about, who were firſt ordained by the Apoſtles at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince all are agreed that they did ordain Succeſſors, and they others, and this has been the conſtant Practice in all Ages? He concludes his Diſcourſe againſt the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion with this Remark, P. 82. <hi>There is,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a vaſtly greater Probability that the Preſbyterian Succeſſion has been preſerved entire and uninterrupted, than that the Epiſcopal Succeſſion has been ſo. Several Things have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to my Thoughts while writing on this Subject, which fully convince me of this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I confeſs is a new Diſcovery; Diſſenters higheſt Ambition formerly was ſatisfied with a Power equal to any Biſhop in <hi>England;</hi> but Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> has quite outdone all that ever went before him; by his hard Study and long <hi>Writing</hi> on this Subject, he has found out that the Diſſenters Power and Succeſſion, though it is only from the Biſhops, is vaſtly <hi>clearer</hi> and more <hi>indiſputable</hi> than theirs.</p>
            <p>But let us try this rare Paradox by the Teſt of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, and ſee if it be ſolid. Does not he pretend that the Biſhops of <hi>New-England</hi> had all their Power from the Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> How then came they by a vaſtly better Claim than thoſe they ſprang from? Why, he tells us, that their Succeſſion as <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters is clear,</hi> but not their <hi>Succeſſion</hi> as <hi>Biſhops.</hi> Well, but don't he affirm, that <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Preſbyter</hi> is one and the ſame? How then can one have a clearer Succeſſion than the other? Beſides, did the Biſhops ordain thoſe Men who afterwards left the Church and turned <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> in their Capacity, as they were <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> and at the ſame Time ordain thoſe who continued in the Church in their Capacity as they were <hi>Biſhops?</hi> No certainly. If they ordained us as <hi>Biſhops,</hi> then as they were <hi>Biſhops,</hi> they ordained you too: If they ordained you, as they were <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> then as <hi>Preſbyters</hi> they ordained us like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:006637_0038_102971FD98837B70"/>There could be no Difference; ſo that his rare Diſcovery, the Fruit of much Study, turns out to be but a childiſh Jingle; and is more eaſily confuted than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained. However, we may obſerve, that he allows, that the Succeſſion in the Church of <hi>England</hi> as to our <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> or <hi>Prieſts,</hi> is <hi>clear</hi> and indiſputable. And he ſays, P. 85, that what he has ſaid, <hi>eſtabliſhes that</hi> (Succeſſion) <hi>in the Line of Preſbyters.</hi> So that we who are Preſbyters in the Church, are in the Line of Succeſſion from the Apoſtles, our <hi>Enemies being Judges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. We come now to the laſt Enquiry, which is, Whether the Miniſters of the Preſbyterian or Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Perſuaſion in <hi>New England</hi> have Authority from CHRIST by Succeſſion? And becauſe I would not have the Reader's Mind diverted from the main Queſtion, I ſhall take no Notice of what he has ſaid about the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Practices of the firſt Settlers of this Country, not becauſe I think his Account juſt, but becauſe it does not concern the Controverſy. And to treat him with the utmoſt Fairneſs, I ſhall grant him what he pleads for, that all the Lay Ordinations in the Country ſhall not prejudice his Cauſe in the leaſt Degree, and that the firſt Miniſters in this Country were ordained by the Biſhops of <hi>England.</hi> The only Queſtion now is, whether by Virtue of the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Ordination, they were inveſted with a Power to ordain others? Upon this ſingle Point the whole Controverſy turns. For he grants, the Neceſſity of a Succeſſion, as I have already ſhewed, and that this Succeſſion is in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and claims a Power from CHRIST by Virtue of their <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Ordination in this Church. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let the Reader, who would make a true Judgment, carefully weigh the Reaſons on both Sides. In my firſt Vindication, as I conſidered all the Arguments on this Head, that I had ever heard or read, ſo <hi>firſt</hi> I took No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Mr. <hi>Neals</hi>'s, and expreſt myſelf thus, <q>You ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy yourſelves with the Argument Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:006637_0039_102971FF1E506FE0"/>who ſays, <hi>the Form of ordaining a Prieſt and a Biſhop is the ſame.</hi> But I am ſorry that I am obliged to tell you, there is no Truth in it. For they are two Forms, and as different as the Forms of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining a Prieſt and a Deacon.</q> Now hear Mr. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart</hi>'s Reply to this, P. 103. He ſays, <q>I can't leave this Subject, without taking Notice of the Injuſtice done to Mr. <hi>Neal,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Beach</hi> charges with Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. He tells us, that Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> has ſaid, <hi>the Form of ordaining a Prieſt and a Biſhop is the ſame;</hi> and he aſſures us <hi>there is no Truth in it.</hi> The Caſe is this, Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> in the Place Mr. <hi>Beach</hi> refers to, is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Book of Ordination compoſed in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> VI, and he ſays of it; <hi>The Form of ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Prieſt and a Biſhop is the ſame,</hi> there being no expreſs mention in <hi>the Words of Ordination, whether it be for the one or the other Office: This has been altered of late Years, ſince a Diſtinction of the two Orders has been ſo generally admitted, but that was not the received Doctrine of theſe Times.</hi>
               </q> Now, ſays Mr. <hi>Hobart,</hi> 
               <q>Mr <hi>Beach</hi> I ſuppoſe, will not deny that the Caſe was truly thus, with Regard to King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s Book; and I cannot imagine with what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience he could charge Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> with Falſhood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the preſent Book of Ordination, the Form for ordaining a Biſhop is different from that for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining a Prieſt, which Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> does not deny. Can you now believe, that Mr. <hi>Beach,</hi> wrote under a Senſe that his next Anſwer might be to his eternal Judge.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> has ſo often reviled me for this ſerious Expreſſion, and repreſented me, (as he owns) as being guilty of little leſs than Perjury, that if I ſhould vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate my Innocence in every Inſtance, I muſt write a Book as large as his, and yet neglect material Points. I deſire herefore the candid Reader, by this one Inſtance of my ſuppoſed Falſhood, to judge of all the reſt. Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s Friend in <hi>Boſton,</hi> (I ſuppoſe) has thought this ſo material a Point, as to make a diſtinct Head of it,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:006637_0040_10297200A3D81620"/>and put it in the Index thus, Mr. <hi>Neal vindicated againſt the Charge of Falſhood.</hi> Let us ſee then, where the Falſhood will fall. And here I need make no Defence but what Biſhop <hi>Maddox</hi> has made for me in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Mr. <hi>Neal,</hi> P. 57. He having ſhewn that the three Orders had obtained from the begining, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally in the Chriſtian Church, then ſays; <q>Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> is extreamly fond of a Parity among the Clergy, and has taken <hi>too much</hi> Pains in that Cauſe. It was an <hi>Exceſs</hi> of <hi>Zeal</hi> to preſs the pious <hi>Reformers</hi> and King <hi>Edward</hi>'s <hi>Ordinal</hi> into this Service.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And here, (ſays Mr. <hi>Neal,) "it is obſervable that the Form of ordaining a Prieſt, and a Biſhop IS THE SAME.</hi> Again ſays he, <hi>our Reformers admitted but two Orders of Church Officers to be Divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, viz. Biſhops and Deacons, Preſbyter and Biſhop according to them, being but two Names for the ſame OFFICE.</hi> By this Account, ſays the Biſhop, 'tis plain, Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> would have it believed, that Biſhop and Prieſt were, in the Opinion of the firſt Reformers, ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonimous Terms, ſignifying not only <hi>the ſame Order,</hi> but the ſame <hi>Office.</hi> His material Proof is the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ordinal; and to be ſure, if any where, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers ſpake <hi>diſtinctly,</hi> when they are deſignedly <hi>treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> upon this Subject, and appointing the very <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Conſecration.</hi> Here then we join Iſſue, and both appeal to the ſame Ordinal, as a <hi>deciſive Proof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Neal</hi>'s Aſſertion is in theſe Words, <hi>The firſt Reformers believed BUT TWO Orders of Church Men in Holy Scripture, viz. Biſhops and Deacons.</hi> Theſe very ſame firſt Reformers, in the very ſame Ordinal, he refers to, make the following expreſs Declaration.<note n="†" place="bottom">Preface to King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Ordinal.</note> 
               <hi>It is evident unto all Men, diligently readynge Holy Scripture and auncient Autours, that from the Apoſtles
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:006637_0041_10297206E5C78240"/>Tyme there have been THESE ORDERS of Miniſters in</hi> CHRISTE'<hi>s Churche, BISHOPPES, PRIESTES and Deacons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without ſtopping for one Reflection, let us go on to his next Aſſertion, which runs thus;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Form of ordaining a Prieſt and a Biſhop is the ſame?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we have Recourſe to the ſame Ordinal, and find therein two Forms, one for the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and the other for the Biſhop, as diſtinct from each other as the Forms of a <hi>Deacon</hi> and a <hi>Prieſt.</hi> The Title of the one Form is, <hi>The Form of ordaining of Prieſts;</hi> the Title of the other is, <hi>The Form of Conſecration of an Arch-Biſhop</hi> or <hi>Biſhop.</hi> Perhaps Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> means, that the very Form of Ordination and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, thoſe <hi>individual Words,</hi> by which they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and conſecrated, are the ſame. But neither is this the Caſe. The Form for the Prieſt is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. <hi>When this Prayer is done, the Biſhop with the Prieſts preſent, ſhall lay their Hands ſeverally upon the Head of every one that receiveth Orders, the Receivers humbly kneeling upon their Knees, and the Biſhop ſaying,</hi> Receive the Holy Ghoſt: Whoſe Sins thou doſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, they are forgiven: And whoſe Sins thou doſt retain, they are retained; and be thou a faithful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſer of the Word of GOD, and of his Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt. — <hi>The Biſhop ſhall deliver to every one of them, the Bible in his Hand, ſaying,</hi> Take thou Authority to preach the Word of GOD, and to Miniſter the Holy Sacraments in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation where thou ſhalt be ſo appointed.</p>
            <p>The Form of conſecrating and Arch Biſhop, or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop is this. <hi>Then the Arch-Biſhop and Biſhops preſent, ſhall lay their Hands upon the Head of the Elect Biſhop, the Arch-Biſhop, ſaying,</hi> Take the Holy Ghoſt, and remember that thou ſtir up the Grace of GOD which is in thee, by Impoſition of Hands; for GOD hath not given the Spirit of Fear, but of Power and Love,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:006637_0042_10297209F91FB010"/>and Soberneſs. <hi>Then the Arch-Biſhop ſhall deliver him the Bible, ſaying,</hi> Give Heed unto Reading, Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Doctrine; Think upon theſe Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Book: Be diligent in them, that the Increaſe coming thereby, may be manifeſt unto all Men. Take Heed unto thyſelf, and unto Teaching, and be diligent in doing them; for by doing this, thou ſhalt ſave thyſelf, and thoſe that hear thee. Be to the Flock of CHRIST a Shepherd, not a Wolf: Feed them, devour them not: Hold up the weak, heal the ſick, bring together the broken, bring again the out-caſt, ſeek the loſt; <hi>be ſo merciful, that ye' be not too remiſs ſo Miniſter Diſcipline, that you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not Mercy;</hi> that when the chief Shepherd ſhall come, you may receive the immarceſcible Crown of Glory, through JESUS CHRIST our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the Forms of ordaining a Biſhop and a Prieſt, which are called the SAME. The Weight of thus miſrepreſenting a publick Ordinal, falls wholly upon Mr. <hi>Neal."</hi> "The old <hi>Puritans</hi> complained, that the <hi>Prieſt receiveth in his Ordination no Authority to govern the Flock, but only to preach the Word and Adminiſter the Sacraments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing, ſure, but the Impoſſibility of ſupporting his Scheme, and proving the Parity of Preſbyters and Biſhops, any other Way, could have put Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> upon this Method of attempting it. He had indeed undertaken a difficult Taſk, and muſt therefore have great Allowances in the Execution of it. The Senſe and Practice of the whole Chriſtian Church for fifteen hundred Years, in a Form of Church Government, ſo early, ſo univerſally, ſo conſtantly received, were great Obſtacles. No Inſtances of Preſbyters executing the diſtinguiſhing Offices of a Biſhop. No Example of a Man's being a Biſhop one Day, and reduced to a mere Preſbyter the next, as muſt have been the Caſe, had a Biſhop, as is ſometimes alledged, been no more than a <hi>Chair Man,</hi> a Moderator, or temporary
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:006637_0043_1029720B822D2CB8"/>
               <hi>Preſident</hi> of a Preſbytery. No Inſtances of many Biſhops in Places where there were many Prieſts; on the contrary, we always find <hi>one</hi> particular Perſon mentioned as the Biſhop, and <hi>ſole</hi> Biſhop of one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular City; even where there were many Preſbyters. This being the Caſe, and the <hi>promiſcuous Uſe of Names,</hi> not ſufficient to overcome ſo many Arguments, or ſhew the <hi>Identity of Order and Office</hi> between a Biſhop and a Prieſt, any more than an Apoſtle's calling himſelf a Deacon<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> iii. 7. <hi>Col.</hi> i. 23.</note> will prove the <hi>Apoſtolate</hi> and Deaconſhip to be one Order; other Methods were to be try'd, and the very Form of conſecrating a <hi>Biſhop</hi> who had before been <hi>ordained</hi> a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> be employed to prove there was in the Opinion of the Compilers of that Form, no ſuch Order as Biſhops in the Church, all meer Preſbyters, and nothing more; not only the Order but the very <hi>Office</hi> the ſame! Since Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> [and Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> after him] has thought fit to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Reformers as Patrons of this Notion, of <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> being the ſame, it may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to lay before the Reader Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Authors of that Opinion.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Hiſt. R. V.</hi> 1. P. 366.</note> In the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church they knew none of theſe Subtilties which were found out in the latter Ages. 'Twas then thought enough that a Biſhop was to be dedicated to his Function by a <hi>new</hi> Impoſition of Hands, and that ſeveral Offices could not be performed without Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; ſuch as Ordination, Confirmation, &amp;c. But they did not refine in theſe Matters, ſo much as to enquire whether Biſhops and Prieſts differed in Order and Office, or only in degree. But after the <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> fell to examine Matters of Divinity with logical and unintelligible Niceties, and the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> began to comment upon the Rules of the ancient Church, they ſtudied to make <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſeem very <hi>near</hi> one another; ſo that the Difference was but ſmall. They
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:006637_0044_1029720D08BA67D0"/>did it with different Deſigns. The <hi>Schoolmen</hi> having ſet up the grand Myſtery of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> were to exalt the Prieſtly Office as much as was poſſible; for the turning the Hoſt into GOD, was ſo great an Action, that they reckoned that there could be no Office higher than that which qualified a Man to ſo mighty a Performance: Therefore as they changed the Form of Ordination from what it was anciently believed to conſiſt in, to a delivering the ſacred Veſſels, and held that a Prieſt had his Orders by that Rite, and not by the <hi>Impoſition</hi> of Hands; ſo they raiſed their Order or Office ſo high as to make it equal with the Order of a Biſhop; but as they deſigned to extol the Order of Prieſthood, ſo the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> had as great a Mind to depreſs the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Order. They generally wrote for Preferment; and the Way to it was to exalt the <hi>Papacy.</hi> Nothing could do that ſo effectually, as to bring down the Power of Biſhops. This only could juſtify the Exemptions of the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Fryars,</hi> &amp;c. All which were unlawful, if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops had by Divine Right, Juriſdiction in their Dioceſes; therefore it was neceſſary to lay them as low as could be, and to make them think, that the Power they held, was rather as Delegates of tha A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick See, than by a Commiſſion from CHRIST or his Apoſtles; ſo that they looked on the declaring <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Authority to be of <hi>Divine Right</hi> as a Blow that would be <hi>fatal</hi> to the <hi>Court of Rome;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did after this at <hi>Trent</hi> uſe all poſſible Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to hinder any ſuch Deciſion: It having been then the common Stile of that Age to reckon Biſhops and Prieſts as the ſame Office, it is no Wonder if at this Time the Clergy of this Church, the greateſt Part of them being ſtill leaven'd with the old Superſtition, and the reſt of them not having Time enough to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine leſſer Matters, retained ſtill the former Phraſes in this particular. On this I have inſiſted the more, that it may appear how little they have conſidered Things
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:006637_0045_102972100939A9F0"/>who are ſo far carried with their <hi>Zeal againſt</hi> the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Government of this Church, as to make much Uſe of ſome Paſſages of the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> and <hi>Canoniſts</hi> that deny them to be diſtinct Offices; For theſe are the <hi>very Dregs of Popery;</hi> the one raiſing the <hi>Prieſt</hi> higher for the ſake of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> the other pulling down the Biſhops lower for the ſake of the Pope's <hi>Supremacy;</hi> and by ſuch Means bringing them almoſt to an Equality. So partial are ſome Men to their particular Conceits that they make Uſe of the moſt miſchievous Topicks, when they can ſerve their Turn, not conſidering how much further theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will run, if they ever admit them. Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> imputes theſe Sentiments of ſome in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. to the Reformers under King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> VI, though in the Preface to their Ordinal they expreſly declare the <hi>contrary.</hi>"</p>
            <p>And now I leave it with the Reader, who are guilty of the Falſhood, we who ſay that one and one make two, or Mr. <hi>Neal,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobart,</hi> and his Friend in <hi>Boſton,</hi> who affirm that two diſtinct Offices are one and the <hi>ſame? It is a ſtubborn Matter of Fact, which will not bend to Men's Humours.</hi> Every one may ſee that as theſe Forms are <hi>two now,</hi> ſo they were in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Time. Seeing then after a Man is ordained <hi>Prieſt,</hi> he muſt be ordained anew, and by a diſtinct Form, in order to receive the Power of Ordination, it is certain that thoſe mere <hi>Prieſts</hi> who came into <hi>New England</hi> and ſet up the Buſineſs of ordaining here, acted without any Authority received by their Ordination: Conſequently the preſent Miniſtry which ſprang from them, have no Authority by Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>
            <p>Let us now conſider Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s other Argument, which is taken from there being but one Commiſſion in the holy Scripture. He ſays, P. 99. <hi>If there be but one Order,</hi> and <hi>Preſbyters have Authority from</hi> CHRIST, (as I allow,) which they cannot have, unleſs CHRIST'S (Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion belongs to them, and if it belongs to them <hi>at all,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:006637_0046_10297215F04EA360"/>they muſt have <hi>all</hi> the Authority contained in it. <hi>That GOD has joined, Men cannot ſeparate.</hi> P. 100. This Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument contains the Strength of their whole Cauſe, and is to them like <hi>Samſon</hi>'s <hi>Locks,</hi> I ſhall therefore carefully re-examine it, although I had anſwered it before.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not true, that if a Man has <hi>Part</hi> of the Goſpel Miniſtry he muſt have all. A <hi>Deacon</hi> in the Church has a <hi>Part</hi> of the Goſpel-Miniſtry, but not the whole, the Expreſſions in ordaining a <hi>Deacon,</hi> are <hi>ſufficiently deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Goſpel Miniſtry,</hi> yet the whole Power that CHRIST has annext to the Goſpel Miniſtry no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a <hi>Deacon,</hi> than to a Lay-man. A Deacon is expreſly empowered to preach, to baptize, and to aſſiſt in the Adminiſtration of the Lord's Supper. Now if Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s Argument be good, a Deacon has the whole Apoſtolick Commiſſion, and as much Authority to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain as any Biſhop in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this he makes no Reply.</p>
            <p>Again, the twelve Apoſtles before CHRIST'S Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, had a <hi>Part,</hi> but not the whole of the Miniſtry: They had Power to preach, baptize and adminiſter the Lord's Supper, yet CHRIST kept the Power of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his own Hands, and never committed it to them till juſt before his final Aſcention; when he ſaid, <hi>as my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you. Judas</hi> had received <hi>Part</hi> of the Miniſtry, but never the whole of it. <hi>Acts</hi> i. 17. <hi>For he was numbred with us, and had obtained part of this Miniſtry.</hi> It will not do, to ſay this was not the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Miniſtry, for here St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays expreſly, it was PART of that very Miniſtry which they had after CHRIST'S Aſcention; yet <hi>Judas</hi> never had the Power of Ordination. I grant, <hi>Men cannot</hi> lawfully <hi>ſeparate what GOD has joined.</hi> But then GOD never has ſo joined the whole of the Goſpel Miniſtry, as that a Man can't have a <hi>Part</hi> withouth the <hi>whole.</hi> Where, when, did GOD ſay, "He that has a <hi>Part</hi> ſhall have <hi>all.</hi>" Prov, xxx. 6. <hi>Add thou not unto his Words, leſt he reprove thee, and thou be found a Liar.</hi> A Man may be impower'd to preach,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:006637_0047_10297218E832B5E0"/>or to baptize, and yet have no more of the Apoſtolick Commiſſion as the Deacons had: We read <hi>Acts</hi> x. 48. When by St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Preaching, a great Number were converted, <hi>he commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the</hi> LORD. Now it is moſt probable, that the Perſons whom he commanded to baptize theſe new Converts, were the Lay-Brethren who had accompanied him from <hi>Joppa.</hi> v. 23. By this Command they were <hi>authorized</hi> to baptize theſe Perſons, and yet they had no Authority to preach, much leſs to ordain, nay, after this Service was over, they were as abſolute Lay-men as any at all. So when three thouſand were converted and baptized in one Day, it is moſt likely that more Hands were employed in it, than the Apoſtles, St. <hi>Paul</hi> baptized but <hi>few</hi> of thoſe whom he converted. He was not ſent <hi>to baptize, but to preach.</hi> So that it is moſt probable that his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts were chiefly baptized by Perſons impower'd by his Command to do it.</p>
            <p>But whether this was really the Caſe, or not, it can't be denied but that they might take this Method; and then it is certain they could give <hi>Part,</hi> without giving the whole of their Authority. Nay Diſſenters do certainly undertake to give a <hi>Part</hi> of the Miniſtry without giving the <hi>whole of</hi> it. It is a univerſal Cuſtom among them to examine <hi>Candidates,</hi> and when they approve of them, they ſend them to preach the Goſpel, in <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of which they give them a written Inſtrument ſigned by their Miniſters. Now this <hi>Right, Liberty</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> to preach the Goſpel is a <hi>Part</hi> of the Goſpel Miniſtry or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick Commiſſion. And though in this Caſe they do not commonly uſe the Rite or Ceremony of <hi>Impoſition</hi> of <hi>Hands,</hi> yet this does not hinder, but that they have as good Authority to preach, as if their Hands had been laid on them. And Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> is clear in it, that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands is not neceſſary to convey the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Authority, but if they who appoint a Man to the Miniſtry, do but ſignify this their Appointment any other way it is ſufficient. <hi>No body,</hi> (ſays he), <hi>I ſuppoſe,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:006637_0048_1029721A6DD01A88"/>upon Miniſterial Authority as ſuch</hi> a phyſical Quality, <hi>as is communicable only by</hi> Contact, firſt Ad. P. 114. So that as often as the Presbyterian Miniſters approve and ſend a Man only to preach, they do really undertake to give a <hi>Part</hi> of the Miniſtry without the <hi>whole.</hi> And by a <hi>Certificate</hi> ſigned by their Hands, they impower him, as effectually as if their Hands had been laid on his Head. Suppoſe then, that a Number of theſe <hi>licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> Preachers ſhould take upon them to ordain others, would you not call them Sons of <hi>Korah</hi> and Uſurpers? Yet they could defend themſelves with the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that <hi>New-England</hi> Miniſters uſe. They could ſay, <q>we were appointed to preach the Goſpel, which is a <hi>Part</hi> of the Apoſtolick Commiſſion or Goſpel-Miniſtry, and we can't have <hi>Part</hi> without having the <hi>whole.</hi> There is but one Commiſſion, and it can't be <hi>divided,</hi> he that has any <hi>Part</hi> of it, muſt have <hi>all.</hi> If there is but one <hi>Order,</hi> we are of that Order, and ſo muſt be equal to thoſe who appointed us to preach.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Will you now tell theſe Preachers, that they want Impoſition of Hands? they can tell you as Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> does, <q>that is only a Point of Order, but is not <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> to the miniſterial <hi>Character,</hi> and all allow <hi>phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Contact is not neceſſary.</hi>
               </q> Will you tell theſe <hi>mere</hi> Preachers, that they who appointed them to Preach, never intended to give them Power to ordain? The ſame we ſay to you with Regard to thoſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> who firſt ſet up <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ordination in this Country, the Biſhops who ordained them, never intended to qualify them to ordain others, and they themſelves vowed they would never do any ſuch Thing; which rendered them leſs qualified to ordain than abſolute Lay-Men. Let us now proceed one ſtep further, ſuppoſe your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters after having examined and approved of a Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date <hi>to go and preach</hi> the Goſpel, ſhould not only pray for a Bleſſing upon this his Undertaking, as I hope they do, but ſhould alſo uſe the Rite of <hi>Impoſition of Hands.</hi> I ask now, whether this does not make him
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:006637_0049_1029721D6818F808"/>a Miniſter of the Goſpel, as far as Preaching goes? Certainly it does. Again, I deſire to know why you may not, in ſending forth a Man to Preach, uſe the Rite of laying on of Hands, as well as that of ſigning a <hi>Certificate</hi> to the ſame Purpoſe? The only Difference is, the one is ſcriptural, and the other is not. If then ſuch a Thing can be done, then the Goſpel Miniſtry may be divided, and a Man may have a <hi>Part,</hi> and not the <hi>whole.</hi> And if it can be done as the Diſſenters conſtant Practice ſhews that they think it <hi>can;</hi> then it is really done in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and Prieſts have a Part of the Goſpel Miniſtry, and not the Power of Ordination. And that ſet of <hi>Prieſts</hi> who came into <hi>New-England,</hi> and ordained the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> Biſhops, had no better Warrant for this, than the <hi>probationary</hi> Preachers among the Diſſenters have to ordain others to the whole Goſpel Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>New-England</hi> Churches there are as really three diſtinct Orders; as in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in ſome Churches there are Deacons ordained to aſſiſt in the adminiſtring the holy Sacrament, to pray in the Congregation, eſpecially in the Miniſter's Abſence, &amp;c. There is a ſecond Order ſent forth merely to preach and pray, theſe of the ſecond Order are as fully <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized</hi> to that Part of the Goſpel Miniſtry, as they can be by thoſe who ſend them: for <hi>phyſical Contact</hi> is not eſſential, ſays Mr. <hi>Hobart.</hi> The higheſt Order is their Biſhops who claim the <hi>ſole</hi> Power of Ordination, and ſo exclude both the Inferior Orders from any ſhare in this Office. So that for my Part, I have no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to join with them upon the Score of three Orders, all I fear is that none of their Orders have any Miſſion from CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Appointing a Man to preach the Goſpel is really or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining him, whether it be done by a written Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Diſſenters do, or by Impoſition of Hands, as our Biſhops do, it alters not the Caſe. If a Biſhop ſhould upon examining a Man, approve of him to go and preach the Goſpel, and give him a <hi>Teſtimonial</hi> of
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:006637_0050_10297221D57558E0"/>this his appointing him to that Work, ſigned by his own Hand, as the Diſſenters do, this Man would no longer be a mere Lay-man, but as really a Miniſter of GOD's Word, as the Biſhop himſelf, and yet be no Miniſter of the Sacraments, nor of Ordination. In a Word, the Argument can not be evaded, turn it over and over, view it on which ſide you pleaſe, it proves that the Goſpel-Miniſtry can be, and is divided, Men can, and do receive a <hi>Part</hi> without the <hi>whole.</hi> And therefore the great Argument to defend the Lawfulneſs of the <hi>New-England</hi> Miniſtry is certainly a Miſtake. <hi>Stubborn Matters of Fact,</hi> confute it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Miſtake in his Argument is, that every Miniſter to the End of the World muſt have that very <hi>individual</hi> Commiſſion which CHRIST gave to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 20. Whereas really what he calls the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> is nothing more than the Account or Hiſtory of their laſt Ordination: And is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of no Man now living. Every Miniſter's Commiſſion is given at his Ordination, and the Words and ſignificant Signs then uſed, ſhew what his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is. And yet,</p>
            <p n="3">3. It does not follow, as he imagines, that we are no Miniſters of CHRIST; becauſe our Commiſſion is not to be found in the Bible. For that Man who is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained or ſent to perform any Part of the Goſpel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry by ſuch as have CHRIST'S Authority to ſend him, is ſo far CHRIST'S Miniſter, and has his Authority.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Office of a Prieſt in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> according to Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> is no Office of CHRIST'S Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: As it is deſcribed in the Book of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is inferior to that of a Biſhop. And Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> ſays, P. 52. that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> are but the <hi>Biſhops Subſtitutes</hi> or <hi>Curates inſtead of being</hi> CHRIST'S <hi>Miniſters.</hi> And therefore his ſuppoſing that CHRIST has in the holy Scripture annext the Power of Ordination to this Office, is certainly vain and groundleſs, and therefore thoſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> who came into this Country, and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>New-England</hi> Miniſters clearly and certainly, had
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:006637_0051_102972235B34AD08"/>no Authority to do it by Vertue of their <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination; but the <hi>Leathern Mitten</hi> Ordinations were quite as Regular, and much more <hi>honeſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> inſiſts upon it, that they by Vertue of their <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Ordination had not Authority ſo much as to Preach, how much leſs to ordain Biſhops? It is certain, if neither CHRIST nor his Apoſtles inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted more than one Order of Goſpel-Miniſters, then the Order of <hi>Prieſts</hi> is only of Eccleſiaſtical Inſtitution; and CHRIST has not annext the Power of Ordination to this merely human Appointment. So that according to Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s Principles, it is demonſtrable that the <hi>New-England</hi> Biſhops have no Authority from CHRIST by Succeſſion.</p>
            <p>What he ſays about a Conſtable's being ignorant of the extent of his Power, when firſt put into his Office, is nothing to the Purpoſe: becauſe the Law diſcovers that. But the Goſpel as it makes no Mention of the Inſtitution of this Order of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> ſo it is perfectly ſilent about any Power of Ordination annext to it.</p>
            <p>The Caſe of an <hi>Antipedobaptiſts</hi> covenanting not to baptize Infants, is not a Parallel, becauſe he is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have Power to baptize, and he who can baptize, may lawfully baptize any who are the proper Subjects of Baptiſm. But the Prieſt in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> receives not Power to ordain any at all; as I before demonſtrated, and the old <hi>Puritans</hi> complained. Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> tells us how compaſſionately concern'd he is for ſome good People, who ask him what they ſhall do, when we who ſhould be Guides differ ſo widely? Now I would adviſe ſuch ſerious Perſons to put on the ſame Temper of Mind, as if they were under Oath to ſerve on the <hi>Jury</hi> to decide a Controverſy about an Eſtate. The Caſe you are to try, is this, whether thoſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who came into this Country, and ſet up the <hi>New-England</hi> Succeſſion, had Authority to ordain? Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> ſays they had: We think they had not. We plead, that if a Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving <hi>Prieſt</hi>'s Orders, can be ſuppoſed to receive Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:006637_0052_10297226589DC9D0"/>to ordain Biſhops, he muſt be ſuppoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Authority, not only without any Word, or Sign which does expreſs it, not only without any ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in the Church, or in the Biſhop ordaining, or laſtly in himſelf, but even againſt the Will and Intention of the Church, againſt the Will and Intention of the Ordainer, nay againſt his own Reſolution, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a ſolemn Vow at the Time of his Ordination. And you know no Title to Land or Eſtate is ever ſo convey'd. This Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> does not deny; but acknowledges it looks like Demonſtration, and he himſelf ſays a great deal more to prove that it is utterly impoſſible that they ſhould have received Power to ordain by Virtue of their Epiſcopal Ordination: for ſays he, that Ordination don't give them ſo much as Power to <hi>preach,</hi> and they were only the <hi>Biſhops Subſtitutes</hi> and <hi>Curates,</hi> and if ſo, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that they ſhould be Biſhops themſelves, and have Power to ordain.</p>
            <p>But now he pleads, that though theſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> were ſo ignorant of the Extent of that Office at the Time of their being ordained to it, that they tied their own Hands by Vows not to act as Biſhops, yet ſeeing CHRIST in the Goſpel has annext the Power of Ordination to it, they had therefore good right to uſe thoſe Powers which at firſt they did not underſtand to belong to their Office.</p>
            <p>And though at firſt they did not know that they had the Power of Ordination, yet if CHRIST has annext the Power of Ordination to their Office, they had good Right to uſe it, their former Ignorance and Vows notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Upon this Plea his whole Cauſe depends.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, the Office or Commiſſion, into which theſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> had been introduced is not recorded in the Scripture.<note n="†" place="bottom">This Paragraph is not ſo to be underſtood as tho' the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Prieſts is not comprehended in the Apoſtolick Commiſſion, for that it virtually is, and conſequently is in the New-Teſtament, being a part of the Power therein given to the Apoſtles: And it manifeſtly appears, that they had a Right (and ſo their Succeſſors in the whole of their Commiſſion) to convey Part of their Power to a ſubordinate Officer, ſuch as is now called a <hi>Prieſt.</hi> For it is evident, that under the infallible Guidance of the Spirit of GOD they did ordain to that ſubordinate Office to adminiſter the Word and Sacraments without the Power of Ordination. For it appears in the New-Teſtament, that in ſeveral Churches there were ſuch inferior Officers, over which the Apoſtles notwithſtanding, thought it neceſſary to appoint one to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in the whole Commiſſion granted to them, who beſides the Power of adminiſtring the Word and Sacraments, had the Power of preſiding in Government, and granting either <hi>plenary</hi> or <hi>partial</hi> Commiſſions to others. And that ſuch ſubordinate Officers did obtain throughout the Chriſtian Church, agreeable to holy Scripture, is an evident Fact from all ancient Writers atteſting it with one Conſent; and never has or can be diſproved by any of our Adverſaries.</note> Therefore no Powers are there annext
<pb n="54"
                   facs="unknown:006637_0053_102972282C7443A8"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>to it. It is true, that he who would know the Extent of any civil Officer's Power muſt not judge of it by the Miſtakes of the Officer at the Time of his being put into that Office, but by what Power the Law has annext to his Office. So he who would know whether the Power of Ordination belongs to that Office, called the Office of a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> he muſt judge of it by the Commiſſion itſelf, but this Commiſſion is no where to be found in the Scripture. The <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> all ſay, no ſuch Office is to be found in the New Teſtament, and we grant that our Commiſſion is not there, and therefore certainly no Power of Ordination is annext to it in Scripture. But he who would know what Powers we have, muſt conſult the Book of Ordination, where our Commiſſion is to be ſeen, and there he will find no Power of Ordination is annext to our Office: but the contrary fully declared.</p>
            <p>If now Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> ſhould ſay, (for I know not what elſe he can ſay,) if the Caſe be ſo, that our Commiſſion is not to be found in the Goſpel, then we are not CHRIST'S Miniſters. I anſwer, this does not follow, for as I ſaid before he who is ordained to any Part of the Goſpel Miniſtry by ſuch as have Power from CHRIST, is CHRIST'S Miniſter. It is a groundleſs Imagination, that none are CHRIST'S Miniſters, unleſs their Commiſſion is recorded in the Goſpel. They who have Authority to act in
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:006637_0054_1029722E2B3C4490"/>CHRIST'S Name, are as really his Ambaſſadors, as if their Ordination had been recorded in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Let me ſuppoſe, that we who have had <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, ſhould be convinced by Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, that our Subordination and Subjection to our Biſhops, is that ſervile <hi>calling Men Maſter,</hi> which our LORD has forbidden, and ſhould take it into our Heads to ordain others, and declare ſuch to be as good Biſhops and have as much Authority as any in <hi>England,</hi> and at the ſame Time ſhould not fall in with Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s Party, but join with the New-Lights (whom he <hi>ſneer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly</hi> calls our <hi>Brethren</hi>) I would fain know, whether it is not very likely, that he would condemn us as guilty of the greateſt Wickedneſs, calls us all Sons of <hi>Korah,</hi> and perjured <hi>Uſurpers?</hi> Be ſure every indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Judge, muſt condemn it with abhorrence. And I'm ſure I ſhould enter upon ſuch a Courſe with as much Horror in my Conſcience as I ſhould engage in a Courſe of Adultery. Yet this was exactly the Caſe of the firſt Sett of Miniſters who began the <hi>New-England</hi> Succeſſion, they had exactly the ſame Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as we; without one Word's Variation, they had made the ſame Vows of Subjection to their Superiors, they never had received a Power to ordain either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly or implicitly by Words or Signs; yet they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to ordain Biſhops, and give an Authority which they themſelves had never received. Such a ſhocking Preſumption this was, that all Church Hiſtory for fifteen hundred Years don't afford any Inſtance like it. In ſaying this, I would not inſinuate, that theſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> though guilty of Uſurpation, were all wicked Men and loſt; I will not ſay of them as Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> does of the <hi>New-Light</hi> Miniſters, that CHRIST will <hi>condemn them.</hi> I eſteem the Memory of ſome of them for their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Zeal. But at the ſame Time I deteſt that Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, and believe that in me it would be the Sin of <hi>Korah,</hi> and we ſhould not imitate even good Men in any <hi>bad</hi> Action.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> very much miſrepreſents the Caſe, when
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:006637_0055_1029723126135850"/>he ſo often pretends that we join with the Church of <hi>England</hi> merely to get rid of <hi>diſputed</hi> Ordination, but don't mend the Matter by coming into the Church. No, no, this is not the Caſe, we chuſe Ordination by the Biſhops, becauſe no Reaſon can be offered, why we ſhould doubt of its Validity. And we dare not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon your Ordination, becauſe we think we can demonſtrate that it is the Fruit of Uſurpation. We don't ſay to you, as you do to us, who knows but that ſome Time or other, there has been ſome ſecret Flaws in your Line of Succeſſion, which are now known only to GOD? No, but we point out to you the Time, and ſhew you how you ſet up without any Miſſion from CHRIST, either mediate or immediate. We freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge from that Time, your Succeſſion is uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, though you have no <hi>Regiſters</hi> to ſhew; and ſome Lay-Ordinations have not ſpoiled your Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, but it is juſt as good now as when you began. And in chuſing <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Ordination we venture no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; for if your's be as good as can be, it cannot be better than the Biſhops, from whom you ſay, you had it. If we are prejudiced and biaſt in this Affair, it muſt be a very ſtrange Piece of Self-denial that blinds us; For it is natural to all Men, to love Power and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and can any Man think, that we had not rather be as <hi>high</hi> in Power and Authority as any Biſhop in <hi>England,</hi> as your Principle would make us, than to be only the Biſhop's <hi>Curate</hi> and <hi>Subſtitute?</hi> Who had not rather think that he has Power to ordain, and act inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently, than to be in Subordination, provided the Evidence were equal on both Sides? But the Evidence againſt our bing really Biſhops, (as you would make us) is ſo clear and full, that we think nothing but the Pride of <hi>Korah,</hi> can hinder our ſeeing it. And if we are not Biſhops, it is certain theſe Miniſters are nothing, that is, they have no Authority by Succeſſion, for we have the ſame Authority as they had, who firſt ordained the <hi>New-England</hi> Miniſters. If they were real Biſhops, ſo are we; if we have not the Power of Ordination, it is
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:006637_0056_10297232EFB21D10"/>certain they had it not. And if they had it not, their Succeſſors have none. In a Word, Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> and Brethren can't prove themſelves <hi>lawful</hi> Miniſters, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proving us to be <hi>Biſhops</hi> at the ſame Time. And who can think we ſhould not be glad to ſee that Point well proved?</p>
            <p>As I know that I am liable to Miſtakes, ſo I endeavour always to keep my Ears open, and be diſpoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Truth from any Perſon, and I ſhould not have been aſham'd or unwilling to have changed my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on once more, could I have ſeen Reaſon for it. Upon ſevral Accounts I ſhould have been very glad, to be convinced, that I may go ſafe to Heaven in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Way. I grant, that what he ſays, is true, that if we would all become Diſſenters it would ſave a great deal of Money: Beſides, it would ſave Candidates for the Miniſtry the Charge and Danger of a Voyage, in which ſeveral have loſt their Lives already, it would preſerve us from much Obloquy and Reproach caſt upon us by Reaſon of our Conformity to the Church of <hi>England:</hi> were it not for which, we might have as much Reſpect and Honour as others: whereas now our <hi>Names are caſt out as evil,</hi> and we have <hi>the Tryal of cruel Mockings,</hi> and are treated as the <hi>Off-ſcouring of all Things,</hi> and have almoſt <hi>all manner of Evil ſaid of us</hi> falſly for Conſcience Sake: ſo that a Man that values his Reputation, had need have in ſome Degree the Spirit of a Martyr, ar at leaſt of Confeſſor, in order to become a Churchman.</p>
            <p>But then on the other Hand, I am obliged to conſider, that if I turn Diſſenter, beſides other Evils, I muſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Office of a Biſhop and ordain, which in me would be a <hi>taking GOD's Name in vain,</hi> and a lying in CHRIST'S Name, ſaying that he has ſent me to ordain, when I know he has not. And I muſt <hi>countenance and own</hi> thoſe who do ſo: While thoſe Words ſound aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in my Ears, <hi>Numb.</hi> xvi. 40. <hi>That he be not as</hi> Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah <hi>and his Company.</hi> If I had lived among the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of <hi>Jonathan, Micah's Prieſt,</hi> I'm ſure it would
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:006637_0057_1029723483BA3170"/>have been my Duty to have ſeparated from them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had as <hi>ſignal</hi> Bleſſings, and as long Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſhew for their Uſurpation, as the <hi>New-England</hi> Miniſters have. I often reflect on the Caſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who for his tranſgreſſing the divine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, pleaded his pious Intentions and the Neceſſity he was under, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xiii. 9. 12. <hi>Therefore ſaid I, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines will come down now upon me from Gilgal, and I have not made Supplication unto the</hi> LORD; <hi>I forced myſelf therefore, and offered a burnt offering.</hi> If ever the Plea of Neceſſity, and Zeal for Worſhipping GOD, could excuſe the tranſgreſſing GOD's Method and Order, certainly <hi>Saul</hi> muſt have been juſtified in what he had done. For he <hi>forced</hi> himſelf to it out of an earneſt Deſire to recommend himſelf to GOD's Protection in ſo eminent a Danger. He would have been glad with all his Soul to have complied punctually with GOD's Rule.</p>
            <p>Now hear <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Anſwer to this Plea of Neceſſity. ver. 13. And <hi>Samuel ſaid unto Saul, thou haſt done fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly: thou haſt not kept the Commandment of the</hi> LORD <hi>thy GOD, which he commanded thee, now thy Kingdom ſhall not continue.</hi> And again upon the like Occaſion, he ſays to him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xi. 22. <hi>Hath the</hi> LORD <hi>as great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in burnt Offerings and Sacrifices, as in obeying the Voice of the</hi> LORD? <hi>Behold to obey, is better than Sacrifice; and to hearken, than the Fat of Rams. For Rebellion is as the Sin of Witchcraft, and Stubbornneſs is as Iniquity and Idolatry.</hi> Now Sacrifices and burnt Offerings were then poſitive Inſtitutions, as Ordination and the Sacraments are now, from hence I certainly conclude, it is ſafer to wait GOD's Time for them, than to receive them from uncommiſſionated Hands. And where GOD gives not an Opportunity to receive them according to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Order, he will not be diſpleaſed with us for not receiving them.</p>
            <p>When I conſider how heinous a Crime it is to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfit a Man's Hand, and much more the Hand and Seal of a Prince, I am afraid to pretend that I have a
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:006637_0058_1029723A6BE4D4E8"/>Commiſſion to ſend Ambaſſadors to act, ſign, and ſeal in CHRIST'S Name, when I know I have none; or even to join with thoſe who do ſo. Here is one Difficulty, which if Mr. <hi>Hobart,</hi> had helped me to overcome, <hi>I ſhould</hi> have returned him many Thanks; and have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to have propoſed ſome more. But ſince he either will not, or can not help me to get rid of the Apprehenſion of this amazing Guilt which ſtares me full in the Face, when ever I think of joining with the Diſſenters, I hope he will not be ſo unkind to my Soul, as to continue to urge me to that Courſe which will expoſe me to the Danger of eternal Damnation. For though I may be miſtaken, and the Thing in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be harmleſs enough, yet ſo long as I believe it to be a Crime of a very heinous Nature, the doing it muſt expoſe me to the Laſhes of a guilty Conſcience, and the Anger of GOD. For <hi>he that doubteth is damned, and whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin.</hi> Whatever a Man believes to be a Sin, though in itſelf innocent, yet in him it is a wilful Sin if he doth it. I know without his Teaching, that there are ſome Things in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that might be altered for the better, and I hope will be ſo, but ſeeing as it now is, it is the beſt I can join with. I therefore hope to live and die in it, and leave it to the Reader whether this is not the ſafeſt Courſe I can take? But if after all the <hi>ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Reader ſhould think thus, there is a great deal of Piety among the <hi>New-England</hi> Miniſters, and therefore though their Call or Ordination is not regular, yet it may be ſafe to continue with them. I would ask one Queſtion, ſuppoſe, that the good People who firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled this Country, inſtead of erecting a new Miniſtry, had only changed the Elements of the LORD'S Supper; and inſtead of Bread and Wine, had uſed Fleſh and <hi>Cyder,</hi> if that had been the Caſe, might there not have been as much Piety among them as there is now? And yet would it not have been our Duty to have joined with a more regular Church? And if the altering of CHRIST'S Supper would have made Separation a Duty, why not the altering his Miniſtry?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:006637_0059_1029723D66F37F20"/>
I have now finiſh't the moſt valuable Part of the Controverſy; what remains is little elſe, but a Collection of Calumnies, ſome of the moſt remarkable, I ſhall briefly examine. Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> aſſerts, that there is no Diſcipline in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> unleſs a Shadow is a Subſtance, and in this Country we have leſs than none, if leſs can be; this I called <hi>unruly Talking.</hi> Upon which he makes a Remark in theſe Words, P. 104. Mr. <hi>Beach repreſents thoſe who complain of Defects in the Diſcipline of the Church as her Adverſaries, and would have you conceive of them as a Pack</hi> of unruly Talkers. And yet at the ſame Time, I never pretended that there were no <hi>Defects</hi> in the Diſcipline of the Church, nor ever knew any Churchman that did pretend it. All that I did, was to give you Biſhop <hi>Beveridge</hi>'s Account of it, that you might judge whether it were ſo vile as ſome Men pretend. I did not look upon myſelf at all concerned to juſtify or condemn the <hi>ſpiritual Courts,</hi> as we in this Country ſhall never be concerned with them, unleſs we chuſe them. And yet to vindicate the Government at Home, and to wipe off a horrid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny from the Laws of our Mother Country, I will venture to ſay again, it is <hi>unruly Talking</hi> to ſay, that by the <hi>Law</hi> a Clergyman is bound to admit to the Lord's Supper, Drunkards, Whoremongerers, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Deiſts and Atheiſts, provided they have or may have a Commiſſion; and if the Miniſter refuſes, he muſt be fined <hi>five hundred Pounds Sterling. So that in this Caſe there is no Medium between Starving and Damming. This I call unruly Talking,</hi> and I hope I can make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſuch to every candid Reader.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Teſt Act</hi> here complain'd of, is the Law of the Nation, not the Church, and it requires that they who have Commiſſions ſhould be Communicants in the Church. Now let it be Mr. <hi>Hildrop,</hi> or who it will, who ſays this Law leaves a <hi>Clergy-man</hi> no <hi>Medium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Starving or Damning,</hi> he arraigns the Laws of the Nation, and charges the whole Legiſlature with the horrid Sin of Perſecution in the higheſt Degree. For
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:006637_0060_1029723EED3DDD08"/>neither <hi>Heathen,</hi> nor <hi>Papal Rome</hi> in the hotteſt Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ever did worſe than to leave Chriſtians no Medium between Dying or Damning.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If any <hi>Clergy-man</hi> ſhould ever ſuffer any Penalty, much more that of <hi>five hundred Pounds Sterling,</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to give the Sacrament to a notorious ſcandalous Perſon, how great a Man ſoever he might be, this <hi>Clergy-man</hi>'s Suffering, cannot be owing to the Law, but to the Injuſtice of the Judge or Jury. For ſuch a Miniſter, ſo repelling has the Law clearly on his Side. For the <hi>Rubrick</hi> is the Law, which runs thus, <hi>So many as intend to be Partakers of the holy Communion, ſhall ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify their Names to the Curate, at leaſt ſome Time the Day before. And if any of thoſe be an open and notorious evil Liver, or have done any wrong to his Neighbours by Word or Deed, ſo that the Congregation be thereby offended; the Curate having Knowledge thereof, ſhall call him, and advertiſe him, that in any wiſe he preſume not to come to the</hi> LORD<hi>'S Table, until he hath openly declared himſelf to have truly repented and amended his former naughty Life;</hi> and he is not to <hi>ſuffer them to be Partakers of the</hi> LORD<hi>'S Table,</hi> till this is done. Now this I ſay is the <hi>Law,</hi> and by it every Miniſter is obliged to <hi>repell</hi> all notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous evil Livers, and no to ſuffer them to come to the LORD'S Table. And there is no Law that difan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuls it. And though it may happen once in an Age, that a Miniſter may be undone by doing his Duty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law; yet it is falſe, to ſay that the <hi>Law</hi> undoes him, it is the Wickedneſs of the Judge, or Jury, or the Malice of ſome great Man that ſtarves and undoes him. And may not a Diſſenting Miniſter happen to be undone ſo too?</p>
            <p>As to our Diſcipline in this Country, which he ſays is none at all, I obſerved, our Clergy may be ſuſpended by the Commiſſary, ſilenced by the Biſhop, and finally impriſoned if need be. To this he makes no Reply.</p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>Laity,</hi> we keep from the Communion all that we judge unworthy. But he ſays we have no
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:006637_0061_1029724096962E48"/>Right to do this, but ſhould be puniſhed for our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, if we were not too far from <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I would obſerve, that as the <hi>Rubrick</hi> is the Law of the Church, and the Deſign of it is, that no ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Perſon ſhould be ſuffered to partake of the LORD'S Supper, ſo when the Cauſe can't be laid before the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,</hi> not only not within fourteen Days, but alſo not within fourteen Years, yet ſtill it gives us Right, and obliges us to keep the Offender from the LORD'S Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per till he repent.</p>
            <p>And to ſay that we muſt repell none from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe we can't give an Account of it to the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> within fourteen Days, is to defeat the End of the Law, and contradict the Deſign of it, it is ſuch a perverſe Interpretation, as would be admitted by no equal Judges.</p>
            <p>And our Superiors at Home, are ſo far from reſenting our Conduct in this Affair, as he pretends, that they would be highly and juſtly diſpleaſed with us, if we did not keep all notorious Offenders from the Communion.</p>
            <p>He taxes me with Falſhood and Profaneneſs, in ſpeaking ſo ſlightily of their Diſcipline in the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> of <hi>Branford,</hi> and ſome good People of <hi>Guilford,</hi> whom they laid under Cenſure; and as I was informed, excommunicated.</p>
            <p>He ſays, Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> was reſtored; which I never denied. What I ſaid was this, that in <hi>Defiance</hi> of their Cenſure and ſilencing, he continued his Adminiſtrations as much as ever; and ſo in all likelihood would have done to this Day, if they had never took off the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Their Cenſure ſignified nothing.</p>
            <p>As to the good People at <hi>Guilford,</hi> their Caſe (if I miſtake not) was this, upon chuſing a Miniſter, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Part of the Congregation, declared their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction in the Perſon choſen, and ſo refuſed to own him as their Miniſter. After ſome Time they were laid under Cenſure. But notwithſtanding this Cenſure, which I ſuppoſe remains upon them to this Day, they became and continue as regular a Church as any in the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:006637_0062_1029724396119110"/>Goverment. In mentioning this Caſe, I called them <hi>zealous Souls,</hi> which I did from a perſonal Acquaintance I had had with ſome of them, who appeared to me to be very honeſt, and as zealous as any Set of Men at all, and told me with Tears in their Eyes, that they would not have expoſed themſelves to ſo much Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Difficulty, had it not been for Conſcience ſake. And I muſt confeſs that it appeared to me amazing, (though I was then a Diſſenter) that ſo many ſerious, grave and religious People, for a ſmall and common Error, ſhould be all without Mercy given up to <hi>Satan.</hi> This Expreſſion it ſeems has raiſed his Anger to a very high Pitch. He calls it <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>ſquing</hi> the holy Scripture, and Infidel like, and I know not what. But I hope the bare ſtating the Caſe will juſtify me. To ſhew what miſchievous Wretches the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are in this Country, he frequently repeats that Calumny that we receive to our Communion, ſuch ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Perſons as they have laid under Cenſure, and would have it believed that this is our common Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. P. 112. Now if he had known any one Inſtance of this Nature, I'm perſuaded that he who deals ſo much in Scandal would have publiſhed it. For my Part I know of no ſuch Thing. And notwithſtanding his ſwaggering ſo much of their Diſcipline that in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Towns where I am concerned, and among many hundreds of People, I know of but one Perſon under their Cenſure, and given to <hi>Satan.</hi> And this Man has ever had a good Character, and for many Years has been a Meſſenger of one of their Churches, and a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Eccleſiaſtical Councils, but he happened to fall into that abominable Sin of ſaying that his Miniſter preached <hi>falſe Doctrine.</hi> Now the falſe Doctrine was no worſe than this, that the <hi>Sins of a Child of GOD, were better Evidences of his good Eſtate than external Duties,</hi> &amp;c. And his diſliking and condemning ſuch Doctrine in his Miniſter, was all the Scandal that I could ever hear that he was charged with, and I have ſeen the Charge drawn up againſt him; and yet to
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:006637_0063_1029724975BF79C8"/>
               <hi>Satan</hi> he was given. Now if this Man had deſired Admiſſion to our Communion, as he never did; yet to prevent Obloquy I ſhould not have received him, until I had conſulted with my Superiors, and taken their Directions. Whoever reads Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> and finds the Practice of receiving thoſe whom they Cenſure ſo often, and ſo awfully charged upon us, muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that they drive on a mighty Trade of cenſuring and excommunicating their People for Immoralities, and we as conſtantly receive to our Communion thoſe whom they reſigned to <hi>Satan.</hi> And yet every Body in theſe Parts knows that there is not one Word of Truth in it. What can be more unjuſt than ſuch Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, unleſs it be what follows? P. 112. He ſays thus, <hi>That the Practice of Religion declines, and that Irreligion and Profaneneſs grow upon us in all Places where the Church prevails, you all know in your own Conſciences that it is true; and Mr.</hi> Beach <hi>himſelf has not the Hardineſs to deny it.</hi> If I have not <hi>Hardineſs,</hi> I'm ſure he has a very large Stock of it. I have known ſome Men who in a violent Paſſion, have <hi>Hardineſs</hi> enough to ſay any Thing that is Spightful and Ill-natured, although there is no Truth in it. To be ſure, what he ſays I had not the <hi>Hardineſs</hi> to deny, I really did deny at the ſame Time. The Generality of <hi>waſpiſh</hi> People after a ſhort Fit of Anger, grow calm; but the longer Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> writes, the more fierce and out-ragious he grows. He ſays, P. 112. <hi>All</hi> my <hi>Argument ſeems as if it were deſigned to prove that the worſt Religion commonly does produce the beſt Men.</hi> To which I reply, when a Man is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with Paſſion, Arguments and Things <hi>ſeem</hi> quite different from what they really are. And if Mr.<hi>Hobart</hi> will put off <hi>Wrath</hi> and grow cool, my Argument will appear in a very different Light. And certainly he does not well to be ſo very angry, becauſe he found himſelf unable to anſwer it. My Argument as he calls it, is this, we cannot know whether the peculiar Tenets of any Sect of Chriſtians are true or falſe, merely by the good or bad Lives of the Profeſſors of that Sect, E. G.
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:006637_0064_1029724C72165788"/>You cannot certainly determine, whether the peculiar Tenets of the <hi>Baptiſts, Congregationaliſts, Presbyterians</hi> or <hi>Church Men</hi> are true, by obſerving their Lives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they all agree in holding the omnipotent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to a holy Life, contained in the Goſpel. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome Men who have unhappily fallen into ſuch Hereſies as <hi>Arrianiſm</hi> and <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> have lived ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Lives, it is therefore very dangerous to make this our Rule to judge by. Now I don't find, that Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> is able to confute this, but inſtead of that, falls to his wonted Practice of Railing, and ſays, I <hi>ſeem</hi> to deſign to prove that the worſt Religion commonly makes the beſt Men. Whereas I was not ſpeaking of different <hi>Religions,</hi> but only of different Opinions in the ſame excellent Religion. And though it may again provoke his Anger, I will venture to add, although he Boaſts much of their Diſcipline, as though it were the main Pillar of Religion, yet the <hi>Quaker</hi> Diſcipline does vaſtly excell the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> in Strictneſs; and they cenſure ten at leaſt, to the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> one; and yet I ſuppoſe he won't think that a good Reaſon to turn <hi>Quaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſaying theſe Things, I do not take it for granted, as he ſays, that <hi>the Practice of Religion decays,</hi> as the Church grows.</p>
            <p>I am perſuaded, that ſolid Chriſtian Virtue, as well as Knowledge increaſes as the Church gains Ground in the Country; and Thouſands of People are really bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by it in their moral Character. If he knows none that are ſo, I think I do. I ſhould be aſhamed of this kind of Diſputing, if he had not compelled me to it. In a Word, there is nothing in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that can hinder us from being as eminent in true Piety, as we can poſſibly be in any Church on Earth. And therefore whether it be true, or falſe, that there are many looſe People who pretend to be Churchmen, yet it is nothing to the Purpoſe: For other Men's neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or abuſing the beſt Means of Piety, need be no Hindrance to my making a good Improvement of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:006637_0065_1029724E1B1DD948"/>
I come now to examine what he has ſaid of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the <hi>Venerable Society.</hi> Which he begins with an Introduction in theſe Words, P. 113. <hi>I ſuppoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in my former Addreſs is more reſented by my Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, than what I ſaid on this Head; and they have their Reaſons for it; for it muſt be owned, that Intereſt is a very tender Point with moſt Men. — Their Intereſt and a very conſiderable one, evidently lay at Stake.</hi> — Now what ſuch ill-natured and unmanly Flouts can prove, I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; unleſs it be the Author's Uncharitableneſs and Cenſoriouſneſs, he muſt needs judge our Hearts by his own, otherwiſe he could not conclude that Intereſt is dearer to us than the Truth of CHRIST. Beſides, this malicious Aſperſion is perfectly groundleſs; for Mr. <hi>Caner</hi> whom he in particular charges with it, has no Intereſt at all at Stake, nor any Concern with the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and Dr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> and I could at any Time advance our Intereſt by leaving <hi>New-England;</hi> ſo that if we were ever ſo wicked Men, this Reproach is certainly groundleſs. And to ſlander the <hi>Devil,</hi> is unmanly. Jude 9. <hi>Michael</hi> the <hi>Archangel when contending with the Devil, durſt not bring againſt him a railing Accuſation, but theſe ſpeak evil of thoſe Things which they know not.</hi> However, in Gratitude towards that venerable and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Corporation, I ſhall ſay a few obvious Things in anſwer to his virulent Aſperſions. What he chiefly inſiſts upon is, that the Society ought not to ſend Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries to ſuch Places where there are <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of any Denomination, at leaſt no till the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then are all converted, and all ſuch Places as have no ſort of Proteſtant Miniſters are ſupplied. This is the grand Point which he contends for, and pretends he does it out of a Principle of Charity to the Souls which are periſhing in Darkneſs. I think this is the Sum of his Diſcourſe in both Addreſſes. This I confeſs has a plauſible Appearance; but I think a very pernicious Tendency. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are now ſo many Colleges and <hi>Shepherd's Tents,</hi> and ſo many Teachers of various Opinions, all
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:006637_0066_10297252D2247090"/>called <hi>Proteſtant Miniſters,</hi> that there is ſcarce a Place on the Continent ſettled by his Majeſty's Subjects, where there is not a Proteſtant Miniſter of one Kind or another ſettled amongſt them. So that if the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety muſt not ſend Miſſionaries where there are <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Miniſters, they muſt very ſoon ſend none to this Continent; For wherever the Society erects a Miſſion, there the Diſſenters ſoon open a Meeting.</p>
            <p>I will not ſay, there is no Place, where it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; but this is true of all Places that I know; and if it be otherwiſe in a few Places <hi>now,</hi> I am perſuaded it will not be ſo <hi>long.</hi> If therefore Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing takes Place, the Society muſt withdraw all their Miſſions from this Continent, and leave many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Church People to turn Sectaries, any Thing or Nothing: which will certainly be the Conſequence. Which whether it can conſiſt with their Charity I leave.</p>
            <p>I readily agree with him, that it is not the Deſign of the Charter that the Society ſhould ſend Miſſionaries to convert <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to the Church: and I am far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Opinion, that it is a baſe <hi>Reflection</hi> in him to ſay they do ſo. For they never ſend a Miſſionary where there is a Proteſtant Miniſter of any Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unleſs there be likewiſe a Number of Church People who earneſtly deſire a Miniſter, and yet can't afford a ſufficient Maintenance. They never ſend Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries to convert Proteſtants to the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> but to miniſter to Church People; and if Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters by that Means are added to the Church, they are not aſhamed to own, they do not think by this any Evil is done. This is the <hi>Truth and all the Truth.</hi> And therefore it is a <hi>ſcurvie Reflection,</hi> when he ſays that the Society and their Miſſionaries do juſt as the Biſhop of St. <hi>David</hi>'s ſays, the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Society <hi>de Propaganda Fide do; only changing</hi> the Word <hi>Pope</hi> for <hi>Biſhops.</hi> P. 132.</p>
            <p>I grant, there was a Time, when, as Dr. <hi>Bray</hi> ſays, there was little or no Occaſion of ſending Miſſionaries to the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> or <hi>Connecticut,</hi> becauſe there was then few or no Church People who wanted a Miniſter,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:006637_0067_1029725457D73DB0"/>yet now the Caſe is very much altered, and as there are ſome Thouſands, ſo they are like to increaſe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all Oppoſition. I think he is miſtaken in ſuppoſing that the Church would have come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before this Time, if the Society had not upheld it; for though we acknowledge their Charity with the ſincereſt Gratitude; yet I believe, unleſs we had met with as ſevere a Perſecution, as the Proteſtants do in <hi>France,</hi> it would have ſubſiſted and grown. For the People in this Country are naturally inquiſitive, and the Diſſenting Religion always changing and fluctuating, and the Writings of the Church coming in to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and exceeding all others, the moſt ingenious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would from Time to Time become in Heart Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, though they had not an Opportunity to join with the Church. This was the Caſe of ſeveral before ever the Society opened a Miſſion in <hi>Connecticut.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to what I had ſaid of the Society's being ready to improve all Opportunities to convert the Heathen, he ſays, P. 142. he will <hi>mention one particular Inſtance of the Society's neglecting a fair Opportunity of chriſtianizing the Heathen,</hi> which is the <hi>Scheme of the late Reverend Mr.</hi> Serjeant <hi>for erecting a Boarding School, for the Education of Indian Children,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now as to this, I will venture to ſay, that had Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi> applied to the Society, and offered to be their Miſſionary to theſe very Indians, they would certainly have received him joyfully, and have ſupported him in that Miſſion Liberally. But as there never was any ſuch Motion made to them; ſo I can't ſee with what Juſtice they can for this be charged with neglecting the Heathen. Is it a Crime in the Society, that by <hi>Orthodox Clergy,</hi> they don't think is meant all ſorts of Diſſenting Miniſters or Teachers, and conſequently don't incline to maintain them? Indeed he undertakes to prove that by Orthodox Clergy, in their Charter, is meant all kind of Miniſters except <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts. P. 143. <hi>All Calviniſt Miniſters</hi> at leaſt. But every one who underſtands Engliſh, knows that the Words <hi>Clergy</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:006637_0068_10297255DDC1D7F8"/>and <hi>Orthodox Clergy</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> no more means Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſters of the Presbyterian, Independent, or Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt Perſuaſion, than the Word <hi>Biſhops</hi> denotes Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian, Independent, or Anabaptiſt Biſhops; though they all eſteem themſelves the only true Biſhops, and the only Orthodox Clergy.</p>
            <p>He further argues, that King <hi>William</hi> who granted this Charter <hi>was a Calviniſt.</hi> But I anſwer, he was no Diſſenter, but being the Head or Protector of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he uſed the Word in the ſame Senſe as the Church uſes it. And ſuch a <hi>Calviniſt</hi> as he was, he gave a Salary to ſupport a Miniſter in the firſt Church of <hi>England</hi> Congregation in <hi>New-England.</hi> And as to what he ſays of Dr. <hi>Macſparran,</hi> he is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, for the King in Council never did declare Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Miniſters to be Orthodox Clergy in the legal Senſe; it was only in the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Senſe, or what was ſuppoſed the Senſe of the Donors of the Land in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. And when the Story is rightly told, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, they had but little Occaſion for giving publick Thanks to Almighty GOD upon that Account as ſome of them did. He adds, that the Society underſtood it ſo. But I add they never did ſo underſtand it, and accordingly never did ſend a Diſſenter upon the Miſſion. Neither does the Words <hi>Calviniſt Miniſter,</hi> denote a Diſſenting Teacher as Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> imagines.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> ſeems ſo full of Compaſſion towards the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> that he would have us all quit <hi>New En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and go amongſt them, although we have no manner of Proſpect of Succeſs, but were ſure to be knocked on the Head, or ſhot to Death for our Pains. For ſays he, <hi>'Tis a poor Shift indeed to pretend that the Indians Averſion to Chriſtianity excuſes the Society from making any Attempts to convert them to it. Had the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and primitive Chriſtians been of Mr.</hi> Beach<hi>'s Mind in this Caſe, Chriſtianity had probably never made any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the World.</hi> P. 139.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, the Caſe of the Apoſtles differed widely
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:006637_0069_10297258D96A9780"/>from ours, they had Miracles to awaken the Attention of the moſt ſtupid or obſtinate, and therefore might expect Succeſs where there was no previous Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to hear or receive them. They might with good Reaſon have gone into ſuch a Country as <hi>Spain</hi> now is, notwithſtanding the <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> and have Preached free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt Superſtition and Idolatry; but I don't ſee that any ſober Miniſter how zealous ſoever, no, nor ſo great an Enthuſiaſt as Mr. <hi>Whitefild</hi> does think that he has at this Day a Call to do ſo: or ſhould be likely to do any Good in ſuch a mad Undertaking.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> goes on in his uſual Way of Fleering, and ſays, <hi>I hope Mr.</hi> Beach <hi>does not mean, that ſo long as the Indians have an Averſion to Chriſtianity, the Society are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable in letting them alone; but if once they ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it in the Form of Presbyterianiſm or Independency, it would be Time to ſend Miſſionaries to convert them to the Epiſcopacy and Liturgy of the Church of England.</hi> P. 139.</p>
            <p>No, no, Mr. <hi>Hobart,</hi> I don't mean any Thing like that, and you know I don't. All I deſire of you is, that when we endeavour to inſtruct them in the Chriſtian Religion, you would not try to prejudice them againſt us, as ſome have done. When I firſt came into this Miſſion, I made an Attempt to inſtruct the <hi>Indians</hi> near to <hi>Newtown,</hi> being about 20 Families: but after a ſhort Trial I found that I labour'd in vain, and they refuſed to hear any Thing about Religion from me, and to ſhew how much they defied the Thoughts of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they would call me <hi>Churchman, Churchman,</hi> out of Contempt, which they had learned from the neighbouring Diſſenters. And ſome of theſe poor Creatures with whom I had culti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vated ſome Intimacy, adviſed me to give over my At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; for the Engliſh they ſaid, had told them, that if they received me for their Miniſter, they muſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain me, and I would in Time get their Land from them. Pretty much as Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> ſtrives to prejudice the good People of <hi>New-England</hi> againſt the Church, by telling them of an intolerable Yoke that it will
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:006637_0070_1029725ECA19F3E8"/>bring them under, if they come into it; that they muſt pay Tithes and maintain the dignify'd Clergy in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> &amp;c. As I eſteem it a greater Good to convert one Infidel to Chriſtianity, than an hundred Diſſenters to the Church; ſo it would have been a vaſt Pleaſure to me, if I might but have ſucceeded in this Deſign. And though he reproaches the Society for neglecting the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Stockbridge;</hi> yet I am perſuaded if they ſhould open a Miſſion there, (as I am confident they would if deſired,) and ſend one of us to inſtruct thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> would diſlike it as much as he does our continuing among the Engliſh. And if ſo, it will ſeem that his Charity to the <hi>Indians</hi> Souls, is like <hi>Judas</hi> his Charity to the <hi>Poor,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>why was this</hi> Waſte? It might have been ſold for much, and have been given to the Poor, not <hi>that he cared for the Poor.</hi> — Envy ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wears the Mask of Charity.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> repreſents it, as though wherever the Church comes, it deſtroys the Practice of Religion, and brings an Inundation of Wickedneſs — and yet that if we would go and ſet up this ſame wicked Church, almoſt any where out of <hi>New-England,</hi> he ſays, it would be an inlarging the Redeemer's Kingdom, and a bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Souls to Glory; which is ſuch a monſtrous Inconſiſtency, that one would be tempted to think, that if we might but be baniſhed, or ſtarved out of <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> does not much care whoſe Kingdom we inlarge.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing he is ſo extreamly urgent for us all to leave <hi>New England,</hi> and go ſome where among the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> and yet does not pretend that he can tell us where we may go, to be received by them and live among them; it looks therefore as though he had ſo much Love and good Will to our Souls, as to wiſh us all the great Happineſs of going to Heaven by the Way of Martyrdom.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this Head when I have made one or two Remarks.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. It is impoſſible with any Degree of Modeſty to arraign either the Wiſdom or Faithfulneſs of the
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:006637_0071_102972604EACD218"/>Society, upon the Account of their not ſending Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries to this or that Place; unleſs we knew their Affairs and in what Degree the People who ſeem to be neglected, were <hi>worthy</hi> of a Miſſionary, as well as the Society do; which certainly Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> does not.</item>
               <item>2. Every Benefactor to the Society is allowed the Privilege to appropriate his Benefaction to the inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Heathen,</hi> if he pleaſes; ſo that it ſhall be put to no other Uſe. Accordingly ſome do confine their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactions to the inſtructing the <hi>Negroes,</hi> ſome to the purchaſing Bibles to be ſent to one particular Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary, &amp;c. and every ones Deſire is punctually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with. And therefore Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s repreſenting the Society as being falſe to their Truſt and defeating the Deſign of the Donors, is very unjuſt.</item>

As the Benefactors certainly know, where the Miſſionaries are ſent, ſo it muſt be preſumed, that it is their Deſire that their Donations ſhould be put to that Uſe, to which they are now applied.

            <p>Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> tells us, that in <hi>Queen Anne's Reign, when High-Church was rampant, and the Proteſtant Religion lay gaſping at her Feet</hi> — it was at this <hi>unhappy Seaſon, that the Society diverted from their original Deſign,</hi> and ingaged in the <hi>Party Buſineſs of promoting</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet in the ſame Page, before he has got to the Bottom, he forgets himſelf, and ſays, it was when Mr. <hi>Cutler,</hi> Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> went for Orders. This ſays he, <hi>turned the Attention of the Society from thoſe Places in which they were before propagating the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and put an End to their Schemes of inlarging the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's Kingdom by bringing the Heathen into it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as both theſe Aſſertions cannot be true, ſeeing they make an abſolute Contradiction, ſo there is not one Word of Truth in either of them. For the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety ſince that Time have been ſo far from laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide their <hi>Scheme of enlarging the Redeemer's Kingdom by
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:006637_0072_1029726349DB9EE0"/>bringing the Heathen into it,</hi> that they have done ten Times as much both in converting Negroes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians ſince, than ever they did before. And at that Time which he ſays, was <hi>eſpecially fatal to Chriſtianity,</hi> the Society erected but one ſingle Miſſion in <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> in which Dr. <hi>Cutler</hi> now ſerves. An aſtoniſhing Thing indeed, that the aſſiſting of that one poor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation in <hi>Boſton,</hi> ſhould prove the FATAL Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and put an End to any further inlarging of the Redeemer's Kingdom! It is true, ſince the firſt Miſſion was opened in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> which was not at either of the Seaſons mentioned by Mr. <hi>Hobart,</hi> the Church has been growing here, and all Oppoſition and Diſcouragements ſeem ſtill to increaſe it. Which methinks ſhould make its Adverſaries ſuſpect, that it may be that <hi>Plant</hi> which our heavenly <hi>Father hath planted,</hi> and therefore cannot be <hi>rooted up.</hi> And certainly it would be no Diſparagement even to the Wiſdom of Mr. <hi>Hobart,</hi> to reflect upon the Advice of <hi>Gamaliel, Acts</hi> v. 38. <hi>Now I ſay unto you, refrain from theſe Men, and let them alone, for if this Counſel, or this Work be of Men, it will come to nought. But if it be of GOD, ye cannot overthrow it; leſt haply ye be found even to fight againſt GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If inſtead of publiſhing ſo many defamatory Untruths againſt the Church People in general, againſt the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, nay, and repreſenting that excellent Princeſs Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> as a moſt mortal Enemy to the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for which he has no Grounds, but only becauſe ſhe was not able for ſome Time before ſhe died, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the publick Buſineſs; I ſay, if inſtead of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing ſuch virulent Untruths, he had fairly reaſoned againſt our <hi>Tenets,</hi> he would certainly have conſulted his own Innocence better, although he had not gained ſo much Applauſe among the <hi>Bigots and High fliers</hi> of his Party. As for that Calumny which Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> has pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed of Dr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> and his Son, viz. that they were guilty of the Sin of Sacrilege in taking the Society's Pay, <hi>a Year</hi> or <hi>two</hi> for no Services done; this is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:006637_0073_10297264D1EC8FE0"/>Forgery of his own: as is made very evident by the Dr. in his Vindication of himſelf and his Son in his Letter to the Publiſher of the <hi>Poſt-Boy</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 24, 1751,<note n="†" place="bottom">See alſo a Letter of the Doctor's, dated <hi>Aug. 2,</hi> which was ſent to the Publiſher of the Poſt-Boy, but not printed, and is now added as an Appendix to this.</note> in which he ſays, <q>My Son was 2 or 3 Years in doubt which of the two Profeſſions to follow: during which Time he was appointed Catechiſt, and conſtantly officiated at <hi>Ripton,</hi> or <hi>Stratford</hi> in my Abſence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Agreement, til he finally concluded to follow the Law. — Upon which he immediately on <hi>March</hi> 25, 1748, wrote his Reſignation to the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; and I have by me from the Secretary an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer dated <hi>June</hi> 23, following, wherein are theſe Words," <hi>"I will acquaint the Society at the next Board with Mr.</hi> Johnſon<hi>'s Reſignation of the Catechiſt's Place, and heartily wiſh him Succeſs in whatever Profeſſion he deſigns.</hi>
               </q> — In the ſame Letter he alſo vindicates the School there from Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s Calumny, and I doubt not but as good an Account if there were Opportunity, might be given of all the reſt of his ſlandrous Stories and Inſinuations. — As to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Caner,</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, I believe any impartial Perſon that ſhall compare his Vindication of himſelf with this pretended Anſwer, will judge, that his, except a little <hi>idle</hi> quibbling, is in effect, only urging the ſame Things over again; notwithſtanding which, I can't but think his Vindication will be thought yet to ſtand good; as well as Dr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s Preface, notwithſtanding all he has pretended to anſwer to that. — At leaſt we are content to leave all that are diſpoſed to do us Juſtice to compare and judge between us.</p>
            <p>As many of Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s Calumnies are formed upon an inadvertent or elſe a wilful Miſrepreſentation of the Society's yearly Abſtracts, I will here once for all, ſtate the Truth of this Matter, that every honeſt Man may ſee the Injuſtice Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> is guilty of, whether he
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:006637_0074_1029726AC7BDF2E8"/>will own it or not. As it is impoſſible for the Society to foreſee what Accidents may happen in regard to the Death or Removal of their Miſſionaries; it is their Practice in ſtating their annual Accounts to charge themſelves with every Salary by them at any Time, granted to Miſſionaries, Catechiſts, or School-Maſters, till ſuch Times as they have agreed to drop any ſuch Miſſion or School by them erected. By this Means every one concerned, may ſee what is their ordinary annual Expence, which they are liable to pay, though perhaps by Reaſon of the Death or Reſignation of ſome of their Miſſionaries or Catechiſts, the whole of it may not actually be drawn out of the Treaſurers Hands that Year. Thus for Inſtance, <hi>Marblehead</hi> is now vacant, and has been ſo for about two Years, and yet the Place is kept upon the Abſtract, and the Society charge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with £ 60 <hi>per Ann.</hi> to that Miſſion, though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is any Thing paid, nor is there any Miſſionary there to demand it. And the Reaſon is, that the Society in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to re-eſtabliſh that Miſſion, as ſoon as a proper Perſon appears to diſcharge the Duties of it.</p>
            <p>In like Manner the Society are not ſolicitous, to drop the Name of any Perſon employed by them from the Abſtract, immediately upon his Diſcharge, provided they intend to replace another in his Stead, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wait till a new Appointment determine who is to ſucceed. Thus Dr. <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s Son was not only conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued upon he Liſt, but is ſtill continued, and perhaps may be continued, till ſome other Perſon is appointed to ſucceed him, though he has received nothing from the Society ſince the 25th of <hi>March</hi> 1748, but then the Salary allowed for the Place where he formerly offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, is annually carried forward to the ſucceeding Years Account, under the Article of Money, remaining in the Hands of the Treaſurer. — The ſhort is, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety's Deſign is to exhibit to their Benefactors, not ſo much the preciſe Sum actually paid every Year, which ſometimes conſidering the Death of Miſſionaries at a great Diſtance, or other ſuch Accidents may be very
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:006637_0075_1029726DC9A1ED58"/>difficult if not impoſſible; as to give an Abſtract of the annual Charge to which they are liable, and which they have taken upon themſelves to make good, if regularly called for. Nor is there any Injuſtice done here to the Benefactors, or to any one elſe, ſince (as I obſerved before) the Surpluſage if any ſuch there be, is brought into the next Year's Account, as Money remaining in the Treaſurer's Hands.</p>
            <p>From hence now any unprejudiced Perſon, may ſee what Injuſtice Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> has been guilty of towards Dr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> and the Society in charging them in ſuch a bold unwarrantable Manner, without truly underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Affair of which he was writing. I will not haſtily charge him as wilfully miſrepreſenting the Caſe, but ſurely he ſhould have taken better Care to inform himſelf rightly, before he pretended to lay ſo heavy and grievous a Charge. Nor can I think that he will be able to vindicate himſelf in this particular, as a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Writer or an honeſt Man, unleſs he publickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts this abuſive Calumny.</p>
            <p>Among other Slanders, he ſays, P. 148. <hi>It is credibly reported, that thoſe who have ſigned Petitions for Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, have (to appear like Perſons of ſome Conſideration) been ſome Times dignified with Civil or Military Titles which they had no Right to.</hi> — Now as to this,</p>
            <p>I remember very well about forty Years ago, I heard this <hi>credible Report</hi> among the Boys at <hi>Stratford,</hi> the Church People had juſt then ſent a Petition to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety for a Miniſter, and a certain Boy, whom I can name reported, as Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> ſays, that ſome of them in ſigning this Petition gave themſelves the Title of Juſtices of the Peace, others <hi>Captains,</hi> ſome <hi>Majors,</hi> and one Man, eſteemed the very pooreſt among them, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelf <hi>Colonel.</hi> I have not heard this <hi>credible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> ſince, till now that it is publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Hobart.</hi> And a great many ſuch <hi>credible Reports</hi> would have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in eternal Oblivion, had not this great HISTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIAN revived, and brought them to Light. But now as to the <hi>Credibility</hi> of this Report, (which like the <hi>Nag's
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:006637_0076_1029726F4E4D4140"/>Head Conſecration,</hi> has now ſlept about 40 Years.) The firſt Church People in <hi>Stratford,</hi> whatever their moral Character might be among their Enemies, were certainly Men of good Senſe and Knowledge, their <hi>Enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judges.</hi> And is it <hi>credible,</hi> that they would uſe ſuch a fooliſh, and more than <hi>childiſh</hi> Method to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the Society! Eſpecially when they did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but by the Direction and with the Mediation of <hi>Colonel Heathcote</hi> and Governor <hi>Hunter.</hi> Is it <hi>credible,</hi> that theſe Gentlemen would countenance ſuch a fooliſh, and wicked Project, when they had both been at <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and converſed with theſe Churchmen all together? as they informed the Society.<note n="*" place="bottom">Society's Hiſtory, <hi>P. 334.</hi>
               </note> Beſides all this, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety's Hiſtory confutes this <hi>credible Report,</hi> it gives us the Character of the Church People at <hi>Stratford</hi> at that very Time, thus, <q>The firſt People who ſtrove to have the Church Worſhip ſettled here, <hi>(Stratford,)</hi> were about 15 Families, moſt Tradeſmen, ſome Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who had been born and bred in <hi>England.</hi> Here you ſee are no <hi>civil or military Titles.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed the Society by long Information from all Parts of this Country, have a more perfect and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Knowledge of the State of Religion in it, and of the Manners of the People, than either Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> or <hi>I</hi> have. And his Arguments, they had well weighed, above 40 Years ago, as is evident from their Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>But to return to his <hi>credible Report,</hi> every one who has Malice and Impudence enough to invent any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful Story of the Church People, eſpecially of their Miniſter, is with ſuch as Mr. <hi>Hobart,</hi> eſteemed a <hi>credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reporter.</hi> I have had many ſuch <hi>credible Reports</hi> raiſed of me. It has been as <hi>credibly reported,</hi> that I get ſo ſo drunk at the holy Communion that I can't go home, but lie and ſleep in the Streets. And when his Hiſtory of the <hi>Epiſcopal Separation</hi> with which he threatens us, comes out, it will no Doubt be filled with many ſuch <hi>credible Reports.</hi>

If what Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> ſays, is juſt, P. 168. <hi>When a Perſon has Tryal of cruel Mockings, and has his Name caſt out as evil, for keeping a good Conſcience, and doing his Duty; it is as really Perſecution, as if he ſuffered Bonds and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments.</hi> If it be ſo, the Church People in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try have had a large and full Cup of Perſecution. But of late, (if my Obſervation don't fail me) this Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is happily abating, and Charity and mutual good Offices and Friendſhip are increaſing among us; I hope Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> with all his <hi>credible Reports,</hi> will not be able to revive and rekindle that bitter unchriſtian Spirit of Envy which was almoſt extinguiſhed. Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s Artifice is well deſcribed by the <hi>Spectator,</hi> No. 125. <q>There is, ſays he, one Piece of Sophiſtry practiſed by both Sides, and that is the taking any ſcandalous Story that has been ever whiſpered or invented of a private Man, for a known undoubted Truth, and raiſing Speculations upon it. Calumnies that have never been proved, or have been often refuted, are the ordinary Poſtulatums of theſe infamous Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, upon which they proceed as upon firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples granted by all Men, though in their Hearts they know they are falſe, or at leaſt very doubtful, when they have laid theſe Foundations of Scurrility, it is no Wonder that their Superſtructure is every way anſwerable to them. — It is the reſtleſs Ambition of artful Men, that thus breaks a People into Factions, and draws ſeveral well-meaning Perſons to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt by a ſpecial Concern for <hi>Religion.</hi> How many honeſt Minds are filled with uncharitable and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Notions out of their Zeal for Religion? What Cruelties and Outrages would they not commit, againſt Men of an adverſe Party, whom they would honour and eſteem, if inſtead of conſidering them as they are repreſented, they knew them as they are? Thus are Perſons of the greateſt Probity ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into ſhameful Errors and Prejudices and made bad Men, even by that nobleſt of Principles the Love of <hi>Religion.</hi> I cannot here forbear mentioning
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:006637_0078_10297276B747C778"/>the <hi>famous Spaniſh</hi> Proverb. <hi>If there were neither Fools nor Knaves in the World, all People would be of one Mind.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>How exactly this Deſciption agrees to Mr. <hi>Hobart's Piece,</hi> I ſhall no further determine, than to obſerve, that he has either collected or invented a Number of Facts, ſome of which are mere Fiction and Romance, and have no Truth at all in them, others he has very much diſguiſed and miſrepreſented, and from theſe Poſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latums he has reaſoned and drawn Inferences until he has proved us to be the moſt fooliſh and wicked Set of Men, the Bane and Peſts of the Country, the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of Souls, nay, and of Religion itſelf, ſo that we ought to be the Scorn and Abhorrence of all Mankind.</p>
            <p>Here it may not be improper to examine one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Railing, which he would have it thought that I am guilty of; which is this, In anſwer to his ſaying, that our Conformity to the Church Worſhip is not to be eſteemed an Act of Obedience either to GOD, or the King, I ſaid, that I feared, that ſuch as he diſobeyed both God and the King, in particular, in that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to pray for the Royal Family, according to the Form injoined by the King. For they think it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to uſe a Form of Prayer, impoſed by the higheſt Authority on Earth; and ſo make Conſcience of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying GOD and the King.</p>
            <p>This put Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> into ſuch a violent Paſſion, that as he tells us, he quite <hi>trembled, he cries out, is this the Man that began his Book with thoſe ſolemn Expreſſions, which conſider'd in this Connection, I tremble to repeat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> he ſays, <hi>is one of the heavieſt Charges he ever knew brought againſt any Man, it is horrid almoſt beyond Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for my Part, I cannot conceive any Man on Earth ſo bad, and I doubt whether human Nature is capable of ſo great a Degree of Wickedneſs.</hi> P. 39. In this Strain he runs on, ſeveral Pages together. Now that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may judge whether I deſerve ſuch Treatment for this Expreſſion, 1. I would obſerve that it is agreed, that our Governor did ſend the King's Command to
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:006637_0079_102972783AF4AE90"/>every Diſſenting Miniſter in this Colony, <hi>in all Prayers for the Royal Family</hi> to uſe theſe individual Words, <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick Prince of Wales,</hi> &amp;c. 2. It is notorious Fact that Diſſenters do make Conſcience of refuſing to uſe, or to ſubmit to a Form of Prayer, enjoyned by the higheſt human Authority. I hope I need not prove to a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter, that it is their grand Principle, that though a Thing or Form of Prayer be in itſelf ever ſo indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent or innocent, yet if it once comes to be enjoined or commanded in Religion by human Authority, they are then obliged in Conſcience, not to yeild to uſe it or ſubmit to the <hi>Impoſition.</hi> Now this making Conſcience of diſobeying the King, when he commands innocent and lawful Things, I verily believe is likewiſe a diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing GOD, who has commanded us <hi>to obey the King.</hi> And I would to GOD, I might have no greater Guilt upon my Soul, when I come before my eternal Judge, than I have contracted by this Expreſſion. I did not ſuppoſe, that the Diſſenters thought that they diſobeyed GOD in this; For it is a Contradiction, and impoſſible to be moved by Conſcience to do what I know or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be contrary to GOD's Will, for Conſcience im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a Belief that it is GOD's Will that I ſhould do ſo. But my meaning evidently was, that Differenters make Conſcience of not doing what they ought to do; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Opinion that GOD has forbidden them to do it, e. g. GOD has commanded them to obey the King, but they think they are bound in Conſcience to diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, if he enjoins any indifferent Thing in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> pretends that the King did not ſend this Command to the Diſſenters. But I anſwer, then our Governor is miſtaken, and it muſt be becauſe the King knows, that Diſſenters make Conſcience of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying him, or he does not at all value their Prayers. But let that be as it will, what I inſiſt upon is this, that if the King had laid ſuch a Command upon them, and they keep to their Principles, they would diſobey him out of Conſcience, and that I believe is di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="5 letters">

               </gap>ing GOD. And therefore the horrid Repreſenta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">

               </gap> of
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:006637_0080_1029727B35AC6EC8"/>me, that Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> has made, for ſaying, ſo, is moſt unrighteous and abuſive. However, I will not ſay of his praying for me upon this Occaſion, as he does of my praying that <hi>GOD would forgive him,</hi> viz. that it <hi>is but a Mockery.</hi> No, but I ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to it, and thank him for it, and am glad that he found and Inclination in his Heart to pray for me, though I fear it was not without too much <hi>Wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now as to that Queſtion, why Church People here cannot ſupport their Way of Religion, as well as the Presbyterians theirs? I anſwer, becauſe we have not the like Aſſiſtance from the Government. When a Congregation of Presbyterians firſt ſet up their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in any Place, the Government lays a Tax on all the Land in the Pariſh for the building their Meeting-Houſe and ſettling their Miniſter, from which neither the Church People nor Miniſter is exempted; their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony Rates are likewiſe given them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To which Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> replies, P. 135. <hi>What a peculiar Burden is this? Was ever any poor People ſo oppreſſed before?</hi> And thus he goes on <hi>canting</hi> and <hi>fleering,</hi> and ſays he, the <hi>Oppreſſion which Mr.</hi> Beach <hi>groans under, ſeems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to make this wiſe Man mad.</hi> This I confeſs is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully <hi>Arch</hi> and <hi>Witty!</hi> And perhaps it may paſs for ſolid Reaſon, and do great Execution, becauſe it will raiſe a ſtout <hi>Horſe-Laugh,</hi> which is the Victory of a Banterer. But it does by no Means convince me. He knows I don't complain, that Churchmen pay Colony Rates; but I ſay we don't enjoy thoſe Favours and Privileges, which our Neighbours do, and this he knows to be true. Nay in ſome Reſpects Churchmen are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Privilege of Engliſhmen, and treated as Slaves, not being allowed to <hi>vote,</hi> but muſt be taxed by our Maſters according to their Pleaſure. I omit the Affair of the Parſonage, it being more proper for the Law. And as to the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s being ſtrictly and legally eſtabliſhed in this Country, it having always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me diſputable, I leave it to be diſputed by Lawyers, and build upon no Foundation, but what is
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:006637_0081_1029727D11090DB0"/>clear and certain. He pretends, that I falſify when I intimate, that a Churchman in <hi>Reading</hi> would ſave Money by turning Diſſenter. But as I have a better Opportunity to underſtand this Affair than he, ſo I know that ſeveral Churchmen here would have ſaved ſome hundred Pounds, if they had turned Diſſenters. I grant indeed, that as the Government is not pleaſed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power us to raiſe Taxes among ourſelves, but we do all by <hi>Free-Will,</hi> ſo ſome few it is poſſible may make an Advantage by it. But whoſe Fault is this!</p>
            <p>He repreſents us as being generally Men of little or no Religion, and few in Number, and poor, and yet complains becauſe we have built five Churches in the two Towns of <hi>Stratford</hi> and <hi>Fairfield;</hi> which methinks, don't ſeem to hang very handſomly together; for the leſs Religion People have, the leſs Coſt and Pains they will be at for the Worſhip of GOD.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> ſays to us, P. 159. <hi>If your Separation from us is not certainly right, it is certainly wrong.</hi> In this he is <hi>certainly</hi> miſtaken. For we are under no Tie of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience whatſoever, to worſhip GOD in the Diſſenting Way? No Law of GOD or Man requires it. If the Church be not eſtabliſhed here, beſure no other Way is. No Law of this Government forbids the Worſhip of the Church, or if it did, it muſt be null and void from the Beginning, ſuch a Law being inconſiſtent with the Charter. And therefore certainly it is no Sin to join in the Church Worſhip. And conſequently if the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Church appears a <hi>more excellent Way,</hi> or if I am doubtful whether the <hi>New-England</hi> Biſhops, be really lawful Biſhops, it is not only harmleſs and ſafe, but my bounden Duty to join with the Church. If any Diſſenter is <hi>doubtful,</hi> whether it was right to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I muſt ſay with Mr. <hi>Hobart, I apprehend an eaſy and ſatisfactory Anſwer may be given.</hi> Which is, <hi>if you are doubtful whether</hi> it was <hi>right</hi> to ſeparate from the Church, <hi>that very Doubt is enough to convince you,</hi> that it is wrong for you to keep out of the Church.</p>
            <p>

He ſays, P. 160. <hi>Every Man is undeniably under ſome Obligation to the Church of which he is a Member.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> in all his three Pieces about Schiſm has ſlily taken a notorious Untruth for his Poſtulatum, and built all his Diſcourſe upon it: viz. that the Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> are <hi>One</hi> uniform Church, like the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſo that for a Diſſenter here to become a Churchman, is the ſame as a Churchman's turning Diſſenter in <hi>England,</hi> which is a poor begging the Queſtion, and has no Truth in it, as I ſhall now ſhow. It is certain and notorious, that the Diſſenting Churches in this Country differ as really, and as much from one another, as many of them do from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And if you ſhould ſay the Difference is not ſo great, yet I ſay Degrees alter not the kind. In ſome Meetings, they uſe the Lord's Prayer, read the holy Scriptures, the Miniſter keeps very much to one Form of Prayer, and preaches <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> in other Meetings, there is nothing of all this. In ſome Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings the Terms of Communion are very rigid, none are to be admitted, unleſs they make a <hi>Relation</hi> of their <hi>Converſion,</hi> in others there is nothing like it, and many abhor it. In ſome they will gladly admit a Churchman to their Communion; in others they will not, unleſs he makes of Recantation and enters into a particular Church Covenant. But a few Years ago the Miniſters of ſome of the moſt eminent Churches dare not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to baptize out of their own Meeting-Houſes, out of their own Town they had no Power, upon any Occaſion whatever. But to ſay no more of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, ſuppoſe I am baptized in, and am a Member of any Meeting in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> I ſuppoſe all will allow, that I may join with any other Presbyterian or Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Church in <hi>Connecticut;</hi> although theſe two Churches do as really differ from each other, as either of them do from the Church of <hi>England;</hi> why then may I not as lawfully join with the Church of <hi>England?</hi> I hope my being baptized in a Meeting, does not oblige me to be at peace with all, but only with the national Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="unknown:006637_0083_102972847ABAA718"/>
Again, if I was baptized in, and became a Member of the Church of <hi>Connecticut</hi> or <hi>Stratford,</hi> why is not the Church of <hi>England</hi> as much a Part of the Church of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> or of <hi>Stratford,</hi> as any other Church is? I muſt confeſs I cannot ſee any Thing in this Plea, but a mere Scare-crow to affright weak People. For if this Government had ever ſo good a Right to eſtabliſh, yet they really have eſtabliſhed no Way of Worſhip, but have left every Society to do what is right in their own Eyes. So that every Congregation may pray by Book, or without Book, juſt as the Miniſter and People can agree, and therefore I am no more an Offender againſt <hi>Connecticut</hi> Conſtitution, for uſing the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> than Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> for neglecting it. And ſeeing moſt of the Churches of this Government have always been altering, improving and reforming till ſome of them have got to be almoſt, if not altogether Presbyterians, I can not ſee, why I might not reform and amend too, as well as my Neighbours, without incurring the <hi>awful Guilt of</hi> Schiſm. And pray, whom are we Churchmen <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> from? From the Church of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> or the Church of <hi>New-England?</hi> That cannot be; for there is no ſuch Church; But here are Scores or Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Churches, all differing, both in Doctrine, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Worſhip, not only from one another, but even from themſelves in the Compaſs of a few Years. And therefore I don't underſtand with what Propriety he ſtiles us a <hi>Separation.</hi> For I'm no more a <hi>Separate</hi> from him than he is from me. My Congregation are no more <hi>Separatiſts</hi> from his, than his is from mine. The Presbyterian Congregation in <hi>Reading,</hi> are as much <hi>Separatiſts</hi> from us, as we are from them, we are no more obliged by any Law of GOD, or Man, to go to them, than they are obliged to come to us.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe, Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> would ſay, that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Churches were ſet up firſt, and therefore we ought to yeild to them. But this is not true; and if it were true, it would make the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in this Place <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> for the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:006637_0084_10297287749C6628"/>Church was here firſt ſettled, before there was any other Church. And as to this Country in general, the Church People, both Miniſters and People came as ſoon as the Independents; and were ſome of the <hi>Patentees.</hi> And the Independents overpowering them, and baniſhing them, did not deprive all Churchmen of a Right to breathe in <hi>New-England</hi> Air.</p>
            <p>And what if Sir <hi>Edmund Androſs</hi> and his Company were as Arbitrary as the <hi>Grand Turk,</hi> and as void of all true Religion as the Devils, as he repreſents them, What is that to our Caſe? Does not your own Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian tell you, that ſome of the firſt <hi>Patentees</hi> were Churchmen, and ſet up that Worſhip, and refuſed to part with the Religion of their Mother Country, and for the were baniſhed? And yet Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> allows that a Colony <hi>tranſplanting themſelves</hi> carry the Religion of <hi>their Mother Country with them.</hi> If ſo, I'm ſure every Churchman who comes from <hi>England,</hi> had a good Right to keep to the Worſhip. And as Church People had at firſt at leaſt as good a Right to ſet up the Church Worſhip, as the <hi>Browniſts</hi> and <hi>Congregationaliſts</hi> had to ſet up their Way, ſo we never loſt this Right, though for ſome Years unjuſtly kept out of it while there was no King in Iſrael, and every Man did what was Right in his own Eyes.</p>
            <p>Nay, let us put the Caſe that never any Churchman or Presbyterian had ſet Foot on <hi>New-England</hi> Shore, but as the Browniſts and Independents firſt ſet up their Way, ſo they had continued without Variation to this Day, had this been the Caſe, I ask whether it would be ſinful or ſchiſmatical for ſome, or all of theſe to turn <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and ſet up that Way?</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe, Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> or any <hi>Presbyterian</hi> muſt allow, this would not only be lawful, but a happy Change, and glorious Reformation, although they had all been <hi>baptized</hi> and <hi>owned their Covenants,</hi> in Independent Churches, nay, although Independents live as good Lives as Presbyterians, and have a ſtricter Diſcipline, and are more rigid in their Terms of Communion.
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:006637_0085_1029728A77698818"/>And if this be granted, as certainly it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by a <hi>conſcientious Presbyterian,</hi> then it unavoidably follows, that if there never had been a Churchman in <hi>New-England</hi> till this Day, yet it would be no Schiſm, no Tranſgreſſion of any Law of GOD for thoſe who have been educated in the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Way, and have been Members of their Churches to ſet up the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> All the Diſpute is, whether it is not a much better or more <hi>excellent</hi> Way? If it be, it is a glorious Reformation for Presbyterians to become Churchmen.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> would account it a commendable Thing for a Member of a New-Light Church, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Obligations he is under as a <hi>Member,</hi> to ſeparate from them, and to join with the Old Lights? Why then may not we eſteem it a commendable Things, for either old Lights or new, to join with the Church of <hi>England?</hi> For they all originally <hi>ſchiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> left the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſays indeed, that they only left the <hi>Corruptions of the Church.</hi> And juſt ſo we only leave the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Errors and Diſorders of the Diſſenters. But ſo far as they are right, we are ready at all Times to join with them.</p>
            <p>In the Concluſion he puts ſeveral awful Queſtions to our Conſcience, all grounded upon the falſe Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Facts, he had made before. Which though numerous for the better Show, yet really amount to no more than this, <hi>viz.</hi> if our asking the Society to aſſiſt us, has occaſioned their neglecting the Heather, then we are the <hi>criminal</hi> Cauſes of their eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And whether we had not better all turn Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters? and whether it is not morally certain if we would do ſo, that the Event would be the Converſion of a Multitude of Pagans?</p>
            <p>To which I reply, we muſt not do a <hi>certain</hi> Evil to obtain an <hi>uncertain</hi> Good. For me to turn Diſſenter, is to ſin againſt my own Conſcience. I can part with my Money, and I hope with my Life: but I can't part with my Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:006637_0086_1029728EE80F10E0"/>
And as to the Converſion of the Heathen, I'm ſo far from being <hi>morally certain,</hi> that my turning Diſſenter would be the Means of the Converſion of one Heathen to Chriſtianity, that I cannot ſee the leaſt Probability of it. I am <hi>morally certain</hi> that if the Society knew of any Place beſides thoſe they now take care of, where there is a <hi>moral Certainty,</hi> that a Miſſion would be ſucceſsful, they would moſt gladly embrace ſuch an Opportunity to convert the Heathen; and rather than the want of Money ſhould hinder, we would chearfully part with their Favours to us. This <hi>Money</hi> may <hi>periſh with him, who thinks it is more</hi> valuable than the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Souls. And I think we may ſafely conclude, that we are not the <hi>criminal</hi> Cauſes of putting a Stop to the inlarging of the Redeemer's Kingdom; for we are moſt heartily willing for the Promotion of it, not only to part with the Society's Charity; but with our own Eſtates alſo.</p>
            <p>But then we don't think it proper, to take Mr. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart</hi>'s Advice, and for a mere Dream of I know not what to be done among Pagans, and no Body knows where to leave the Church and looſe the Means of Grace, which through the Society's Goodneſs we now enjoy.</p>
            <p>How it can be a <hi>criminal</hi> Hindrance to the Inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Redeemer's Kingdom, for us to ask the Society's Aſſiſtance, I can't underſtand, ſince we know that they are vaſtly more forward to ſend Miſſionaries to the Heathen, when there is a Proſpect of Succeſs, than to us; as their Wants are more preſſing than ours, and Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s ſo often aſſerting the contrary is mere Calumny.</p>
            <p>And when we apply to the Society, we only deſire them to judge, whether it be more agreeable to their pious Deſigns, to grant, or to deny our Requeſt. And they are the propereſt Judges where their Miſſionaries are like to do the moſt good.</p>
            <p>I have now examined every Thing which I eſteem material in this Piece, and ſome Things perhaps too
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:006637_0087_102972906CCA7DE0"/>
               <hi>trivial:</hi> And after all remain of Opinion, that he has offered nothing that can juſtify me before GOD or Man, if I ſhould according to his Deſire turn Diſſenter. If I miſtake not, his Piece is mere vehement Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion grounded upon Untruths, Miſrepreſentations, and Calumnies. However, as every one has a Right to judge for himſelf, I don't expect or deſire, that my Judgment ſhould influence and Body elſe.</p>
            <p>As I have remarked upon Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s Performance, with an <hi>honeſt Freedom:</hi> ſo any one is welcome to find what Fault he pleaſes with my Opinion, provided he treats me with Truth and Juſtice; which I'm ſure Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> has not done.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now conclude with an Appeal to my Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Neighbours, who are competent Witneſſes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeveral heinous Crimes laid to my Charge are true. Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> has charged us one and all with <hi>the Blood of Souls, yea, with the Blood of Religion itſelf,</hi> P. 160. becauſe we <hi>ſo</hi> readily receive thoſe whom they for Scandal have laid under Cenſure; this he has repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as our common Practice. Now no Guilt can be more amazing than the Murder of Souls, and the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Religion itſelf. Damnation is very dreadful, but a double Damnation is due for the Murther of Souls, and of Religion. And yet how often has he repeated this Charge? Now you my <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Neighbours,</hi> are Eye Witneſſes of our Conduct, you can certainly tell whether theſe Things are ſo: To you I Appeal againſt this Accuſer, did I ever receive to our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion one Perſon, Man or Woman, whom you had cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured or caſt out from your Communion? You all know for certain, that there never was any Thing of this Nature done. Nay, ſome of you have complained that I have been too rigid towards thoſe who have been ſo unhappy as to fall into a groſs Sin, in that I do not readmit them to Communion immediately upon their acknowledging their Sin, but wait ſome Time for their Amendment.</p>
            <p>Again, do I ever, as he charges me, <hi>foment Diviſions</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:006637_0088_1029729365F3CE18"/>amongſt you, or diſturb your Civil or Eccleſiatical Affairs? Is it poſſible to meddle leſs with other Men's Affairs, or to live more peaceably and inoffenſively than I do?</p>
            <p>When he aſſerts, that ſuch and ſuch Things are <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly reported of us,</hi> e. g. as that we <hi>dignify ourſelves with Civil and Military Titles, which belong not to us,</hi> when we ſign Petitions to the Society, you muſt know that they are ſo far from being <hi>credible,</hi> that they are incredible and malicious Slanders.</p>
            <p>And ſince you ſee with your Eyes, that theſe horrid Charges and Accuſations are groundleſs Calumnies and Slanders, (and I believe the ſame Appeal may be made by all my Brethren, as I have now made) I deſire it of you, as a Piece of common Juſtice, that you would not countenance or encourage ſuch Railers, and Propagators of injurious Falſhoods. For it is a Sin to <hi>love</hi> and hug a <hi>Lie,</hi> as well as to <hi>make it.</hi> Whenever I have heard you of the Presbyterian Perſuaſion abuſed and miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by malicious Perſons, I have eſteemed it but juſt, to vindicate you ſo far as I knew you to be wronged. And it is but juſt that we ſhould expect the ſame Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from you. <hi>Honeſt</hi> Men of all Sides ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine to diſcountenance the Propagators of Scandal, though of their own Party. For this wicked Practice is not only a great Injury to the Perſon defamed, but it alienates and ſours the Tempers of People who are obliged to live together, and fills them with Spleen and Rancour to ſuch a Degree, as their Regard to their private Intereſt would never do.</p>
            <p>And however you may boaſt of your Piety, there is really no more Religion amongſt you, than there is Love. Love or Charity is but another Name for Holineſs. And <hi>GOD is Love.</hi> And though Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> is pleaſed to cenſure the generality of the Church People as having
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:006637_0089_10297294E9ECA2B0"/>little or no Religion; yet ſo little as we have, if any of us ſhould abandon himſelf to Slander in ſuch a Manner as he has done, I am confident our People would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly aſhamed of his Writings.</p>
            <p>The very <hi>Devil</hi> has his Name from Slandering and falſe Accuſing; and no Sin in the holy Scripture is more ſeverely threatned than this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> xv. 1. The Queſtion is put, <hi>Lord who ſhall abide in thy Tabernacle? who ſhall dwell in thy holy Hill?</hi> Part of the Anſwer is, <hi>He that backbiteth not with his Tongue, nor doth evil to his Neighbour, nor taketh up a Reproach againſt his Neighbbour.</hi> In the New Teſtament it is expreſly declared, that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilers ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of</hi> GOD, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 10. St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares that <hi>Railers</hi> or falſe Accuſers are as worthy of Church Cenſures as <hi>Drunkards,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 11. If Diſcipline were ſo carefully uſed among Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians as Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> pretends, he would certainly feel the Smart of it himſelf.</p>
            <p>But as for you my Brethren and Neighbours, I hope better Things of you; I hope you will not ſuffer your Minds to be <hi>ſoured</hi> with his <hi>Leaven.</hi> That we ſhould be all of one Opinion is rather to be wiſhed for, than expected; but that we ſhould treat each other <hi>fairly,</hi> that we ſhould not ſpeak evil one of another, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote each others Comfort and Happineſs, is what we all acknowledge to be right. No Difference of Opinion can excuſe us, if we violate the common Rules of Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and Humanity. <hi>Mala.</hi> xi. 10. <hi>Have we not all one Father? hath not one GOD created us? why do we deal treacherouſly every Man againſt his Brother. Let us love as Brethren, let us follow Peace with all Men,</hi> and the GOD of Love and Peace will be with us.</p>
            <p>And though you, or we, may at laſt be found to have lived in ſome <hi>Miſtakes;</hi> yet, if it ſhall appear, that we have uprightly endeavoured to know and do GOD'S
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:006637_0090_1029729677F541A0"/>Will; I hope ſuch unavoidable Miſtakes will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to you, or us, to our Condemnation; but through GOD's infinite Mercies, and CHRIST'S all-ſufficient Merits, we ſhall rejoice together in eternal Love and Peace. Which is the earneſt Prayer of your Souls ſincere Friend,</p>

               <p>ONE would have thought an ingenuous Mind with any thing of a truly chriſtian Temper and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, would, upon being miſled into any wrong Repreſentations of a Fact injurious to a Neighbour's good Name, be glad to be ſet right, and ready to repair the Injury. — But Mr. <hi>Hobart,</hi> it ſeems is ſo far from this, that, though I had given a Tranſcript of my Letter, clearly ſettling the Point, againſt what he had inſinuated, he has in your's by the laſt Poſt, done all he could, to eſtabliſh the odious Character he had given of me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Truth, or Provocation. — It would be very eaſy to anſwer every Line of his long quibbling and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Performance, if this were a proper Place for it: But as it is not, I beg leave only juſt to fix him down to the Facts as they really are, and he knows them to be: — He knows, the only Fact I objected to, was, <q>
                     <hi>That my Son,</hi> (as he would have it,) <hi>continued to draw for his Salary, after he ceaſed to do Duty.</hi>
                  </q> — He knows he had charged this in ſo many Words, by ſaying, <q>This is the Caſe of Dr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi>

I aſſure him we never did. — Can there be a more idle Quibble, than that againſt his Reſigning <hi>immediately,</hi> after he concluded to follow the Law, that he was preſent at two or three Courts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, only the better to make a Judgment, whether that Profeſſion would be eligible to him; when he knows he never appeared at the Bar, till above half a Year after? —or than that againſt the <hi>Conſtancy</hi> of his officiating, that he made a Tour to <hi>Cambridge</hi> in that Time, which it was before agreed he ſhould? — Miſerable muſt be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Man reduced to ſuch Shifts as theſe! — Is his own very frequent Attendance on the Courts, an Argument that he ought long before now to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his Salary and the Miniſtry, and turn'd Lawyer? — Or is it a reaſonable Objection againſt his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy at <hi>Fairfield,</hi> that he ſometimes takes a Ride to <hi>Boſton?</hi> — I am ſorry and aſhamed for him, that he ſhould ſo very weakly diſcover ſo much Venom! — Now he would have it thought I impoſe on the World in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the Secretary was ill at the <hi>Bath</hi> about that Time. — Muſt I then produce another Letter from him ſome time after this, thanking GOD for his Recovery, and excuſing, on Account of his late long Sickneſs, his not anſwering my Letters of <hi>October</hi> 1748, and <hi>March</hi> 1749, and Mr. <hi>Ogilvie</hi>'s Teſtimony, who was then there, that he was long Sick, and at the <hi>Bath</hi> about that Time? — Might he not write his Name, and yet not be able to make the Abſtract? — Or might not the moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Secretary in the World, or Under Secretary be liable to ſome little Inadvertencies? — If Mr. <hi>H—t</hi> had the leaſt Candour he might have been ſenſible that it was to
<pb facs="unknown:006637_0093_102972A2A977B130"/>this, and not to his Abſence, that I aſcribed <hi>Ripton</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called a neighbouring Town. — And now as to the School, can the Society be ſaid to be impoſed upon, when Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> for £. 15, takes Care that their School here is faithfully kept, though by another Man, (to which they are knowing,) and that it is done better than he could do it himſelf, as the People here account it to be, though for this Care, he retains a ſmall Part of the Money? — Whatever Mr. <hi>H—t</hi> ſays, I do not believe any Perſon of Veracity ever told him that Mr. <hi>Silby</hi> told him he did it for one third, becauſe it never was ſo, and <hi>Silby</hi> aſſures me he never ſaid ſo: and I challenge him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his veracious Gentleman. — It is indeed to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented as a Diſhonour to Chriſtianity, that any one who profeſſes himſelf a Miniſter of the Goſpel of Peace and Charity, ſhould (in direct Oppoſition to the Dictates of that Charity which <hi>thinketh no Evil, and hopeth all Things</hi> in favour to our Neighbour) ſo laboriouſly, from meer Hearſays through three or four Hands, and meer Surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes and Suppoſes of his own, endeavour publickly to faſten the moſt odious Characters on his Brethren, and even Elders (with whom he has no Buſineſs) againſt whom the Apoſtle forbids even their own Biſhops to take <hi>an Accuſation, but under two or three faithful Witneſſes.</hi> — But the Brevity I am obliged to ſtudy, forbids me to add any more. — I only pray Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s Name may never ſo groſly ſuffer by ſuch abuſive Meaſures from any one, as I ſuffer from him. — And as he has now ſeen the Letter of my Son's Reſignation, and the Secretary's Anſwer, I can't but hope he will yet have the Ingenuity to retract and do me Juſtice.</p>
