            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Theſe terms, I have with reluctance been forced to ſubmit for I am therefore obliged to aſſure the public, that the ſtory is founded on fact, tranſacted near this city not long ſince and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in the memory of thouſands, and for the truth of which I appeal to my fellow citizens.</p>

                     <p>I can't bear the thoughts of dividing, not I! diviſion! why I cou'd never learn it at ſchool! but, addition and multiplication, were always my darlings! Two hundred and fifty thouſand pounds, divided into nine parts, let me ſee—aye! I have it! nine times nine is, a, a, ſixty-two, no, that's wrong. Nine times eleven is, a, a hundred and ſix, and four over, no that's too much, but I'm no ſcholar, never mind, no matter,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030036_0083_0FE40BFC38CF2AC8"/>
I can count a hundred as faſt as any of 'em, and they can't cheat me! Charity begins at home, and he muſt be the greateſt fool on earth, that cheats himſelf; I never could forgive my ſelf for ſuch a ſin as that, I think I am old enough to have more wit. He that cheats another, can wipe off the ſin, by reſtoring four-fold, but he that cheats himſelf; poor ſoul! the ſin will lie at his own door, and it will never be in his power to make himſelf reſtitution! no, no, I know better; that muſt be the crying, that is ſpoken of by Lazarus, Nicodemus, Judas, or ſome other prophet, I forget who now; alack! its many years ago, ſince I read the bible, no matter. I'll e'en go and inform the Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, then I ſhall have one half to myſelf, and the other will go the Preſident of the United States. They'll call me traitor and informer, but I don't care, let them laugh that wins, ha! ha! It's an old ſaying and a true one, aye, I have it! "One bird in hand is better far, than two that's in the buſh,"—no, no, "than two that in buſhes are." Aye, that's it! I remember it's ſo on my neighbour Simmond's ſign, I love to make rhimes, when they jingle ſo cleverly, but here's two hundred and fifty thouſand birds in the cage, and moſt of them pretty yellow birds!
