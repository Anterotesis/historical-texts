            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>NE objection which the enemies of chriſtianity have made to the goſpel-inſtitution is, that it no where recommends a public ſpirit and the love of our country, or annexes any rewards to thoſe patriot-virtues, which formed the diſtinguiſhing characteriſtic of the antient Greeks and Romans, and raiſed thoſe celebrated republies to the higheſt pitch of power and opulence.—But whoever examines divine revelation with candor, will ſoon ſee that this is a groundleſs and unreaſonable charge.—'Tis true, that intemperate zeal for the proſperity of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular people,—that ſtrong and unbridled paſſion for the national glory, which was what they underſtood by love to their country, and which, after all the encomiums laviſhed upon it, often
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009866_0005_0F7B32EAA3FA9DF8"/>
prompted to great injuſtice to other nations, has no place in the ſcheme of chriſtian morals, nor is it fit it ſhould. Such a temper and conduct, inſtead of a beauty, would be really a blemiſh and defect, in a revelation deſigned to ſubſerve the general good of ſociety, and promote univerſal love and benevolence to all mankind. And had our ſaviour and his apoſtles, in the name of God, animated the Jewiſh nation to a warm zeal for their country and its liberties,—had they promiſed divine and eternal rewards to the exerciſe of this virtue, this, in the then preſent diſpoſition and circumſtances of the nation, would doubtleſs have been conſtrued as a lawleſs attempt to ſubvert the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and foment a ſpirit of ſedition and rebellion in the ſtate,—But if by love to our country be meant a well-tempered zeal for the public-good;—if an earneſt deſire for the welfare of the community to which we belong;—if a cordial and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted affection for our fellow-ſubjects;—if well-meant wiſhes for the national happineſs, and the moſt active endeavours to promote its true intereſt, conſiſtent with the general laws of charity, and the univerſal obligations of benevolence to the whole human race;—if this be the true notion of patriotiſm, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys the moſt rational idea of that truly amiable and generous virtue; 'tis no where ſo effectually taught as in the ſacred oracles,—no where carried to ſo high a pitch of perfection as in the word of God.—Moſt certainly <q>that charity which ſeeks not her own,</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. 13.5.</note> will exert itſelf for the good of others;—that chriſtian law of our divine maſter, which commands us <q>to love even our enemies,</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 5.44.</note> will not ſuffer us to overlook and neglect our friends;—that principle of univerſal benevolence which ſhines on millions, and incircles all mankind in its friendly embrace; will ſcatter its warmeſt and kindeſt influences on our dear country;—and thoſe precepts which require us to maintain ſuch a noble ſpirit of diſintereſted love to our brethren, as <q>to lay down our lives for their ſakes</q>

<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009866_0006_0F7B32EAF7A47220"/>
and animate us, even to die for the good of the community, if called by divine providence ſo to do.</p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY, there never was ſo glorious an inſtance of this noble and generous virtue, as we ſee exhibited in the life and actions of our bleſſed REDEEMER, the divine author of this inſtitution. Warm with a generous, a diſintereſted benevolence to mankind; he laid down his life for their redemption: Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by a true ſpirit of patriotiſm, he gave the moſt ſignal proofs of love to his country, and manifeſted the ſincereſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Jewiſh nation, from whom he ſprung, according to the fleſh. Hence aroſe that amiable concern he expreſſed for the miſeries he foreſaw coming upon them, in his moving and pathetic lamentation over Jeruſalem, recorded by the evangeliſts.<note n="§" place="bottom">Luke 13.34.</note> Hence were thoſe kind endeavours he uſed to prevent theſe evils, by checking the tumultuous ſpirit then kindling amomg them, and engaging them to a peaceable ſubjection to the Roman government. And to this, may we not add, it was owing, at leaſt in part, that, as he declared <q>he was not ſent, except to, the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 15.24.</note>; ſo the whole of his public miniſtry was confined to that nation, and all thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and beneficent miracles he wrought, were limited to the country that gave him birth? May we not view theſe miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous operations, in one reſpect, as ſo many ſolid atteſtations of true patriotiſm and ſtriking evidences of love to his country? In this view, no doubt, they were conſidered by the men of that age: And therefore when the elders of the Jews apply to him, with a requeſt from the Roman centurion, that he would come and heal his ſervant; they recommend him as one who was eminently poſſeſſed of this virtue, and as ſuch, a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object of our Saviour's regard.—'He is worthy, (ſay they) <q>for whom thou ſhalt do this, for he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a ſynagogue.</q>—He was a Roman officer: But as he was poſted in Judea, he conſidered it as his country,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009866_0007_0F7B32EB8FF39E40"/>
and teſtified his affection to it, by public-ſpirited actions. <note n="*" place="bottom">Whether this centurion was a proſelyte to the Jewiſh church, or not, appears to me very uncertain. Mr. Pool's continuators upon the parallel place Mat. 8, rather think he was not, tho' ſome interpreters ſuppoſe he was. Our Saviour, in the commendation he gives of his great faith, ſeems rather. I imagine, to conſider him as one who had hitherto lived in Paganiſm, and therefore his great faith in the power and grace of Chriſt was the more remarkable on that account "I have not found (ſays he) ſo great faith, no not in Iſrael." And in this view his building the Jews a ſynagogue will appear a more notable and ſtriking inſtance of public ſpirit and love to his country.</note> And tho' he was probably educated in idolatry, yet ſuch was his regard for his fellow-ſubjects among whom he lived, that he chearfully contributed to the ſupport of the Jewiſh religion, and generouſly built them a ſynagogue, for the worſhip of the God of Iſrael, at his own expence. The true patriot will not abate of his love to his country, or deſert its intereſts, barely becauſe the religion therein profeſſed and eſtabliſhed, differs from his own: So far from it, that if there be nothing in ſuch religion repugnant to the general laws of reaſon and morality, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of the natural rights and liberties of mankind; he will look upon himſelf obliged to promote it, and chearfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to its ſupport. This then was the virtue, on account of which this Roman officer was recommended by the Jewiſh elders, as worthy the notice of our Saviour, and of which Chriſt accordingly teſtified his approbation by going and healing his ſervant. And in this view the words afford a proper argument for a diſcourſe upon the virtue of PATRIOTISM, and naturally lead us to conſider this noble principle in its nature,—properties,—and effects.</p>
            <p>TRUE PATRIOTISM then, conſidered as a principle, is the ſame thing with public ſpirit, or a generous love to our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,—a regard for the happineſs of our fellow-creatures, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a tender concern for the welfare of our fellow-ſubjects.</p>
            <p>SELF-LOVE, or a regard to our own happineſs, is an innate and inextinguiſhable principle in the human mind: But then,—that we are not born for ourſelves only,—conſequently are not
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009866_0008_0F7B32EC464CAFA8"/>
to confine our views to our own private intereſt, ſeperate from that of the community, much leſs in oppoſition to it; is a genuine dictate of reaſon, philoſophy, and revelation.—From the firſt dawn of life to its final period, we are neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent.—Firſt and principally indeed, upon the great author of nature; but next and ſubordinately upon our fellow-creatures with whom we ſtand connected. As we advance forward in life, theſe reciprocal dependencies and connexions, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the ſocial obligations thence reſulting, multiply and increaſe. Our happineſs and ſecurity, or rather the ſprings from whence they derive, branch out into innumerable channels, and demand a correſpondent attention. If therefore a principle of ſelf-love, prompts us to ſeek our own particular happineſs, becauſe it is ours; the ſame principle muſt induce us to love our country and ſeek its welfare, becauſe our own is involved in it, and inſeperably connected with it. And thus even from ſelf-love and a deſire of happineſs, we are directed to ſeek the good of the public, and yield obedience to that apoſtolic precept,—<q>look not every man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of others</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Phil. 11.4.</note>. In this view of the caſe that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is verified,—</p>
            <p>"That true ſelf-love and ſocial are the ſame."</p>
            <p>This principle of benevolence begins with ourſelves—Family connexions and private friendſhips are its next objects.—It ſpreads on to our neighbours and acquaintance.—Our country feels its cheriſhing influence next.—Still it expands and widens till it comprehends all the human ſpecies, and finally incloſes the whole creation in the friendly and generous circle.<note n="§" place="bottom">

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:009866_0009_0F7B32ED0E089EF0"/>HENCE it appears, that though patriotiſm has its origin in ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, and is ever conſiſtent with it; yet it is widely different from, or rather directly oppoſite to the principle that commonly goes under that name. The true patriot has a noble and exalted notion of happineſs: He does not confine it to his own perſonal intereſt and convenience, or limit it to the contracted circle of his family, or particular friends; but comprehends in his idea of it the welfare of millions, and eſpecially includes the ſafety and proſperity of his dear country in the account. And while the ſelfiſh man confines his views wholly to his private intereſt, and meanly coils himſelf up it the narrow and dirty ſhell of his own perſonal ſafety, and happineſs; the true patriot, ever ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious of the public good, and concerned for its proſperity; ardently deſires its happineſs, and warmly intereſts himſelf in its various viciſſitudes. The miſeries of his country awaken his inmoſt grief and compaſſion. At ſight of the public calamities, his benevolent heart bleeds. He rejoices in its emolument, and feels the nobleſt ſatisfaction in its ſafety, proſperity and glory. However flouriſhing his own private affairs are; if his country is in danger, and the public happineſs interrupted or inſecure:—Is it involved in the calamities of war,—ravaged and depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by foreign enemies, or weakened and rent by civil diſcord, domeſtic faction, and inteſtine ſtrife:—Does it groan under the iron rod of deſpotiſm and tyranny, or has its foundations ſapped by a prevailing ſpirit of anarchy, levelliſm, and irrefrenable licentiouſneſs:—If public credit runs low, and a general temper of diffidence, diſtruſt, and diſaffection to government prevails:—If oeconomy, and induſtry, manufactures, navigation, and commerce, thoſe ſources of wealth, and unfailing ſprings of public proſperity, dwindle and decline:—And on the other
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009866_0010_0F7B32EE8A4C4AA0"/>
hand, idleneſs, contention, intemperance, diſſipation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality, increaſe and abound.—In a word:—If righteouſneſs, charity, peace, truth, faithfulneſs, and liberality, together with thoſe other amiable and ſalutary virtues, ſo directly tending to "exalt a nation," evidently fade and languiſh; and the oppoſite vices, which are a "reproach," a ſhame and ruin to a civil community, become faſhionable and prevail:—Theſe things will affect the true patriot with the moſt keen and ſenſible an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, will diſpirit his happineſs, and damp his joy amidſt the higheſt tides of domeſtic proſperity, or the greateſt affluence of perſonal and family enjoyments.—He who does not thus feel for his country, is a ſtranger to this noble and generous impulſe:—He who regards his own intereſt above that of the public, is a concealed enemy to the ſtate:—He who purſues his own little affairs at the expence of his fellow-ſubjects, and does not <q>prefer Jeruſalem above his chief joy</q>; whenever there happens a competition, will ſacrifice the public happineſs to his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate convenience;—will commence a rebel, a traytor to his country; and, if he has opportunity, rob and plunder the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, to promote his own paltry purpoſes and deſigns.</p>
            <p>TO LOVE our country then,—to deſire its proſperity, and warmly intereſt ourſelves in its various viciſſitudes, is part, and but part, of this noble virtue of patriotiſm.—Some men have ſo much honeſty, as not to hurt the public; but have not zeal enough for its welfare to do it any good. They are proof, perhaps, againſt any temptation to injure it; but will never exert themſelves for its happineſs.—Their love to their country is much like that cold, ineffective charity, mentioned by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <note n="*" place="bottom">Jam. II. 16</note>, which barely ſays, "—be ye warmed and filled"; but after all its pretended good wiſhes, "does not profit" is of no avail to the object of it. If all men were of this indolent and lukewarm diſpoſition, government muſt ſoon be unhinged, the foundations of public peace and happineſs diſolved, and the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009866_0011_0F7B32EF45AC9B30"/>
ſafety and welfare of the community become a prey to the firſt invader. Would we merit the glorious character of patriots, we muſt not only wiſh, but act for our country's good. Our love to the public muſt exemplify itſelf, in public-ſpirited actions and ſervices, equal to our abilities, and proportionate to the utmoſt extent of our power and influence.—The true patriot, therefore, is one who allows his country a ſhare in his thinking hours. He is ſtudious of its welfare, thoughtful of its happineſs, and plans and projects for its ſafety. Civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is abſolutely neceſſary to public happineſs. But without good laws, and wholeſome inſtitutions, government cannot ſubſiſt. At leaſt, it can never anſwer thoſe ſalutary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes for which it was appointed, in any tolerable degree. And to frame theſe laws,—to adapt theſe rules and maxims of government to the genius of the people, the circumſtances of time and place, and the various exigencies of the ſtate; demands the ſtudy, the wiſdom and ſkill of the politician.</p>
            <p>BUT the legiſlator is not the only man who ſtudies and plans for the good of the public. Whoever projects any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the welfare of his country, tho' it be but to the throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a hint that may be improved to that purpoſe:—He who invents any new and uſeful arts of life, or makes or communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates any valuable improvements in thoſe already found out; is ſo far forth a patriot, and deſerves his country's thanks: Eſpecially the man who ſtudies to promote its beſt intereſts, to curb the vices and reform the morals of a degenerate age, and to introduce and cheriſh the amiable, the beneficial virtues of chriſtianity among his fellow-men, is highly deſerving of that character: And he who refuſes or neglects theſe things, when it is in his power, is no true friend to the public:—Nay he is an enemy to his courtry, in proportion to the value and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of his neglected ſervices.</p>
            <p>FURTHER ſtill;—love to our country requires, that we act, as well as ſtudy and think, for the public good.—The ſituation
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009866_0012_0F7B32F385DEA7B0"/>
of our country may be ſuch, as to demand the utmoſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our power and influence in its behalf: And the duty we owe the public, requires a chearful compliance with this demand. The true patriot is one, whoſe purſe, as well as his heart, is open for the defence and ſupport of his country. "His liberal ſoul deviſes liberal things," and his generous hand is over ready to execute his liberal purpoſes.—As a ruler, every well-concerted and public-ſpirited meaſure, is ſure to meet with his approbation, and gain his ſuffrage.—As a ſubject, he ſcorns to be ſtingy and parſimonious, when the ſafety or welfare of his country calls for his aſſiſtance. When any noble and generous deſign is on foot, that has a friendly aſpect upon the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;—be it for the reformation of manners,—the promotion of learning,—the advancement of virtue and religion, or any thing that tends to the public emolument;—then, in proportion to this ability, he will be <q>rich in good works, ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Tim. VI.18.</note>—In a word:—As love to the public is his ruling paſſion, conſidered as a member of ſociety the grand object of his ambition is, to ſhield it from danger, and promote its welfare. In purſuit of this he is indefatigable and undaunted. Nor hope nor fear can ſhake his reſolution, or warp him aſide from his duty. The moſt lucrative conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are no temptations to him, to betray his country, or deſert its intereſt. To bribery, he is an avowed enemy. He diſdains the mean and dirty arts of corruption. To riſe upon the ruins of his country, or ſacrifice its intereſt to his own private ſchemes, or the narrow and contracted views of a party:—To enrich himſelf at the expence of the community, or fatten and riot on the public ſpoils, his generous ſoul abhors. Love to his country is his predominant principle.—He is unwearied in his attempts to promote its happineſs.—Not even inſenſibility in the public, of his benevolent purpoſes; nor the moſt ungrateful returns for his well-meant wiſhes and ſervices, can damp his patriot ardor,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009866_0013_0F7B32F419437FB0"/>
cauſe him to diſcontinue his attempts in its favour, or diſcourage him in the noble and generous purſuit. When his country is invaded and demands his ſervice, he deſpiſes danger, and boldly hazards his life in its defence. He gallantly oppoſes his breaſt, to the drawn ſwords and ſpears of its enemies; he nobly reſolves to procure its ſafety, or ſhed his blood in the generous conflict, "and bravely die in the laſt ditch."—Thus engaged is the true patriot in his country's behalf.—His heart and his head,—his tongue,—his pen, and his hands,—his eſtate,—yea and even his life too, are ready at its ſervice, and devoted to its intereſt, whenever they are called for.</p>
            <p>BUT 'tis not every pretended regard for our country, or zeal for the public welfare, that deſerves the name of public<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirit. There are hypocrites and impoſtors, wild enthuſiaſts and frantic zealots in patriotiſm and politics, as well as in religion. Too often the reſtleſs ſpirit of diſaffection and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,—the wild zeal of ambition and faction, or the ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable fury of ſedition, treaſon and rebellion, aſſume the maſk of patriotiſm, artfully mimic the air of public-ſpirit, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to obtrude themſelves upon the world for a diſintereſted regard for the common happineſs. But 'tis not difficult for a diſcerning eye to detect the impoſture, and unmaſk the cheat. Men of this caſt and complexion, under all theſe ſpecious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes, have ſome ſelfiſh ſcheme at bottom, which a little atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will ſerve to lay open and expoſe. True public ſpirit has its ſource in benevolence and kindneſs to our fellow-men, 'Tis near, akin to that heavenly wiſdom deſcribed by the apoſtle, <note n="*" place="bottom">James 3.17.</note> 
               <q>which is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocriſy;</q> or rather like its ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ter virtue, charity, <q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">I Cor. I3. 4, 5.</note>it ſuffers long and is kind, envieth not, vaunteth not it ſelf, is not puffed up, doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly, ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily provoked,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009866_0014_0F7B32F55FBAAA58"/>
thinketh no evil.</q> 'Tis a prudent zeal for the public, chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by reflection, calm ſteady and diſpaſſionate in its operation,—in its influence moſt beneficent and kind. Whenever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, under pretence of concern for the public, men appear four and moroſe; forward, bold, and aſſuming,—cruel, fierce, angry, and vindictive, or loud and boiſterous in purſuit of any favorite ſcheme; and ſeem to aim their reſentments, rather againſt the perſons, than the vices of thoſe they oppoſe; there is great reaſon to ſuſpect their honeſty; 'tis almoſt certain ſome foul deſign lurks beneath this fair outſide, and that they are really cheats and impoſtors at heart. Men of this ſort, are ever ready to clamour, and find fault, with the conduct of all public meaſures in which, they have no hand: Eſpecially, if croſſed in any favourite pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they at once ſet up a cry;—<q>the country is in danger; the public is ruined;</q>—when probably, all the buſineſs is, that themſelves are out of power, or they meet with oppoſition in proſecuting ſome private ſcheme, or party project, injurious to the country, or deſtructive of the public happineſs. But ſo argue againſt the being and excellence of public-ſpirit, from theſe pernicious arts of ill-deſigning men, is juſt as illogical and abſurd as to conclude, that becauſe there are hypocrites and pretenders in religion, therefore religion has no exiſtence, and virtue no real charms. On the contrary, 'tis a convincing argument in its favour:—'Tis a clear evidence that there is indeed ſomething truly excellent in the ſubſtance, when even the ſhadow is captivating: The reality needs muſt be valuable, ſince the bare appearance is thus capable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the deformity of vice, and render even wickedneſs reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. As counterſeit coin, ſpeaks an intrinſic value in the true; ſo this mock-patriotiſm, by which ill-deſigning men impoſe upon the world, loudly proclaims the excellency of true public-ſpirit, and abundantly proves its innate ſterling worth.</p>
            <p>And truly with the higheſt reaſon.—For this virtue is no beneficial in its conſequences, than truly amiable in its nature
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009866_0015_0F7B32F610656340"/>
and properties. Wherever it prevails among a people, it has a kind and ſalutary influence, and is ever productive of the happieſt effects. Next to the bleſſing of Heaven upon a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, 'tis the firmeſt foundation of ſocial happineſs, the moſt ſure and unfailing ſpring of the public ſafety, proſperity and glory. Did it univerſally govern, univerſal tranquility would be the conſequence:—In proportion to its influence in a community, the public felicity is ſecure. To trace it in all its happy conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and enumerate the many advantages reſulting from it to a people among whom it generally prevails, requires more time than is at preſent allowed me, were I equal to the taſk. Suffice it to ſay,—that the liberties of a people will be ſafe;—their lives, perſons, and properties ſecure;—the important intereſt of learning promoted;—and virtue and true religion encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, in proportion to the prevalence of patriot-principles and public-ſpirit among them.</p>
            <p>LIBERTY is the glory of a community, the moſt firm and unſhaken baſis of public happineſs. <q>This gives an inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble charm to all our enjoyments:—It imparts a reliſh to the moſt indifferent pleaſures, and renders the higheſt gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions doubly delightful. It ſmooths the rugged brow of adverſity, and endears and enhances every acquiſition.</q>—The want of this will abate the value of all the comforts of life. The imbittering circumſtance of precarious property:—The grating reflection, that life and all its enjoyments, lie at the mercy of a tyrant, and are liable, every moment, to be raviſhed by the lawleſs hand of violence;—mars the reliſh of every gratification, and throws a melancholly gloom upon all temporal enjoyments. But wherever public-ſpirit prevails; liberty is ſecure. There men may freely think for themſelves, and publiſh their ſentiments on religion or government, without moleſtation or fear. For as liberty is the ſource of ſo much public-happineſs; he who is a patriot, and wiſhes well to his country, muſt needs be a faſt friend to it, a warm and ſtrenuous
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009866_0016_0F7B32F9BACCDF28"/>
advocate for it, whatever rank in the community he ſuſtains.</p>
            <p>FOR the ſame reaſon our lives, perſons, and properties will be ſecure, in proportion as this generous. principle prevails. The ſafety of theſe is inſeperably connected with civil liberty, which, as we have heard, is a genuine conſequence of public<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirit, They never can be wreſted, from us but by cruelty and oppreſſion,—vices which can have no exiſtence in a patriot-ſtate. In poſſeſſion of theſe bleſſings we are therefore ſecure, unleſs, by our crimes, we make a foreiture of them to the public: But this we never ſhall do, if we ourſelves act under the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this virtue.</p>
            <p>LEARNING is another great and ineſtimable bleſſing to ſociety,—a ſhining ornament to a country, and productive of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt conſequences. Imagination can ſcarce paint the ſuperior condition of that ſtate, where learning, ſcience, and the liberal arts flouriſh; to that of a rude and unpoliſhed people, over-run with barbariſm and ignorance. But learning is both the nurſe and off-ſpring of public-ſpirit, in different views. 'Tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible therefore that it ſhould be diſcouraged, or its important intereſts neglected, where this noble principle governs. 'Tis the character, the genuine tendency of public-ſpirit, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſocial happineſs in all poſſible ways. As learning, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, has ſuch a kind and ſalutary influence on the good of ſociety; it muſt needs be the object of the true patriot's kindeſt regard:—what he will moſt tenderly promote and cheriſh, and ever ſhew himſelf a warm friend and patron to its important intereſts.</p>
            <p>ON the ſame principles, religion and virtue muſt ever be the object of the patriot's care, and every thing done to encourage and promote it, where public-ſpirit, prevails. The genuine principles of chriſtianity;—that ſpirit and temper which the goſpel inſpires all its true votaries with, has the kindeſt influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon public happineſs, both in a natural and moral reſpect. It's direct tendency is, to reform the vices, and correct thoſe
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009866_0017_0F7B32FA531B9618"/>
corrupt diſpoſitions of the human heart, which, in their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, are ever inimical to ſociety, and ſubverſive of all the important intereſts of mankind. In the room of theſe it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plants and cultivates the virtues of juſtice, truth, loyalty, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and charity, ſo friendly to ſocial-happineſs, and certainly productive of public peace. And beſides all this, true religion and public virtue, recommend a people to the divine protection, and engage the ſmiles of heaven for their ſafety and proſperity.—This intereſt, therefore, will neceſſarily engage the attention of the true patrior. In proportion as he loves his country, he will regard religion, and labour to promote it. He will care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attend its ſacred inſtitutions himſelf, and generouſly contribute to ſupport its worſhip and miniſtry. <q>If he loves his nation, he will build it a ſynagogue,</q> and promote it's religious intereſts to the utmoſt of his power, becauſe he knows the public happineſs, which ever lies near his heart, is neceſſarily dependent upon, and inſeperably connected with, this great and important concern.</p>
            <p>IN fine:—The prevalence of this principle would have a moſt happy influence upon the religious, the literary, civil, military, and commercial intereſts of a people. It would be one of the moſt powerful checks upon thoſe vices in particular, which ſtrike at the very being of ſociety, and directly threaten its ruin; while it animated all ranks and orders in the ſtate, to acquire and cultivate thoſe virtues, which are moſt conducive to its happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>DID the civil rulers of a people, for inſtance, thoroughly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe this generous ſpirit, how happy would the community be under their adminiſtration? This would be a ſure preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt pride and unbounded ambition: It would prevent peculation, lawleſs power, and undue ſtretch of prerogative; and be an effectual curb upon oppreſſion, tyranny and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary rule.—On the contrary, it would induce them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and conduct themſelves, as the fathers of the peoples,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009866_0018_0F7B32FB4E27DEF0"/>
—as the faithful guardians of their liberties, properties, and lives;—as raiſed, by divine providence, to their elevated ſtations, not for their own grandeur and eaſe; but for the health and happineſs of the community. In this view king David conſidered his elevation to the throne of Iſrael.—<q>He perceived that the Lord had eſtabliſhed him king over Iſrael, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Iſrael's ſake.</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">11 Sam, V.12.</note>.</p>
            <p>THIS principle would animate goſpel-miniſters to a faithful diſcharge of the important duties of their office. Love to their country would extinguiſh the hateful ſpirit of bigotry, ſuperſtition, and thirſt of dominion; and inſpire the amiable virtues of humility and meekneſs, candor, catholiciſm, and true chriſtian love. It would be a powerful ſpur to induſtry,—would make them ſtudious and laborious in their great work, diligent and zealous in propagating the benevolent principles of chriſtianity, and eſpecially careful to enforce the great duties of charity, and loyalty, the true goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patriotiſm, ſo frequently taught and ſo forcibly recommended by the precepts and example of their divine maſter.</p>
            <p>NOR would the good effects of this principle, upon ſubjects and the body of the people in general, be leſs viſible and happy. Idleneſs, prodigality, and intemperance, ſo pernicious to ſociety, would diſappear; and a ſpirit of induſtry, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality and good oeconomy take place, in proportion as patriot-virtue gained ground, Fraud and knavery in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,—a ſpirit of contention and litigation,—deceit, cheating and lying. ſmuggling and illicit trade, will vaniſh;—and truth, juſtice and equity,—good-faith, probity and honour, in all civil contracts and ſocial commerce among men, will abound and flouriſh in a patriot-ſtate,—To add no more:—Public-ſpirit will totally extirpate the malignant ſeeds of diſaffection and diſobedience to authority,—cruſh the ſpirit
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009866_0019_0F7B32FC0A19E448"/>
of ſedition and rebellion, and cultivate and cheriſh the true principles of loyalty, ſubmiſſion and peace;—virtues moſt friendly to ſociety, and eminently conducive to the public ſafety and proſperity.</p>
            <p>THUS have I attempted to exhibit a portrait of this ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ſalutary virtue, in its general nature and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.—Were the deſign executed to the life, it would command univerſsal reſpect:—Did the picture anſwer to the original, it muſt needs charm every beholder, and conciliate the eſteem and veneration of every rational intelligence.</p>
            <p>WHAT then remains, but to urge and preſs it upon all ranks and orders in the ſtate, to acquire and cultivate this generous principle?—Ever to act the influence of it themſelves, and labour to encourage and promote it in others? Thus to do, is the indiſpenſable duty of every member of ſociety, as ſuch, and what their own perſonal intereſt and ſafety demands. The relation we all ſtand in to the public, renders ſuch a conduct highly reaſonable and becoming: And as our own particular happineſs is dependent upon, and inſeperably connected with, the ſafety and proſperity of the whole; a ſuitable regard to that muſt certainly induce us to wiſh well to our country, and labour to promote its welfare by all lawful means.—Do we need examples to fire us with ambition, and urge us on this glorious purſuit? Both ſacred and proſane hiſtory abound with many ſhining inſtances of this heroic virtue, in the celebrated names of antiquity there recorded.—I have mentioned the example of the bleſſed JESUS, who was eminent for this and every other virtue.—Moſes, the illuſtrious leader of Iſrael, and Paul, the great doctor of the Gentiles, were both inſpired with this laudable principle in a very exalted degree. The Jewiſh laws-giver, nobly prefers death, to the ruin of his nation; and rather
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009866_0020_0F7B32FCD51337C8"/>
than ſurvive the public calamity, begs that his name might be blotted out of the book of GOD, the public regiſter in which the living were inrolled <note n="†" place="bottom">Exod.

But as the word, "anathema," here uſed, was the common term by which excommunication was expreſſed in the Jewiſh church, I rather think the apoſtle uſes it in that ſenſe, to denote his willingneſs of being cut off from the communion of the faithful, as above explained.</note> might it ſubſerve the beſt intereſt of his nation, and be productive of their reſtoration to the favour of God.—In what warm and pathetic ſtrains does the ſweet ſinger of Iſrael breath forth his patriot-ardor, and expreſs his cordial wiſhes for his country's good? <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal.

no leſs remarkable for love to their country, than for a firm faith in divine providence, and an unſhaken truſt and confidence in the living God.—Greatly famed alſo, for love to their country, were the celebrated republics of ancient Greece and Rome.—Their Philoſophers, poets, orators, legiſlators, heroes,—in ſhort, their very peaſants and mechanics, gloried in the name of patriots: And while this ſpirit continued to operate among them, tho' very deficient compared with true goſpel patriotiſm, they rivaled, in point of ſecular grandeur and public happineſs, the moſt celebrated nations upon earth.</p>
            <p>BUT we need not ranſack the records of antiquity, or range among the monuments of Athens, Sparta, and Rome, to find a patriot character worthy of imitation.—Britain too, can boaſt her heroes,—nay more, ſhe can glory in her patriot-kings. Not to mention her HENRIES, EDWARDS, and a WILLIAM of bleſſed memory,—the ſeveral princes of the houſe of BRUNS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WICK, who in a happy ſucceſſion of half a century, have filled and adorned the Britiſh throne, are eminently deſerving of that character.—Princes, who diſdained to lay the foundation of their greatneſs, in an undue ſtretch of prerogative, but nobly choſe to reign in the affections of their ſubjects, and eſtabliſh their dominion in the hearts of a free, a loyal, and happy people.—And behold the good effects! Never did Great-Britain enjoy ſuch a ſeries of domeſtic peace and tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as under their adminiſtration. Never was the national glory carried to ſo high a pitch, as in the laſt and preſent reign. To the generous efforts of this principle, inſpired by the great father of his ſubjects, aſſiſted by the wiſe councils of a truly patriot miniſtry, and happily diffuſed from the throne through the various orders in the ſtate, we are indebted, (under God,) for the many glorious victories and conqueſts, obtained in the late war.—Victories that will aſtoniſh poſterity:—Conqueſts that will add freſh luſtre to our hiſtory, and adorn the Britiſh annals 'till time ſhall be no more.—Victories and conqueſts,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009866_0022_0F7B32FE488B7060"/>
which have curbed the overgrown power of France, bounded the ambition of the grand-monarque, humbled the haughty pride of Spain, added a prodigious extent of territory to the Britiſh dominions, and finally terminated in a happy and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious peace.—Theſe bright examples of this generous virtue, and the happy conſequences attending the practice of it, both to the public and ourſelves, are ſo many powerful incentives to fire our ambition, to warm us with a cordial and diſintereſted love to our country, and inſpire our breaſts with true patriot zeal. Let us then lay aſide all mean, ſelfiſh and party princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and nobly aſpire to the glorious character of patriots and true friends to the public.—This is a duty incumbent upon us whatever rank in ſociety we ſuſtain.—But 'tis eminently ſo upon, rulers,—upon thoſe who are exalted to poſts of honour, and places of public truſt.—As therefore, his HONOUR'S command, has ordered me into the deſk on the preſent occaſion, this muſt be my apology, while, with all proper deference, and yet with a freedom becoming the miniſterial character, I addreſs the political fathers of my country,—the legiſlative body of this colony in general court aſſembled.</p>
            <p>WORTHY and much eſteemed ſenators:—</p>
            <p>ONE very ſtriking and inſtructive title given to rulers, in the ſacred oracles, is that of "Gods."—This, while it expreſſes the dignity of their character, ſerves to remind them of the great and important duties of their poſt. They are gods by office; and it highly concerns them to imitate the glorious fountain of power and goodneſs, in the god-like attribute of benevolence and doing good to mankind. You are exalted, by divine providence, to diſtinguiſhed honours and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant betruſtments in the ſtate.—Honours, the more ſhining and elevated, as they flow from the ſpontaneous ſuffrages of your fellow-ſubjects:—Betruſtments the more ſacred and inviolable,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009866_0023_0F7B32FF0C8A6F18"/>
as they carry in them the higheſt teſtimonies of the unſeigned reſpect and confidence of a free, grateful and loyal people.—In return for theſe marks of eſteem and affection, your people challenge your patriot care.—They expect, they juſtly expect that you <q>love your country and build it a ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue:</q>—That you tenderly regard the public happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and faithfully improve your opportunity and talents to promote its intereſt in church and ſtate. A moderate ſhare of political knowledge, under the influence of this principle, will make a man a good ruler; while the greateſt talents without it, do but render him the more dangerous to ſociety, and utterly unfit to be intruſted with the conduct of public affairs.—A ſelfiſh and contracted temper in any member of ſociety, is a great blemiſh:—But in a ruler 'tis odious,—'tis ſhocking,—I had almoſt ſaid, unpardonable. Your honours well know, that the great, the original end of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the good of ſociety; and to promote the ſafety and happineſs of the public, its grand and ultimate object. Your obligations, therefore to love your country and ſeek its beſt intereſt, are proportionable to your elevated rank in life, and hold pace with your ſuperior opportunity and advantages for theſe benevolent purpoſes. Opportunity, how precarious!—Advantages, how uncertain!—This day we behold a breach, a vacancy in your honourable board, occaſioned by the death, the juſtly lamented death of one <note n="†" place="bottom">ANDREW BURR, <abbr>eſq</abbr> of Fairfield, for many years a judge of the probates, chief juſtice of the county court, and one of members of council, in the colony. He was taken ill while attending the aſſembly at New Haven, in October laſt, and died there ſoon after the ſeſſion caded.</note>, who, for a courſe of years, had ſhared the honours of his country, and faithfully diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the truſt repoſed in him, in ſundry very important offices of government. But he is now gone!— Death, inexorable death, deal to the cries of his family,—deaf to his country's
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009866_0024_0F7B330042F7C7E8"/>
moſt ardent prayers and vows, has ſtripped him of his robes of honour, diſcharged him from the obligations therewith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, and laid him level with thoſe that hold the loweſt rank in life.—Rulers, tho' gods by office, ſcripture and experience, atteſt "muſt die like men." How alarming the admonition!—How quickening the conſideration to the utmoſt diligence and faithfulneſs in their great work!</p>
            <p>THE neceſſary qualifications of magiſtracy, and the various duties of their high ſtation, in their legiſlative, judicial and executive capacities, your honours, I preſume, are not unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. They have often been enumerated and urged upon theſe occaſions, and I need not repeat them. Suffer me, however, to mention one political evil, which, among many others, ſeems loudly to call for a ſpeedy redreſs.—I mean the great multiplicity of needleſs diſputes and contentions in the law. This colony, perhaps, above any in his majeſty's dominions, has been long famed for this litigious diſpoſition. And it is ſo far from being abated, that the number of law-ſuits, in the year paſt, is probably much greater than in any preceeding year. Whether this temper and practice be owing to the free nature of our civil conſtitution, the genius of the people, or to what other cauſe, is perhaps, difficult to ſay. Certain it is, however, that ſuch a ſpirit is ruinous, in its operation, to individuals, and highly injurious to the public happineſs. There is little doubt, but the time and money, needleſsly ſpent this way, would much more than defray all the public expences of the colony. Beſides the ill blood it tends to create, what a prodigious drain muſt this be to the government? How does "eat like a canker," prey upon the very blood and vitals of the community, and loudly threaten its ruin, unleſs ſpeedily checked? Whether increaſing the coſts of ſuit, and making it more expenſive to go to law, would have a tendency to diſcourage the practice; or whether any proper and effectual remedy can be applied in
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009866_0025_0F7B3300C202A9E8"/>
the caſe, I will not preſume to ſay. If the diſeaſe is not incurable, it loudly calls for the help of the political phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician: And, I truſt, your honours, deeply ſenſible of the great importance of it, will leave no means unattempted, to put a ſpeedy ſtop to the growing miſchief. May the father of lights, the inexhauſtible fountain of truth and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, repleniſh your minds with wiſdom, faithfulneſs, juſtice, fortitude, love to your country, and every ruling virtue. May public-ſpirit be the predominant principle of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,—ever animate your debates, and direct your councils and deliberations for the public happineſs. Under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, influence of this, you will exert your authority, in your ſeveral ſtations and departments, to reform the morals of the people under your government.—To puniſh and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the awful prevalence of immorality, profaneneſs, intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, uncleanneſs, ſabbath-breaking, neglect of public worſhip and every other vice.—And promote and encourage virtue and piety, by enacting new laws, if need be, for theſe ſalutary purpoſes, and faithfully executing thoſe that are in force. And while you ſhew yourſelves the noble patrons of chriſtian liberty, the faithful guardians of the unalienable rights of conſcience, to the ſober diſſenters among us, of every deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; we juſtly expect the continuance of your more peculiar and diſtinguiſhing regard, to the conſtituted churches of this colony, as eſtabliſhed by law. Theſe, certainly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand your patronage.—They juſtly claim the countenance, the encouragement and ſupport of a chriſtian magiſtracy, by whoſe laws they are expreſly eſtabliſhed, and under whoſe protection they ſo long flouriſhed and increaſed. Let the intereſt of learning alſo ſhare your paternal regard. This is intimately connected with the public happineſs, and the care of it properly falls within the province of the civil magiſtrate. May our college and and inferior ſchools, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009866_0026_0F7B330157B4F070"/>
conſtantly engage your attention, and ſtill be the objects of your patriot-care. And may their important intereſts more and more flouriſh under your wiſe adminiſtration. Thus will you anſwer the juſt expectations of your conſtituents, and approve yourſelves the true friends and fathers of your country. The preſent generation will riſe up and call you bleſſed,—your memories will be embalmed to poſterity, ages yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born will honour and revere your names; and what is ſtill infinitely more, if you are faithful to God and your country, you will e'er long meet the final plaudit of your ſupreme judge, and ſhare in thoſe endleſs honours and divine joys which, through Chriſt, are the promiſed rewards of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed virtue and goodneſs.</p>
            <p>I NOW turn to the ambaſſadors of Chriſt, the kind father of his people, and the great benefactor of the univerſe.—</p>
            <p>REVEREND fathers and brethren.—</p>
            <p>WE too are concerned, intimately concerned in the intereſting ſubject before us.—Next to the glory of his father, a ſpirit of diſintereſted benevolence, and the moſt generous love to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, was the governing principle in the life and actions of our divine maſter, and it ought to be ſo in his diſciples and ſervants, eſpecially the officers of his houſhold, the miniſters of his everlaſting goſpel. Our character is that of ambaſſadors of peace, and heralds of divine mercy and grace to a periſhing world.—To publiſh the glad tidings of ſalvation;—to win ſouls to Chriſt;—to beſeech ſinners, in his name, to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God;—to open up to mankind the unſearchable riches of divine grace, and explain and enforce the whole ſcheme of goſpel-duties and chriſtian morals:—Thus to ſubſerve the beſt intereſt of ſociety, and promote the eternal happineſs of our fellow-men, is the great end of our office,—the honourable, the important buſineſs in which we are employed. We are
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009866_0027_0F7B330206AD1B40"/>
placed as centinels upon the walls of Zion, to guard againſt ſin, the worſt enemy of our country, and ſound the alarm in God's holy mountain. <q>We watch for ſouls, as they that muſt give account,</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. XIII.17.</note> and woe be to us if we are unfaithful. <q>For, as they who turn many to righteouſneſs, will ſhine</q> with diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed luſtre in the kingdom of glory; ſo they who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful in the chriſtian miniſtry, and do the work of the Lord deceitfully; contract aggravated guilt, and expoſe themſelves to a moſt awful and intolerable doom. But next to <q>the love of God ſhed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt;</q> a principle of true patriotiſm and public-ſpirit, a ſincere regard to the beſt good of ſociety and a generous, diſintereſted bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence to mankind, will be found the moſt animating ſpring to induſtry, the nobleſt incentive to diligence and faithfulneſs in our great work. The goſpel we preach, is a ſyſtem of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence and love, and all its doctrines and precepts promotive of ſocial happineſs. This virtue of patriotiſm, therefore, ſo congenial to our profeſſion, and ſo peculiarly ornamental and becoming the ſacred character, it highly concerns us to acquire and cultivate;—ever to act under the influence of it ourſelves, and, both by example and precept, labour to recommened it to others. <q>While, therefore, we ſtudy to ſhew ourſelves approved, unto God, workmen that need not be aſhamed, rightly divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word of truth:</q> 
               <note n="§" place="bottom">II Tim, II.15.</note> Let us, together with the great goſpel-doctrines of <q>repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts XX.21.</note> faithfully inculcate the relative duties of chriſtianity, and urge upon our hearers the important virtues of truth, juſtice, ſobriety, charity, peace, loyalty and obedience, ſo peculiarly ornamental to the chriſtian charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo eminently ſubſervient to the public tranquility and happineſs. In a word:—Let us ſee to it that the genuine principles of the goſpel rule and govern in our hearts. This will make us faithful to our great maſter,—faithful to the beſt
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009866_0028_0F7B3304D3809590"/>
intereſt of our people,—generous friends to our country, and warmly ſolicitous to promote its welfare and happineſs.</p>
            <p>To conclude:—As public-ſpirit and love to our country is univerſally incumbent on every member of ſociety, let all ranks and orders of men from the higheſt to the loweſt, be ambitious of this amiable character, and cordially unite their endeavours to promote the public happineſs. If we conſider, my brethren, the very happy conſtitution we are under, both civil and eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical.—the mild and gentle form of our government, both in church and ſtate, and the peculiar and diſtinguiſhing privileges of a public nature we in this colony enjoy: As no people under heaven, have more reaſon to be ſatisfied and pleaſed with their ſituation; ſo none can poſſibly be under ſtronger obligations to maintain public-ſpirit, and love to their country than we. We are not inthralled by lawleſs tyranny, or oppreſſed with the galling yoke of deſpotic and arbitrary rule. We have no temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to wiſh for the wings of a dove, that we might quit our country, and fly away to ſome lonely deſert and be at reſt. To Gallic ſlavery, to Romiſh perſecution and ſpiritual bondage, (bleſſed be God,) we are utter ſtrangers. Still we taſte the dear, the delightful ſweets of liberty, in the free and unreſtrained choice of our own rulers, as the return of this joyful anniverſary, once more happily atteſts. For a long time we have ſat under the ſweet and refreſhing ſhade of the mantling vine. Let us not then, by our ſins and licentious conduct, provoke almighty God, "by whom kings reign," to ſtrip us of our dear privileges, and teach us, too late, the value of them, <q>by the briars and thorns of the wilderneſs.</q> On the contrary:—let each one, deeply ſenſible of the worth of theſe ineſtimable privileges, ſee to it that they teſtify a proper regard for them, by a faithful, thankful and religious improvement of them. This will be the moſt likely means, under divine providence, of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance and perpetuation. Let us all do our faithful endeavour
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009866_0029_0F7B3305700FAA48"/>
to reform thoſe vices in ourſelves, which are inimical to ſociety, and deſtructive of public happineſs, and then uſe our influence in our ſeveral ſtations, to promote a general reformation. To do this our gracious ſovereign, the father of his people, has earne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>y exhorted us from the throne. His royal proclamation, <note n="*" place="bottom">Proclamation for the reformation of manners, publiſhed by his preſent Majeſty in the firſt year of his reign.</note> ſeconded by the chief authority of the colony, calls upon all ranks and orders in the ſtate, to unite their endeavours, and engage, heart and hand, in this truly laudable deſign. And how guilty, how inexcuſable will thoſe in ſubordinate authority,—will miniſters of the goſpel, and, in ſhort, all the ſubjects be, if we neglect to concur with this pious intention of our rulers, and refuſe to engage in the ſalutary work? How ſhall we anſwer it to God or our own conſciences, to the preſent age or poſterity, if, by our criminal neglect or abuſe of theſe rich bleſſings, we make a forfeiture of them to God and the king? To prevent this, let all be exhorted to "put on charity" which is the great band of ſociety, and ſpring of public-happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Let love to God, love to our country, and love to all mankind, ever reign in our hearts, and direct and govern all our actions. In particular, let us, above all things, be ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to obtain the ſaving bleſſings of the goſpel of Chriſt, and have the various graces and virtues of the chriſtian character inwrought in our hearts and regulating our lives.—<q>That ſo ſpeaking the truth in love, we may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Chriſt: From whom the whole body, fitly joined together, and compacted, by that which every joint ſupplieth, according to the effectual work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the meaſure of every part, maketh increaſe of the body unto the edifying of itſelf in love.</q>
