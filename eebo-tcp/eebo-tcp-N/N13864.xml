            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT has long been desired by the friends of Mr. Edwards, that a number of his manuscripts should be published; but the disadvantage under which all posthumous publications must necessarily appear, and the difficulty of getting any considerable work printed in this infant country, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto have proved sufficient obstacles to the execution of such a proposal. The first of these obstacles made me doubt, for a considerable time after these manuscripts came into my hands, whether I could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistently with that regard which I owe to the honor of so worthy a parent, suffer any of them to appear in the world. However being diffident of my own sentiments, and doubtful whether I were not over-jealous in this matter, I determined to submit to the opinion of gentlemen, who are friends both to the character of Mr. Edwards and to the cause of truth. The consequence was, that they gave their advice for publishing them.</p>
            <p>The other obstacle was removed by a gentleman in the church of Scotland, who was formerly a correspondent of Mr. Edwards. He engaged a bookseller to undertake the work, and also signified his desire that these following d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> be made public.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:017525_0003_0FA12B93AFBFB1A0"/>Mr. Edwards had planned a body of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, in a new method, and in the form of a history; in whch he was first to show, how the most remarkable events, in all ages from the fall to the present times, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in sacred and profane history, were adapted to promote the work of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and then to trace, by the light of scripture-prophecy, how the same work should be yet further carried on even to the end of the world. His heart was so much set on executing this plan, that he was considerably averse to accept the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidentship of Prince-town college, lest the duties of that office should put it out of his power.</p>
            <p>The out lines of that work are now offered to the public, as contained in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of sermons, preached at Northampton in 1739 <note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note>, without any view to publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. On that account, the reader cannot reasonably expect all that from them, which he might justly have expected, had they been written with such a view, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Authors own hand for the press.</p>
            <p>As to elegance of composition, which is now esteemed so essential to all publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is well known, that the author did not make that his chief study. However,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:017525_0004_0FA12B9474082120"/>
his other writings, though destitute of the ornaments of fine language, have it seems that solid merit, which has procured both to themselves and to him a considerable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in the world, and with many an high esteem. It is hoped that the reader will find in these discourses many traces of plain good sense, sound reasoning, and thorough knowledge of the sacred oracles, and real unfeigned piety: and that, as the plan is new, and many of the sentiments uncommon, they may afford entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and improvement to the ingenious, the inquisitive, and the pious reader; may confirm their faith in God's government of the world, in our holy Christian religion in general, and in many of its peculiar doctrines; may assist in studying with greater pleasure and advantage the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical and prophetical books of scripture; and may excite to a conversation become<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gospel.</p>
            <p>That this volume may produce these happy effects in all who shall peruse it, is the hearty desire and prayer of</p>

            <p>THEY who have a relish for the study of the scriptures, and have access to peruse the following sheets, will, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded, deem themselves much indebted to the Reverend Mr. Edwards of Newhaven for consenting to publish them. Though the acute philosopher and deep divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in them, yet they are in the general better calculated for the instruction and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of ordinary Christians, than those of President Edward's writings, where the abstruse nature of the subject, or the subtle objections of opposers of the truth, led him to more abstract and metaphysical reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The manuscript being intrusted to my care, I have not presumed to make any change in the sentiments or composition. I have, however, taken the liberty to reduce it from the form of sermons, which it ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally bore, to that of a continued trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise; and I have so altered and diversified the marks of the several divisions and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisions, that each class of heads might be easily distinguished.</p>

            <p>THE design of this chapter is to comfort the church under her sufferings, and the persecutions of her enemies; and the argument of consolation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on is, the constancy and perpetuity of God's mercy and faithfulness towards her, which shall be manifest in continuing to work salvation for her, protecting her against all assaults of her ene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>In the text, this happiness of the church of God is set forth by comparing it with the contrary fate of her enemies that oppress her. And therein we may observe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. How short lived the power and prosperity of the church's enemies are: <hi>The moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool</hi>; i. e. however great their pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and however great their present glory, they shall by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees consume and vanish away by a secret curse of God, till they come to nothing; and all their power and glory, and so their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, eternally cease, and they be finally and irrecoverably ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined,

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The contrary hap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y lot and portion of God's church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in these words, <hi>My righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.</hi> Who are meant as those that shall have the benefit of this, we also learn by the preceding verse, viz. They <hi>that know righteousness, and the people in whose heart is God's law</hi>; or, in one word, the church of God. And concerning this happiness of theirs here spoken of, we may observe two things, viz. 1. Wherein it consists; 2. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) Wherein it consists, viz. In God's righteousness and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation toward them. By God's righteousness here, is meant his faithfulness in fulfilling his covenant promises to his church, or his faithfulness towards his church and people in bestowing the benefits, of the covenant of grace upon them; which benefits though they are bestowed of free and sovereign grace, as being altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserved; yet as God has been pleased, by the promises of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, to bind himself to bestow them, so they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed in the exercise of God's righteousness or justice. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the apostle says, Heb. vi.10. <hi>God is not unrighteous, to forget your work and labour of love.</hi> And so, 1. John i.9. <hi>If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> confess our sins, he is faithful, and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all our unrighteousness.</hi> So the word <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> is very often used in scripture for God's covenant-faithfulness so it is used in Nehem. ix.8. <hi>Thou hast performed thy words, for thou art righteous.</hi> So we are often to understand righteousness and covenant-mercy for the same thing; as Psal. xxiv.5. <hi>He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.</hi> Psal. xxxvi.10 <hi>Continue thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to them that know thee, and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.</hi> And Psal. li.14. <hi>Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.</hi> Dan. ix.16. <hi>O Lord, according to thy righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away.</hi>— And so in innumerable other places.</p>
            <p>The other word here used is <hi>salvation.</hi> Of these two, God's righteousness and his salvation, the one is the cause, of which the other is the effect. God's righteousness, or covenant-mercy,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017525_0011_0FA12B9A74DF1C48"/>
is the root of which his salvation is the faith. Both of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the covenant of grace. The one is God's covenant-mercy and faithfulness, the other intends that work of God by which this covenant-mercy is accomplished in the fruits of it. For salvation is the sum of all those works of God by which the benefits that are by the covenant of grace are procured and bestowed.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) We may observe its continuance, signified here by two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions; <hi>for ever,</hi> and <hi>from generation to generation.</hi> The latter seems to be explanatory of the former. The phrase <hi>for ever,</hi> is variously used in scripture. Sometimes hereby is meant as long as a man lives. So it is said, the servant that has his ear bored through with an awl to the door of his master, shall be his <hi>for ever.</hi> Sometimes thereby is meant during the continuance of the Jewish state. So of many of the ceremonial and Levitical laws it is said that they should be statues <hi>for ever.</hi> Sometimes it means as long as the world shall stand, or to the end of the generations of men. So it is said, Eccles. i.4. "One generation passeth away and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother cometh; but the earth abideth <hi>forever.</hi>" Sometimes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is meant to all eternity. So it is said, "God is blessed <hi>for ever,</hi>" Rom. i 15. And so it is said, John vi, 51. "If any man eat of this bread, he shall live <hi>for ever.</hi>"—Which of these senses is here to be understood, the next words determine, viz. to the end of the world, or to the end of the generations of men. It is said in the next words, "and my salvation <hi>from generation to generation.</hi>" Indeed the fruits of God's salvation shall remain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the end of the world, as appears by the 6th verse: "Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner, <hi>but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.</hi>" But the work of salvation itself towards the church shall continue to be wrought till then: till the end of the world, God will go on to accomplish deliverance and salvation for the church, from all her enemies; for that is what the prophet is here speaking of; till the end of the world; till her enemies cease to be, as to any power to molest the church. This expression, <hi>from generation to generation</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may determine us as to the time which God continues to carry on the work of salvation for his church, both with respect to the beginning and end. It is from generation to generation, <hi>i. e.</hi> throughout all generations; beginni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

DOCTRINE. The work of redemption is a work that God car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on from the fall of man to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>The generations of mankind on the earth did not begin till after the fall. The beginning of the posterity of our first parents was after the fall; for all their posterity, by ordinary generation, are partakers of the fall, and of the corruption of nature tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> followed from it; and these generations, by which the human race i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated, <hi>shall</hi> continue to the end of the world: so these two are the limits of the generations of men on the earth; the fall of man, the beginning; and of the end of the world, or the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the end. The same are the limits of the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption as to those progressive works of God, by which that redemption is brought about and accomplished, tho' not as to the fruits of it; for they, as was said before, <hi>shall</hi> be to all eternity.</p>
            <p>The work of redemption and the work of salvation are the same thing. What is sometimes in scripture c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lled God's saving his people, is in other places called his redeeming them. So Christ is called both the Saviour and the Redeemer of his people.</p>
            <p>BEFORE entering on the proposed History of the Work of Redemption, I <hi>would,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Explain the terms made use of in the doctrine,—and,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Show what those things are that are designed to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished by this great work of God.</p>
            <p>First, I <hi>would</hi> show in what sense the terms of the doctrine are used.—<hi>And,</hi> 1. I would show how I would be understood when I use the word <hi>redemption;—and,</hi> 2. how I <hi>would</hi> be understood when I say, this work is a work of God carried on from the fall of man to the end of the world.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I would show how I would be understood when I use the word <hi>redemption.</hi>—Here it may be observed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is sometimes understood in a mere limited sense, for the purchase of salvation; for so the word strictly signifies, a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of deliverance; and if we take the word in this restrained sense, the work of redemption was not so long in doing. But it was begun and finished with Christ's humilation. It was all wrought while Christ was upon earth. It was begun with Christ's incarnation, <hi>and</hi> carried on thro' Christ's life, and finished with his death, or the time of his remaining under the power of death, which ended in his resurrection: and so we say, that the day of Christ's resurrection is the day when Christ finished the work of redemption,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017525_0013_0FA12B9BF4C9A430"/>
               <hi>i e</hi> then the purchase was finished, and the work itself, and all that appertained to it, was <hi>virtually</hi> done and finished, but not <hi>actually.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then sometimes the work of redemption is taken more largely, including all that God works or accomplishes tending to this end; not only the purchasing the redemption, but also all God's works that were properly preparatory to the purchase, or as applying the purchase and accomplishing the success of it: so that the whole dispensation, as it includes the preparation, and the purchase, and the application and success of Christ's redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is here called the work of <hi>redemption.</hi> All that Christ does in this great aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ir as mediator, in any of his offices, either of prophet, priest, or king; either when he was in this world, in his human nature, or before or since; and not only what Christ the mediator has done, but also what the Father and the Holy Ghost, <hi>have</hi> done, as united or confederated in this design of redeeming sinful men; or, in one word, all that is wrought in execution of the eternal covenant of redemption; this is what I call the work of redemption in the doctrine; for it is all but one work, one design. The various dispensations or works that belong to it, are but the several parts of one scheme. It is but one design that is formed to which all the offices of Christ do directly tend, and in which all the persons of the Trinity do conspire, and all the various dispensations that belong to it are united; and the several wheels are one m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>chine, to answer one end, and produce one effect.</p>
            <p n="2">II. When I say, this work is carried on from the fall of man to the end of the world; in order to the full understanding of my meaning in it, I would desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e two or three things to be observed.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That it is not meant, that nothi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g was done in order to it before the fall of man. There were many things done in order to this work of redemption before that. Some things were done before the world was created, yea from all eternity. The persons of the Trinity were as it were confederated in a design and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of redemption; in which covenant the Father had appointed the Son, and the Son had undertaken the work; and all things to be accomplished in the work were stipulated and agreed. Besides these, there were things done at the creation of the world, in order to that wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k, before man fell; for the world itself seems to have been created in order to it. The work of creation was in order to God's works of providence: So that if it be enquired, which of these kinds of works is the greatest, the works of creation or the works of providence? I answer, the works of providence; because God's works of providence are the end of his works of creation, as <hi>the building an house,</hi> or <hi>the forming an engine or machine,</hi> is for its use. But God's main work of providence
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017525_0014_0FA12B9CACE7D598"/>
is this great work of God that the doctrine speaks of, as may more fully appear hereafter.</p>
            <p>The creation of heaven was in order to the work of redemption: it was to be an habitation for the redeemed: Matth. xxv.34. "Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." Even the angels were created to be employed in this work. Therefore the apostle calls them, "<hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring spirits,</hi> sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation," Heb. i.14. As to this lower world, it was doubtless created to be a stage upon which this great and wonderful work of redemption should be transacted: and therefore, as might be shown, in many respects this lower world is wisely fitted, in the formation, for such a state of man as he is in since the fall, under a possibility of redemption; so that when it is said, that the work of redemption is carried on from the fall of man to the end of the world, it is not meant, that all that ever was done in order to redemption has been done since the fall. Nor,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is it meant that there will be no remaining fruits of this work after the end of the world. The greatest fruits of all will be after that. That glory and blessedness that will be the sum of all the fruits, will remain to all the saints after that. That work of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not an eternal work, <hi>i. e.</hi> it is not a work always a doing and never accomplished. But the fruits of this work are eternal fruits. The work has an issue. But in the issue the end will be obtained; which end will never have an end. As those things that were in order to this work before the beginning of the world, as God's electing love, and the covenant of redemption, never had a beginning; so the fruits of this work, that shall be after the end of the world, never will have an end. therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. When it is said in the doctrine, that this is a work that God is carrying on from the fall of man to the end of the world, what I mean is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that those things that belong to this work itself, and are parts of this scheme, are all this while accomplishing. There are things that are in order to it that are before the beginning of it, and fruits of it that are after it is finished. But the work itself is so long a doing, even from the fall of man to the end of the world, it is all this while a carrying on. It was begun immediately upon the fall and will continue to the end of the world, and then will be finished. The various dispensations of God that are in this space, do belong to the same work, and to the same design, and have all one issue; and therefore are all to be reckoned but as several parts of one work, as it were several successive motions of one machine, to bring about in the conclusion one great event.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:017525_0015_0FA12B9D75B30260"/>Here also we must distinguish between the parts of redemption itself, and the parts of the work by which that redemption is wrought out. There is a difference between the parts of the benefits procured and bestowed, and the parts of the work of God by <hi>which</hi> those benefits were procured and bestowed. As, for example, there is a difference between the parts of the benefit that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel received, consisting in their redemption out of Egypt, and the parts of that work of God by which this was wrought. The redemption of the children of Israel out of Egypt, considered as the benefit which they enjoyed, consisted of two parts, viz. their deliverence from their former Egyptian bondage and misery, and their being brought into a more happy state, as the servants of God, and heirs of Canaan. But there are many more things which are parts of that work of God which is called his work of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Israel out of Egypt. To this <hi>belongs</hi> his calling of Moses, his sending him to Pharaoh, and all the signs and wonders he wrought in Egypt, and his bringing such terrible judgements on the Egyptians, and many other things.</p>
            <p>It is this work by which God effects redemption that we are speaking of. This work is carried on from the fall of man to the end of the world; and it is so in two respects.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) With respect to the effect wrought on the souls of the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which is common to all ages from the fall of man to the end of the world. This effect that I here speak of, is the application <hi>with respect</hi> to the souls of particular persons, in converting, justifying, sanctifying, and glorifying them. By these things the souls of particular persons are actually redeemed, and do receive the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the work of redemption in its effect in their souls. And in this sense the work of redemption is carried on in all ages of the world, from the fall of man to the end of the world. The work of God in converting so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ls opening blind eyes, unstopping deaf ears, raising dead souls to life, and rescueing the miserable capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated souls out of the hands of Satan, was begun soon after the fall of man, has been carried on in the world ever since to this day and will be to the end of the world. God has always, ever since the first erecting of the church of the redeemed after the fall, had such a church in the world. Though <hi>oftentimes</hi> is has been reduced to a very narrow compass, and to low circumstances; yet it has never wholly failed.</p>
            <p>As God carries on the work of converting the souls of fallen men through all these ages, so he goe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> out all their sins, and to accept them as righteous in his fight, through the righteousness of Christ, and adopt and receive them from being the children of Satan, to be his own children; so also
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017525_0016_0FA12B9E31889A60"/>
he goes on to sanctify, or to carry on the work of his grace, which he has begun in them, and to comfort them with the consolations of his Spirit, and to glorify them, to bestow upon them, when their bodies die, that eternal glory which is the fruit of the purch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ase of Christ. What is said, Rom. viii.30. "Whom he did predestinate, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified:" I say this is applicable to all ages, from the fall, to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>The way that the work of redemption, with respect to these effects of it on the souls of the redeemed, is carried on from the fall to the end of the world, is by repeating and continually work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same work over again, though in different persons, from age to age. But,</p>
            <p n="2">(2) The work of redemption with respect to the grand design in general, as it respects the universal subject and end, is carried on from the fall of man to the end of the world in a different manner, not merely by repeating or renewing the same effect in the different subjects of it, but by many successive works and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations of God, all tending to one great end and effect, all united as the several parts of a scheme, and all together making up one great work. Like an house or temple that is building; first, the workmen are sent forth, then the materials are gathered, then the ground fitted, then the foundation is laid, then the super-structure is erected, one part after another, till at length the top-stone is laid, and all is finished. Now the work of redemption in that large sense that has been explained, may be compared to such a building, that is carrying on from the fall of man to the end of the world. God went about it immediately after the fall of man. Some things were done towards it immediately, as may be shown hereafter; and so God has proceeded, as it were, getting materials and building, ever since; and so will proceed to the end of the world; and then the time will come when the top-stone shall be brought forth, and all appear complete and consummate. The glorious structure will then stand forth in its proper perfection.</p>
            <p>This work in the former respect that has been mentioned, viz. as to the effect on the souls of particular persons that are redeemed, by its being an effect that is common to all ages. The work in this latter respect, viz. as it respects the church of God, and the grand design in general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>is carried on,</hi> not only by that which is common to all ages, but by successive works wrought in different ages, all parts of one whole, or one great scheme, whereby one work is brought about by various steps, one step in one age, and another in another. It is this carrying on of the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017525_0017_0FA12B9EED3614D8"/>
work of redemption that I shall chiefly insist upon, though not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the former; for one necessarily supposes the other.</p>
            <p>Having thus explained what I mean by the terms of the doctrine: that you may the more clearly see how the great design and work of redemption is carried on from the fall of man to the end of the world; I say, in order to this,</p>
            <p>I now proceed, in the second place, to show what is the des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gn of this great work, or what things are designed to be done by it. In order to see how a design is carried on, we must first know what the design is. To know how a workman proceeds, and to understand the various steps he takes in order to accomplish a piece of work, we need to be informed what he is about, or what the thing is that he intends to accomplish; otherwise we may stand by, and see him do one thing after another, and be quite puzzled and in the dark, seeing nothing of his scheme, and understanding nothing of what he means by i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. If an architect, with a great number of hands, were a building some great palace, and one that was a stranger to such things should stand by, and see some men digging in the earth, others bringing timber, others hewing stones, and the like, he might see that there was a great deal done; but if he knew not the design, it would all appear to him confusion. Therefore, that the great works and dispensations of God that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this great affair of redemption may not appear like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion to you, I would set before you briefly the main things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to be accomplished in this great work, to accomplish which God began to work presently after the fall of man, and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue working to the end of the world, when the whole work <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ill appear completely finished. The main things designed to be done by it are these that follow.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It is to put all God's enemies under his feet, and that the goodness of God should finally appear triumphing over all evil. Soon after the world was created, evil entered into the world in the fall of the angels and man. Presently after God had made ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creatures, <hi>there were</hi> enemies <hi>who</hi> rose up against him from among them; and in the fall of man evil entered into this lower world, and God's enemies rose up against him here. Satan rose up against God, endeavouring to frustrate his design in the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this lower world, and to destroy his workmanship here, and to wrest the government of this lower world out of his hands, and usurp the throne himself, and set up himself as god of this world instead of the God that made it. To these ends he introduced sin into the world; and having made man God's enemy, he brought guilt on man, and brought death and the most extreme and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful misery into the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:017525_0018_0FA12B9FAE85BAA0"/>Now one great design of God in the affair of redemption was, to reduce and subdue those enemies of God, till they should all be put under God's feet: 1 Cor. xv.25. "He must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet." Things were originally so planned and designed, that he might disappoint and confound, and triumph over Satan, and that he might be bruised under Christ's feet, Gen iii.15. The promise was given, that the feed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head. It was a part of God's original design in this work, to destroy the works of the devil, and confound him in all his purposes: 1 John iii 8. "For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil." It was a part of his design, to triumph over sin, and over the corruptions of men, and to root them out of the hearts of his people, by conforming them to himself. He designed also, that his grace should triumph over man's guilt, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite demerit that there is in sin. Again, it was a part of his design, to triumph over death; and however this is the last enemy that shall be destroyed, yet that shall finally be vanquished and destroyed.</p>
            <p>God thus appears gloriously above all evil; and triumphing over all his enemies, was one great thing that God intended by the work of redemption; and the work by which this was to be done, God immediately went about as soon as man fell; and so goes on till he fully accomplishes it in the end of the world.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In doing this, God's design was perfectly to restore all the ruins of the fall, so far as concerns the elect part of the world, by his Son; and therefore we read of the <hi>restitution of all things,</hi> Acts iii.21. "Whom the heaven must receive, untill the times of the <hi>restitution of all things</hi>;" and of the <hi>times of refreshing</hi> from the presence of the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> Acts iii.19. "Repent ye therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the <hi>times of refreshing</hi> shall come from the presence of the Lord."</p>
            <p>Man's soul was ruined by the fall; the image of God was ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; man's nature was corrupted and destroyed, and man became dead in sin. The design of God was, to restore the soul of man; to restore life to it, and the image of God, in conversion, and to carry on the restoration in sanctification, and to perfect it in glory. Man's body was ruined; by the fall it became subject to death. The design of God was, to restore it from this ruin, and not only to deliver it from death in the resurrection, but to deliver it from mortality itself, in making it like unto Christ's glorious body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The world was ruined, as to man, as effectually as if it had been reduced to <hi>chaos</hi> again; all heaven and earth were overthrown. But the design of God was, to restore all, and as it were to create a new heaven and a new earth: Is. lxv.17. "Behold, I creat
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017525_0019_0FA12BA080E41A88"/>
new heavens, and a new earth; and the former shall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor come into mind." 2 Pet. iii.13. "Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens, a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."</p>
            <p>The work by which this was to be done, was begun immediately after the fall, and so is carried on till all is finished at the end, when the whole world, heaven and earth, shall be restored; and there shall be, as it were, new heavens, and a new earth, in a spiritual sense, at the end of the world. Thus it is represented, Rev. xxi.1. "And I saw a new heaven, and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away."</p>
            <p n="3">III. Another great design of God in the work of redemption, was to gather together in one all things in Christ, in heaven and in earth, <hi>i. e.</hi> all elect creatures; to bring all elect creatures, in heaven and in earth, to an union one to another in one body, under one head, and to unite all together in one body to God the Father. This was begun soon after the fall, and is carried on through all ages of the world, and finished at the end of the world.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. God designed by this work to perfect and complete the glory of all the elect by Christ. It was a design of God to advance the elect to an exceeding pitch of glory, "such as the eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor has ever entered into the heart of man." He intended to bring them to perfect excellency and beauty in his image, and in holiness, which is the proper beauty of spiritual beings; and to advance them to a glorious degree of honor, and also to an ineffable pitch of pleasure and joy; and thus to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the whole church of elect men in soul and body, and with them to bring the glory of the elect angels to its highest pitch under one head. The work which tends to this, God began immediately after the fall, and carries on through all ages, and will have perfected at the end of the world.</p>
            <p n="5">V. In all this God designed to accomplish the glory of the blessed Trinity in an exceeding degree. God had a design of glorifying himself from eternity; to glorify each person in the Godhead. The end must be considered as first in order of nature, and then the means; and therefore we must conceive, that God having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed this end, had then as it were the means to chuse; and the principal mean that he pitched upon was this great work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that we are speaking of. It was his design in this work to glorify his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ; and it was his design, by the Son to glorify the Father: John xiii.31.32. "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God be glorified in him, God also shall glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him." It was his design that the Son should
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017525_0020_0FA12BA12EA9D4D0"/>
be glorified, and should glorify the Father by what should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished by the Spirit to the glory of the Spirit, that the whole Trinity, conjunctly, and each person singly, might be exceedingly glorified. The work that was the appointed means of this, was begun immediately after the fall, and is carried on till, and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nished at, the end of the world, when all this intended glory shall be fully accomplished in all things.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus explained the terms made use of in the doctrine, and shown what the things are which are to be accomplished by this great work of God, I proceed now to the proposed History; that is, to show, how what was designed by the work of redemption has been accomplished, in the various steps of this work, from the fall of man to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>In order to this, I would divide this whole space of time into three periods:—the</p>
            <p n="1">1st, reaching from the fall of man to the incarnation of Christ; —the</p>
            <p n="2">2d, from Christ's incarnation till his resurrection; or the whole time of Christ's humiliation;—the</p>
            <p n="3">3d, from thence to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>It may be some may be ready to think this a very unequal division: and it is so indeed in fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> respects. It is so, because the second period is so much the greatest: for although it be so much shorter than either of the other, being but between thirty and forty years, whereas both the other contain thousands; yet in this affair that we are now upon, it is more than both the others.—I would therefore proceed to show distinctly how the work of redemption is carried on from the fall of man to the end of the world, through each of these periods in their order; which I would do under three propositions; one concerning each period.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That from the fall of man till the incarnation of Christ, God was doing those things that were preparatory to Christ's coming, and working out redemption, &amp; were forerunners and earnests of it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That the time from Christ's incarnation, till his resurrection, was spent in procuring and purchasing redemption.</p>
            <p n="3">III That the space of time from the resurrection of Christ to the end of the world, is all taken up in bringing about or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing the great effect or success of that purchase.</p>
            <p>In a particular consideration of these three propositions, the great truth taught in the doctrine may perhaps appear in a clear light, and we may see how the work of redemption is carried on from the fall of man to the end of the world.</p>
            <div n="1" type="period">

               <head>PERIOD I. From the Fall to the Incarnation.</head>
               <p>MY first task is, to show how the work of redemption is carried on <hi>from the fall of man to the incarnation of Christ,</hi> under the <hi>first prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               <p>That the space of time from the fall of man to the incarnation of Christ, was taken up in doing those things that were forerunners and earnests of Christ's coming, and working out redemption, and were preparatory to it.</p>
               <p>The great wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ks of God in the world during this whole space of time, were all preparatory to this. There were many great changes and revolutions in the world, and they were all only the turning of of the wheels of providence in order to this, to make way for the coming of Christ, and what he was to do in the world. They all pointed hither, and all issued here. Hither tended especially all God's great works towa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds his church. The church was under va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious dispensations of providence, and in very various circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, before Christ came. But all these dispensations were to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way for his coming. God wrought salvation for the souls of men through all that space of time, though the number was very small to what it was afterwards; and all this salvation was, as it were, by way of anticipation. All the souls that were saved before Christ came, were only as it were the earnests of the future harvest.</p>
               <p>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me. These salvations were all but so many images and forerunners of the great salvation Christ was to work out when he should come. God revealed himself of old, from time to time, from the fall of man to the coming of Christ. The church during that space of time enjoyed the light of divine revelation, or God's word. They had in a degree the light of the gospel. But all these revelations were only so many forerunners and earnests of the great light that he should bring who came to be the light of the world That whole space of time was as it were the time of night, wherein the church of God was not indeed whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without light: but it was like the light of the moon and stars that we have in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight; a dim light in comparison of the light of the sun, and mixed with a great deal of darkness. It had no glory, by reason of the glory that excelleth, 2 Cor. iii.10. The church had indeed the light of the sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it was only as reflected from the moon and stars. The church all that while was a minor. This the apostle evidently teaches in Gal. iv.1.2.3. "Now I say, that the heir as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; but is under tutors and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, until the time appointed of the father. Even so we, when we
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017525_0022_0FA12BA3E9EC4108"/>
were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world."</p>
               <p>But here, for the greater clearness and distinctness, I would subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide this period from the fall of man to the coming of Christ into six lesser periods, or parts:—The

                     <item>1st, extending from the fall to the flood;—the</item>
                     <item>2d, from thence to the calling of Abraham;—the</item>

               <div n="1" type="part">
                  <head>PART I. From the fall to the flood.</head>
                  <p>THIS was a period farthest of all distant from Christ's incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; yet then this great work was begun to be carried on; then was this glorious building begun, that will not be finished till the end of the world, as I would now show you how. To this purpose I would observe,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. As soon as ever man fell, Christ entered on his mediatorial work. Then it was that Christ first took on him the work and office of a mediator. He had undertaken it before the world was made. He stood engaged with the Father to appear as man's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and to take on that office when there should be occasion, from all eternity. But now the time was come. When man fell, then the occasion came; and then Christ immediately, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delay, entered on his work, and took on him that office that he had stood engaged to take on him from eternity. As soon as ever man fell, Christ the eternal Son of God clothed himself with the mediatorial character, and therein presented himself before the Father. He immediately stepped in between an holy, infinite, offended Majesty, and offending mankind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was accepted in his interposition; and so wrath was prevented from going forth in the full execution of that amazing curse that man had brought on himself.</p>
                  <p>It is manifest that Christ began to exercise the office of mediator between God and man as soon as ever man fell, because mercy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be exercised towards man immediately. There was mercy in the forbearance of God, that he did not destroy him, as he did the angels when they fell. But there is no mercy exercised to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fallen man but through a mediator. If God had not in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy restrained Satan, he would immediately have seized on his pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y. Christ began to do the part of an intercessor for man as soon as he fell. There is no mercy exercised towards man but what is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained through Christ's intercession: so that now Christ was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on his work that he was to continue in throughout all ages
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017525_0023_0FA12BA449C23EC8"/>
of the world. From that day forward Christ took on him the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e of the church of the elect: he took on him the care of fallen man in the exercise of all his offices; he undertook thenceforward to teach mankind in the exercise of his prophetical office; and also to intercede for fallen man in his priestly office; and he took on him, as it were, the care and burden of the government of the church, and of the world of mankind, from this day forward. He from that time took upon him the care of the defence of his elect church from all their enemies. When Satan, the grand ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, had conquered and overthrown man, the business of refining and conquering him was committed to Christ. He thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward undertook to manage that subtle powerful adversary. He was then appointed the Captain of the Lord's hosts, and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of their salvation, and always acted as such thenceforward: and so he appeared from time to time, and he will continue to act as such to the end of the world. Henceforward this lower world, with all its concerns, was, as it were, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>volved upon the Son of God; for when man had sinned, God the Father would have no more to do with man immediately; he would no more have any immediate concern with this world of mankind, that had apostatized from and rebelled against him. He would hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward have no concern with man, but only through a mediator, either in teaching men, or in governing or bestowing any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits on them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, when we read in sacred history what God did from time to time towards his church and people, and what he said to them, and how he revealed himself to them, we are to understand it especially of the second person of the Trinity. When we read of God's appearing after the fall, from time to time, in some visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble form or outward symbol of his presence, we are ordinarily, if not universally, to understand it especially of the second person of the Trinity; which may be argued from John i.18. "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him." He is therefore call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed "the image of the invisible God," Col. i.15.; intimating, that though God the Father be invisible, yet Christ is his image or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Yea not only was this lower world devolved on Christ, that he might have the care and government of it, and order it agreeably to his design of redemption, but also in some respect the whole u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse. The angels from that time were committed to him, to be subject to him in his mediatorial office, to be ministring spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to him in this affair; and accordingly were so from this time forward, as is manifest by the scripture-history, wherein we have
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017525_0024_0FA12BA4EF06A688"/>
accounts from time to time of their acting as ministring spirits in the affairs of the church of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we may suppose, that immediately on the fall of man, it was made known in heaven among the angels, that God had a design of redemption with respect to fallen man, and that Christ had now taken upon him the office and work of a mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man, that they might know their business hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which was to be subservient to Christ in this office. As Christ, in this office, has since that, as God-man, Mediator, been solemnly exalted and enstalled the King of heaven, and is thenceforward as God-man, Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it; for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof;" so this revelation that was made in heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the angels, of Christ's now having taken on him the office of a mediator between God and man, was as it were the first dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this light in heaven. When Christ ascended into heaven after his passion, and was solemnly installed in the throne as King of heaven, then this sun rose in heaven, even the Lamb that is the light of the new Jerusalem. But the light began to dawn immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the fall.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Presently upon this the gospel was first revealed on the earth, in these words, Gen. iii.15. "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel." We must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that God's intention of redeeming fallen man was first sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in heaven, before it was signified on earth, because the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the angels as ministring spirits of the Mediator required it; for as soon as ever Christ had taken on him the work of a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, it was requisite that the angels should be ready immediately to be subservient to him in that office; so that the light first dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in heaven; but very soon after the same was signified on earth. In those words of God there was an intimation of another surety to be appointed for man, after the first surety had failed. This was the first revelation of the covenant of grace; this was the first dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the light of the gospel on earth.</p>
                  <p>This lower world before the fall enjoyed noon-day light; the light of the knowledge of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017525_0025_0FA12BA5B0AB1758"/>
man nor angels could find out any way whereby this darkness might be scattered. This darkness appeared in its blackness then, when <hi>Adam</hi> and his wife saw that they were naked, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ewed fig leaves, and when they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden, and hid themselves among the trees of the garden; and when God first called them to an account, and said to <hi>Adam,</hi> What is this that thou hast done? "Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee, that thou shouldst not eat?" Then we may suppose that their hearts were filled with shame and terror. But these words of God, Gen. iii.15. were the first dawning of the light of the gospel after this darkness. Now first appeared some glimmering of light after this dismal darkness, which before this was without one glimpse of light, any beam of comfort, or any the least hope. It was an obscure revelation of the gospel; and was not made to <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Eve</hi> directly, but it was in what God said to the serpent. But yet it was very comprehensive, as might be easily shown, would it not take up too much time.</p>
                  <p>Here was a certain intimation of a merciful design by "the seed of the woman," which was like the first glimmerings of the light of the sun in the east when the day first dawns. This intimation of mercy was given them even before sentence was pronounced on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Eve,</hi> from tenderness to them, to whom God designed mercy, lest they should be overborn with a sentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without having any thing held forth whence they could ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any hope.</p>
                  <p>One of those great things that were intended to be done by the work of redemption, is more plainly intimated here than the rest, viz. God's subduing his enemies under the feet of his Son. This was threatened now, and God's design of this was now first declared, which was the work Christ had now undertaken, and which he soon began, and carried on henceforward, and will perfectly accomplish at the end of the world. Satan probably had triumphed greatly in the fall of man, as though he had defeated the design of God in the creation of man and the world in general. But in these words God gives him a plain intimation, that he should not finally tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, but that a complete victory and triumph should be obtained over him by the seed of the woman.</p>
                  <p>This revelation of the gospel in this verse was the first thing that Christ did in his prophetical office. You may remember that it was said in the first of those three propositions that have been mentioned, that from the fall of man to the incarnation of Christ, God was doing those things that were preparatory to Christ's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and working out redemption, and were forerunners and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nests of it. And one of those things which God did in this time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Christ's coming into the world, was to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017525_0026_0FA12BA66FAA1278"/>
foretel and promise it, as he did from time to time, from age to age, till Christ came. This was the first promise that ever was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of it, the first prediction that ever was made of it on earth.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Soon after this, the custom of sacrificing was appointed, to be a steady type of the sacrifice of Christ till he should come, and offer up himself a sacrifice to God. Sacrificing was not a custom first established by the Levitical law of Moses; for it had been a part of God's instituted worship long before, even from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of God's visible church on earth. We read of the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, offering sacrifice, and before them Noah, and before him Abel. This was by divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for it was part of God's worship in his church, that was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up in faith, and that he accepted: which proves that it was by his institution; for sacrificing is no part of natural worship. The light of nature doth not teach to offer up beasts in sacrifice to God; and seeing it was not enjoined by the law of nature, if it was acceptable to God, it must be by some positive command or institution; for God has declared his abhorrence of such worship as is taught by the precept of men without his institution: Is. xxix.13. "Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their hearts far from me, and their fear tow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rds me is taught by the precept of men; therefore behold, I will preceed to do a marvellous work," &amp;c. And such worship as hath not a warrant from divine institution, cannot be offered up in faith, because faith has no foundation where there is no divine appointment. It cannot be offered up in faith of God's acceptance; for men have no warrant to hope for God's acceptance, in that which is not of his appointment, and in that to which he hath not promised his acceptance: and therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the custom of offering sacrifices to God was instituted soon after the fall; for the scripture teaches us, that Abel offered "the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof," Gen. iv.4.; and that he was accepted of God in his offering, Heb. xi.4. And there is nothing in the story that looks as though the institution was first given then when Abel offered up that sacrifice to God; but it appears as tho' Abel only therein complied with the custom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready established.</p>
                  <p>It is very probable that it was instituted immediately after God had revealed the covenant of grace, in Gen. iii.15.; which cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and promise was the foundation on which the custom of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing was built. That promise was the first stone that was laid towards this glorious building, the work of redemption, which will be finished at the end of the world. And the next stone which was laid upon that, was the institution of sacrifices, to be a type of the <hi>great sacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="unknown:017525_0027_0FA12BA73261FEB8"/>The next thing that we have an account of after God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced sentence on the serpent, on the woman and on the man, was, that God made them coats of skins and cloathed them; which by the generality of divines, are thought to be the skins of beasts slain in sacrifice; for we have no account of any thing else that should be the occasion of man's slaying beasts, but only to offer them in sacrifice, till after the flood. Men were not wont to eat the flesh of beasts for their common food till after the flood. The first food of man in paradise before the fall was the fruit of the trees of paradise; and when he was turned out of paradise after the fall then his food was the herb of the field: Gen. iii, 18. "And thou shalt eat of the herb of the field." The first grant that he had to eat flesh as his common food was after the flood: Gen. ix, 3. Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things." So that it is likely that these skins that Adam and Eve were clothed with, were the skins of their sacrifices. God's clothing them with these was a lively figure of their being clothed with the righteousness of Christ. This cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was no clothing of their own obtaining; but it was God that gave it them. It is said, "God made them coats of skins, and clothed them;" as the righteousness our naked souls are clothed with, is not our righteousness but the righteousness which is of God. It is he only clothes the naked soul.</p>
                  <p>Our first parents, who were naked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were clothed at the expence of life. Beasts were slain, and resigned up their lives a sacrifice to God, to afford clothing to them to cover their nakedness. So doth Christ, to afford clothing to our naked souls. The skin signifies the life: So Job ii.4. "Skin for skin, yea all that a man hath will he give for his life;" <hi>i. e. life for life,</hi> Thus our first parents were covered with skins of sacrifices, as the tabernacle in the wilderness, which signified the church, was, when it was covered with r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ms skins died red, as though they were dipped in blood, to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy that Christ's righteousness was wrought out through the pains of death, under which he shed his precious blood.</p>
                  <p>We observed before, that the light that the church enjoyed from the fall of man, till Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st came, was like the light which we enjoy in the night; not the light of the sun directly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as reflected from the moon and stars; which light did foreshow Christ, the Sun of righteousness that was afterwards to arise. This light of the Sun of righteousness to come they had chiefly two ways: one was by predictions of Christ to come, whereby his coming was foretold and promised; the other was by types and shadows, whereby his coming and redemption were prefigured. The first thing that was done to prepare the way for Christ in the former of these ways, was in that promise that was just taken notice of in the foregoing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:017525_0028_0FA12BA7EF7CD858"/>
and the first thing of the latter kind, viz. of types, to fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>how Christ's c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ming, was that institution of sacrifices that we are now upon. As that promise in Gen. iii.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. was the first dawn of gospel-light after the fall in prophecy; so the institution of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices was the first hint of it in types. The giving of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise was the first thing that was done after the fall, in this work, in Christ's prophetical office; institution of sacrifices was the first thing that we read of after the fall, by which especially Christ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited himself in his priestly office.</p>
                  <p>The institution of sacrificer was a great thing done towards pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the way for Christ's coming, and working out redemption. For the sacrifices of the Old Testament were the main of all the Old Testament types of Christ and his redemption; and it tended to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish in the minds of God's visible church the necessity of a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory sacrifice, in order to the Deity's being satisfied for sin; and so prepared the way for the reception of the glorious gospel, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals the great sacrifice in the visible church, and not only so, but thro' the world of mankind. For from this institution of sacrifices that was after the fall, all nations derived the custom of sacrificing. For this custom of offering up sacrifices to the gods, to atone for their sins, was common to all nations. No nation, however barbarous, was found without it any where. This is a great evidence of the truth of the Christian religion; for no nation, but only the Jews, could tell how they came by this custom, or to what purpose it was to offer sacrifices to their deities. The light of nature did not teach them any such thing. That did not teach them that the gods were hungry, and fed upon the flesh which they burnt in sacrifice; and yet they all had this custom; of which no other account can be given, but that they derived it from Noah, who had it from his ancestors, on whom God had enjoined it as a type of the great sacrifice of Christ. However, by this means all nations of the world had their minds possessed with this notion, that an atonement or sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for sin was necessary; and a way made for their more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily receiving the great doctrine of the gospel of Christ, which teaches us the atonement and sacrifice of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. God did soon after the fall begin actually to save the souls of men through Christ's redemption. In this Christ, who had lately taken upon him the work of Mediator between God and man, did first begin that work, wherein he appeared in the exercise of his kingly office, as in the sacrifices he was represented in his priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office, and in the first prediction of redemption by Christ he had appeared in the exercise of his prophetical office. In that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction the light of Christ's redemption first began to dawn in the prophecies of it; in the institution of sacrifices it first began to dawn in the types of it; in this, viz. his beginning actually to save men, it first began to dawn in the fruit of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="unknown:017525_0029_0FA12ABA2C433510"/>It is probable, therefore, that Adam and Eve were the first fruits of Christ's redemption; it is probable by God's manner of treating them, by his comforting them as he did, after their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakenings and terrors. They were awakened, and ashamed with a sense of their guilt, after their fall, when their eyes were opened, and they saw that they were naked, and sewed fig-leaves to cover their nakedness; as the sinner, under the first awakenings, is wont to endeavour to hide the nakedness of his soul, by patching up a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness of his own. Then they were further terrified and awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, by hearing the voice of God, as he was coming to condemn them. Their coverings of fig-leaves do not answer the purpose; but, notwithstanding these, they ran to hide themselves among the trees of the garden, because they were naked, not d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ring to trust to their fig leaves to hide their nakedness from God. Then they were further awakened by God's calling of them to a strict account. But while their terrors were raised to such a height, and they stood, as we may suppose, trembling and astonished before their judge, without any thing to catch hold of, whence they could gather any hope, then God took care to hold forth some encouragement to them, to keep them from the dreadful effects of dispair under their awakenings, by giving a hint of a design of mercy by a Saviour, even before he pronounced sentence against them. And when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this he proceeded to pronounce sentence, whereby we may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their terrors were further raised, God soon after took c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re to encourage them, and to let them see, that he had not wholly cast them off, by taking a fatherly care of them in their fallen, naked, and miserable state, by making them coa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> of skins and clothing them. Which also manifested an acceptance of those sacrifices that they offered to God for sin, that those were the skins of, which were types of what God had promised, when he said, "The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head:" which promise, there is reason to think, they believed and embraced. Eve seems plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to express her hope in and dependence on that promise, in what she says at the birth of Cain, Gen. iv.1. "I have gotten a man from the Lord;" <hi>i. e.</hi> as God has promised, that my seed should bruise the serpent's head; so now has God given me this pledge and token of it, that I have a seed born.

Though he was, as it were, sure of them and all their posterity, Christ the Redeemer soon showed him, that he was mistaken, and that <hi>he</hi> was able to subdue him, and deliver fallen man. He let him see it, in delivering those first captives of his; and so soon gave him an instance of the fulfilment of that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening, "The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head;" and in this instance a presage of the fulfilment of one great thing he had undertaken, viz. his subduing all his enemies under his feet.</p>
                  <p>After this we have another instance of redemption in one of their children, viz. in righteous Abel, as the scripture calls him, whose soul perhaps was the first that went to heaven through Christ's redemption. In him we have at least the first instance of the death of a redeemed person that is recorded in scripture. If he was the first, then as the redemption of Christ began to dawn before in the souls of men in their conversion and justification, in him it first began to dawn in glorification; and in him the angels began first to do the part of ministring spirits to Christ, in going forth to conduct the souls of the redeemed to glory. In him the el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus they by this saw the glorious effect of Christ's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, in the great honour and happiness that was procured for sinful, miserable creatures by it.</p>
                  <p n="5">V.

<pb n="28" facs="unknown:017525_0031_0FA12ABCA73790E8"/>
religion, and a duty to which a spirit of piety does most natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lead men. Prayer is as it were the very breath of a spirit of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; and we cannot suppose therefore, that those holy men that had been before for above <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> hundred years, had lived all that while with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prayer. Therefore some divines think that the meaning is, that then men first began to perform public worship, or to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the name of the Lord in public assemblies. Whether it be so to be understood or no, yet so much must necessarily be understood by it, viz. that there was something new in the visible church of God with respect to the duty of prayer, or calling upon the name of the Lord; that there was a great addition to the performance of this duty; and that in some respect or other it was carried far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what it ever had been before, which must be the consequence of a remarkable pouring out of the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>If it was now first that men were stirred up to get together in assemblies to help and assist one another in seeking God, so as they never had done before, it argues something extraordinary as the cause; and could be from nothing but uncommon influences of God's Spirit. We see by experience, that a remarkable pouring out of God's Spirit is always attended with such an effect, viz. a great increase of the performance of the duty of prayer. When the Spirit of God begins a work on men's hearts, it immediately sets them to calling on the name of the Lord. As it was with Paul after the Spirit of God had laid hold of him, then the next news is, "Behold, he prayeth!" so it has been in all remarkable pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings out of the Spirit of God that we have any particular account of in scripture; and so it is foretold it will be at the great pouring out of the Spirit of God in the latter days. It is foretold, that it will be poured out as a spirit of grace and supplication, Zech. xii 10. See also Zeph. iii, 9. "For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent."</p>
                  <p>When it is said, "Then <hi>began</hi> men to call upon the name of the Lord," no more can be intended by it, than that this was the first remarkable season of this nature that ever was. It was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or the first, of such a kind of work of God, such a pouring out of the Spirit of God. After such a manner such an expression is commonly used in scripture: so, 1 Sam. xiv.35. "And <hi>Saul</hi> built an altar unto the Lord, the same was the first altar that he built unto the Lord." In the Hebrew it is, as you may see in the margin, "that altar he began to build unto the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" Heb. ii.3. "How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation, which first <hi>began</hi> to be spoken by the Lord?"</p>
                  <p>It may here be observed, that from the fall of man to this day wherein we live, the work of redemption in its effect has mainly
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:017525_0032_0FA12ABD2C350058"/>
been carried on by remarkable pourings out of the Spirit of God. Though there be a more constant influence of God's Spirit always in some degree attending his ordinances; yet the way in which the greatest things have been done towards carrying on this work, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways has been by remarkable pourings out of the Spirit at special seasons of mercy, as may fully appear hereafter in our further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of the subject we are upon. This pouring out of the Spirit in the days of <hi>Enos,</hi> was the first remarkable pouring out of the Spirit of God that ever was. There had been a saving work of God on the hearts of some before; but now God was pleased to grant a more large effusion of his Spirit, for the bringing in an harvest of souls to Christ; so that in this we see that great building that is the subject of our present discourse, which God laid the foundation of immediately after the fall of man, carried on further, and built higher, than ever it had been before.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. The next thing I shall take notice of, is the eminently holy life of <hi>Enoch,</hi> who we have reason to think was a saint of greater eminency than any ever had been before him; so that in this res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the work of redemption was carried on to a greater height than ever it had been before. With respect to its effect in the visible church in general, we observed just now how it was carried higher in the days of <hi>Enos</hi> than ever it had been before. Probably Enoch was one of the saints of that harvest; for he lived all the days that he did live on earth, in the days of <hi>Enos.</hi> With respect to the degree to which this work was carried in the soul of a particular person, it was raised to a greater height in Enoch than ever before. His soul, as it was built on Christ, was built up in holiness to a greater height than there had been any instance before. He was a wonderful instance of Christ's redemption, and the efficacy of his grace.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. In <hi>Enoch</hi>'s time, God did more expressly reveal the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ than he had done before, in the prophecy of <hi>Enoch</hi> that we have an account of in the 14th and 15th verses of the epistle of Jude: "And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him" Here Enoch prophesies of the coming of Christ. It does not seem to be confined to any particular coming of Christ; but it has respect in general to Christ's coming in his kingdom, and is fulfilled in a degree in both the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming of Christ; and indeed in every remarkable manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Chris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> has made of himself in the world, for the saving of his people, and the destroying of his enemies. It is very parallel in this
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017525_0033_0FA12ABDEDD2BA68"/>
respect with many other prophecies of the coming of Christ, that were given under the Old Testament; and, in particular, it seems to be parallel with that great prophecy of Christ's coming in his kingdom that we have in the 7th chapter of Daniel, whence the Jews principally took their notion of the kingdom of heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> see ver. 10. "A fiery stream issued, and came forth from before him: Thousand thousands ministred unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened." And ver. 13.14. "I saw in the night-visions, and behold, one like the son of man, came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed." Though it is not unlikely that <hi>Enoch</hi> might have a more immediate respect in this prophecy to the approaching destruction of the old world by the flood, which was a remarkable resemblance of Christ's destruction of all his enemies at his second coming, yet it doubtless looked beyond the type to the antitype.</p>
                  <p>As this prophecy of Christ's coming is more express than any had been before; so it is an instance of the increase of that gospel-light that began to dawn presently after the fall of man; and is an instance of that building that is the subject of our present discourse, being yet further carried on, and built up higher than it had been before.</p>
                  <p>Here, by the way, I would observe, that the increase of gospel-light, and the carrying on the work of redemption, as it respects the elect church in general, from the first erecting of the church to the end of the world, is very much after the same manner as the carrying on of the same work and the same light in a particular soul, from the time of its conversion, till it is perfected and crowned in glory The work in a particular soul has its ups and downs; sometimes the light shines brighter, and sometimes it is a dark <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>; sometimes grace seem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to prevail, at other times it seems to languish for a great while together, and corruption prevails, and then grace revives again. But in general, grace is growing: from it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> first infusion, till it is perfected in glory, the kingdom of Christ is building up in the soul.</p>
                  <p>So it is with respect to the great affair in general, as it relates to the universal subject of it, as it is carried on from the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it after the fall, till it is perfected at the end of the world, as will more fully appear by a particular view of this affair from beginning to end, in the prosecution of this subject, if God give opportunity to carry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it through as I propose.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="31" facs="unknown:017525_0034_0FA12ABECE3D6A90"/>VIII. The next remarkable thing towards carrying on this work, we have an account of in scripture, is the translation of Enoch into heaven. The account we have of it is in Gen. v.24. "And <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God, and he was not; for God took him." Here Moses, in giving an account of the genealogy of those that were of the line of <hi>Noah,</hi> does not say concerning <hi>Enoch,</hi> he lived so long and he died, as he does of the rest; but, <hi>he was not, for God took him; i. e.</hi> he translated him; in body and soul carried him to heaven without dying, as it is explained in Heb. xi.5. "By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death." By this wonderful work of God, the work of redemption was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a greater height in several respects, than it had been before.</p>
                  <p>You may remember<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that when I was showing what were the great things that God aimed at in the work of redemption, or what the main things were that he intended to bring to pass; I among other things mentioned (p. 12.) the perfect restoring the ruins of the fall with respect to the elect, and restoring man from that destruction that he had brought on himself, both in soul and body. Now this translation of <hi>Enoch</hi> was the first instance that ever was of restoring the ruins of the fall with respect to the body. There had been many instances of restoring the soul of man by Christ's redemption, but none of redeeming and actually saving the body till now. All the bodies of the elect are to be saved as well as their souls. At the end of the world, all the bodies of the saints shall actually be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed; those that then shall have been dead, by a resurrection; and others, that then shall be living, by causing them to pass under a glorious change. There was a number of the bodies of saints <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and glorified at the resurrection and ascension of Christ; and before that there was an instance of a body glorified in Elijah. But the first instance of all was this of Enoch, that we are now speaking of.</p>
                  <p>The work of redemption by this was carried on further that ever it had been before; as, by this wonderful work of God, there was a great increase of gospel light to the church of God, in this respect, that hereby the church had a clearer manifestation of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture state and of the glorious reward of the saints in heaven. We are told, 2 Tim. 1.10. "That life and immortality are brought to light by the gospel." And the more of this is brought to light, the more clearly does the light shine In that respect. What was said in the Old Testament of a future state, is very obscure, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison with the more full, plain, and abundant revelation given of it in the New. But yet even in those early days, the church of God, in this instance, was favored with an instance of it set before their eyes, in that one of their brethren was actually taken
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:017525_0035_0FA12ABF71BD4E90"/>
up to heaven without dying; which we have all reason to think the church of God knew then, as they afterwards knew Elijah's translation. And as this was a clearer manifestation of a future state than the church had had before, so it was a pledge or earnest of that future glorification of all the saints which God intended through the redemption of Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. The next thing that I shall observe, was the upholding the church of God in the family of which Christ was to proceed, in the time of that great and general defection of the world of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that was before the flood. The church of God, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, was small, in comparison with the rest of the world, from the beginning of the time that mankind first began to multiply on the face of the earth, or from the time of <hi>Cain's</hi> defection, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from among the people of God; the time we read of, Gen. iv.16. "When <hi>Cain</hi> went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of <hi>Nod</hi>;" which being interpreted, is the land of banishment: I say, from this time of <hi>Cain's</hi> departure and separation from the church of God, it is probable that the church of God was small in comparison with the rest of the world. The church seems to have been kept up chiefly in the posterity of <hi>Seth</hi>; for this was the seed that God appointed instead of <hi>Abel,</hi> whom <hi>Cain</hi> slew. But we cannot reasonably suppose, that <hi>Seth's</hi> poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity were one fiftieth part of the world: "For <hi>Adam</hi> was one hundred and thirty years old when <hi>Seth</hi> was born." But <hi>Cain,</hi> who seems to have been the ringleader of those that were not of the church, was <hi>Adam's</hi> eldest child, and probably was born soon after the fall, which doubtless was soon after <hi>Adam's</hi> creation; so that there was time for <hi>Cain</hi> to have many sons before <hi>Seth</hi> was born, and besides many other children, that probably Adam and Eve had before this time, agreeably to God's blessing that he gave them, when he said, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth:" and many of these children might have children. The story of <hi>Cain</hi> before <hi>Seth</hi> was born, seems to represent as though there were great numbers of men on the earth: Gen. iv.14.15. "Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth: and from thy face shall I be hid, and I shall be a fugitive and a vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me. And the Lord said unto him, "Therefore whosoever slayeth <hi>Cain,</hi> vengeance shall be taken on him seven-fold. And the Lord set a mark upon <hi>Cain</hi> lest any finding him should kill him." And all those that were then in being when <hi>Seth</hi> was born, must be supposed then to stand in equal capacity of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying their posterity with him; and therefore, as I said before, <hi>Seth</hi>'s posterity were but a small part of the inhabitants of the world.</p>

                     </gap> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> (for <hi>Enoch</hi> was translated before <hi>Enos</hi> died); I say, after their days, the church of God great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diminished, in proportion as multitudes that were of the line of <hi>Seth,</hi> and had been born in the church of God, fell away, and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the wicked world, principally by means of intermar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iages with them: as Gen. vi.1.2. &amp; 4. "And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men, which were of old men of renown." By the <hi>sons of God</hi> here, are doubtless meant the children of the church. It is a denomination often given them in scripture. They intermarried with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world, and so had their hearts led away from God; and there was a great and continual defection from the church. The church of God, that used to be a restraint on the wicked world, diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed exceedingly, and so wickedness went on without restraint. And Satan, that old serpent the devil, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> our first parents, and set up himself as God of this world, raged exceedingly; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imagination of the thoughts of man's heart was only evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and the earth was filled with violence. It seemed to be deluged with wickedness now, as it was with water afterwards: and mankind in general were drowned in this deluge; almost all were swallowed up in it. Now Satan made a most violent and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent attempt to swallow up the church of God; and had almost done it. But yet God preserved it in the midst of all this flood of wickedness and violence. He kept it up in that line of which Christ was to proceed. He would not suffer it to be destroyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a blessing was in it. The Lord the Redeemer was in this branch of mankind, and was afterwards to proceed from it. There was a particular family that was a root in whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the great Redeemer of the world was, and whence the branch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness afterwards was to shoot forth. Therefore, however the branches were lopped off, and the tree seemed to destroyed: yet God in the midst of all this, kept alive this root, by his wonderful redeeming power and grace, so that the gates of hell could not prevail against it.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have shown how God carried on the great affair of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; how the building went on that God began after the fall, during this first period of the times of the Old Testament, viz. from the fall of man, till God brought the flood on the earth.

All the great and mighty works of God from the fall of man to the end of the world, are reducible to this great work, and, if seen in a right view of them, will appear as parts of it, and so many step<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> that God has taken in order to it, or as carrying it on; and doubtless so great a work, so remarkable and universal a catastrophe, as the deluge was, cannot be excepted. It was a work that God wrought in order to it, as thereby God removed out of the way the enemies and obstacles of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that were ready to overthrow it.</p>
                  <p>Satan seems to have been in a dreadful rage just before the flood, and his rage then doubtless, was, as it always has been, chiefly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the church of God to overthrow it; and he had filled the earth with violence and rage against it. He had drawn over al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the world to be on his side, and they listed under his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner against Christ and his church. We read, that the earth "was filled with violence;" and doubtless that violence was chiefly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the church, in fulfilment of what was foretold, <hi>I will put enmity between thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God's spirit had striven with them an hundred and twenty years, and all in vain; and the church was almost swallowed up.

                  <p>We read of scarce any great destruction of nations any where in Scripture, but that one main reason given for it is, their enmity and injuries against God's church; and doubtless this was one main reason of the destruction of all nations by the flood.

Therefore their destruction was a work of God that did as much belong to the work of redemption, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God took their part, and appeared for them against their enemies, and drowned those of whom they had been afraid in the flood of water, as he drowned the enemies of Israel that pursued them in the Red sea.</p>
                  <p>Indeed God could have taken other methods to deliver his church: he could have converted all the world instead of drowning it; and so he could have taken another method than drowning the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the Red sea. But that is no a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>By the wicked world's being drowned, the wicked, the enemies of God's people, were dispossessed of the earth, and the whole earth given to Noah and his family to possess in quiet: as God made

room for the <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Canaan,</hi> by casting out their enemies from before them. And God's thus taking the possession of the enemies of the church, and giving it all to his church, was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that promise of the covenant of grace: Psal. xxxvii.9.10.11. "For evil doers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth. For yet a little while and the wicked shall not be: yea thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be. But the meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace."</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Another thing here belonging to the same work, was God's so wonderfully preserving that family of which the Redeemer was to proceed, when all the rest of the world was drowned. God's drowning the world, and saving <hi>Noah</hi> and his family, both were works reducible to this great work. The saving <hi>Noah</hi> and his family belonged to it two ways. As that family was the family of which the Redeemer was to proceed, and as that family was the church that he had redeemed, it was the mystical body of Christ that was there saved. The manner of God's saving those persons, when all the world besides was so overthrown, was very wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and remarkable. It was a wonderful and remarkable type of the redemption of Christ, of that redemption that is sealed by the baptism of water, and is so spoken of in the New Testament, as 1 Pet. iii, 20.21. "Which some time were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was preparing, wherein few, that is eight souls, were saved by water. The like figure whereunto, even baptism, doth also now save us, (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That water that washed away the filth of the world, that cleared the world of wicked men, was a type of the blood of Christ, that takes away the sin of the world. That water that delivered Noah and his sons from their enemies, is a type of the blood that delivers God's church from their sins, their worst enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That water that was so plentiful and abundant, that it filled the world, and reached above the tops of the highest mountains, was a type of that blood, the sufficiency of which is so abundant, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> is, the new grant of the earth God made to Noah and his family immediately after the flood, as founded on the covenant of grace. The sacrifice of Christ was represented by Noah's building an alter to the Lord and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:017525_0040_0FA12AC3302F4808"/>
offering a sacrifice of every clean beast and fowl. And we have an account of God's accepting this sacrifice: and thereupon he blessed Noah, and established his covenant with him, and with his seed, promising to destroy the earth in like ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

And God now, on occasion of this sacrifice that Noah offered to God, gives him and his posterity a new grant of the earth; a new power of dominion over the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as founded on that sacrifice, and so founded on the coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of grace. And so it is to be looked upon as a diverse grant from that which was made to Adam, that we have, Gen. i.28. "And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." Which grant was not founded on the covenant of grace; for it was given to Adam while he was under the covenant of works, and therefore was antiquated when that covenant ceased. The first grant of the earth to Adam was founded on the first covenant; and therefore, when that first covenant was broken, the right conveyed to him by that first covenant was forfeited and lost. Hence it came to pass, that the earth was taken away from mankind by the flood: for the first grant was forfeited; and God had never made another after that, till after the flood. If the first covenant had not been brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, God never would have drowned the world, and so have taken it away from mankind: for then the first grant made to mankind would have stood good. But that was broken; and so God after a while, destroyed the earth, when the wickedness of man was great.</p>

The reason why such a promise, that God would no more destroy the earth, was added to this grant made to Noah, and not to that made to Adam, was because this was founded on the covenant of grace, of which Christ was the surety, and therefore could not be broken.

When we have this expression in scripture, <hi>my covenant,</hi> it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is to be understood of the covenant of grace. The manner of expression, "I will establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you," shews plainly, that it was a covenant already in being, that had been made already, and that Noah would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what covenant it was by that denomination, viz. the covenant of grace.</p>

This city and tower was set up in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the city of God, as the god that they built it to, was their pride.

                  <p>They intended to have built Babel up to heaven. That building that is the subject we are upon, is a building that is intended to be built so high, its top shall reach to heaven indeed, as it will to the highest heavens at the end of the world, when it shall be finished: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God would not suffer the building of his enemies, that they design<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed to build up to heaven in opposition to it, to prosper. If they had gone on and prospered in building that city and tower, it might have kept the world of wicked men, the enemies of the church, together, as that was their design. They might have remained united in one vast, powerful city; and so they might have been too powerful for the city of God, and quite swallowed it up.</p>
                  <p>This city of Babel is the same with the city of Babylon; for Babylon in the original is Babel. But Babylon was a city that is always spoken of in scripture as chiefly opposite to the city of God. Babylon, and Jerusalem, or Zion, are opposed to each other often both in the Old Testament and New. This city was a powerful and terrible enemy to the city of God afterwards, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this great check put to the building of it in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. But it might have been, and probably would have been vastly more powerful, and able to vex and destroy the church of God, if it had not been thus checked.</p>
                  <p>Thus it was in kindness to his church in the world, and in prosecution of the great design of redemption, that God put a stop to the building of the city and tower of Babel.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. The dispersing of the nations, and dividing the earth among its inhabitants, immediately after God had caused the building of Babel to cease. This was done so as most to suit that great design of redemption. And particularly, God therein had an eye to the future propagation of the gospel among the nations. They were so placed, the bounds of their habitation so limited round about the land of Canaan, the place laid out for the habitation of God's people, as most suited the design of propagating the gospel among them: Deut. xxxii.8 "When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel." Acts xvii.26.27. "And hath made of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:017525_0043_0FA12AC56DF63470"/>
habitations; that they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him." The land of Canaan was the most conveniently situated of any place in the world for the purpose of spreading the light of the gospel thence among the nations in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. The inhabited world was chiefly in the Roman empire in the times immediately after Christ, which was in the countries round about Jerusalem, and so properly situated for the purpose of diffusing the light of the gospel among them from that place. The devil seeing the advantage of this situation of the nations for promoting the great work of re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Thus he led some into America; and others into northern cold regions, that are almost in accessible.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Another thing I would mention in this period, was God's preserving the true religion in the line of which Christ was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, when the world in general apostatized to idolatry, and the church were in imminent danger of being swallowed up in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral corruption. Although God had lately wrought so wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the deliverance of his church, and had shewn so great mercy towards it, as for its sake even to destroy all the rest of the world, and although he had lately renewed and established his covenant of grace with Noah and his sons; yet so prone is the corrupt heart of man to depart from God, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ell into gross idolatry; so that before Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham the distemper was become almost universal. The earth was become very corrupt at the time of the building of Babel; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven God's people themselves, even that line of which Christ was to come, were corrupted in a measure with idolatry: Josh. xxiv.2. "Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor; and <hi>they served other gods.</hi>" The other side of the flood means beyond the river Euphrates, where the ancestors of Abraham lived.</p>
                  <p>We are not to understand, that they were wholly drawn off to idolatry, to forsake the true God. For God is said to be the God of Nahor: Gen. xxxi.53. "The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of <hi>their father,</hi> judge betwixt us." But they only partook in some measure of the general and almost universal corruption of the times; as Solomon was in a measure infected with idolatrous corruption; and as the children of Israel in Egyp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> are said to serve other gods, though yet there was the true church of God among them; and as these were images kept for a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time in the family of Jacob; the corruption being brought from Padan-Aram, whence he fetched his wives.</p>

Therefore God saw it to be time to call Abraham, the person in whose fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily he intended to uphold the true religion, out of his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and from his kindred, to a far distant country, that his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity might there remain a people separate from all the rest of the world; that so the true religion might be upheld there, while man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind besides were swallowed up in Heathenism.</p>
                  <p>The land of the Chaldees, that Abraham was called to go out of, was the country about Babel; Babel, or Babylon, was the chief city of the land of Chaldea. Learned men suppose, by what they gather from some of the most ancient accounts of things, that it
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:017525_0045_0FA12AC6EEE06590"/>
was in this land that idolatry first began; that Babel and Chaldea were the original and chief seat of the worship of idols, whence it spread into other nations. Therefore the land of the Chaldeans, or the country of Babylon, is in scripture called <hi>the land of graven images</hi>: as you may see, Jer. 1.35. together with ver. 38. "A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the Lord, and upon the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.— A drought is upon her waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols." God calls Abraham out of this idolatrous country, to a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from it. And when he came there, he gave him no inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in it, no not so much as to set his foot on; but he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a stranger and a sojourner, that he and his family might be kept se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This was a new thing: God had never taken such a method be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. His church had not in this manner been separated from the rest of the world till now, but were wont to dwell with them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any bar or fence to keep them separate; the mischievous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of which had been found once and again.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ble wall of separation, was, that the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ected, and the church was almost bro't to nothing. The method that God took then to fence the church was, to drown the wicked world, and save the church in the ark. And now the world, before Abraham was called, was become cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt again. But now God took another method. He did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>est by the wicked world, and save Abraham, and his wife, and Lot, in an ark; but he calls these persons to go and live separate from the rest of the world.</p>
                  <p>This was a new thing, and a great thing, that God did toward the work of redemption. This thing was done now about the middle of the space of time between the fall of man and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there were about two thousand years yet to come before Christ the great Redeemer was to come. But by this calling of Abraham, the ancestor of Christ, a foundation was laid for the upholding the church of Christ in the world, till Christ should come. For the world having bec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And then it was needful that there should be a particular nation separated from the rest of the world, to receive the types and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies that were needful to be given of Christ, to prepare the way for his coming; that to them might be committed the oracles of God; and that by them the history of God's great works of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

So that this calling of Abraham may be looked upon as a kind of a new foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation laid for the visible church of God, in a more distinct and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular state, to be upheld and built up on this foundation from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward, till Christ should actually come, and then through him to be propagated to all nations.

It is the same tree that flourishes from that small beginning, that was in Abraham's time, and has in these days of the gospel spread its branches over a great part of the earth, and will fill the whole earth in due time, and at the end of the world shall be transplanted from an earthly soil into the paradise of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. There accompanied this a more particular and full revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and confirmation of the covenant of grace than ever had been before. There had before this been, as it were, two particular and solemn editions or confirmations of this covenant; one at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the first period, which was that whereby the covenant of grace was revealed to our first parents, soon after the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ll then any that had been before. The covenant was now more particularly revealed. It was now revealed, not only that Christ should be; but it was revealed to Abraham, that he should be his seed; and it was now promised, that all the families of the earth should be blessed in him. God was much in the promises of this to Abraham. The first promise was when he first called him, Gen. xii.2. "And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee and make thy name great; and thou shall be a blessing." Again the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:017525_0047_0FA12AC86EA30E70"/>
was renewed after he came into the land of Canaan, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> 14. &amp;c. The covenant was again renewed after Abraham and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the slaughter of the kings, chap. xv.5.6. Again after his offering up Isaac, chap. xxii.16.17.18.</p>
                  <p>In this renewal of the covenant of grace with Abraham, several particulars concerning that covenant were revealed more fully <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ever had been before; not only that Christ was to be of Abraham's seed, but also, the calling of the Gentiles, and the bringing all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into the church, that all the families of the earth were to be blessed, was now made known. And then the great condition of the covenant of grace, which is faith, was now more fully made known. Gen. xv.5.6 "And he said unto him, So shall thy seed he. And Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness." Which is much taken notice of in the New Testament as that whence Abraham was called the father of them that believe.</p>
                  <p>As there was now a further revelation of the covenant of grace, so there was a further confirmation of it by seals and pledges, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ever had been before; as, particularly, God did now institute a certain sacrament, to be a steady seal of this covenant in the visible church, till Christ should come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viz. circumcision. Circumcision was a seal of this covenant of grace, as appears by the first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, as we have an account of it in the 17th chapter of Genesis. It there appears to be a seal of that covenant by which God promised to make Abraham a father of many nations, as appears by the 5th verse, compared with the 9th and 10th verses. We are expressly taught, that it was a seal of the righteousness of faith, Rom. 4.11. Speaking of Abraham, the apostle says, "he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of faith."</p>
                  <p>As I observed before, God called Abraham, that his family and posterity might be kept separate from the rest of the world, till Christ should come, which God saw to be necessary on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned accounts. And this sacrament was the principal wall of separation; it chiefly distinguished Abraham's seed from the world, and kept up a distinction and separation more than any other particular observance whatsover.</p>
                  <p>Besides this, there were other occasional seals, pledges, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations, that Abraham had of this covenant; as, particularly, God gave Abraham a remarkable pledge of the fulfi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap> in his own house, conquered, subdued, and baffled this mighty emperor, and the kings that came with him, and all their army. This he received of God as a pledge of what he had promised, viz. The victory that Christ his seed should obtain over the nations of the earth, whereby he should possess the gates of his enemies. It is plainly spoken of as such in the 41st of Isaiah. In that chapter is foretold the future glorious victory the church shall obtain over the nations of the world; as you may see in the 1st, 10th, and 15th verses, &amp;c. But here this victory of Abraham over such a great emperor and his mighty forces, is spoken of as a pledge and earnest of this victory of the church, as you may see in 2d and 3d verses. "Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow. He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that be had not gone with his feet."</p>
                  <p>Another remarkable confirmation Abraham received of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of grace, was when he returned from the slaughter of the kings; when Melchisedec the king of Salem he the priest of the Most High God, that great type of Christ, met him, and blessed him, and brought forth bread and wine. The bread and wine signified the same blessings of the covenant of grace, that the bread and wine does in the sacrament of the Lord's supper. So that as Abraham had a seal of the covenant in circumcision that was equivalent to baptism, so now he had a seal of it equivalent to the Lord's supper. Melchisedec's coming to meet him with such a seal of the covenant of grace, on the occasion of this victory of his over the kings of the north, confirm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>nt of the same covenant; for that is the mercy that Melchisedec with his bread and wine takes notice of; as you may see by what he says in Gen. xiv.19.20.</p>
                  <p>Another confirmation that God gave Abraham of the covenant of grace, was the vision that he had in the deep sleep that fell upon him, of the smoking furnace, and burning lamp, that passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the parts of the sacrifice, as in the latter part of the 15th
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:017525_0049_0FA12AC9EEDB3958"/>
chapter of Genesis. The sacrifice, as all sacrifices do, signified the sacrifice of Christ. The smoking furnace that passed through the midst of that sacrifice first, signified the sufferings of Christ. But the burning lamp that followed, which shone with a clear bright sight, signifies the glory that followed Christ's sufferings, and was procured by them.</p>
                  <p>Another remarkable pledge that God gave Abraham of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment of the covenant of grace, was his giving of the child of whom Christ was to come, in his old age This is spoken of as such in scripture; Heb. xi.11.12. and also Rom. iv.18 &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Again, another remarkable pledge that God gave Abraham of the fulfilment of the covenant of grace, was his delivering Isaac, after he was laid upon the wood of the sacrifice to be slain. This was a confirmation of Abraham's faith in the promise that God had made of Christ, that he should be of Isaac's posterity; and was a representation of the resurrection of Christ; as you may see, Heb. xi.17.18.19. And because this was given as a confirmation of the covenant of grace, therefore God renewed that covenant with Abraham on this occasion, as you may see, Gen. xxiv<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see how much more fully the covenant of grace was revealed and confirmed in Abraham's time than ever it had been before; by means of which Abraham seems to have had a more clear understanding and sight of Christ the great Redeemer, and the future things that were to be accomplished by him, than any of the saints that had gone before. Therefore Christ takes notice of it, that Abraham rejoiced to see his day, and he saw it and was glad, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">III. The next thing that I would take notice of here, is God's preserving the patriarchs for so long a time in the midst of the wicked inhabitants of Canaan, and from all other enemies. The patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, were those of whom Christ was to proceed; and they were now separated from the world, that in them his church might be upheld. Therefore, in preserving them, the great design of redemption was uph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He preserved them, and kept the inhabitants of the land where they so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed from destroying them; which was a remarkable dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of providence. For the inhabitants of the land were at that day exceeding wicked, though they grew more wicked afterwards. This appears by Gen. xv.16. "In the fourth generation they shall come hither again; for the iniquity of the Canaanites is not yet full:" As much as to say, Though it be very great, yet it is not yet full. Their great wickedness also appears by Abraham and Isaac's aversion to their child<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Another argument of their great wickedness, is the instance we have of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim, which were some of the cities of Canaan though they were probably distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishingly wicked.</p>

Besides, it could not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, but that they must be much in reproving their wickedness, as we find Lot was in Sodom; who, we are told, vexed his right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous soul with their unlawful deeds, and was a preacher of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness to them.</p>
                  <p>They were the more exposed to them, being strangers and sojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the land, and having no inheritance there as yet. Men are more apt to find fault with strangers, and be irritated by any thing in them that offends them, as they were with Lot in Sodom. He very gently reproved their wickedness; and they say upon it, "This fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a ruler and a judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" and theatened what they would do to him.</p>
                  <p>But God wonderfully preserved Abraham and Lot, Isaac and Jacob, and their families, amongst them, though they were few in number, and they might quickly have destroyed them; which is taken notice of as a wonderful instance of God's preserving mercy towards his church, Psal. cv.12. &amp;c. "When they were but few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it. When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people.

                  <p>This preservation was in some instances especially very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; those instances that we have an account of, wherein the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the land were greatly irritated and provoked; as they were by Simeon and Levi's treatment of the Shechemites, as you may see in Gen. xxxiv.30. &amp;c.

"Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad." How wonderfully did he also preserve him from Esau his brother, when he came forth with an army, with a full design to cut him off! how did God in answer to his prayer, when he wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Christ at Penuel, wonderfully turn Esau's heart, and make him, instead of meeting him as an enemy with slaughter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, to meet him as a friend and brother, doing him no harm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p n="4">IV. The next thing I would mention is, the awful destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the neighbouring cities. This tended to promote the great design and work that is the subject of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent undertaking, two ways. It did so, as it tended powerfully to restrain the inhabitants of the land from injuring those holy stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that God had brought to sojourn amongst them. Lot was one of those strangers; he came into the land with Abraham; and Sodom was destroyed for their abusive disregard of Lot, the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of righteousness, that God had sent among them. And their destruction came just upon their committing a most injurious and abominable insult on Lot, and the strangers that were come into his house, even those angels, whom they probably took to be some of Lot's former acquaintance come from the country that he came from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to visit him. They in a most outrageous manner beset Lot's house, intending a monstrous abuse and act of violence on those strangers that were come thither, and threatening to serve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But in the midst of this God smote them with blindness; and the next morning the city and the country about it was overthrow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>re and brimstone; which dreadful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, as it was in the sight of the rest of the inhabitants of the land, therefore greatly tended to restrain them from hurting those holy strangers any more; doubtless struck a dread and terror on their minds, and made them afraid to hurt them, and probably was one principal means to restrain them, and preserve the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs. And when that reason is given why the inhabitants of the land did not pursue after Jacob, when they were so provoked by the destruction of the Shechemites, viz. "that the terror of the Lord was upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" it is very probable, that this was a terror
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:017525_0052_0FA12ACC2F4B8F28"/>
that was set home upon them. They remembered the amazing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Sodom, and the cities of the slain, that came upon them, upon their abusive treatment of Lot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so curst <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Another way that this awful destruction tended to promote this great affair of redemption, was, that hereby God did remarkably exhibit the terrors of this law, to make men sensible of their need of redeeming mercy. The work of redemption never was carried on without this. The law, from the beginning, is made use of as a school-master to bring men to Christ.</p>
                  <p>But under the Old Testament there was much more need of some extraordinary, visible, and sensible manifestation of God's wrath against sin, than in the days of the gospel; sine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore the revelation that G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d gave of himself in those days, used to be accompanied with much more terror than it is in these days of the gospel. So when God appeared at Mount Sinai to give the law, it was with thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud. But some external, awful manifestations of God's wrath against sin were on some accounts especially neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary before the giving of the law: and therefore, before the flood, the terrors of the law handed down by tradition from Adam served. Adam lived nine hundred and thirty years himself, to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And some that s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He did so to Isaac, as you may see, Gen. xxvi 3.4. "And I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; and I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed." After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it was renewed and confirmed to Jacob; first in Isaac's bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of him, wherein he acted and spoke by extraordinary divine direction. In that blessing, the blessings of the covenant of grace were established with Jacob and his seed; as Gen. xxvii.29. "Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee; be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: Cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee." Therefore Esau, in missing of this blessing, missed of being blessed as an heir of the benefits of the covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p>This covenant was again renewed and confirmed to Jacob at Bethel, in his vision of the ladder that reached to heaven; which ladder was a symbol of the way of salvation by Christ. For the stone that Jacob rested on was a tye of Christ, the stone of Israel, which the spiritual Israel or Jacob rests upon; as is evident, because this stone was on this occasion anointed, and was made use of as an alter. But we know that Christ is the anointed of God, and is the only true altar of God. While Jacob was resting on this stone, and saw this ladde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth; and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south; and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."</p>
                  <p>Jacob had another remarkable confirmation of this covenant at Penuel, where he wre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tled with God, and prevailed; where Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him in a human form, in the form of that nature which he was afterwards to receive into a personal union with his divine nature.</p>
                  <p>God renewed his covenant with him again, after he was come out of Padan-aram, and was come up to Bethel, to the stone that he had rested on, and where he had the vision of the ladder; as you may see in Gen xxxv.10 &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus the covenant of grace was now often renewed, much oftener than it had been before. The light of the gospel now began to shine much brighter, as the time drew nearer that Christ should come.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. The next thing I would observe, is God's remarkably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the family of which Christ was to proceed from perishing by famine, by the instrumentality of Joseph. When there was a seven-years famine approaching, God was pleased, by a wonderful providence, to send Joseph into Egypt, there to provide for, and feed Jacob and his family, and to keep the holy seed alive, which otherwise would have perished. Joseph was sent into Egypt for
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:017525_0054_0FA12ACDAF529BD8"/>
that end, as he observes, Gen. l.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>0. "But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to save much people alive." How often had this holy root, that had the future branch of righteousness, the glorious Redeemer, in it, been in danger of being destroyed! But God wonderfully preserved it.</p>
                  <p>This salvation of the house of Israel by the hand of Joseph, was upon some accounts very much a resemblance of the salvation of Christ. The children of Israel were saved by Joseph their kinsman and brother, from perishing by famine; as he that saves the souls of the spiritual Israel from spiritual famine is their near kinsman, and one that is not ashamed to call them brethren. Joseph was a brother, that they had hated, and sold, and as it were killed; for they had designed to kill him. So Christ is one that we naturally hate, and, by our wicked lives, have sold for the vain things of the world, and that by our sins we have slain. Joseph was first in a state of humiliation; he was a servant, as Christ appeared in the form of a servant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then was cast into a dungeon, as Christ descended into the grave; and then when he rose out of the dungeon, he was in a state of great exaltation, at the king's right hand as his deputy, to reign over all his kingdom, to provide food, to preserve li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e; and being in this state of exaltation, he dispenses food to his brethren, and so gives them life; as Christ was exalted at God's right hand to be a prince and saviour to his brethren, and received gifts for men, even for the rebellious, and them that hated, and had sold him.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. After this there was a prophecy given forth of Christ, on some accounts, more particular than ever any had been before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And then it was limited more still; for when Isaac had two sons it was revealed that Christ was to be of Israel's posterity. And now though Israel had twelve sons, yet it is revealed that Christ should be of Judah's Posterity: Christ in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

He did his utmost against the people, and to his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most opposed their redemption. But it is said, that when God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed his people out of Egypt, he broke the heads of the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons in the waters, and broke the head of leviathan in pieces, and gave him to be meat for the people inhabiting the wilderness, Psal. lxxiv.12.13.14.

And when Pharaoh and his hosts, and Satan by them pursued the people, Christ overthrew them in the Red sea; the Lord triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider he cast into the sea, and there they slept their last sleep, and never followed the children of Israel any more; as all Christ's enemies are overthrown in his blood, which by its abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant sufficiency, and the greatness of the sufferings with which it was shed, may well be represented by a sea.

                  <p>This was quite a new thing that God did towards this great work of redemption. God never had done any thing like it before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Deut. iv.32.33.34. This was a great advancement of the work
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:017525_0058_0FA12AD0AE83E1F8"/>
of redemption, that had been begun and carried on from the fall of man; a great step taken in divine providence towards a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Christ's coming into the world, and working out his great and eternal redemption: for this was the people of whom Christ was to come. Now we may see how that plant flourished that God had planted in Abraham. Though the family of which Christ was to come, had been in a degree separated from the rest of the world before, in the calling of Abraham; yet that separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that was then made, appeared not to be sufficient, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther separation. For though by that separation, they were kept as strangers and sojourners, kept from being united with other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the same political societies; yet they remained mixed among them, by which means, as it had proved, they had been in danger of wholly losing the true religion, and of being overrun with the idolatry of their neighbours. God now, therefore, by this redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, separated them as a nation from all other nations, to subsist by themselves in their own political and ecclesiastical state, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any concern with the Heathen nations, that they might so be kept separate till Christ should come; and so that the church of Christ might be upheld and might keep the oracles of God, till that time; that in them might be kept up those types and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Christ, and those histories, and other divine previous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, that were necessary to prepare the way for Christ's coming.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. As this people were separated to be God's peculiar people, so all other people upon the face of the whole earth were wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and given over to Heathenism. This, so far as the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God was concerned in it, belongs to the great affair of redemption that we are upon, and was one thing that God ordered in his providence to prepare the way for Christ's coming, and the great salvation he was to accomplish in the world; for it was only to prepare the way for the more glorious and signal victory and triumph of Christ's power and grace over the wicked and miserable world, and that Christ's salvation of the world of mankind might become the more sensible. This is the account the scripture itself gives us of the matter, Rom. xi.30.31.32. The apostle there speaking to the Gentiles that had formerly been Heathens, says, "As ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief; even so have these also now not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy. For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all." <hi>i. e.</hi> It was the will of God, that the whole world, Jews, and Gentiles, should be concluded in visible and professed unbelief, that so God's mercy and Christ's salvation towards them all might be visible and sensible. For the apostle is not speaking only of that unbelief that is natural to all God's professing people as well
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:017525_0059_0FA12AD16CCE61F8"/>
as others, but that which appears, and is visible; such as the Jews fell into, when they openly rejected Christ, and ceased to be a professing people. The apostle observes, how that first the Gentiles, even the Gentile nations, were included in a professed unbelief and open opposition to the true religion, before Christ came, to prepare the way for the calling of the Gentiles, which was soon after Christ came, that God's mercy might be the more vis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>We cannot certainly determine precisely at what time the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasy of the Gentile nations from the true God, or there being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in visible unbelief, became universal. Their falling away was a gradual thing, as we observed before.

                  <p>And as the first calling of the Gentiles after Christ came, was accompanied with the rejection of the Jews; so the first calling of the Jews to be God's people, when they were called out of Egypt, was accompanied with a rejection of the Gentiles.</p>

They were concluded so long a time in unbelief, that there might be a thorough proof of the necessity of a saviour; that it might appear by so long a trial, past all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that mankind were utterly insufficient to deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Herein the wonderful wisdom of God appeared, in thus preparing the way for Christ's redemption. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Here I might consider as another work of God, whereby the general work of redemption was carried on, that wonderful deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance which he wrought for the children o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as this may be referred to their redemption out of Egypt, and considered as a part of that more general work, I shall not further enlarge upon it.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The next thing that I shall take notice of here, what was done towards the work of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>edemption, is God's giving the moral law in so awful a manner at Mount Sinai. This was another new thing that God did, a new step taken in this great affair. Deut. iv.33. "Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?" And it was a great thing that God did towards this work, and that whether we consider it as delivered as a new exhibition of the covenant of works, or given as a rule of life.</p>
                  <p>The covenant of works was here exhibited to be as a school-master to lead to Christ, not only for the use of that nation in the ages of the Old Testament, but for the use of God's church through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ages of the world; as an instrument that the great redeemer makes use of to convince men of their sin and misery, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less state, and of God's awful and tremenduous majesty and justice as a lawgiver, and so to make men sensible of the necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="58" facs="unknown:017525_0061_0FA12AD3B8287ED0"/>It was given in an awful manner, with a terrible voice, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loud an awful, so that all the people that were in the camp trembled; and Moses himself, though so intimate a friend of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet said, I exceedingly fear and quake; the voice being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with thunders and lightnings, the mountain burning with fire to the midst of heaven, and the earth itself shaking and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; to make all sensible how great that authority, power, and justice was, that stood engaged to exact the fulfilment of this law, and to see it fully executed; and how strictly God would require the fulfilment: and how terrible his wrath would be against every breaker of it; that men being sensible of those things, might have a thorough trial of themselves, and might p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">IV. The next thing that is observable in this period, is God's giving the typical law, in which I suppose to be included most or all those precepts that were given by Moses, that did not properly belong to the moral law; not only those laws that are commonly called <hi>ceremonial,</hi> in distinction from judicial laws, which are the laws prescribing the ceremonies and circumstances of the Jewish worship, and their ecclesiastical state; but also many, if not all those divine laws that were political, and for regulating the Jewish commonwealth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> commonly called <hi>judicial</hi> laws; these were at best many of them typical. The giving this typical law was another great thing that God did in this period, tending to build up this glorious structure of redemption that God had been carying on from the beginni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>g of the world. There had been many typical events of providence before, that represented Christ and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and some typical ordinances, as particularly those two of sacrifices and circumcision: but now, instead of representing the great redeemer in a few institutions, God gives forth a law full of nothing else but various and innumerable typical represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of good things to come, by which that nation were direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how, every year, month, and day, in their religous actions, and in their conduct of themselves, in all that appertained to their ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical and civil state, to show forth something of Christ; one observance showing one thing, exhibiting one doctrine, or one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit; another, another: so that the whole nation by this law was,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:017525_0062_0FA12AD470C1A4C8"/>
as it were, constituted in a typical state. Thus the gospel was abundantly held forth to that nation; so that there is scarce any doctrine of it, but is particularly taught and exhibited by some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance of this law; though it was in shadows, and under a vail, as Moses put a vail on his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="5">V. About this time was given to God's church the first written word of God that ever was enjoyed by God's people. This was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother great thing done towards the affair of redemption, a new and glorious advancement of the bui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>w, and was added to from that time, for many ages, till it was finished, and the canon of scripture completed by the apostle John. It is not very material, whether the first written word that ever was, was the ten commandments written on the tables of stone with the finger of God, or the book of Job; and whether the book of Job was written by Moses, as some suppose, or by Elihu, as others. If it was written by Elihu, it was written before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The written word of God is the main instrument Christ has made use of to carry on his work of redemption in all ages since it was given. There was a necessity new of the word of God's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing committed to writing, for a steady rule of God's church. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, the church had the word of God by tradition, either by immediate tradition from eminent men that were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But the distance from the beginning of things was become so great, and the lives of men become so short, being brought down to the present standard about Moses's time, and God having now separated a nation to be a peculiar people, partly for that end to be the keepers of the oracles of God; God saw it to be a needful

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, besides the book of Job, Christ wrote the ten commandments on tables of stone, with his own finger; and after this the whole law, as containing the substance of the five books of Moses, was by God's special command committed to writing, which was called <hi>the book of the law,</hi> and was laid in the tabernacle, to be kept there for the use of the church; as you may see, Deut. xxxi.24 25 26.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. God was pleased now wonderfully to represent the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of his redeemed church through the world to their eternal inheritance, by the journey of the children of Israel through the wilderness, from Egypt to Canaan. Here all the various steps of the redemption of the church by Christ were represented from the beginning to its cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The beginning of the application of the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ's church in their conversion, was represented by Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael's going out of Egypt, and passing through the Red sea in so extraordinary and miraculous a manner. The travel of the church through this evil world, and the various changes through which the church passes, in the different stages of it, was represented by the journey of the Israelite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> through the wilderness. The manner of their being conducted by Christ, was represented by the Israelites being led by the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night. The manner of the church's being supported in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, and supplied from the beginning to the end of it, with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual food, and continual daily communications from God, was represented by God's supplying the children of Israel with bread, or man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ites, and others they met with there. Innumerable other things might be mentioned, wherein the things they met with were lively ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of things which the church and saints meet with in all ages of the world. That these things are typical of things that pertain to the Christian church, is manifest from 1 Cor. x.11. "Now all these things happened unto them for ensampler, and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come." Here the apostle is speaking of those very things which we have now mentioned, and he says expressly, that they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto them for <hi>types</hi>; so it is in the original.</p>

Another thing here must not be omitted, which was a great and remarkable dispensation of Providence, respecting the whole world of mankind, which was finished in this period; and that was, the shortening the days of man's life, whereby it was brought down from being between nine hundred and a thousand years, to be but about seventy or eighty. The life of man began to be shortened immediately after the flood: it was brought down the first generation to 600 years, and the next to between four and 500 years; and so the life of man gradually gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w shorter and shorter, 'till a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>out the time of the great mortality that was in the congregation of Israel, after they had murmured at the report of the spies, and their carcasses fell in the wilderness, whereby all the men of war died; and then the life of man was reduced to its present standard, as Moses observes in that psalm that he wrote on occasion of that mortality: psal. 10.10. "The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow: for it is soon cut off, and we fly away."</p>
                  <p>This great dispensation of God tended to promote the grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the redemption of Christ. Man's life being cut so very short in this world, tended to prepare the way for poor, mortal, short-lived men, the more joyfully to entertain the glad tidings of everlasting life in another world, that are brought to light by the gospel; and more readily to embrace a saviour, that purchases and offers such a blessing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if men's lives were still commonly about nine hundred years, how much less would they have to move them to regard the proffers of a future life; how much greater temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would they have to rest in the the things of this world, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such long continuance, and to neglect any other life but this? This probably contributed greatly to the wickedness of the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deluvians. But now how much greater motives have men to seek redemption, and a better life than this, by the great Redeemer, since the life of man is not one twelfth part of what it used to be, and men now universally die at the age when men formerly used to be but as it were setting out in the world?</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. The same work was carried on in preserving that people, of whom Christ was to come, from totally perishing in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by a constant miracle of forty years continuance. I observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before many times, how God preserved those of whom the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer was to proceed in a very wonderful manner; as he preserved Noah and his family from the flood; and as he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cob and his family from perishing by the famine, by Joseph in Egypt. But this preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:017525_0065_0FA12AD6B1737838"/>
of the children of Israel for so long a time in the wilderness, was on some accounts more remarkable than any of them; for it was by a continual miracle of so long duration. There was, as may be fairly computed, at first two millions of souls in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, that could not subsist any better without meat and drink than other men. But if this had been with held, they must all have perished, every man, woman, and child, in less than one month's time, so there would not have been one of them left. But yet this vast multitude subsisted for forty years together, in a dry barren wilderness, without sowing or reaping, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>illing any land, having their bread daily rained down to them out of heaven, and being furnished with water to satisfy them all, out of a rock; and the same cloaths with which they came out of Egypt, lasting, without wearing out all that time. Never was any instance like this, of a nation being so upheld for so long a time together. Thus God upheld his church by a continual miracle, and kept alive that people in whom was the blessing, the promised seed, and great Redeemer of the world.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. God was pleased, in this time of the children of Israel's being in the wilderness, to give a further revelation of Christ the Redeemer in the predictions of him, than had been before. Here are three prophecies given at this time that I would take notice of. The fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"I shall see him, but not now; I shall behold him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not nigh: There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth. And Edom shall be a possession, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city." This is a plainer prophecy of Christ, especially with regard to his kingly office, than any that had been before. But we have another, that God gave by Moses, that is plainer still, especially with regard to his prophetical office, in Deut. xviii.18. &amp;c. "I will raise up a prophet from among their brethren, like thee, and will put my words into his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I command him," &amp;c. This is a plainer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of Christ than any that had been before, in this respect, that all the prophecies that had been before of Christ, were in figurative mystical language. The first prophecy was so, That the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head. The promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, "That in their seed all the families of the earth should be blessed," were also mystical; which prophecy is not so particular, because the expression, <hi>thy seed,</hi> is general, and not plainly limited to any particular person. The prophecy of Jacob in blessing Judah, Gen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> xlix.8. is in mystical language;

                  <p>There are several things contained in this prophecy of Christ. Here is hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> mediatorial office in general, ver. 16. Here it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed how he should be a person to stand between them and God, that was so terrible a being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a being of such awful majesty, holiness, and justice, that they could not have come to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with him immediately, without a mediator to stand between them; because, if they came to such a dreadful sin-revenging God immediately, they should die; God would prove a consuming fire to them. And then here is a particular revelation of Christ with respect to his prophetical office: "I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee," &amp;c. Further, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed what kind of a prophet he should be, a prophet like Moses, who was the head and leader of all the people, and who, under God, had been their redeemer, to bring them out of the house of bondage, was as it were their shepherd by whom God led them through the Red sea and wilderness, and was an intercessor for them with God, and was both a prophet and a king in the congregation; for Moses had the power of a king among them. It is said of him, Deut. xxxiii.5. he was king in Jeshurun, and he was the prophet by whom God as it were built up his church, and delivered his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions of worship. Thus Christ was to be a prophet like unto Moses; so that this is both the plainest and fullest prophecy of Christ that ever had been from the beginning of the world to this time.</p>
                  <p>The next prophecy that I shall take notice of, respects only the calling of the Gentiles, which should be after Christ's coming, of which God gave a very plain prophecy by Moses in the wilderness, Deut. xxxil 21. Here is a very plain prophecy of the rejection of the Jews and calling the Gentiles. They moved God to jealousy, by that which was not a god<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by casting him off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and taking other gods, that were no gods, in his room. So God declares that he will move them to jealousy in the like manner, by casting them off, and taking other people, that had not been his people, in their room. The Apostle Paul takes notice of this prophecy, as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling the calling of the Gentiles, in Rom. x.19 20 "But I say, Did not Israel know? "First, Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you. But Es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus you see how the light of the gospel, which first began to dawn and glimmer immediately after the fall, gradually increases the nearer we come to Christ's time.</p>

The generation that was grown up when they came out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, was a very froward and perverse generation. They were tainted with the idolatry and wickedness of Egypt, and were not weaned from it, as the Prophet Ezekiel takes notice, Ezek. xx.6.7.8. Hence they made the golden calf in imitation of the idolatry of Egypt, that was wont to worship a bull or an ox; and therefore cattle are called <hi>the abomination of the Egyptians, i. e.</hi> their idol. This generation God was exceeding angry with, and swore in his wrath, that they should not enter into his rest. But the younger generation were not so; the generation that were under twenty years old when they came out of Egypt, and those that were born in the wilderness, the generation spoken of Numb. xiv.31. "But yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This was the generation with whom the covenant was renewed, as we have an account in Deuteronomy, and that entered into the land of Canaan. This generation God was pleased to make a generation to his praise, and they were eminent for piety; as appears by many things said in scripture about them; as, particularly, Jer. ii.2.2. "I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown. Israel was holiness to the Lord, and the first fruits of his increase." Here the generation that went after God in the wilderness is spoken of with very high commendations, as eminent for holiness: Israel was holiness to the Lord, and the first fruits of his increase. Their love to God is spoken of as distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished like the love of a bride at her espousals. The going after God in the wilderness that is here spoken of, is not the going of the children of Israel out of Egypt into the wilderness of Sinai, but their following God through that dreadful wilderness, that the congregation long w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"Who led thee thro' the great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water." Though this generation had a much greater trial, than the generation of their fathers had before they came to Kadesh-Barnea, yet they never murmured against God in any wise, as their fathers had done: But their trials had a contrary effect upon them, to awaken them, convince, and humble them, and fit them for great mercy. They were awakened by those awful judgments of God that he inflicted on their fathers, whereby their carcasses fell in the wilderness.

We find that such solemn renovations of the covenant commonly accompanied any remarkable pouring out of the Spirit, causing a general reformation: So we find it was in Hezekiah's and Josiah's times. It is questionable whether there ever was a time of so great a flourishing of religion in the Israelitis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Thus God at this time did gloriously advance the work of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both by his word and Spirit. By this pouring out of the Spirit of God, the work of redemption was promoted, not only as it was in itself a glorious instance of the carrying on of that redemption in the application of it, but as this was what God made use of as a means of the good and orderly establishment of the church of Israel at its first beginning, when it was first settled in the regular obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of God's ordinances in Canaan: Even as the pouring out of the Spirit, in the beginning of the Christian church, was a great means God made use of for the well establishing the Christian church in the world in all succeeding ages.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. The next thing I would observe, is God's bringing the people of Israel under the hand of Joshua, and settling them in that land where Christ was to be born, and which was the great type of the heavenly Canaan, which Christ has purchased. This was done by Joshua, who was of Joseph's posterity, and was an eminent type of Christ, and is therefore called the shepherd, the stone of Israel, in Jacob's blessing of Joseph, Gen. xlix.24. Being such a type of Christ, he bore the name of Christ. <hi>Joshua</hi> and <hi>Jesus</hi> are the same name, only the one is Hebrew, the other is Greek: And therefore, in the New Testament, which was originally written in G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>God wonderfully possessed his people of this land, conquering the former inhabitants of it, and the mighty glants, as Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the devil; first conquering the great kings of that part of the land that was on the eastern side of Jordan, Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan; and then dividing the river Jordan, as before he had done the Red sea; causing the walls of Jericho to fall down at the sound of the trumpets of the priests<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

that sound typifying the sound of the gospel by the preaching of gospel-ministers, the walls of the accursed city Jericho signifying the walls of Satan's kingdom; and after this wonderfully destroying the mighty host of the Amorites under the five kings, causing the sun and moon to stand still, to help the people against their enemies, at the prayer of the typical Jesus; plainly holding this forth, that God would make the whole course of nature to be subservient to the affair of redemption; so that every thing should yield to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of that work, and give place to the welfare of God's redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people.</p>
                  <p>Thus did Christ show his great love to his elect, that he would make the course of nature, in the frame of the world, that he had made, and that he governed, to give place to their happiness and prosperity; and showed that the sun and moon, and all things, visible and invisible, were theirs by his purchase. At the same time, Christ fought as the Captain of their host, and cast down great hail stones upon their enemies, by which more were slain than by the sword of the children of Israel. After this Christ gave the people a mighty victory over a yet greater army in the northern part of the land, that were gathered together at the waters of Merom, as the sand of the sea-shore, as it is said Josh. xi.4.</p>
                  <p>Thus God gave the people whence Christ was to proceed, the land where he was to be born, and live, and preach, and work miracles, and die, and rise again, whence he was to ascend into heaven, as the land which was a great type of heaven: Which is another thing whereby a great advance was made in the affair of redemption.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. Another thing that God did towards carrying on this affair, was his actually setting up his stated worship among the people, as it had been before instituted in the wilderness.

Yet they were remarkably preserved throughout all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations at such seasons, agreeable to the promise that God had made Exod. xxxiv 24. "Neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the Lord thy God thrice in the year." So wonderfully did God order affairs, and influence the hearts of their enemies, that though they were so full of enmity against Israel, and desired to dispossess them of their land, and had so fair an opportunity so often in their hands, that the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was left naked and empty of all that could resist them, and it would have been only for them to have gone and taken possession, and they could have had it without opposition, and they were so eager to take other opportunities against them; yet we never read, in all their history, of any of their enemies taking these oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities against them: which could be no less than a continual miracle, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="14">XIV. God's preserving his church and the true religion from being wholly extinct in the frequent apostasies of the Israelites in the time of the judges.

                  <p n="15">XV. God's preserving that nation from being destroyed, and delivering them from time to time, although they were so often subdued and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But yet God, in all these dangers, preserved them, and kept them from being wholly overthrown; and from time to time, when it was come to extremity, and God saw that they were upon the very brink of ruin, then God raised up a deliverer, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Deut. xxxii, 36. "For the Lord shall judge his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and repent himself for his servants; when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Those remarkable despensations of Providence are very livelily and elegantly set forth by the Psalmist, Psal. cvi.34. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>These deliverers that God raised up from time to time were all types of Christ, the great redeemer and deliverer of his church; and some of them very remarkably so; as, particularly, Barak, Jepht<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="16">XVI. It is observable, that when Christ appeared to manage the affairs of his church in this period, he often appeared in the form of that nature that he took upon him in his incarnation. So he seems to have appeared to Moses from time to time, and particularly at that time when God spake to him face to face, as a man speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his friend, and he beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ld the similitude of the Lord (Numb. xii.8.), after he had besought him to show him his glory; which was the most remarkable vision that ever he had of Christ. There was a twofold discovery that Moses had of Christ: one was spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, made to his mind, by the word that was proclaimed, when he proclaimed his name, saying, "The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the childrens
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:017525_0073_0FA12ADCAFFF0878"/>
children, unto the third and to the fourth generation," Exod. xxxiv.6. &amp;c. Another was external; which was that which Moses saw, when Christ passed by, and put him in a cleft of the rock, and covered him with his hand, so that Moses saw his back parts. What he saw was doubtless the back parts of a glorious human form, in which Christ appeared to him, and in all likehood the form of his glorified human nature, in which he should afterwards appear. He saw not his face; for it is not to be supposed that any man could subsist un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a fight of the glory of Christ's human nature as it now appears.</p>
                  <p>So it was an human form in which Christ appeared to the seventy elders, of which we have an account. Exod. xxiv.9 10.11. "Then went up Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel. And they saw the God of Israel: and there was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet, as it were a paved work of a sapphire-stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness. And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink." So Christ appeared afterwards to J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>shua in the form of the human nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sh. v.13.14, "And it came to pass when J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>shua was by Jericho, he lift up his eyes, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and behold, there stood <hi>a man</hi> over against him, with a sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us or for our adversaries? And he said Nay, but a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> captain or the host of the Lord am I now come" And so he appeared to Gideon, Judg. vi.11. &amp;c. and so also to Manoah Judg. xiii.17.—21. Here Christ appeared to Manoah in a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation both of his incarnation and death; of his incarnation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> that he appeared in a human form; and of his death and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, represented by the sacrifice of a kid, and by his ascending up in the flame of the sacrifice; intimating that it was he that was the great sacrifice, that must be offered up to God for a sweet sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, in the fire of his wrath, as that kid was burned and ascended up in the flame. Christ thus appeared, time after time, in the form or that nature he was afterwards to take upon him; because he now appeared on the same design, and to carry on the same work, that he was to appear in that nature to work out and carry on.</p>
                  <p n="17">XVII. Another thing I would mention, done in this period to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the work of redemption, is the beginning of a succession of prophets, and erecting a school of the prophets, in Samuel's time. There was something of this spirit of prophecy in Israel after Moses, before Samuel. Joshua and many of the Judges had a degree of it. Deborah was a prophetess; and some of the high priests were informed with this spirit; particularly Eli: and that space of time was not wholly without instances of those that were set app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> of God especially to this office, and so were called prophets. Such on one we read of, Judg. vi.8. "The Lord sent a porphet unto the
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:017525_0074_0FA12ADD715230B0"/>
children of Israel, which said unto them," &amp;c. Such an one it seems to have been that we read of, 1 Sam. ii.27. "and there came a man of God to Eli," &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But there was no such order of men upheld in Israel for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, before Samuel; the want of it is taken notice of in 2 Sam. iii 1. "And the word of the Lord was precious in those days<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was no open vision." But in Samuel there was begun a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of prophets, that was maintained continually from that time, at least with very little interruption, till this spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy ocased, about Malachi's time: and therefore Samuel is spok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in the New Testament as the beginning of the succession of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Acts iii.24. And all the prophets from Samuel, and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have foretold of these days." After Samuel was Nathan, and Gad and Iddo, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and Asaph, and others. And afterwards, in the latter and of Solomon's reign, we read of Ahijah; and in Jeroboam and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam's time we read of prophets; and so continually one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet succeeded another, till the captivity: We read in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of those prophets that are inserted into the canon of the scip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of prophets as being a constant order of men uph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ld in the land in those days: and in the time of the captivity there were prophets still, as Ezekiel and Daniel; and after the captivity there were prophets, as Zechariah, Higgai, and Malachi.</p>
                  <p>Because God intended a constant succession of prophets from Samuel's time, therefore in his time was begun a school of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; that is, a school of young men, that were trained up under some great prophet, who was their master and teacher in the study of divine things, and the practice of holiness, to fit them for this office as God should call them to it. Those young men that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to these schools, were called <hi>the sons of the prophets</hi>; and oftentimes they are called <hi>prophets.</hi> These at first were under the tuition of Samuel. Thus we read of Samuel's being appointed over them, 1 Sam. xix.20. "And when they saw the company of prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them." The company of prophets that we read of 1 Sam. x.5. were the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Afterwards we read of their being under Elijah. Elisha was one of his sons; but he desired to have a double portion of his spirit, as his successor, as his first-born, as the eldest son was wont to have a double portion of the estate of his father; and therefore the sons of the prophets, when they perceived that the spirit of Elijah re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ted on Elisha, submitted themselves to him, and owned him for their master, as they had done Elijah before him; as you may see, 2 Kings ii.15. "And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho, saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oth rest on Elisha. And they bowed themselves to the ground before him."</p>

                     <pb n="72" facs="unknown:017525_0075_0FA12ADE2DB10968"/>After this Elisha was their master or teacher; he had the care and instruction of them; as you may see, 2 Kings iv.38. "And Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha came again to Gilgal, and there was a dearth in the land, and the sons of the prophets were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In Elijah's and Elisha's time, there were seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places where there resided companies of these sons of the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

It is there said of Huldah the prophetess, that "she dwelt in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, in "the college." They had houses built, where they used to dwell together; and therefore those at Jericho bing multiplied, and finding their house too little for them, desired leave of their master and teacher Elisha, that they might go and he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>At some times there were numbers of these sons of the prophets in Israel; for when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord, it is said, that Obadiah took an hundred of them, and hid them by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> in a cave, 1 Kings xviii.4.</p>
                  <p>These schools of the prophets being set up by Samuel, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards kept up by such great prophets as Elijah and Elisha, must be of divine appointment; and accordingly we find, that those sons of the prophets were often favoured with a degree of inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while they continued under tuition in the schools of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and God commonly, when he called any prophet to the constant exercise of the prophetical office, and to some extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary service, took them out of these schools,—though not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally. Hence the prophet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, speaking of his being called to the prophetical office, says, that he was one that had not been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the schools of the prophets, and was not one of the sons of the prophets. Amos vii.14 15. But Amos's taking notice of it as remarkable, that he should be called to be a prophet that had not been educated at the schools of the prophets, shows that it was God's ordinary manner to take his prophets out of these schools; for therein he did but bless his own institution.</p>
                  <p>Now this remarkable dispensation of Providence that we are upon, viz. God's beginning a constant succession of prophets in in Samuel's time, that was to last many ages; and to that end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing a school of the prophets under Samuel, thenceforward to be continued in Israel, was a step that God took in that great affair of redemption that we are upon.

It was only God that could find him out. His father's house is spoken of as being little in Israel, and he was the youngest of all the sons of his father, and was least expected to be the man that God had chosen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by Samuel. God had before, in the former ages of the world, remarkably distinguished the persons from whom Christ was to come; as he did Seth, and Noah, and Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. But the last we have any account of God's marking out in any notable manner, the very person of whom Christ was to come, was in Jacob's blessing his son Judah; unless we reckon Nahshon's advancement in the wilderness to be the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the tribe of Judah. But this distinction of the person of whom Christ was to come, in David, was very honorable; for it was God's anointing him to be king over his people. There was something further denoted by David's anointing, than was in the anointing of Saul. God anointed Saul to be king personally; but God intended something further by sending Samuel to anoint David, viz. to establish the crown of Israel in him and in his family, as long as Israel continued to be a kingdom; and not only so, but what was infinitely more still, establishing the crown of his universal church, his spiritual Israel, in his seed, to the end of the world, and throughout all eternity.</p>
                  <p>This was a great dispensation of God, and a great step taken towards a further advancing of the work of redemption, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the time drew near wherein Christ was to come. David, as he was the ancestor of Christ, so he was the greatest personal type of Christ of all under the Old Testament. The types of Christ were of three sorts; types of institution, or instituted types, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential and personal types. The ordinance of sacrificing was the greatest of the instituted types; and the redemption out of Egypt was the greatest of the providential types; and David the greatest of the personal types. Hence Christ is often called David in the prophecies of scripture; as Ezek. xxxiv.23.24. "And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David;—My servant David a prince among them" and so in many other places: and he is very often spoken of as the seed of David, and the son of David.</p>
                  <p>David being the ancestor and great type of Christ, his being so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly anointed by God to be king over his people, that the kingdom of his church might be continued in his family for ever, may in some respects be looked on as an anointing of Christ himself.
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:017525_0078_0FA12AE072EEF890"/>
Christ was as it were anointed in him; and therefore Christ's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointing and David's anointing, are spoken of under one in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as Psal. lxxxix.20. "I have found David my servant; wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> my holy oil have I anointed him." And David's throne and Christ's are spoken of as one: Luke i<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 32. "And the Lord shall give him the throne of his father David<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" Acts li, 30. "David—knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to set on his throne." Thus God's beginning of the kingdom of his church in the house of David, was, as it were, a new establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the kingdom of Christ; the beginning of it in a state of such visibility as it thenceforward continued in. It was as it were God's planting the root, whence that branch of righteousness was afterwards to spring up, that was to be the everlasting king of his church; and therefore this everlasting king is called <hi>the branch from the stem of Jesse.</hi> Is. xi.1. "And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots." Jer. xxiii.5, "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise up unto David a righteous branch, and a king shall reign and prosper." So chap. xxxiii.15, "In those d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will cause the branch of righteousness to grow up to David, and he shall execute judgement and righteousness in the land." So Christ in the New Testament, is called <hi>the root and offspring of David,</hi> Rev. xxii.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>It is observable, that God anointed David after Saul to reign in his room. He took away the crown from him and his family, who was higher in stature then any of his people, and was in their eyes fittest to bear rule, to give it to David, who was low of sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in comparison, of despicable appearance: so God was pleased to show how Christ, who appeared despicable, without form or comeliness, and was despised and rejected of men, should take the kingdom from the great ones of the earth. And also it is observable, that David was the youngest of Jesse's sons, as Jacob the younger brother supplanted Esau, and got the birthright and blessing from him: and as Pharez, another of Christ's ancestors, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted Zarah in the birth; and as Isaac, another of the ancestors of Christ, cast out his elder brother Ishmael; thus was that frequent saying of Christ fulfilled, "The last shall be first, and the first last."</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The next thing I would observe, is God's so preserving Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's life, by a series of wonderful providences, till Saul's death. I before took notice of the wonderful preservation of other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular persons that were the ancestors of Christ; as Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob; and have observed how, in that Christ the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer was to proceed from them, that in their preservation, the work of redemption itself may be looked upon as preserved from

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> remarkable than that of any others that have been already taken notice of. How often was it so, that there was but a step between <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>im and death. The first instance of it we have in his encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a lion and a bear, when they had caught a lamb out of his flock, which, without miraculous assistance, could at once have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable instance was, in preserving him from that mighty giant Goliath, who was strong enough to have taken him, and picked him to pieces with his fingers, and given his flesh to the beasts of the field, and to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And how remarkably did God preserve him from being slain by Saul, when he first sought his life, by giving him his daughter to be a snare to him, that the hand of the Philistines might be upon him, requiring him to pay for her by an hundred foreskins of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines, that so his life might be exposed to them; and in preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him afterwards, when Saul spake to Jonathan, and to all his servants, to kill David; and in inclining Jonathan, instead of his killing him, as his father bade him, to love him as his own soul, and to be a great instrument of his preservation, even so as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his own life to preserve David; though one would have thought that none would have been more willing to have David killed than Jonathan, seeing that he was competitor with him for his father's crown; and again saving him, when Saul threw a javelin at him, to smite him even to the wall; and again preserving him when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> town, where Saul thought he was sure of him. How wonderfully was he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from Saul, when he pursued and hunted him in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains? How remarkably did God deliver him in the wilderness of Maon, when Saul and his army were compassing David about? How was he delivered in the cave of Engedi, when, instead of Saul's killing David, God delivered Saul into his hands in the cave, and he cut off his skirt, and might as easily have cut off his head; and afterwards delivering him in like manner in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness of Ziph; and afterwards again preserving him in the land of the Philistines, though David had fought against the Philistines, and conquered them at Keilah, since he was last among them; which one would think, would have been sufficient warning to them not to trust him, or let him escape a second time, if ever they had him in their hands again; but yet now, when they had a second opportunity, God wonderfully turned their hearts to him to be friend and protect him, instead of destroying him.</p>
                  <p>Thus was the precious seed that virtually contained the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and all the blessings of his redemption, wonderfully preserved, when hell and earth were conspired against it to destroy it. How often does David himself take notice of this, with praise and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, in the book of Psalms?</p>
                  <p n="3">III. About this time, the written word of God, or the cannon of scripture, was added to by Samuel. I have before observed, how that the canon of scripture was begun, and the first written word of God, the first written rule of faith and manners that ever was, was given to the church about Moses's time: and many, and I know not but most divines, think it was added to by Joshua, and that he wrote the last chapter of Deuteronomy, and most of the book of Joshua. Others think that Joshua, Judges, Ruth, and part of the first book of Samuel, were writen by Samuel. However that was, this we have good evidence of, that Samuel made an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the canon of scripture; for Samuel is manifestly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the New Testament, as one of the prophets whose writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings we have in the scriptures, in that forementioned Acts iii.24. "Yea and all the prophets from Samuel, and those that follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of those days." By that expression, "as many as have spoken," cannot be meant, as many as have spoken by word of mouth; for never was any prophet but what did that: but the meaning must be, as many as have spoken by writing, so that what they have spoken has come down to us, that we may see what it is.</p>
                  <p>The way that Samuel spoke of these times of Christ and the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:017525_0081_0FA12AE2AE1C17A8"/>
was by giving the history of those thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that typified them, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> pointed to them, particularly the things concerning David that he wrote. The Spirit of God moved him to commit those things to writing, chiefly for that reason, because they pointed to Christ, and the times of the gospel; and, as was said before, this was the main business of all that succession of prophets, that began in Samuel, to foreshow those times.</p>
                  <p>That Samuel added to the canon of the scriptures seems further to appear from 1 Chron. xxix.29. "Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer."</p>
                  <p>Whether the book of Joshua was written by Samuel or not, yet it is the general opinion of divines, that the books of Judges, and Ruth, and part of the first book of Samuel, were penned by him. The book of Ruth was penned for that reason, because though it seemed to treat of private affairs, yet the persons chiefly spoken of in that book were of the family whence David and Christ proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and so pointed to what the apostle Peter observed of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel and the other prophets, in the 3d chapter of Acts. The thus adding to the canon of the scriptutes, the great and main instrument of the application of redemption, is to be looked upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> a further carrying on of that work, and an addition made to that great building.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Another thing God did towards this work, at that time, was his inspiring David to show forth Christ and his redemption, in divine songs, which should be for the use of the church, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worship, throughout all ages. David was himself endued with the spirit of prophecy. He is called <hi>a prophet,</hi> Acts ii.29.30. "Let me freely speak to you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepluchre is with us unto this day: therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ad sworn with an oath," &amp;c. So that herein he was a type of Christ, that he was both a prophet and king. We have no certain account of the time when David was first endued with the spirit of prophecy; but it is manifest, that it either was at the time that Samuel anoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ted him, or very soon after; for he appears soon after acted by this spirit, in the affair of Goliath: and then great part of the psalms were penned in the time of his troubles, before he came to the crown; as might be made manifest by an induction of particulars.</p>
                  <p>The oil that was used in anointing David was a type of the spirit of God; and the type and the antetype were given both together; as we are told, 1 Sam. xvi.13. "Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren; and the spirit of the Lord came down upon David from that day forward:" and it is probable, that it now came upon him in its prophetical influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>

                  <p>This was a great advancement that God made in this building; and the light of the gospel, which had been gradually growing from the fall, was exceedingly increased by it: for whereas before there was but here and there a prophecy given of Christ in a great many ages, now here Christ is spoken of by his ancestor David abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in multitudes of songs, speaking of his incarnation, life, death, resurrection, ascension into heaven, his satisfaction, intercession; his prophetical, kingly, and priestly office; his glorious benefits in this life and that which is to come; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is union with the church, and blessedness of the church in him; the calling of the Gentiles, the future glory of the church near the end of the world, and Christ's coming to the final judgement. All these things, and many more, concerning Christ and his redemption, are abundantly spoken of in the book of Psalms.</p>
                  <p>This was also a glorious advancement of the affair of redemption, as God hereby gave his church a book of divine songs for their use in that part of their public worship, viz. singing his praises, throughout all ages to the end of the world. It is manifest the book of Psalms was given of God for this end. It was used in the church of Israel by God's appointment: this is manifest by the title of many of the psalms, in which they are inscribed to the chief musician. <hi>i. e.</hi> to the man that was appointed to be the leader of divine songs in the temple, in the public worship of Israel. So David is called, <hi>the sweet psalmist of Israel,</hi> because he penned
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:017525_0083_0FA12AE432625C78"/>
psalms for the use of the church of Israel; and accordingly we have an account that they were actually made use of in the church of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael for that end, even ages after David was dead; as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Chron. xxix.30. "Moreover, Hezekiah the king, and the princes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Levites to sing praises unto the Lord, with the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ds of David, and of Asaph the seer." And we find that the same are appointed in the New-Testament to be made use of in the Christian church, in their worship: Eph. v.19. "Speaking to yourselves in <hi>psalms,</hi> hymns, and spiritual songs." Col. iii.16. "Admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another in <hi>psalms,</hi> hymns, and spiritual songs." And so they have been, and will to the end of the world be made use of in the church to celebrate the praises of God. The people of God were wont sometimes to worship God by singing songs to his praise before; as they did at the Red sea; and they had Moses's prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical song, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, and Barak, and Hannah, sung praises to God: but now first did God commit to his church a book of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine songs for their constant use.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. The next thing I would take notice of, is God's actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting David to the throne of Israel, notwithstanding all the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition made to it. God was determined to do it, and he made every thing give place that stood in the way of it. He removed Saul and his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ons out of the way; and first set David over the tribe of Judah; and then, having removed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, set him over all Israel. Thus did God fulfil his word to David. He took him from the sheep cote, and made him king over his people Israel, Psal. lxxxiii.70.71. And now the throne of Israel was establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that family in which it was to continue for ever, even for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Now first it was that God proceeded to chuse a particular city out of all the tribes of Israel to place his name there. There is several times mention made in the law of Moses, of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel's bringing their oblations to the place which God should chuse; as Deut. xii.5.6.7. and so in many other places; but God had never proceeded to do it till now. The ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle and ark were never fixed, but sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another; but now God proceeded to chuse Jerusalem. The city of Jerusalem was never thoroughly conquered, or taken out of the hands of the Jebusites, till David's time. It is said in Joshua xv.63. "As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out: but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day." But now David wholly subdued it, as we have an account in 2 Sam. v. And now God proceeded to chuse that city to place his name there,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:017525_0084_0FA12AE4EC96E6D8"/>
as appears by David's bringing up the ark thither soon after; and therefore this is mentioned afterwards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the first time God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to chuse a city to place his name there, 2 Chron. vi.5.6. and chap. xii.13 Afterwards God proceeded to show David the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> he would have his temple built, viz. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>This city of Jerusalem is therefore called the <hi>holy city</hi>; and it was the greatest type of the church of Christ in all the Old Testament. It was redeemed by David, the captain of the hosts of Israel, out of the hands of the Jebuzites, to be God's city, the holy place of his rest forever, where he would dwell; as Christ, the captain of his people's salvation, redeems his church out of the hands of devils, to be his holy and beloved city. Therefore how often does the scripture, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> speaking of Christ's redemption of his church, call it by the names of <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem?</hi> This was the city that God had appointed to be the place of the first gathering and erecting of the Christian church after Christ's resurrection, of that remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pouring out of the Spirit of God on the apostles and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christians, and the place whence the gospel was to sound forth into all the world; the place of the first Christian church, that was to be, as it were, the mother of all other churches through the world; agreeable to that prophecy, Is. ii.3.4. "Out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem: and he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people," &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus God chose Mount Sion when the gospel was to be sounded forth, as the law had been from Mount Sinai.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. The next thing to be observed here, is God's solemnly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the covenant of grace with David, and promising that the Messiah should be of his seed. We have an account of it in the 7th chapter of the second book of Samuel. It was done on occasion of the thoughts David entertained of building God an house. On this occasion God sends Nathan the prophet to him, with the glorious promises of the covenant of grace. It is especially contained in these words in the 16th verse: "And thy house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee; thy throne shall be established forever." Which promise has respect to Christ, the seed of David, and is fulfilled in him only: for the kingdom of David has long since ceased, any otherwise than as it is upheld in Christ. The temporal kingdom of the house of David has now ceased for a great many ages; much longer than ever it stood.</p>
                  <p>That this covenant that God now established with David by Nathan the prophet, was the covenant of grace, is evident by the plain testimony of scripture, in Is. lv.1.2.3. There we have Christ inviting sinners to come to the waters, &amp;c. And in the 3d verse, he says, "Incline your ear, come unto me; hear, and your souls
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:017525_0085_0FA12AE5ADEA3A08"/>
shall live; and I will make with you an everlasting covenant, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the sure mercies of David." Here Christ offers to poor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> they will come to him, to give them an interest in the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> covenant that he had made with David, conveying to them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>me sure mercies. But what is that covenant that sinners obtain an interest in, when they come to Christ, but the covenant of grace?</p>
                  <p>This was the fifth solemn establishment of the covenant of grace with the church after the fall. The covenant of grace was revealed and established all along. But there had been particular seasons, wherein God had in a very solemn manner renewed this covenant with his church, giving forth a new edition and establishment of it, revealing it in a new manner. This was now the fifth solemn establishment of that covenant. The first was with Adam, the second was with Noah, the third was wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the fourth was in the wilderness by Moses, and now the fifth is this made to David.</p>
                  <p>This establishment of the covenant of grace with David, David always esteemed the greatest smile of God upon him, the greatest honor of all that God had put upon him; he prized it, and rejoiced in it above all the other blessings of his reign. You may see how joyfully and thankfully he received it, when Nathan came to him with the glorious message. in 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sam. vii.18. &amp;c. And so David, in his last words, declares this to be all his salvation, and all his desire; as you may see, 2 Sam. xxiii.5. "He hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and sure: For this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> all my salvation, and all my desire."</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. It was by David that God first gave his people Israel the possession of the whole promised land. I have before shown, how God's giving the possession of the promised land belonged to the covenant of grace. This was done in a great measure by Joshua, but not fully. Joshua did not wholly subdue that part of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised land that was strictly called the land of Canaan, and that was divided by lot to the several tribes; but there were great numbers of the old inhabitants lest unsubdued, as we read in the books of Joshua and Judges; and there were many left to prove Israel, and to be thorns in their sides, and pricks in their eyes. There were the Jeb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sites in Jerusalem, and many of the Canaanites, and the whole nation of the Philistines, who all dwelt in that part of the land that was d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vided by lot, and chiefly in that part of the land that belonged to the tribes of Judah and Ephraim.</p>
                  <p>Thus these remains of the old inhabitants of Canaan continued unsubdued till David's time; but he wholly subdued them all. Which is agreeable to what St. Stephen observes, Acts vii.45. "Which also our fathers brought in with Jesus (<hi>i. e.</hi> Joshua) into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="83" facs="unknown:017525_0086_0FA12AE66DD55A48"/>
unto the days of David." They were till the days of David in driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out, before they had wholly subdued them. But D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>tirely brought them under. He subdued the Jebusites, and he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the whole nation of the Philistines, and all the rest of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the seven nations of Canaan: 1 Chron. xviii.1. "Now after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> and took Gath and her towers out of the hands of the Philistines."</p>
                  <p>After this, all the remains of the former inhabitants of Canaan were made bond-servants to the Israelites. The posterity of the Gibeonites became servants before, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e were of wood, and drawers of water, for the house of God. But Solomon, David's son and successor, put all the other remains of the seven nations of Canaan to bond-service; at least made them pay a tribute of bond-service, as you may see. 1 Kings ix.20.21.22. And hence we read of the children <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Solomon's servants, after the return from the Babylonish captiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>y. Ezra ii.55. and Neh. xi.3. They were the children or posterity of the seven nations of Canaan, that Solomon had subjected to bond-service.</p>
                  <p>Thus David subdued the whole land of Canaan, strictly so called. But then that was not one half, nor quarter, of the land God had promised to their fathers. The land that God had often promised to their fathers, included all the countries from the river o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Egypt to the river Euphrates. These were the bounds of the land promised to Abraham, Gen. xv.18. "In that same day the Lord made a covenant with Abraham, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> river of Egypt, unto the great river, the river Euphrates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So again God promised at Mount Sinai, Exod. xxiii.31. "And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee." <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o again. Deut. xi.24. "Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>read, shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea, shall your coast be." Again, the same promise is made to Joshua: Josh. i.3.4. "Every place that the soul of your feet shall tread upon, have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses; from the wilderness and this Lebanon, even or to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and unto the great sea, towards the going down of the sun, shall be your coast." But the land that Joshua gave the people the possession of, was but a little part of this land. And the people never had had the possession of it, till now when God gave it them by David.</p>
                  <p>This large country did not only include that Canaan that was divided by lot to those who came in with Joshua, but the land of
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:017525_0087_0FA12AE72F40C188"/>
the Moabites and Ammonites, the land of the Amal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bah. All these nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were subdued and brought under the children of Israel by David. And he put garrisons in the several countries, and they became David's servants, as we have a particular account in the 8th chapter of 2d Samuel: and David extended their border to the river Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates, as was promised; see the 3d verse: "And David smo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>dadeger the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates." Accordingly we read, that Solomon his son reigned over all the region on this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the river, 1 Kings iv.24. "For he had dominion over all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion on this side the river, from Tiphsah even unto Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river." This Artaxerxes king of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia takes notice of long after: Ezra iv.20. "There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and tol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, tribute, and custom was paid unto them."</p>
                  <p>So that Joshua, that type of Christ, did but begin the work of giving Israel the possession of the promised land; but left it to be finished by that much greater type and ancestor of Christ, even David, who subdued far more of that land than ever Joshua had done. In this extent of his and Solomon's dominion was some resemblance of the great extent of Christ's kingdom; and therefore the extent of Christ's kingdom is set forth by this very thing, of its being over all lands from the Red sea, to the sea of the Philistines, and over all lands from thence to the river Euphrates; as Psal. lxxii.8. "He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth." See also 1 Kings viii.56.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. God by David perfected the Jewish worship, and added to it several new institutions. The law was given by Moses, but yet all the institutions of the Jewish worship were not given by Moses; some we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So this greatest of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal types of Christ did not only perfect Joshua's work, in giving Israel the possession of the promised land, but he also finished Moses's work, in perfecting the instituted worship of Israel. Thus there must be a number of typical prophets, pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The reason was not, because the kings of Judah, many of them, were better than the kings of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el; but the one had the blessing in them; they were the ancestors of Christ, whose right it was to sit on the throne of Israel. But with the kings of Israel it was not so; and therefore divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence exercised a continual care, through all the changes that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened through so many generations, and such a long space of time, to keep the crown of Judah in one direct line, in fulfilment of the everlasting covenant he had made with David, the mercies of which covenant were sure mercies; but in the other case there was no such covenant, and so no such care of Providence.</p>
                  <p>Here it must not be omitted, that there was once a very strong conspiracy of the kings of Syria and Israel, in the time of that

wicked king of Judah, Ahaz, to dispossess Ahaz and his family of the throne of Judah, and to set one of another family, even the son of Tabeal, on it; as you may see in Is. vii.6. "Let us go up against Judah, and v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There seemed to be so great a likelihood of it, that the hearts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple sunk within them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they gave up the cause. It is said, "The heart of Ahaz and his people was moved as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind." On this occasion God sent the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Isaiah to encourage the people, and tell them that it should not come to pass. And because it looked so much like a gone cause, that Ahaz and the people would very difficulty believe that it would not be, therefore God directs the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>phet to give them, this sign of it, viz. that Christ should be born of the legal seed of Ahaz; as Is. vii.14.
<q>Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign: Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.</q>

                  <p>I have mentioned this dispensation of Providence in this place, because though it was continued for so long a time, yet it began in Solomon's succession to the throne of his father David.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. The next thing I would take notice of is, the building of the temple: a great type of three things, viz. of Christ, especially the human nature of Christ; of the church of Christ; and of heaven. The tabernacle seemed rather to represent the church in its moveable, changeable state, here in this world. But that beautiful, glorious, costly structure of the temple, that succeeded the tabernacle, and was a fixed, and not a moveable thing, seems especially to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the church in its glorified <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>eh; as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen."</p>
                  <p>This was the house where Christ dwelt, till he came to dwell in the temple of his body, or human nature, which was the antetype
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:017525_0093_0FA12AECC6CB5588"/>
of this temple; as appears, because Christ, on occasion of showing him the temple of Jerusalem, says, "Destroy this temple, and in three days will I raise it up," speaking of the temple of his body, John ii.19.20. This house, or an house built in this place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to be the house of God, the place of the worship of his church, till Christ came. Here was the place that God chose, where all their sacrifices were offered up, till the great sacrifice came, and made the sacrifice and oblation to cease. Into his temple in this place the Lord came, even the messenger of the covenant. Here he often delivered his heavenly doctrine, and wrought miracles; here his church was gathered by the pouring out of the Spirit, after his ascension. Luke xxiv.53. speaking of the disciples, after Christ's ascension, it is said, "And they were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God." And, Acts ii.46. speaking of the multitudes that were converted by that great outpouring of the Spirit that was on the day of Pentecost, it is said, "And they continued daily with one accord in the temple." And, Acts v.42. speaking of the apostles, "And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ." Hence the sound of the gospel went forth, and the church spread into all the world.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. It is here worthy to be observed, that at this time, in Solomon's reign, after the temple was finished, the Jewish church was risen to its highest external glory. The Jewish church, or the ordinances and constitution of it, is compared to the moon, in Rev. xii.1. "And there appeared a great wonder in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars." As this church was like the moon in many other respects, so it was in this, that it waxed and waned like the moon. From the first foundation of it, that was laid in the covenant made with Abraham, when this moon was now beginning to appear, it had to this time been gradually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing in its glory. This time, wherein the temple was finished and dedicated, was about the middle between the calling of Abraham and the coming of Christ, and now it was full moon. After this the glory of the Jewish church gradually decreased, till Christ came; as I shall have occasion more particularly to observe afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Now the church of Israel was in its highest external glory: Now Israel was multiplied exceedingly, so that they seemed to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like the sand on the sea shore, 1 Kings iv.20. Now the kingdom of Israel was firmly established in the right family, the family of which Christ was to come: Now God had chosen the city where he would place his name: Now God had fully given his people the possession of the promised land; and they now possessed the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of it all in quietness and peace, even from the river of Egypt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="91" facs="unknown:017525_0094_0FA12AED37F2C8D0"/>
to the great river Euphrates; all those nations that had formerly been their enemies, quietly submitted to them; none pretended to rebel against them:—Now the Jewish worship in all its ordinances was fully settled:—Now, instead of a moveable tent and taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, they had a glorious temple; the most magnificent, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and costly structure, that there was then, ever had been, or ever has been since: Now, the people enjoyed peace and plenty, and every man sat under his vine and fig-tree, eating and drinking, and making merry as 1 Kings iv 20.:—Now they were in the highest pitch of earthly prosperity, silver being as plenty as stones, and the land full of gold and precious stones, and other precious foreign commodities, which were brought by Solomon's ships from Ophir, and which came from other parts of the world:—Now they had a king reigning over them that was the wisest of men, and probably the greatest earthly prince that ever was:—Now their fame went abroad into all the earth, so that they came from the utmost parts of the earth to see their glory and their happiness.</p>
                  <p>Thus God was pleased, in one of the ancestors of Christ, remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to shadow forth the kingdom of Christ reigning in his glory. David, that was a man of war, a man who had shed much blood, and whose life was full of troubles and conflicts, was more of a representation of Christ in his state of humiliation, his militant state, wherein he was conflicting with his enemies. But Solomon, that was a man of peace, was a representation more especially of Christ exalted, triumphing, and reigning in his kingdom of peace. And the happy glorious state of the Jewish church at that time, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably represent two things: 1. That glorious state of the church on earth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The future glorified state of the church in heaven. The earthly Canaan never was so lively a type of the heavenly Canaan, as it was then, when the happy people of Israel did indeed enjoy it as a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. After this the glory of the Jewish church gradually declined more and more till Christ came; yet not so but that the work of redemption still went on. Whatever failed or declined, God still carried on this work from age to age; this building was still ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing higher and higher. Things still went on, during the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of the Jewish church, towards a further preparation of things for the coming of Christ, as well as during its increase; for so wonderfully were things ordered by the infinitely wise governor of the world, that whatever happened was ordered for good to this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral design, and made a means of promoting it. When the people of the Jews flourished, and were in prosperity, he made that to contribute to the promoting this design; and when they were in adversity, God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> that also to contribute to the carrying on of the same desig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>, the work of redemption was carried on by their increase; and when they came to their declining state, which they were in from Solomon's time till Christ, God carried on the work of redemption by that. That decline itself was one thing that God made use of as a further preparation for Christ's coming.</p>
                  <p>As the moon, from the time of its full, is approaching nearer and nearer to her conjunction with the sun; so her light is still more and more decreasing, till at length, when the conjunction comes, it is wholly swallowed up in the light of the sun.

                  <p>God, by this gradual decline of the Jewish state and church from Solomon's time, prepared the way for the coming of Christ several ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The decline of the glory of this legal dispensation, made way for the introduction of the more glorious dispensation of the gospel. The decline of the glory of the legal dispensation, was to make way for the introduction of the evangelical dispensation, that was so much more glorious, that the legal dispensation had no glory in comparison with it. The glory of the ancient dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, such as it was in Solomon's time, consisting so much in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal glory, was but a childish glory, compared with the spiritual glory of the dispensation introduced by Christ. The church, under the Old Testament, was a child under tutors and governors, and God dealt with it as a child. Those pompous externals are called by the apostle, <hi>weak and beggarly elements.</hi> It was fit that those things should be diminished as Christ approached; as John the Baptist, the fore-runner of Christ, speaking of Christ, says, "He must increase, but I must decrease." John iii.30. It is fit that the twinkling stars should gradually withdraw their glory, when the sun is approaching towards his rising. The glory of the Jewish dispensation must be gradually diminished, to prepare the way for the more joyful reception of the spiritual glory of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. If the Jewish church, when Christ came, had been in the same external glory that it was in, in the reign of Solomon, men would have had their eyes so daz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This gradual decline of the glory of the Jewish state, tended to prepare the way for Christ's coming another way, viz. as it tended to make the glory of God's power, in the great effects of Christ's redemption, the more conspicuous. God's people's being so diminished and weakened by one step after another, till Christ came, was very much like the diminishing Gideon's army. God told Gideon, that the people that was with him, was too many for him to deliver the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel should vaunt themselves against him, saying, "My own hand hath saved me." Therefore all that were fearful were commanded to return; and there returned twenty and two thousand, and there remained ten thousand. But still they were too many; and then, by trying the people at the water, they were reduced to three hundred men. So the people in Solomon's time were too many, and mighty and

glorous for Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore he diminished them; first, by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the ten tribes; and then he diminished them again by the captivity into Babylon; and then they were further diminished by the great and general corruption that there was when Christ came; so that Christ found very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>I have taken notice of this dispensation of providence in the gradual decline of the Jewish church in this place, because it began in the reign of Solomon.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. I would here take notice of the additions that were made to the canon of scripture in or soon after the reign of Solomon. There were considerable additions made by Solomon himself, who wrote the books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, probably near the close of his reign. His writing the Song of Songs, as it is called, is what is especially here to be taken notice of, which is wholly on the subject that we are upon, viz Christ and his redemption, representing the high and glorious relation, and union, and love, that is between Christ and his redeemed church. And the history of the scripture seems, in Solomon's reign, and some of the next succeeding reigns, to have been added to by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets Nathan and A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the ten tribes had generally and finally forsaken the true worship of God, God kept up the true religion in the kingdom of Judah; and when they corrupted themselves, as they very often did exceedingly, and idolatry was ready totally to swallow all up, yet God kept the lamp alive, and was often pleased when things seemed to be come to an extremity, and religion at its last gasp, to grant blessed revivals by remarkable out pourings of his Spirit, particularly in Hezekiah's and Jos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The most remarkable instance of this kind that we have, was the preservation of the book of the law in the time of the great apostasy during the greatest part of the long reign of Manassah, which lasted fifty-five years, and then after that the reign of Am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

In Josiah's time, when they came to repair the temple, it was found buried in rubbish, after it had been lost so long that Josiah himself seems to have been much a stranger to it till now.

                     </gap>. The visible church of Christ from Solomon's reign, was mainly in the tribe of Judah. The tribe of Benjamin, that was annexed to them, was but a very small tribe, and the tribe of Judah exceeding large; and as Judah took Benjamin under his covert when he went into Egypt to bring corn, so the tribe of Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min seemed to be under the covert of Judah ever after: and though<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on occasion of Jeroboam's setting up the calves at Bethel and Dan, the Levites resorted to Judah out of all the tribes of Israel, (2 Chron xi.13.); yet they were also small, and not reckoned among the tribes: and though many of the ten tribes did also on that occasion, for the sake of the worship of God in the temple, leave their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances in their several tribes, and removed and settled in Judah, and so were incorporated with them, as we have account in the chapter just quoted, and 16th verse; yet the tribe of Judah was so much the prevailing part, that they were called by one name, they were called <hi>Judah</hi>

So when the ten tribes were carried captive, it is said, there was none left but the tribe of Judah only: 2 Kings xvii.18 "Therefore the Lord was very wroth with Israel, and removed them out of his sight; there was none left but the tribe of Judah only" Whence they were all called <hi>Jews,</hi> which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

was wonderfully preserved from destruction during this period, when they often seemed to be upon the brink of ruin, and just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be swallowed up. So it was in Rehoboam's time, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So it was again in Abijah's time, when Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men; a mighty army indeed. We read of it, 2 Chron. xiii.3. Then God wrought deliverance to Judah, out of regard to the covenant of grace estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished with David, as is evident by ver 4. and 5.; and the victory they abtained was because the Lord was on their side, as you may see, ver. 12 So it was again in Asa's time, when Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rah the Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian came against him with a yet larger army of a thousand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand and three hundred chariots, 2 Chron. xiv.9. On this occasion Asa cried to the Lord, and tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"And Asa cried unto the Lord his God, and said, Lord, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with thee to help, whether with many, or with those that have no power." Accordingly God gave them a glorious victory over this mighty host.</p>
                  <p>So again it was in Jehoshaphat's time, when the children of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab, and the children of Ammon, and the inhabitants of Mount Seir, combined together against Judah with a mighty army, a force vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y superior to any that Jehoshaphat could raise; and Jehoshaphat and his people were greatly afraid: yet they set themselves to seek God on this occasion, and trusted in him; and God told them by one of his prophets, that they need not fear them, nor should they have any occasion to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

According to his direction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they only stood still, and sang praises to God, and God made their enemies do the work themselves, and set them to killing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the children of Judah had nothing to do, but to gather the spell, which was more than they could carry away. We have the story in 2 Chron. xx.</p>
                  <p>So it was again in Ahaz's time, when Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, the king of Israel, conspired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Judah, and seemed to be sure of their purpose; of which we have spoken already. So it was again in Hezekiah's time, when Sennacherib, that great king of Assyria, and head of the greatest monarchy that was then in the world, came up against all the fenced cities of Judah, after he had conquered most of the neighbouring countries, and sent Rabshakeh, the captain of his host, against Jerusalem, who came, and in a very proud and scornful manner insulted Hezekiah and his people, as being sure of victory; and
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:017525_0100_0FA12AF1AFE09780"/>
the people were trembling for fear, like lambs before a lion. Then God sent Isaiah the prophet to comfort them, and assure them that they should not prevail; as a token of which he gave them this sign, viz that the earth, for two years successively, should bring forth food of itself, from the roots of the old stalks, without their plowing or sowing; and then the third year they should sow and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them, and live on the fruits of their labour, as they were wont to do before. See a Kings xix.29. This is mentioned as a type of what is promised in ver. 30.31. "And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah, shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape, out of Mount Zion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this." The corn's springing again after it had been cut off with the fickle, and bringing forth another crop from the roots, that seemed to be dead, and so once and again, represents the church's reviving again, as it were out of its own ashes, and flourishing like a plant after i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the enemies of the church have done their utmost, and seem to have gained their point, and to have overthrown the church, so that the being of it is scarcely visible, but like a living root hid under ground; yet there is a secret life in it that will cause it to flourish again, and to take root downward, and bear fruit upward.

<pb n="98" facs="unknown:017525_0101_0FA12AF26FD27E20"/>
is probably that which we have in the first book of Kings. The history of Israel seems to have been further carried on by Iddo and Shemaiah: 2 Chron. xii.15. "Now the acts of Rhehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and Iddo the seer, concerning genealogies?" And after that the history seems to have been further carried on by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Jehu, the son of Hanani: 2 Chron. xx.34. "Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel," as we find him to be 1 Kings xvi.1.7. And then it was further continued by the prophet Isaiah: 2 Chron. xxvi.22. "Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet the son of Amos write." He probably did it as well in the second book of Kings, as in the book of his prophecy. And the history was carried on and finished by other prophets after him.</p>
                  <p>Thus the prophets, even from Samuel's time, had from time to time been adding to the cannon of scripture by their historical writings. But now, in the days of Uzziah, did God first raise up a set of great prophets, not only to write histories, but to write books of their prophecies. The first of these is thought to be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea the son of Beeri, and therefore his prophecy, or the word of the Lord by him, is called <hi>the beginning of the word of the Lord</hi>; as Hos. i.2. "The beginning of the word of the Lord by Hosea;" that is, the beginning, or the first part, of the written word of that kind, viz. that which is written in books of prophecy. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel. There were many other witnesses for God raised up about the same time to commit their prophecies to writing, Isaiah, and Amos, and Jonah, and Micah, and Nahum, and probably some others; and so from that time forward God seemed to continue a succession of writing prophets.</p>
                  <p>This was a great dispensation of Providence, and a great advance made in the affair of redemption, which appears, if we consider what was said before, that the main business of the prophets was to foreshew Christ and his redemption. They were all forerunners of the great prophet. The main and why the spirit of prophecy was given them was, that they might give testimony to Jesus Christ, the great Redeemer, that was to come; and therefore the testimony of Jesus, and the spirit of prophecy, are spoken of as the same thing: Rev. xix.10. "And I f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll at his feet to worship him: and he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy." Therefore we
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:017525_0102_0FA12AF32F90C200"/>
find, that the great and main thing that the most of the prophets in their written prophecies insisted upon, is Christ and his redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the glorious times of the gospel, which should be in the latter days, according to their manner of expression. Though many other things were spoken of in their prophecies, yet it seems to be only as introductory to their prophecy of these great things. Whatever they prophesy of, here their prophecies commonly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, as you may see by a careful perusal of their writings.</p>
                  <p>These prophets were set to writing their prophecies by the Spirit of Christ that was in them, chiefly for that end, to foreshow and prepare the way for the coming of Christ, and the glory that should follow. In what an exalted strain do they all speak of those things! Many other things they speak of in men's usual language. But when they come upon this subject, what a joyful heaven sublimity is there in the language they use about it! Some of them are very particular and full in their predictions of these things, and above all the Prophet Isaiah, who is therefore deservedly called the <hi>evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical prophet.</hi> He seems to teach the glorious doctrines of the gospel almost as plainly as the Apostles did, who preached after Christ was actually come. The Apostle Paul therefore takes notice, that the Prophet Esai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> is very bold, Rom. x.20. i. e. as the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word, as used in the New Testament, is very plain, he speaks out very plainly and fully; so being "very bold" is used 2 Cor. iii.12. we use "great plainness of speech," or "boldness," as it is in the margin.</p>
                  <p>How plainly and fully does the Prophet Isaiah describe the manner and circumstances, the nature and end, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the sufferings and sacrifice of Christ, in the 53d chapter of his prophecy. There is scarce a chapter in the New Testament itself which is more full on it! and how much, and in what a glorious strain, does the same prophet speak from time to time of the glorious benefits of Christ, the unspeakable blessings which shall redound to his church through his redemption! Jesus Christ, the person that this prophet spoke so much of, once appeared to Isaiah in the form of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, the nature that he should afterwards take upon him. We have an account of it in the 6th chapter of his prophecy at the beginning: "I saw also the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple," &amp;c. This was Christ that Isaiah now saw, as we are expressly told in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. See John xii.39.40.41.</p>
                  <p>If we consider the abundant prophecies of this and the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, what a great increase is there of the light of the gospel, which had been growing from the fall of man to this day? How plentiful are the revelations and prophecies of Christ now, to what they were in the first period of the Old Testament, from Adam to Noah? or

                  <p>BUT before I enter upon particulars, I would observe in three things wherein this period is distinguished from the prec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ding periods of the times of the Old Testament.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though we have no account of a great part of this period in the scripture-history, yet the events of this period are more the subject of scripture-prophecy, than any of the preceding periods. There are two ways wherein the scripture gives account of the events by which the work of redemption is carried on; one is by history, and another is by prophecy: and in one or the other of these way<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> we have contained in the scriptures an account how the work of redemption is carried on from the beginning to the end. Although the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>per history of the whole, yet there is contained the whole chain of great events by which this aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y or prophecy.</p>
                  <p>It is to be observed, that were the scripture is wanting in one of these ways, it is made up in the other. Where scripture-history fails, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e prophecy takes place: so that the account is still car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, and the chain is not broken, till we come to the very last link of it in the consummation of all things.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly it is observable of this period or space of time that we are upon, that though it is so much less the subject of scripture-history, than most of the preceding periods, so that there is above <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>our hundred years of it that the scriptures gives us no history of;
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:017525_0104_0FA12AF4AEFE3660"/>
yet the events of this period are more the subject of scripture-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, than the events of all the preceding periods put together. Most of those remarkable prophecies of the book of Daniel do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to events that were accomplished in this period: so most of those prophecies of Isaiah, and Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, against Babylon, and Tyrus, and against Egypt, and many other nations, were fulfilled in this period.</p>
                  <p>So that the reason why the scripture gives us no history of so great a part of this period, is not because the events of this period were not so important, or less worthy to be taken notice of, than the events of the foregoing periods? for I shall hereafter show how great and distingushedly remarkable the events of this period were. But there are several other reasons which may be given of it. One is, that it was the will of God that the spirit of prophecy should cease in this period, (for reasons that may be given hereafter); so that there were no prophets to write the history of these times; and therefore God designing this, took care that the great events of this period should not be without mention in his word; and so ordered it, that the prophecies of scripture should be more full h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re, than in the preceding periods. It is observable, that that set of writing prophets that God raised up in Israel, were raised up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>at the latter end of the foregoing period, and at the beginning of this; which it is likely was partly for that reason, that the time was now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, of which the spirit of prophecy having ceased, there was to be no scripture-history, and therefore no other scripture-account but what was given in prophecy.</p>
                  <p>Another reason that may be given why there was so great a part of this period left without an historical account in scripture, is, that God in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>is providence took care, that there should be authentic and full accounts of the events of this period preserved in profane history. It is remarkable, and very worthy to be taken notice of, that with respect to the events of the five preceding periods, of which the scriptures give the history, profane history gives us no account, or at least of but very few of them. There are many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous and uncertain accounts of things that happened before; but the beginning of the times of authentic profane history is judged to be but a little before Nebuchadnezzar's time, about an hundred years before. The learned men among the Greeks and Romans, used to call the ages before that <hi>the fabulous age</hi>; but the times after that they called <hi>the historical age.</hi> From about that time to the coming of Christ, we have undoubted accounts in profane history of the principal events; accounts that wonderfully agree with the many prophecies that we have in scripture of those times.</p>
                  <p>Thus did the great God, that disposes all things, order it. He took care to give an historical account of things from the beginning
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:017525_0105_0FA12AF56F44C0F8"/>
of the world, though all those former ages which profane history does not reach, and ceased not till he came to those later ages in which profane history related things with some certainty: and concerning those times, he gives us abundant account in prophecy, that by comparing profane history with those prophecies, we might see the agreement.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This period being the last period of the Old Testament, and the next to the coming of Christ, seems to have been remarkably distinguished from all others in the great revolutions that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the nations of the earth, to make way for the kingdom of Christ. The time now drawing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>igh, wherein Christ, the great King and Saviour of the world, was to come, great and mighty were the changes that were brought to pass in order to it. The way had been preparing for the coming of Christ from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of man, through all the foregoing periods: but now the time drawing nigh, things began to rip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n apace for Christ's coming; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore divine providence wrought wonderfully now. The greatest revolutions that any history whatsoever gives an account of, that ever had been from the flood, fell out in this period. Almost all the then known world, i. e. all the nations that were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound about the land of Canaan, far and near, that were within the reach of their knowledge, were overturned again and again. All lands were in their turns subdued, captivated, and as it were emptied, and turned upside down, and that most of them repeatedly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this period; agreeable to that prophecy, Is. xxiv.1. "Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty; he maketh it wasts, and turneth is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.</p>
                  <p>This emptying, and turning upside down, began with God's vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible church, in their captivity by the king of Babylon. Then the cup from them went round to all other nations, agreeable to what God revealed to the Prophet Jeremiah, xxv.15.—27. Here spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial respect seems to be had to the great revolutions that there were on the face of the earth in the times of the Babylonish empire. But after that there were three general overturnings of the world before Christ came, in the succession of the three great monarchies of the world that were after the Babylonish empire. The king of Babylon is represented in scripture as overturning of the world; but after that, the Babylonish empire was overthrown by Cyrus; who founded the Persian empire in the room of it; which was of much greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent than the Babylonish empire in its greatest glory. Thus the world was overturned the second time. After that, the Persian empire was overthrown by Alexander, and the Grecian empire was set up upon the ruins of it; which was still of much greater extent than the Persian empire: and thus there was a general overturning of the world a third time. After that, the Grecian empire was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:017525_0106_0FA12AF6305824F8"/>
by the Romans, and the Roman empire was established; which vastly exceeded all the foregoing empires in power and extent of dominion. And so the world was overturned the fourth time.</p>
                  <p>These several monarchies, and the great revolutions of the world under them, are abundantly spoken of in the prophecies of Daniel. They are represented in Nebuchadnezzer's image of gold, silver, brass, and iron, and Daniel's interpretation of it in the second chapter of Daniel; and then in Daniel's vision of the four beasts, and the angel's interpretation of it in the seventh chapter of Daniel. And the succession of the Persian and Grecian monarchies is more particularly represented in the eighth chapter in Daniel's vision of the ram and the he-goat, and again in the 11th chapter of Daniel.</p>
                  <p>Besides these four general overturnings of the world, the world was kept in a constant tumult between whiles: and indeed the world was as it were in a continual convulsion through the whole period till Christ came. Before this period, the face of the earth was comparatively in quietness: though they were many great wars among the nations, yet we read of no such mighty and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal convulsions and overturnings as there were in this period. The nations of the world, most of them, had long remained on their lees as it were, without being empted from vessel to vessel, as is said of Moab, Jer. xlviii.11. Now these great overturnings were because the time of the great Messiah draw nigh. That they were to prepare the way for Christ's coming, is evident by scripture particularly by Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k. xxi.22. "I will overturn, overturn, overturn it, and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is, and I will give it him." The prophet, by repeating the word <hi>overturn</hi> three times, has respect to the three overturnings, as in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, viii.13 The repetition of the word <hi>wo</hi> three times, signifies three distinct woes; as appears by what follows, ix.12. "One wo is past;" and xi.14. "The second wo is past, and behold the third wo cometh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ckly."</p>
                  <p>It must be noted, that the Prophet Ezekiel prophesied in the time of the Babylonish captivity; and therefore there were three great and general overturnings of the world to come after this prophecy, before Christ came; the first by the Persians, the second by the Grecians, the third by the Romans; and then after that Christ, whose right it was to take the diadem, and reign, should come. Here these great overturnings are evidently spoken of as preparatory to the coming and kingdom of Christ But to understand the words aright, we must note the particular expression, "I will overturn, overturn, overturn <hi>it</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" i. e. the diadem and crown of Israel, or the supreme temporal dominion over God's visible people. This God said should be no more, i. e. the crown should be taken off, and the diadem removed, as it is said in the foregoing verse. The
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:017525_0107_0FA12AF6ED9CBE18"/>
supreme power over Israel should be no more in the royal line of David, to which it properly belonged, but should be removed away, and given to others, and overturned from one to another: First the supreme power over Israel should be in the hands of the Persians; and then it should be overturned again; and then it should be in the hands of the Grecians; and then it should be overturned again, and come into the hands of the Romans, and should be no more in the line of David, till that very person should come, that was the son of David, whose proper right it was, and then God would give it to him.</p>
                  <p>That those great shakings and revolutions of the nations of the world, were all to prepare the way for Christ's coming, and setting up his kingdom in the world, is further manifest by Haggai, ii.6.7. "For thus saith the Lord of hosts, Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; and I will shake all nations, and the desire of nations shall come, and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" And again, verse 21.22. and 23. It is evident by this, that these great revolutions and shakings of the nations, whereby the thrones of kingdoms and armies were overthrown, and every one came down by the sword of his brother, were to prepare the way for the coming of him who is the desire of all nations.</p>
                  <p>The great changes and troubles that have sometimes been in the visible church of Christ, are in Rev. xii.2. compared to the church's being in travail to bring forth Christ: So these great troubles and mighty revolutions that were in the world before Christ was born, were, as it were, the world's being in travail to bring forth the Son of God. The Apostle, in the 8th of Romans, represents the whole creation as groaning and travailing in pain together until now, to bring forth the liberty and manifestation of the children of God. So the world as it were travailed in pain, and was in continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l convulsions, for several hundred years together, to bring forth the first-born child, and the only begotten Son of God. And those mighty revolutions were as so many pangs and throes in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it, The world being so long a time kept in a state of war and bloodshed, prepared the way for the coming of the Prince of peace, as it showed a great need the world stood in of such a prince to deliver the world from its miseries.</p>
                  <p>It pleased God to order it in his providence, that earthly power and dominion should be raised to its greatest height, and appear in its utmost glory, in those four great monarchies that succeeded one another, and that every one should be greater and more glorious than the preceding, before he set up the kingdom of his Son. By this it appear how much more glorious his spiritual kingdom was than the most glorious temporal kingdom. The strength and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Satan's kingdom in these four mighty monarchies, appeared
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:017525_0108_0FA12AF7AE683FC0"/>
in its greatest height: for these monarchies were the monarchies of the Heathen world, and so the strength of them was the strength of Satan's kingdom. God suffered Satan's kingdom to rise to so great a height of power and magnificence before his Son came to overthrow it, to prepare the way for the more glorious triumph of his Son. Goliath must have on all his splendid armour when the stripling David comes against him with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ing and a stone, for the greater glory of Davids victory. God suffered one of those great monarchies to subdue another, and erect itself on the other's rui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, appearing still in greater strength, and the last to be the strongest and mightiest of all; that so Christ, in overthrowing that, might as it were overthrow them all at once; as the stone cut out of the mountain without hands, is represented as destroying the whole image, the gold, the silver, the brass, the iron, and the clay; so that all became as the chaff of the summer threshing floor.</p>
                  <p>These mighty empires were suffered thus to overthrow the world, and might destroy one another: and though their power was so great, yet they could not uphold themselves, but fell one after another, and came to nothing, even the last of them, that was the strongest, and had swallowed up the earth. It pleased God thus to show in them the instability and vanity of all earthly power and greatness; which served as a foil to set forth the glory of the kingdom of his Son, which never shall be destroyed, as appears by Dan. ii.44<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to another people, but it shall break in pieces, and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever." So great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does this kingdom differ from all those kingdoms: they vanish away, and are le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t to other people; but this shall not be left to other people, but shall stand for ever. God suffered the devil to do his utmost, and to establish his interest, by setting up the greatest, strongest, and most glorious kingdoms in the world that he could, before the despised Jesus overthrew him and his empire. Christ came into the world to bring down the high things of Satan's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that the hand of the Lord might be on every one that is proud and lofty, and every high tower, and every lofty mountain; as the Prophet Isaiah says, chap. ii.12. &amp;c. Therefore these things were suffered to rise very high, that Christ might appear so much the more glorious in being above them.</p>
                  <p>Thus wonderfully did the great and wise governor of the world prepare the way for the erecting of the glorious kingdom of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved son Jesus.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another thing for which this last period or space of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ was particularly remarkable, was the wonderful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the church through all those overturnings. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:017525_0109_0FA12AF86F21FAA0"/>
of the church was on some accounts more remarkable through this period, than through any of the foregoing. It was very wonderful that the church, which in this period was so weak and in so low a state, and mostly subject to the dominion of Heathen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, should be preserved for five or six hundred years together, while the world was so often overturned, and the earth was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in pieces, and made so often empty and waste, and the inhabitants of it came down so often every one by the sword of his brother. I say it was wonderful that the church in its weak and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> state, being but a little handful of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should be preserved in all these great convulsions; especially considering that the land of Judea, the chief place of the church's residence, lay in the midst of them, as it were in the middle between the contending parties, and was very much the fear of war amongst them, and was often over-run and subdued, and sometimes in the hands of one people, and sometimes another, and very much the object of the envy and hatred of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Heathen nations, and often almost ruined by them, often grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> multitudes of its inhabitants being slain, and the land in a great measure depopulated; and those who had them in their power, often intended the utter destruction of the whole nation. Yet they were upheld; they were preserved in their captivity in Babylon, and they were upheld again under all the dangers they passed through, under the kings of Persia, and the much greater dangers they were liable to under the empire of the Greeks, and afterwards when the world was trodden down by the Romans.</p>
                  <p>Their preservation through this period was also distinguishingly remarkable, in that we never read of the church's suffering per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution in any former period in any measure to such a degree as they did in this, under Antiochus Epiphanes, of which more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. This wonderful preservation of the church through all these overturnings of the world, gives light and confirmation to what we read in the beginning of the 46th Psalm: "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar, and be troubled; though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof."</p>
                  <p>THUS I have taken notice of some general things wherein this last period of the Old Testament times was distinguished. I come now to consider how the work of redemption was carried on in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The first thing that here offers is the captivity of the Jews in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Babylon. This was a great dispensation of providence, and such as never was before. The children of Israel in the time of the judges, had often been brought under their enemies; and many
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:017525_0110_0FA12AF92F3CFCB0"/>
particular persons were carried captive at other times. But never had there been any such thing as destroying the whole land, the sanctuary, and the city of Jerusalem, and all the cities and villages of the land, and carrying the whole body of the people out of their own land into a country many hundred miles distant, and leaving the land of Canaan empty of God's visible people. The ark had once forsaken the tabernacle of Shiloh, and was carried captive into the land of the Philistines: but never had there been any such thing as the burning the sanctuary, and utterly destroying the ark, and carrying away all the sacred vessels and utensils, and breaking up all their stated worship in the land, and the land's lying waste and empty for so many years together. How lively are those things set forth in the Lamentations of Jeremiah!</p>
                  <p>The work of redemption was promoted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y this remarkable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation in these following ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It finally cured that nation of their itch after idolatry. The Prophet Isaiah, speaking of the setting up of the kingdom of Christ, chap. ii.18. speaks of the abolishing idolatry as one thing that should be done to this end: "And the idols he shall utterly abolish." When the time was drawing near, that God would abolish Heathen idolatry, through the greater part of the known world, as he did by the preaching of the gospel after Christ came, it pleased him first to abolish Heathenism among his own people; and he did it now by their captivity into Babylon; a presage of that abolishing of idols<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that God was about to bring to pass by Christ through so great a part of the Heathen world.</p>
                  <p>This nation that was addicted to idolatry before for so many ages, and that nothing would cure them of, not all the reproofs, and warnings, and corrections, that they had, and all the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments God inflicted on them for it; yet now were finally cured: so that however some might fall into this sin afterwards, as they did about the time of Antiochus's persecution, yet the nation, as a nation, never shewed any hankering after this sin any more. This was a remarkable and wonderful change in that people, and what directly promoted the work of redemption, as it was a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the interest of religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It was one thing that prepared the way for Christ's coming, and setting up the glorious dispensation of the gospel, as it took away many of those things wherein consisted the glory of the Jewish dispensation. In order to introduce the glorious dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the gospel, the external glory of the Jewish church must be diminished, as we observed before. This the Babylonish cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity did many ways; it brought the people very low.</p>
                  <p>First, it removed the temporal diadem of the house of David a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them, i. e. the supreme and independent government of
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:017525_0111_0FA12AF9F0696AD8"/>
themselves. It took away the crown and diadem from the nation. The time now approaching when Christ, the great and everlasting king of his church, was to reign, it was time for the typical kings to withdraw. As God said by Ezekiel, ch. xxi.26. "He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the crown and diadem, that is might be no more, till he should come whose right it was." The Jews henceforward were always dependent on the governing power of other nations, until Christ came, for near six hundred years, excepting about 90 years, during which space they maintained a sort of independence, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual wars under the dominion of the Maccabees and their posterity.</p>
                  <p>Again, by the captivity, the glory and magnificence of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was taken away, and the temple that was built afterwards, was nothing in comparison with it. Thus it was meet, that when the time dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w nigh that the glorious antetype of the temple should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the typical temple should have in glory withdrawn.</p>
                  <p>Again, another thing that they lost by the captivity, was the two tables of the testimony delivered to Moses, written with the finger of God; the two tables on which God with his own finger wrote the ten commandments on Mount Sinai. These seem to have been preserved in the ark till the captivity. These were in the ark when Solomon placed the ark in the temple, 1 Kings viii.9. There was nothing in the ark, save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb. And we have no reason to suppose any other, but that they remained there as long as that temple stood. But the Jews speak of these as finally lost at that time; though the same commandm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se tables also were withdrawn on the approach of their antetype.</p>
                  <p>Again, another thing that was lost that the Jews had before, was the Urim and Thummim. This is evident by Ezra, ii.63. "And the Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap> said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there should stand up a priest with Urim and Thummim." we have no account that this was ever restored; but the ancient writings of the Jews say the contrary. What this Urim and Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim was, I shall not now enquire; but only observe, that it was something by which the high priest enquired of God, and received immediate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> from him, or by which God gave forth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate oracles on particular occasions. This was now withdrawn, the time approaching when Christ, the antetype of the Urim and Thummim, the great word and oracle of God, was to come.</p>
                  <p>Another t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing that the ancient Jews say was wanting in the second temple, was the Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>chinah, or cloud of glory over the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-seat. This was promised to be in the tabernacle: Levit. xvi.2. "For I will appear in the tabernacle upon the mercy-seat." We read elsewhere of the cloud of glory descending into the tabernacle, Exod. xl.35; and so we do likewise with respect to Solomon's
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:017525_0112_0FA12AFAAF29EDC8"/>
temple. But we have no account that this cloud of glory was in the second temple. And the ancient accounts of the Jews say, that there was no such thing in the second temple. This was needless in the second temple, considering that God had promised that he would fill this temple with glory another way, viz. by Christ's coming into it; which was afterwards fulfilled. See Haggai, ii.7. "I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts."</p>
                  <p>Another thing, that the Jews in their ancient writings mention as being now withdrawn, was the fire from heaven on the altar. When Moses built the tabernacle and altar in the wilderness, and the first sacrifices were offered on it, fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offering, as in Levit. ix.24.; and so again, when Solomon built the temple, and offered the first sacrifices, as you may see in 2 Chron. vii.1. And this fire was never to go out, but with the greatest care to be kept alive, as God commanded, Levit. vi.13. "The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar: It shall never go out." And there is no reason to suppose the fire in Solomon's time ever went out till the temple was destroyed by the Babylonians. But then it was extinguished, and never was restored. We have no account of its being given on the building of the second temple, as we have at the building of the tabernacle and first temple. But the Jews, after their return, were forced to make use of their common fire instead of it, according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient tradition of the Jews. Thus the lights of the Old Testament go out on the approach of the glorious Sun of righteousness.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The captivity into Babylon was the occasion of another thing which did afterwards much promote the setting up of Christ's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the world, and that was the dispersion of the Jews through the greater part of the known world, before the coming of Christ. For the whole nation being carried away far out of their own land, and continuing in a state of captivity for so long a time, they got them possessions, and built them houses, and settled themselves in the land of their captivity, agreeable to the direction that Jeremiah gave them, in the letter he wrote to them in the 29th chapter of Jeremiah. Therefore, when Cyrus gave them liberty to return to the land where they had formerly dwelt, many of them never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; they were not willing to leave their settlements and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions there, to go into a desolate country, many hundred miles distant, which none but the old men among them had ever seen; and therefore they were but few, but a small number, that return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as we see in the accounts we have in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. Great numbers tarried behind, though they still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the same religion with those that returned, so far as it could be practised in a foreign land. Those messengers that we read of in
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:017525_0113_0FA12AFB6DAC8910"/>
the 7th chapter of Zechariah, that came to enquire of the priests and prophets in Jerusalem, Sherezer and R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lech, are supposed to be messengers sent from the Jews that remained still in Babylon.</p>
                  <p>Those Jews that remained still in that country were soon, by the great changes that happened in the world, dispersed thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the adjacent countries. Hence we find, that in Esther's time, which was after the return from the captivity, the Jews were a people that were dispersed throughout all parts of the vast Persian empire, that extended from India to Ethiopia; as you may see, Esth. iii.8. "And Haman said unto King Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad, and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom," &amp;c. And so they continued dispersed till Christ came, and till the apostles went forth to preach the pospel. But yet these dispersed Jews retained their religion in this dispersion. Their captivity, as I said before, thoroughly cured them of their idolatry; and it was their manner, for as many of them as could from time to time to go up to the land of Judea to Jerusalem at their great feasts. Hence we read in the 2d chapter of Acts, that at the time of the great feast of Pentecost, there were Jews abiding at Jerusalem out of every nation under heaven. These were Jews come up from all countries where they were dispersed, to worship at that feast. Hence we had, in the history of the Acts of the Apostles, that wherever the Apostles went preaching through the world, they found Jews. They came to such a city, and to such a city, and went into the synagogue of the Jews.</p>
                  <p>Antiochus the Great, about two hundred years before Christ, on a certain occasion, transplanted two thousand families of Jews from the country about Babylon into Asia the Less; and so they and their post<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ty, many of them, settled in Pontus, Galatia, Phrygia, Pamphylla, and in Ephesus, and from thence settled in Athens, Corinth, and Rome. Whence came those synagogues in those places that the Apostle Paul preached in.</p>
                  <p>Now, this dispersion of the Jews through the world before Christ came, did many ways prepare the way for his coming, and setting up his kingdom in the world.</p>
                  <p>One was, that this was a means of raising a general expectation of the Messiah through the world about the time that he actually came. For the Jews, where-ever they were dispersed, carried the holy scriptures with them, and so the prophecies of the Messiah; and being conversant with the nations among whom they lived, they, by that means, became acquainted with these prophecies, and with the expectations of the Jews of their glorious Messiah; and by this means, the birth of such a glorious person in Judea about that time began to be the general expectation of the nations of the world, as appears by the writings of the learned men of the Heathen
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:017525_0114_0FA12AFC2E5C0AC0"/>
that lived about that time, which are still extant; particularly Virgil, the famous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>et that lived in Italy a little before Christ was born, has a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>em about the expectation of a great prince that was to be born, and the happy times of righteousness and peace that he was to introduce; some of it very much in the language of the prophet Isaiah.</p>
                  <p>Another way that this dispersed state of the Jews prepared the way for Christ was, that it showed the necessity of abol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hing the Jewish dispentation, and introducing a new dispensation of the covenant of grace. It showed the necessity of abolishing the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial law, and the old Jewish worship: For, by this means, the observance of that ceremonial law became impracticable even by the Jews themselves; for the ceremonial law was adapted to the state of a people dwelling together in the same land, where was the city that God had chosen; where was the temple, the only place where they might offer sacrifices; and where it was lawful for their priests and Levites to officiate, where they were to bring their first fruits, and where they were their cities of refuge, and the like. But the Jews, by this dispersion, lived, many of them, in other lands, more than a thousand miles distant, when Christ came; which made the observation of their laws of sacrifices, and the like, impracticable. Though their forefathers might be to blame in not going up to the land of Judea when they were permitted by Cyrus, yet the case was now, as to many of them at least, become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable; which shewed the necessity of introducing a new dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, that should be fitted, not only to one particular land, but to the general circumstances and use of all nations of the world.</p>
                  <p>Again, another way that this dispersion of the Jews through the world prepared the way for the setting up of the kingdom of Christ in the world, was, that it contributed to the making the facts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Jesus Christ publicly known thro' the world. For, as I observed before, the Jews that lived in other countries, used fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to go up to Jerusalem at their three great feasts, which were from year to year; and so, by this means, they could not but become acquainted with the news of the wonderful things that Christ did in that land. We find that they were present at, and took great notice of, that great miracle of raising Lazarus, which excited the curiosity of those foreign Jews that come up to the feast of the Passover to see Jesus; as you may see in John xii.19.20.21. These Greeks were foreign Jews and proselytes, as is evident by their coming to worship at the feast of the Passover. The Jews that lived abroad among the Greeks, and spoke their language, were called <hi>Greeks or Hellenists:</hi> so they are called <hi>Grecians,</hi> Acts vi.1. These Grecians here spoken of were not Gentile Christians; for this was before the calling of the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="unknown:017525_0115_0FA12AFCF0BA3E40"/>By the same means, the Jews that went up from other countries became acquainted with Christ's crucifixion. Thus the disciples, going to Emmaus, say to Christ, when they did not know him, Luke, xxiv.18. "Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which have come to pass there in these days?" plainly intimating, that the things concerning Jesus were so publicly known to all men, that it was wonderful to find any man unacquainted with them. And so afterwards they became acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the news of his resurection; and when they went home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into their own countries, they carried the news with them, and so made these facts public through the world, as they had made the prophecies of them public before.</p>
                  <p>After this, those foreign Jews that came to Jerusalem, took great notice of the pouring out of the Spirit at Pentecost, and the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful effects of it; and many of them were converted by it, viz. Parthians, Medes, El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mites, and the dwellers in Mesapotamia, and in Egypt, and the parts of Libyia about Cyrene, and the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Rome, Jews and Proselytes, Cretes and Arabians. And so they did not only carry back the news of the facts of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but Christianity itself, into their own countries with them; which contributed much to the spreading of it through the world.</p>
                  <p>Again, another way that the dispersion of the Jews contributed to the setting up of the gospel kingdom in the world was, that it opened a door for the introduction of the apostles in all place, where they came to preach the gospel. For almost in all places where they came to preach the gospel, they found Jews, and sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues of the Jews, where the holy scriptures were wont to be read, and the true God worshipped; which was a great advantage to the apostles in their spreading the gospel through the world. For their way was, into whatever city they came, first to go into the synagogue of the Jews, (they being people of the same nation), and there to preach the gospel unto them. And hereby their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and their new doctrine, was taken notice of by their Gentile neighbours, whose curiosity excited them to hear what they had to say; which became a fair occasion to the apostles to preach the gospel to them. It appears that it was thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the account we have of things in the Acts of the Apostles. These Gentiles hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been before, many of them, prepared in some measure, by the knowledge they had of the Jews religion, and of their worship of one God, and of their prophecies, and expectation of a Messiah; which knowledge they derived from the Jews, who had long been their neighbours; this opened the door for the gospel to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to them. And the work of the apostles with them was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less much easier than if they never had heard any thing before of any expectation of such a person as the apostles preached, or any thing about the worship of one only true God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="unknown:017525_0116_0FA12AFDADF33AB8"/>So many ways did the Babylonish captivity greatly prepare the way for Christ's coming.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The next particular that I would take notice of is, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition made to the cannon of scripture in the time of the captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in those two remarkable portions of scripture, the prophecies of Ezekiel and Daniel. Christ appeared to each of these prophets in the form of that nature which he was afterwards to take upon him. The prophet Ezekiel gives an account of his thus appearing to him repeatedly, as Ezek. i.26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "And above the firmament that was over their heads, was the likeness of a throne as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a sapphire-stone, and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it." And so chap. viii.1 2. So Christ appeared to the prophet Daniel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Dan. viii.15.16. "There stood before me as the appearance of a man. And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision." There are several things that make it evident, that this was Christ, that I cannot now stand to mention particularly. So Christ appeared again as a man to this prophet, chap. x.5.6. "Then I lift up mine eyes and looked, and behold, a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz: his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude." Comparing this vision with that of the Apostle John in the 1st chapter of Revelation, makes it manifest that it was Christ. And the prophet Daniel, in the historical part of his book, gives an account of a very remarkable appearance of Christ in Nebuchadnezzar's furnace, with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. We have the account of it in the 3d chapter. In the 25th verse, Christ is said to be like the Son of God; and it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that he appeared in the form of man: "Lo, I see four <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> loose,—and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God."</p>
                  <p>Christ did not only here appear in the form of the human nature, but he appeared in a furnace, saving those persons who believed on him from that furnace; by which is represented to us, how Christ, by coming himself into the furnace of God's wrath, saves those that believe in him from that furnace, so that he has no power on them; and the wrath of God never reaches or touches them, so much as to singe the hair of their heads.</p>
                  <p>These two prophets, in many respects, were more particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the coming of Christ, and his glorious gospel kingdom, than any of the prophets had been before. They both of them mention those three great overturnings of the world that should be before he came. Ezekiel is particular in several places concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:017525_0117_0FA12AFE6E8030A8"/>
the coming of Christ. The prophet Daniel is more particular in foretelling the time of the coming of Christ than ever any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had been before, in the 9th chap. of his prophecy; who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that it should be seventy weeks, <hi>i. e.</hi> seventy weeks of years, or seventy times seven years, or four hundred and ninety years, from the decree to rebuild and restore the state of the Jews, till the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">III The next particular I would mention is, the destruction of Babylon, and the overthrow of the Chaldean empire by Cyrus. The destruction of Babylon was in that night in which B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now that great city, which had long been an enemy to the city of God, his Jerusalem, was destroyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after it had stood ever since the first building of Babel, which was about seventeen hundred years. If the check that was put to the building this city at its beginning, whereby they were prevented from carrying of it to that extent and magnificence that they intended; I say, if this promoted the work of redemption, as I have before shown it did, much more did this destruction of it.</p>
                  <p>It was a remarkable instance of God's vengeance on the enemies of his redeemed church; for God brought this destruction on Babylon for the injuries they did to God's children, as is often set forth in the prophets. It also promoted the work of redemption, as thereby God's people, that were held captive by them, were set at liberty to return to their own land to rebuild Jerusalem; and therefore Cyru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

own land, and rebuilding Jerusalem and the temple. Cyrus, as soon as he had destroyed the Babylonish empire, and had erected the Persian empire on its ruins, made a decree in favour of the Jews, that they might return to their own land, and rebuild their city and temple. This return of the Jews out of the Babylonish <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, next to the redemption out of Egypt, the most remarkable of all the Old Testament redemptions, and most insisted on in scripture, as a type of the great redemption of Jesus Christ. It was under the hand of one of the legal ancestors of Christ, viz. Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, whose Babylonish name was S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>ws, and their leader in their first return out of captivity; and, together with Joshua the son of Josedek the high priest, had the chief hand in rebuilding the temple. This redemption was bro't about by the hand of Zerubbabel and Joshua the priest, as the redemption out of Egypt was brought about by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</p>
                  <p>The return out of captivity was a remarkable dispensation of Providence. It was remarkable, that the heart of a Heathen prince, as Cyrus was, should be so inclined to favour such a design as he did, not only in giving the people liberty to return, and rebuild the city and temple, but in giving charge that they should be helped with silver and gold, and with goods, and with beasts, as we read in Ezra, i.4. And afterwards God wonderfully inclined the heart of Darius to further the building of the house of God with his own tribute money, and by commanding their bitter enemies, the Samaritans, who had been striving to hinder them to help them without fail, by furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with all that they needed in order to it, and to supply them day by day; making a decree, that whosoever failed of it, timber should be pulled down out of his house, and he hanged thereon, and his house made a dunghill; as we have an account in the 6th chapter of Ezra. And after this God inclined the heart of Artaxerxes, another king of Persia, to promote the work of restoring the state of the Jews, by his ample commission to Ezra, which we have an account of in the 7th chapter of Ezra; helping them abundantly with silver and gold of his own bounty, and offering more, as should be needful, out of the King's treasure-house, and commanding his treasurers beyond the river Euphrates to give more, as should be needed, unto an hundred talents of silver, and an hundred measures of wheat, an hundred baths of wine, and an hundred baths of oil, and salt, without prescribing how much; and giving leave to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablish magistrates in the land; and freeing the priests of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It was remar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>We have shewed before how the settlement of the people in this land in Joshua's time promoted the work of redemption. On the same account does their restitution <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elong to the same work. The resettlement of the Jews in the land of Canaan belongs to this work, as it was a necessary means of preserving the Jewish church and dispensation in being, till Christ should come. If it had not been for this restoration of the Jewish church, and temple, and worship, the people had remained without any temple, and land of their own, that would be as it were their head-quarters, a place of worship, habitation, and resort; the whole constitution, which God had done so much to establish, would have been in danger of utterly fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, long before that six hundred years had been out, which was from about the time of the captivity till Christ. And so all that preparation which God had been making for the coming of Christ, from the time of Abraham, would have been in vain. Now that very temple was built that God would fill with glory by Christ's coming into it, as the Prophets Haggai and Zechariah told the Jews to encourage them in building it.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. The next particular I would observe, is the addition made to the canon of the scriptures soon after the captivity by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ggai and Zechariah, who were prophets sent to encourage the people in their work of rebuilding the city and temple; and the main argument they made use of to that end, is the approach of the time of the coming of Christ. Haggai foretold that Christ should be of Zerubbabel's legal posterity, last chap. last verse. This seems to be the last and most particular revelation of the descent of Christ, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oll the angel Gabriel was sent to reveal it to his mother Mary.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. The next thing I would take notice of, was the pouring out of the Spirit of God that accompanied the ministry of Ezra <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

priest after the captivity. That there was such a pouring out of the Spirit of God that accompanied Ezra's ministry, is manifest by many things in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. Presently after Ezra came up from Babylon, with the ample commission which Artaxerxes gave him, whence Daniel's seventy weeks began, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> set himself to reform the vices and corruptions he found among the Jews; and his great success in it we have an account of in the 10th chapter of Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a; so that there appeared a very general and great mourning of the congregation of Israel for their sins, which was accompanied with a solemn covenant that the people entered into with God; and this was followed with a great and general reformation, as we have there an account. The people about the same time, with great zeal, and earnestness, and reverence, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves together to hear the word of God rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> by Ezra; and gave diligent attention, while Ezra and the other priests preached to them, by reading and expounding the law, and were greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in the hearing of it. They wept when they heard the words of the law, and set themselves to observe the law, and kept the feast of tabernacles, as the scripture observes, after such a manner as it had not been kept since the days of Joshua the son of Nun; as we have account in the 8th chapter of Nehemiah: after this, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing separated themselves from all strangers, they solemnly observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a fast, by hearing the word of God, confessing their sins, and renewing their covenant with God; and manifested their sincerity in that transaction, by actually reforming many abuses in religion and morals; as we learn from the 9th and following chapters of Nehemiah.</p>
                  <p>It is observable, that it has been God's manner in every remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable new establishment of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tate of his visible church, to give a remarkable outpouring of his spirit. So it was on the first estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishment of the church of the Jews at their first coming into Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan under Joshua, as has been observed; and so it was now in this second settlement of the church in the same land in the time of Ezra; and so it was on the first establishment of the Christian church after Christ's resurrection; God wisely and graciously lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foundation of those establishments in a work of his holy Spirit, for the lasting benefit of the state of his church, thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward continued in those establishments. This pouring out of the Spirit of God, was a final cure of that nation of that particular sin which just before they especially run into, viz. intermarrying with the Gentiles; for however inclined to it they were before, they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after shewed an aversion to it.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Ezra added to the cannon of the scriptures. He wrote the book of Ezra; and he is supposed to have written the book of Chronicles, at least of compiling them, if he was not the author of

Ezra is often spoken of as a noted and eminent scribe of the law of God, and the canon of scripture in his time was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly under his special care; and the Jews, from the first accounts we have from them have always held, that the canon of scripture, so much of it as was then extant, was collected, and orderly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and settled by Ezra; and that from him they have delivered it down in the order in which he disposed it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

made up of both the law and the other parts of the scripture then extant, in all the synagogues, which were set up in every city, and every where, where-ever the Jews in any considerable number dwelt, as our meeting-houses are. Thus we find it was in Christ's and the apostles time, Acts xv.21. "Moses of old time hath in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day."

                  <p n="12">XII. After this the canon of the Old Testament was compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and sealed by Malachi. The manner of his concluding his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy seems to imply, that they were to expect no more prophecies, and no more written revelations from God, till Christ should come. For in the last chapter he prophecies of Christ's coming; ver. 2 3. "But unto you that fear my name, shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall. And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be as ashes under the soles of your feet, in the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord of hosts." Then we read in ver.
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:017525_0123_0FA12B03C36C2110"/>
4. "Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgements," i. e. Remember and improve what ye have; keep close to that written rule you have, as expecting no more additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to it, till the night of the Old Testament is over, and the Sun of righteousness shall at length arise.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. Soon after this, the spirit of prophecy ceased among that people till the time of the New Testament. Thus the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment light, the stars of the long night, began space to hide their heads, the time of the Sun of righteousness now drawing nigh. We before observed, how the Kings of the house of David ceased before the true King and head of the church came; and how the cloud of glory withdrew, before Christ, the brightness of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's glory, appeared; and so as to several other things. And now at last the spirit of prophecy ceased. The time of the great Prophet of God was now so nigh, it was time for their typical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to be silent, and shut their mouths.</p>
                  <p>WE have now gone through with the time that we have any hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical account of in the writings of the Old Testament, and the last thing that was mentioned, by which the work of redemption was promoted, was the ceasing of the spirit of prophecy.</p>
                  <p>I now proceed to show how the work of redemption was carried on through the remaining time that were before Christ: in which we have not that thread of scripture history to guide us that we have had hitherto; but have these three things to guide us, viz. the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Old Testament, human histories of those times, and some occasional mention made, and some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This was the third overturning of the world that came to pass in this period, and was greater and more remarkable than either of the foregoing.

Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power; so you may see in the 11th chap. of Daniel.

"And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will." And then he foretels, in the 4th verse, of the dividing of his kingdom between his four captains: "And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and not to his posterity nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up even so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those."

                     </gap> prepare the way for the setting up of Christ's kingdom This gave advantage for spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gospel from one nation to another, and so through all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with vastly greater ease, than if every nation had a distinct language, and did not understand each other. For though some of the first preachers of the gospel had the gift of languages so that they could preach in any language; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> all had not this particular gift; and they that had, could not exercise it when they would, but only at special seasons, when the spirit of God was pleased to inspire them in this way. The church, in different parts of the
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:017525_0125_0FA12B0534A04A40"/>
world, as the churches of Jerusalem, Antioch, Galatia, Corinth, and others, which were in countries distant one from another, could not have had that communication one with another, which we have an account of in the book of <hi>Acts,</hi> if they had had no common lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. So it was before the Grecian empire was set up. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, many in all those countries well understood the same lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, viz the Greek language; which wonderfully opened the door for mutual communication between those churches, so far separated one from another. Again, the making the Greek lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage common through so great a part of the world, did wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully make way for the setting up of the kingdom of Christ, because it was the language in which the New Testament was to be origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally written. The apostles propogated the gospel through many scores of nations; and if they could not have understood the Bible any otherwise than as it was translated into so many languages, it would have rendered the spreading of the gospel vastly more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. But by the Greek language being made common to all, they all understood the New Testament of Jesus Christ in their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in which the apostles and evangelists originally wrote it: so that as soon as ever it was written by its original penmen, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately lay open to the world in a language that was commonly understood every where, as there was no language that was so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly understood in the world in Christ's and the apostles times as the Greek; the cause of which was the setting up of the Grecian empire in the world.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. The next thing I shall take notice of is, the translation of the scriptures of the Old Testament into a language that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly understood by the Gentiles. The translation that I here speak of is that into the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eek language, that is commonly called the Septuagint, or the tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>slation of the Seventy. This is supposed to have been made about fifty or sixty years after Alexander's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the world. This is the first translation that ever was made of the scriptures that we have any credible account of. The canon of the Old Test<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ment had been compleated by the prophet Malachi but about an hundred and twenty years before in its original; and hitherto the scriptures had remained locked up from all other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons but the Jews, in the Hebrew tongue, which was understood by no other nation. But now it was translated into the Greek lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which, as we observed before, was a language that was commonly understood by the nations of the world.</p>
                  <p>This translation of the Old Testament is still extant, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the hands of learned men in these days, and is made great use of by them. The Jews have many fables about the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and manner of this translation; but the truth of the case is supposed to be this, that multitudes of the Jews living in other
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:017525_0126_0FA12B05F3D030D0"/>
parts of the world besides Judea, and being born and bred among the Greeks, the Greek became their common language, and they did not understand the original Hebrew; and therefore they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ed the scriptures to be translated for their use into the Greek language: and so henceforward the Jews, in all countries, except Judea, were wont in their synagogues to make use of this transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion instead of the Hebrew.</p>
                  <p>This translation of the scriptures into a language commonly understood through the world, prepared the way for Christ's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and setting up his kingdom in the world, and afterwards did greatly promote it. For as the apostles went preaching through the world, they made great use of the scriptures of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and especially of the prophecies concerning Christ that were contained in them. By means of this translation, and by the Jews being scattered every where, they had the scriptures at hand in a language that was understood by the Gentiles: and they did princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally make use of this translation in their preaching and writings where-ever they went; as is evident by this, that in all the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable quotations that are made out of the Old Testament in their writings in the New-Testament, they are almost every where in the very words of the Septuagint. The sense is the same as it is in the original Hebrew; but very often the words are different, as all that are acquainted with their Bibles know. When the apostles in their epistles, and the evangelists in their histories, cite passages out of the Old Testament, it is very often in different words from what we have in the Old Testament, as all know. But yet these citations are almost universally in the very words of the Septuagint version; for that may be seen by comparing them together, they being both written in the same language. This makes it evident, that the apostles, in their preaching and writings, commonly made use of this translation. So this very translation was that which was principally used in Christian churches through most nations of the world for several hundred years after Christ.</p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. The next thing is the wonderful preservation of the church when it was imminently threatened and persecuted under the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian empire.</p>
                  <p>The first time they were threatened was by Alexander himself. When he was besieging the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ear to spare them, and favour them, much as he did the heart of Esau when he met Jacob.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="unknown:017525_0127_0FA12B06AE86DF98"/>After this, one of the kings of Egypt, a successor of one Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's four captains, entertained a design of destroying the nation of the Jews; but was remarkably and wonderfully prevented by a stronger interposition of Heaven for their preservation.</p>
                  <p>But the most wonderful preservation of them all in this period was under the cruel persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, king of Syria, and successor of another of Alexander's four captains. The Jews were at that time subject to the power of Antiochus; and he being enraged against them, long strove to his utmost utterly to destroy them, and root them out; at least all of them that would not forsake their religion, and worship his idols: and he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in a great measure waste the country, and depopulate the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Jerusalem; and profaned the temple, by setting up his idols in some parts of it; and persecuted the people with insatiable cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; so that we have no account of any persecution like his before. Many of the particular circumstances of this persecution would be very affecting, if I had time to insist on them. This cruel persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion began about an hundred and seventy years before Christ It is much spoken of in the prophecy of Daniel, as you may see, Dan. viii.9 —25.; xi, 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Antiochus intended not only to extirpate the Jewish religion, but, as far as in him lay, the very nation; and particularly labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the utmost to destroy all copies of the law. And considering how weak they were, in comparison with a king of such vast do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, the providence of God appears very wonderful in defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his design.

Speaking of Antiochus's persecution, he says, "And such as do wickedly against the covenant, shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God, shall be strong, and do exploits."</p>
                  <p>God afterwards brought this Antiochus to a fearful, miserable and, by a loathsome disease, under dreadful torments of body, and horrors of mind; which was foetold, Dan. xi.45. in these words, "Yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him."</p>

                  <p n="17">XVII. The next thing to be taken notice of is the destruction of the Grecian empire, and setting up of the Roman empire. This was the fourth overturning of the world that was in this period. And though it was brought to pass more gradually than the setting up of the Grecian empire, yet it far exceeded that, and was much the greatest and largest temporal monarchy that every was in the world; so that the Roman empire was commonly called <hi>all the world</hi>; as it is in Luke ii.1. "And there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed;" i. e. all the Roman empire.</p>
                  <p>This empire is spoken of as much the strongest and greatest of any of the four: Dan. ii.40. "And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces, and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces, and bruise." So also Daniel vii.7.19.23.</p>
                  <p>The time that the Romans first conquered and brought under the land of Judea, was between sixty and seventy years before Christ was born. Soon after this, the Roman empire was established in its greatest extent; and the world continued subject to this empire henceforward till Christ came, and many hundred years afterwards.</p>
                  <p>The nations of the world being united in one monarchy when Christ came, and when the apostles went forth to preach the gospel, did greatly prepare the way for the spreading of the gospel, and the setting up of Christ's kingdom in the world. For the world being thus subject to one government, it opened a communication from nation to nation, and so opportunity was given for the more swiftly propagating the gospel through the world. Thus we find it to be now; as if any thing prevail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There are innumerable difficulties in travelling through different nations, that are under different independent governments, which there are not in travelling through different parts of the same realm, or different dominions of the same prince. So the world being under one government, the government of the Romans, in Christ's and the apostles times, facilitated the apostles travelling, and the gospel's spreading through the world.</p>

And God was pleased to make foolish the wisdom of this world, to shew men the folly of their best wisdom, by the doctrines of his glorious gospel which were above the reach of all their philosophy.

                  <p n="19">XIX Just before Christ was born, the Roman empire was rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to its greatest height, and also settled in peace. About four and twenty years before Christ was born, Augustus Caesar, the first Roman emperor, began to rule as emperor of the world. Till then the Roman empire had of a long time been a commonwealth under the government of the senate: but then it became an absolute mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. This Augustus Caesar, as he was the first, so he was the greatest of all the Roman emperors: he reigned in the greatest glory. Thus the power of the Heathen world, which was Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's visible kingdom, was raised to its greatest height, after it had been rising higher and higher, and strengthening itself more and more from the days of Solomon to this day, which was about <hi>a thousand years.</hi> Now it appeared at a greater height than ever it appeared from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> first beginning of Satan's Heathenish kingdom, which was probably about the time of the building of Babel. Now the Heathen world was in its greatest glory for strength, wealth, and learning.</p>
                  <p>God did two things to prepare the way for Christ's coming, wherein he took a contrary method from that which human wisdom would have taken. He brought his own visible people very low, and made them weak; but the Heathen, that were his enemies, he exalted to the greatest height, for the more glorious triumph of the cross of Christ. With a small number in their greatest weakness, he conquered his enemies in their greatest glory. Thus Christ tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over principalities and powers in his cross.</p>
                  <p>Augustus Caesar had been for many years establishing the state of the Roman empire, subduing his enemies in one part and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till the very year that Christ was born; when all his enemies being subdued, and his dominion over the world seemed to be set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in its greatest glory. All was established in peace; in token whereof the Romans shut the temple of Janus, which was an estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished symbol among them of there being universal peace through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Roman empire. This universal peace, which was begun that year that Christ was born, lasted twelve years, till the year that Christ disputed with doctors in the temple.</p>
                  <p>Thus the world, after it had been, as it were, in a continual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsion for so many hundred years together, like the four winds striving together on the tumultuous raging ocean, whence arose those four great monarchies, being now established in the greatest height of the fourth and last monarchy, and settled in quietness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="128" facs="unknown:017525_0131_0FA1290658D51228"/>
now all things are ready for the birth of Christ. This remarkable universal peace, after so many ages of tumult and war, was a fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus I have gone through the first grand period of the whole space between the fall of man and the end of the world, vi.z that from the fall to the time of the incarnation of Christ; and have shown the truth of the first proposition, viz. That <hi>from the fall of man to the incarnation of Christ,</hi> God was doing those things that were preparatory to Christ's coming, and were forerunners of it.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>IMPROVEMENT.</head>
               <p>BEFORE I proceed to the next proposition, I would make some few remarks, by way of improvement, upon what has been said under this.</p>
               <p n="1">I. From what has been said, we may strongly argue, that Jesus of Nazareth is indeed the Son of God, and the Saviour of the world; and so that the Christian religion, is the true religion, seeing that Christ is the very person so evidently pointed at, in all the great dispensations of divine providence from the very fall of man, and was so undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly in so many instances foretold from age to age, and shadowed forth in a vast variety of types and figures. If we seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the course of things from the beginning, and observe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all the great wheels of providence from one age to another, we shall descern that they all tend hither. They are all as so many lines, whose course, if it be observed and accurately followed, it will be found that every one centers here. It is so very plain in many things, that it would argue stupidity to deny it. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is undeniable, that this person is a divine person sent from God, that came into the world with his commission and authority, to do his work, and to declare his mind. The great Governor of the world, in all his great works before and since the flood, to Jews and Gentiles, down to the time of Christ's birth, has declared it. It cannot be any vain imagination, but a plain and evident truth, that that person that was born in Bethlehem, and dwelt at Nazareth, and at Capernaum, and was crucified without the gates of Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>must be</hi> the great Messiah, or anointed of God. And bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are all they that believe in and confess him, and miserable are all that they deny him. This shows the unreasonableness of the Deists, who deny revealed religion, and of the Jews, who deny that this Jesus is the Messiah foretold and promised to their fathers.</p>
               <p>Here it may be some persons may be ready to object, and say, That it may be, some subtle, cunning men contrived this history, and these prophecies, so that they should all point to Jesus Christ on purpose to confirm it, that he is the Messiah. To such it may be replied, How could such a thing be contrived by cunning men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="129" facs="unknown:017525_0132_0FA1290674D2E360"/>
to point to Jesus Christ, long before he ever was born? How could they know that ever any such person would be born? And how could their craft and subtilty help them to foresee and point at an event that was to come to pass many ages afterwards? for no fact can be more evident, than that the Jews had those writings long before Christ was born; as they have them still in great vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, wherer-ever they are, in all their dispersions through the world; and they would never have received such a contrivance from Christians, to point to and confirm Jesus to be the Messiah, whom they always denied to be the Messiah; and much less would they have been made to believe that they always had had those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ooks in their hands, when they were first made and imposed upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">II. What has been said, affords a strong argument for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority of the books of the Old Testament, from that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable harmony there is in them, whereby they all point to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he same thing. For we may see by what has been said, how all the parts of the Old Testament, though written by so many different penmen, and in ages distant one from another, do all harmonize one with another; all agree in one, and all centre in the same thing, and that a future thing; an event which it was impossible any one of them should know but by divine revelation, even the future coming of Christ. This is most evident and manifest in them, as appears by what has been said.</p>
               <p>Now, if the Old Testament was not inspired by God, what account can be given of such an agreement? for if these books were only human writings, written without any divine direction, then none of these penmen knew that there would come such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as Jesus Christ into the world; his coming was only a mere figment of their own brain; and if so, how happened it, that this figment of theirs came to pass? How came a vain imagination of theirs, which they foretold without any manner of ground of their prediction, to be exactly fulfilled? and especially how did they come all to agree in it, all pointing exactly to the same thing, tho' many of them lived so many hundred years distant one from another?</p>
               <p>This admirable consent and agreement in a future event, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a clear and certain evidence of the divine authority of those writings.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Hence we may learn what a weak and ignorant objection it is that some make against some parts of the Old Testament's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word of God, that they consist so much of histories of the wars and civil transactions of the kings and people of the nation of the Jews. Some say, We find here among the books of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular nation, histories which they kept of the state of their nation from one age to another; histories of their kings and rulers, histories of their wars with the neighbouring nations, and histories of the
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:017525_0133_0FA12907317B82D0"/>
changes that happened from time to time in their state and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and so we find that other nations used to keep histories of of their public affairs, as well as they; and why then should we think that these histories which the Jews kept are the word of God, more than those of other people? But what has been said, shows the folly and vanity of such an objection. For hereby it appears, that the case of the histories is very different from that of all other his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. This history alone gives us an account of the first original of all things; and this history alone deduces things down in a wonderful series from that original, giving an idea of the grand scheme of divine providence, as tending to its great end. And to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the doctrines and prophices contained in it, the same book gives a view of the whole series of the great events of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ovidence, from the first original to the last end and consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of all things, giving an excellent and glorious account of the wise and holy designs of the governor of the world in all.</p>
               <p>No common history has such p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>men as this history, which was all written by men who came with evident signs and testimonies of their being prophets of the most high God immediately inspired.</p>
               <p>The histories that were written, as we have seen from what has been said under this proposition, do all contain those great events of providence, by which it appears how God has been carrying on the glorious divine work of redemption from age to age. Though they are histories, yet they are no less full of divine instruction, and those things that show forth Christ, and his glorious gospel, than other parts of the holy scriptures which are not historical.</p>
               <p>To object against a book's being divine, merely because it is historical, is a poor objection; just as if that could not be the word of God which gives an account of what is past; or as though it were not reasonable to suppose, that God, in a revelation he should give mankind, would give us any relation of the dispensations of his own providence. If it be so, it must be because his works are not worthy to be related; it must be because the scheme of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and series of his dispensations towards his church, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the world that he has made, whereby he has ordered and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed it from age to age, is not worthy that any record should be kept of it.</p>
               <p>The objection that is made, That it is a common thing for nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and kingdoms to write histories and keep records of their wars, and the revolutions that come to pass in their territories, is so far from being a weighty objection against the historical part of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as though it were not the word of God, that it is a strong argument in favour of it. For if reason and the light of nature teaches all civilized nations to keep records of the events of their human government, and the series of their administrations, and to
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:017525_0134_0FA12907F5B94008"/>
publish histories for the information of others; how much more may we expect that God would give the world a record of the dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his divine government, which doubtless is infinitely more worthy of an history for our inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>mation? If wise kings have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care that there should be good histories written of the nations over which they have reigned, shall we think it incredible, that Jesus Christ should take care that his church, which is his nation, his peculiar <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, should have in their hands a certain infallible history of their nation, and of his government of them?</p>
               <p>If it had not been for the history of the Old Testament, how wofully should we have been left in the dark about many things which the church of God needs to know! How ignorant should we have been of God's dealings towards mankind, and towards his church, from the beginning! and we would have been wholly in the dark about the creation of the world, the fall of man, the first rise and continued progress of the dispensations of grace towards fallen mankind! and we should have known nothing how God at first set up a church in the world, and how it was preserved; after what manner he governed it from the beginning, how the light of the gospel first began to dawn in the world; how it increased, and how things were preparing for the coming of Christ.</p>
               <p>If we are Christians, we belong to that building of God that has been the subject of our discourse from this text: but if it had not been for the history of the Old Testament, we should never have known what was the first occasion of God's going about this build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and how the foundation of it was laid at first, and how it has gone on from the beginning. The times of the history of the Old Testament are mostly times that no other history reaches up to; and therefore, if God had not taken care to give and preserve an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of these things for us, we should have been wholly without them.</p>
               <p>Those that object against the authority of the Old Testament history of the nation of the Jews, may as well make it an objection against Moses's account of the creation that it is historical; for, in the other, we have an history of a work no less important viz. the work of redemption. Yea, this is a far greater and more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work, as we observed before; that if it be inquired which of the two works, the work of creation, or the work of providence, is greatest? it must be answered, the work of providence; but the work of redemption is the greatest of the works of providence.</p>
               <p>Let those who make this objection consider what part of the Old Testament history can be spared, without making a great breach in that thread or series of events by which this glorious work has been carried on.—This leads me to observe,</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That, from what has been said, we may see much of the wisdom of God in the composition of the scriptures of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:017525_0135_0FA12908B4CBC710"/>
i. e. in the parts of which it consists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By what it has been said, we may see that God hath wisely given us such revelations in the Old Testament as we needed. Let us briefly take a view of the several parts of it, and of the need there was of them.</p>
               <p>Thus it was necessary that we should have some account of the creation of the world, and of the degeneracy of it, and of the universal deluge, and some account of the origin of nations after this destruction of mankind.</p>
               <p>It seems necessary that there should be some account of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the church of God from the beginning: and seeing God suffered all the world to degenerate, and only took one nation to be his people, to preserve the true worship and religion till the Saviour of the world should come, that in them the world might gradually be prepared for that great light, and those wonderful things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssary that we should have some account of this thing, how it was first done by the calling of Abraham, and by their being bond-slaves in Egypt, and how they were brought to Canaan. It was necessary that we should have some account of the revelation which God made of himself to that people, in giving their law, and in the appointment of their typical worship, and those things wherein the gospel is vailed, and of the forming of that people, both as to their civil and ecclesiastical state.</p>
               <p>It seems exceeding necessary that we should have some account of their being actually brought to Canaan, the country that was their promised land, and where they always dwelt. It seems very necessary that we should have an history of the successions of the church of Israel, and of those providences of God towards them, which were most considerable and fullest of gospel mystery. It seems nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is necessary that we should have an account of the succession of the kings of Juda, and of the church, till their captivity into Babylon; and that we should have some account of their return from their captivity, and resettlement in their own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And it was necessary that we should have some account of the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations of God in prophecy, which were to be after the finishing of inspired history; and so it was exceeding suitable and needful that there should be a number of prophets raised who should foretel the coming of the Son of God, and the nature and glory of his kingdom, to be as so many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>It was also a matter of great consequence that the church should have a book of divine songs given by inspiration from God, wherein there should be a lively representation of the true spirit of devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of faith, hope, and divine love, joy, resignation, humility, obedience, repentance, &amp;c. and also that we should have from God, such books of moral instructions as we have in Proverbs and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastes, relating to the affairs and state of mankind, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of human life, containing rules of true wisdom and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for our conduct in all circumstances; and that we should have particularly a song representing the great love between Christ and his spouse the church, particularly adapted to the disposition and holy affections of a true Christian soul towards Christ, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting his grace and marvellous love to, and delight in, his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; as we have in Solomon's Song; and especially that we should have a book to teach us how to conduct ourselves under affliction, seeing the church of God here is in a militant state, and God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of heaven; and the church is for so long a time under trouble, and meets with such exceeding firy trials, and extreme sufferings, before her time of peace and rest in the latter ages of the world shall come: the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God has given us a book most proper in these circumstances, even the book of Job, written upon occasion of the afflictions of a particular saint, and was probably at first given to the church in Egypt under her afflictions there; and is made use of by the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to comfort Christians under persecutions, James v.11.

                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:017525_0137_0FA12A15EE29DB18"/>Thus, from this brief review, I think it appears, that every part of the scriptures of the Old Testament is very useful and necessary, and no part of it can be spared, without loss to the church. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d therefore, as I said, the wisdom of God is conspicuous in ordering that the scriptures of the Old Testament should consist of those very books of which they do consist.</p>
               <p>Before I dismiss this particular, I would add, that it is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveable, that the history of the Old Testament is large and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular where the great affair of redemption required it; as where there was most done towards this work, and most to typify Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to prepare the way for him. Thus it is very large and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in the history of Abraham and the other patriarchs; but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry short in the account we have of the time which the children of Israel spent in Egypt. So again it is large in the account of the redemption out of Egypt, and the first settling of the affairs of the Jewish church and nation in Moses and Joshua's time; but much shorter in the account of the times of the judges. So again, it is large and particular in the account of David's and Solomon's times, and then very short in the history of the ensuing reigns. Thus the accounts are large or short, just as there is more or less of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of redemption to be seen in them.</p>
               <p n="5">V. From what has been said, we may see, that Christ and his redemption are the great subject of the whole Bible. Concerning the New-Testament, the matter is plain; and by what has been said on this subject hitherto, it appears to be so also with respect to the Old Testament. Christ and his redemption is the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eat subject of the prophecies of the Old Testament, as has been shown. It has also been shown, that he is the great subject of the songs of the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d Testament; and the moral rules and precepts are all given in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to him. And Christ and his redemption are also the great subject of the history of the Old Testament from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all along; and even the history of the creation is brought in as an introduction to the history of redemption that immediately follows it. The whole book, both Old Testament and New, is filled up with the gospel; only with this difference, that the Old Testament contains the gospel under a vail, but the New contains it unvailed, so that we may see the glory of the Lord with open face.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. By what has been said, we may see the usefulness and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Old Testament. Some are ready to look on the Old Testament as being as it were out of date, and as if we in these days of the gospel have but little to do with it; which is a very great mistake, arising from want of observing the nature and design of the Old Testament, which, if it were observed, would appear full of the gospel of Christ, and would in an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent manner illustrate and confirm the glorious doctrines and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:017525_0138_0FA12A16ADBB1B88"/>
of the New Testament. Those parts of the Old Testament which are commonly looked upon as containing the least divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, are as it were mines and treasur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of gospel knowledge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and the reason why they are thought to contain so little is, because persons do but superficially read them. The treasures which are hid underneath are not observed. They only look on the top of the ground, and so suddenly pass a judgement that there is nothing there. But they never dig into the mine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they did, they would find it richly stored with silver and gold, and would be abundantly requited for their pains.</p>
               <p>What has been said, may show us what a precious treasure God has committed into our hands, in that he has given us the Bible. How little do most persons consider, how much they enjoy, in that they have the possession of that holy book the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble, which they have in their hands, and may converse with it as they please. What an excellent book is this, and how far exceeding all human writings, that reveals God to us, and gives us a view of the grand design and glorious scheme of providence from the beginning of the world, either in history or prophecy; that reveals the great Redeemer and his glorious redemption, and the various steps by which God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishes it from the first foundation to the top-stone! Shall we prize an history which gives us a clear account of some great earthly prince, or mighty warrior, as of Alexander the Great, or Julius Caesar, or the Duke of Marlborough? and shall we not prize the history that God gives us of the glorious kingdom of his Son Jesus Christ, the Prince and Saviour, and of the wars and other great transactions of that King of kings, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">VII. What has been said, may make us sensible how much most persons are to blame for their inattentive, unobservant way of reading the scriptures. How much do the scriptures contain, if it were but observed? The Bible is the most comprehensive book in the world. But what will all this signify to us, if we read it without observing what is the drift of the Holy Ghost in it? The Psalmist, Psal. cxix.18. begs of God, "That he would enlighten his eyes that he might behold wondrous things out of his law." The scriptures are full of wondrous things. Those histories which are commonly read as if they were only histories of the private concerns of such and such particular persons, such as the histories of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and Joseph, and the history of Ruth, and the histories of particular lawgivers and princes, as the history of Joshua and the Judges, and David, and the Israelitists princes, are accounts of vastly greater things, things of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and more extensive concernment, than they that read <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> are commonly aware of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="unknown:017525_0139_0FA12A18852BC2D0"/>The histories of scripture are commonly read as if they were sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries written only to entertain mens fancies, and to while away their leisure hours, when the infininitely great things contained of pointed at in them are passed over and never taken notice of. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever treasures the scriptures contain, we shall be never the better for them if we do not observe them. He that has a Bible, and does not observe what is contained in it, is like a man who has a box full of silver and gold, and does not know it, does not observe that it is any thing more than a vessel filled with common stones. As long as it is thus with him, he will be never the better for his treasure: for he that knows not that he has a treasure, will never make use of what he has, and so might as well be without it. He who has a plenty of the choicest food stored up in his house, and does not know it, will never taste what he has, and will be as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to starve as if his house were empty.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. What has been said, may show us how great a person Jesus Christ is, and how great an errand he came into the world upon, seeing there was so much done to prepare the way for his coming. God had been doing nothing else but prepare the way for his coming, and doing the work which he had to do in the world, thro' all ages of the world from the very beginning. If we had notice of a certain stranger's being about to come into a country, and should observe that a great preparation was made for his coming, that many months were taken up in it, and great things were done, many great alterations were made in the state of the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and that many hands were employed, and persons of great note were engaged in making preparation for the coming of this person, and the whole country was overturned, and all the affai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s and concerns of the country were ordered so as to be subservient to the design of entertaining that person when he should come; it would be natural for us to think with ourselves, why, surely, this person is some extraordinary person indeed, and it is some very great business that he is coming upon.</p>
               <p>How great a person then must he be, for whose coming into the world the great God of heaven and earth, and governor of all things, spent four thousand years in preparing the way, going about it soon after the world was created, and from age to age doing great things, bringing mighty events to pass, accomplishing wonders without number, often overturning the world in order to it, causing every thing in the state of mankind, and all revolutions and changes in the habitable world from generation to generation to be subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to this great design? Surely this must be some great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary person indeed, and a great work indeed it must needs be that he is coming about.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="unknown:017525_0140_0FA12A18EF09D308"/>We read, Matth. xxi.8.9.10 that when Christ was coming into Jerusalem, and the multitudes ran before him, and cut down branches of palm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They wondered who that extraodinary person should be, that there should be such an ado made on occasion of his coming into the city, and to prepare the way before him. But if we consider what has been said on this subject, what great things was done in all ages to prepare the way for Christ's coming into the world, and how the world was often overturned to make way for it, much more may we cry out, Who is this? What great person is this? and say, as in Psal. xxiv 8.10. "Who is this King of glory," that God should show such respect, and put such vast honour upon him? Surely this person is honourable indeed in God's eyes, and greatly beloved of him; and surely it is a great errand upon which he is sent into the world.</p>

This is the most remarkable article of time that ever was, or ever will be.

It may also be observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that all that was done before the beginning of time, in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal councils of God, and that eternal transaction there was between the persons of the Trinity, chiefly respected this period.

               <p>That during the time of Christ's humiliation, from his incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his resurrection, the purchase of redemption was made.</p>
               <p>Though there were many things done in the affair of redemption from the fall of man to this time, though millions of sacrifices had been offered up; yet nothing was done to purchase redemption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ's incarnation: no part of the purchase was made, no part of the price was offered till now. But as soon as Christ was incarnate, then the purchase began immediately without any delay: And the whole time of Christ's humiliation, from the morning that Christ began to be incarnate, till the morning that he arose fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. I would speak of Christ's becoming incarnate to capacitate himself for this purchase;—and,</p>

               <div n="1" type="part">
                  <head>PART I.</head>
                  <p>FIRST, I would consider Christ's coming into the world, or his taking upon him our nature to put himself in a capacity to purchase redemption for us.—Christ became incarnate, or, which is the same thing, became man, to put himself in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for working out our redemption: for though Christ, as God, was infinitely sufficient for the work, yet to his being in an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate capacity for it, it was needful that he should not only be God but man. If Christ had remained only in the divine nature, he would not have been in a capacity to have purchased our salvation; not from any imperfection of the divine nature, but by reason of it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> absolute and infinite perfection: for Christ, merely as God, was not capable either of that obedience or suffering that was needful. The divine nature is not capable of suffering: for it is infinitely above all suffering. Neither is it capable of obedience to that law that was given to man. It is as impossible that one who is only God, should obey the law that was given to man, as it is that he should suffer man's punishment.</p>
                  <p>It was necessary not only that Christ should take upon him a created nature, but that he should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ke upon him our nature. It would not have sufficed for us for Christ to have become an angel, and to have obeyed and suffered in the angelic nature. But it was necessary that he should become a man, and that upon three accounts.</p>

It was needful that he should come into this sinful, miserable undone world, to restore and save it. In order to man's recovery it was needful that he should come down to man, to the world that was man's proper habitation, and that he should tabernacle with us: John i.14, "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us."</p>
                  <p>CONCERNING the incarnation of Christ, I would observe these following things.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The incarnation itself; in which especially two things are to be considered, viz.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His conception, which was in the womb of one of the race of mankind, whereby he became truly the Son of man, as he was often called. He was one of the posterity of Adam, and a child of Abraham, and a son of David according to God's promise. But his conception was not in the way of ordinary generation, but by the power of the Holy Ghost. Christ was formed in the womb of the Virgin, of the substance of her body, by the power of the Spirit of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that he was the immediate son of the woman, but not the immediate son of any male whatsoever; and so was the seed of the woman, and the son of a Virgin, one that had never known man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His birth —Though the conception of Christ was supernatural, yet after he was conceived, and so the incarnation of Christ begun, his human nature was gradually perfected in the womb of the virgin, in a way of natural progress; and so his birth was in a way of natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e But his conception being supernatural, by the power of the Holy Ghost, he was both conceived and born without sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The second thing I would observe concerning the incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ, is the fulness of the time in which it was acomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It was after things had been preparing for it from the very first fall of mankind, and when all things were ready It came to pass at a time, which in infinite wisdom was the most fit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: Gal. iv.4. "But when the fulness of time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law."</p>
                  <p>It was now the most proper time on every account. Any time before the flood would not have been so fit a time. For then the mischief and ruin that the fall brought on mankind, was not so fully seen. The curse did not so fully come on the earth before the flood, as it did afterwards: for though the ground was cursed
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:017525_0143_0FA12A1B2DF34288"/>
in a great measure before, yet it pleased God that the curse should once, before the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Though mankind were mortal before the flood, yet their lives were the greater part of a thousand years in length, a kind of immortality in comparison with what the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a time for Christ to come, after the flood, before Moses's time: for till then mankind were not so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally apostatized from the true God: they were not fallen uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally into Heathenish darkness; and so the need of Christ, the light of the world was not so evident: and the woful consequence of the fall with respect to man's mortality, was not so fully mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest till then; for man's life was not so shortned as to be reduced to the present standard till about Moses's time.</p>
                  <p>It was most fit that the time of the Messiah's coming should not be till many ages after Moses's time; till all nations, but the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel, had lain long in Heathenish darkness; that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medilessness of their disease might by long experience be seen, and so the absolute necessity of the heavenly physician, before he came.</p>
                  <p>Another reason why Christ did not come soon after the flood pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably was, that the earth might be full of people, that Christ might have the more extensive kingdom, and that the effects of his light, and power, and grace, might be glorified, and that his victory over Satan might be attended with the more glory in the multitude of his conquests. It was also needful that the coming of Christ should be many ages after Moses, that the church might be prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which was formed by Moses for his coming, by the Messiah's being long prefigured, by his being many ways foretold, and by his being long expected. It was not proper that Christ should come before the Babylonish captivity, because Satan's kingdom was not then come to the height. The Heathen world before that con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ed of lesser kingdoms. But God saw meet that the Messiah should come in the time of one of the four great monarchies of the world. Nor was it proper that he should come in the time of the Babylonish monarchy; for it was God's will, that several general monarchies should follow one another, and that the coming of the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssiah should be in the time of the last, which appeared above them all. The Persian monarchy, by overcoming the Babylonian, appeared above it: and so the Grecian, by overcoming the Persian, appeared above that: and for the same reason, the Roman above
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:017525_0144_0FA12A1BEEA3AE98"/>
the Grecian. Now it was the will of God, that his Son should make his appearance in the world in the time of this greatest and strongest monarchy, which was Satan's visible kingdom in the world; that, by overcoming this, he might visibly overcome Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's kingdom in its greatest strength and glory, and so obtain the more complete triumph over Satan himself.</p>
                  <p>It was not proper that Christ should come before the Babylonish captivity. For, before that, we have not histories of the state of the Heathen world, to give us an idea of the need of a saviour. And besides, before that, learning did not much flourish, and so there had not been an opportunity to show the insufficiency of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man learning and wisdom to reform and save mankind. Again, before that, the Jews were not dispersed over the world, as they were afterwards; and so things were not prepared in this respect for the coming of Christ. The necessity of abolishing the Jewish dispensation was not then so apparent as it was afterwards, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the dispersion of the Jews; neither was the way prepared for the propagation of the gospel, as it was afterwards, by the same dispersion. Many other things might be mentioned, by which it would appear, that no other time before that very time in which Christ did come, would have been proper for his appearing in the world to purchase the redemption of men.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The next thing that I would observe concerning the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Christ, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the greatness of this event. Christ's incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was a greater and more wonderful thing than ever had come to pass; and there has been but one that has ever come to pass which was greater, and that was the death of Christ, which was afterwards. But Christ's incarnation was a greater thing than had ever come to pass before. The creation of the world was a very great thing, but not so great a thing as the incarnation of Christ. It was a great thing for God to make the creature, but not so great as for God, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for the creator himself, to become a creature. We have spoken of many great things that were accomplished from one age to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the ages between the fall of man and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">IV. What I would next observe concerning the incarnation of Christ, are the remarkable circumstances of it; such as his being born of a poor virgin, that was a pious holy person, but poor, as appeared by her offering at her purification: Luke ii.24. "And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtle doves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or two young pigeons." Which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to Lev. v.7. "And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons." And this poor

                  <p>He was born in the town of Bethlehem, as was foretold: and there was a very remarkable providence of God to bring about the fulfilment of this prophecy, the taxing of all the world by Augus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Caesar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in Luke ii<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He was born in a very low condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even in a stable, and laid in a manger.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. I would observe the concomitants of this great event, or the remarkable events with which it was attended — And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first thing I would take notice of that attended the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of Christ, was the return of the <hi>Spirit</hi>; which indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a little before the incarnation of Christ; but yet was given on occasion of that, as it was to reveal either his birth, or the birth of his fore-runner John the Baptist.

But now, on this occasion, they are granted anew, and the Spirit in these operations returns again. The first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of its restoration that we have any account of is in the vision of Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist, which we read of in the 1st chapter of Luke. The next is in the vision which the Virgin Mary had, of which we read also in the same chapter. The third is in the vision which Joseph had, of which we read in the 1st chapter of Matthew. In the next place, the Spirit was given to Elisabeth, Luke i.41. N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They had taken great notice of the prophecies and promises of these things all along: for we are told, that the angels desire to look into the affairs of redemption, 1 Pet. i.12. They had all along been the ministers of Christ in this affair of redemption, in all the several steps of it down from the very fall of man. So we read, that they were employed in God's dealings with Abraham, and in his dealings with Jacob, and in his dealings with the Israelites from time to time. And doubtless they had long joyfully expected the coming of Christ; but now they see it accomplished, and therefore greatly rejoice, and sing praises on this occasion.</p>
                  <p>Notice was taken of it by some among the Jews; as particularly by Elizabeth and the Virgin Mary before the birth of Christ; not to say by John the Baptist before he was born, when he leaped in his mother's womb as it were for joy, at the voice of the salutation of Mary. But Elizabeth and Mary do most joyfully praise God together, when they meet with Christ and his forerunner in their wombs, and the Holy Spirit in their souls. And afterwards what joyful notice is taken of this event by the shepherds, and by those holy persons Zacharias, and Simeon, and Anna! How do they praise God on this occasion! Thus the church of God in heaven, and the church on earth, do as it were unite in their joy and praise on this occasion.</p>

occasion of the purification of the blessed Virgin. We read, Hagg. ii.7. "The desire of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house (or temple) with glory." And in Mal. iii.1. "The Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of the covenant." And now was the first instance of the fulfilment of these prophecies.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The last concomitant I shall mention is the sceptre's depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Judah, in the death of Herod the Great. The sceptre had never totally departed from Judah till now. Judah's sceptre was greatly diminished in the revolt of the ten tribes in Jeroboam's time; and the sceptre departed from Israel or Ephraim at the time of the captivity of the ten tribes by Shalmaneser. But yet the sceptre remained in the tribe of Judah, under the kings of the house of David. And when the tribes of Judah and Benjamin were carried captive by Nebuchadnezzar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the sceptre of Judah ceased for a little while, till the return from the captivity under Cyrus: and then, though they were not an independent government, as they had been before, but owed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>alty to the kings of Persia: yet their governor was of themselves, who had the power of life and death, and they were governed by their own laws; and so Judah had a lawgiver from between his feet during the Persian and Grecian monarchies. Towards the latter part of the Grecian monarchy, the people were governed by kings of their own, of the race of the Maccabees, for the greater part of an hundred years; and after that they were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by the Romans. But yet the Romans suffered them to be governed by their own laws, and to have a king of their own. Herod the Great, who reigned about forty years, and governed with proper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But presently after Christ was born he died, as we have an account<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Matth. ii.19. and Archelaus succeeded him; but was soon put down by the Roman Emperor; and then the sceptre depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Judah. There were no more temporal kings of Judah after that, neither had that people their governors from the midst of themselves after that, but were ruled by a Roman governor sent among them; and they ceased any more to have the power of life and death among themselves. Hence the Jews say to Pilate, "It is not lawful for us to put any man to death," John xviii.31. Thus the sceptre departed from Judah when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>HAVING thus considered Christ's coming into the world, and his taking on him our nature, to put himself in a capacity for the purchase of redemption, I come now, SECONDLY, to speak of the purchase itself. — And in speaking of this, I would,</p>

                     <p>I WOULD show what is here intended by Christ's purchas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing redemption. There are two things that are intended by it viz. his satisfaction, and his merit. All is done by the price that Christ lays down. But the price that Christ laid down does two things: it pays our debt, and so it <hi>satisfies:</hi> by its intrinsic value, and by the agreement between the Father and the Son, it procures a title to us for happiness, and so it <hi>merits.</hi> The satisfaction of Christ is to free us from misery, and the merit of Christ is to purchase happiness for us.</p>
                     <p>The word <hi>purchase,</hi> as it is used with respect to the purchase of Christ, is taken either more strictly or more largely. It is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times used more strictly to signify only the merit of Christ; and sometimes more largely, to signify both his satisfaction and merit. Indeed most of the words which are used in this aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus sometimes divines use <hi>merit</hi> in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair for the whole price that Christ offered, both satisfactory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and and also positively meritorious. And so the word <hi>satisfaction</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For in some sense, not only suffering the penalty, but positively obeying, is needful to satisfy the law. The reason of this various use of these terms seems to be, that satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and merit do not differ so much really as relatively. They both consist in paying a valuable price, a price of infinite value; but only that price, as it respects a debt to be paid, is called <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>; and as it respects a positive good t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I NOW proceed to some general observations, concerning those things by which this purchase was made.—And here,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I would observe, that whatev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> in Christ had the nature of satisfaction, it was by virtue of the suffering or humiliation that was in it. But whatever had the nature of merit, it was by virtue of the obedience or righteousness there was in it. The satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:017525_0149_0FA12A206D717410"/>
of Christ consists in his answering the demands of law on man, which were consequent on the breach of the law. These were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered by suffering the penalty of the law. The merit of Christ consists in what he did to answer the demands of the law, which were prior to man's breach of the law, or to fulfil what the law demanded before man sinned, which was obedience.</p>
                     <p>The satisfaction or propitiation of Christ consists either in his suffering evil, or his being subject to abasement. For Christ did not only make satisfaction by proper suffering, but by whatever had the nature of humiliation, and abasement of circumstances. Thus Christ made satisfaction for sin, by continuing under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of death, while he lay buried in the grave, though neither his body nor soul properly endured any suffering after he was dead. Whatever Christ was subject to that was the judicial fruit of sin, had the nature of satisfaction for sin. But not only proper suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but all abasement and depression of the state and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of mankind below its primitive honour and dignity, such as his body's remaining under death, and body and soul remaining separate, and other things that might be mentioned, are the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al fruits of sin. And all that Christ did in his state of humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that had the nature of obedience or moral virtue or goodness in it, in one respect or another had the nature of merit in it, and was p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rt of the price with which he purchased happiness for the elect.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I would observe, that both Christ's satisfaction for sin, and also his meriting happiness by his righteousness, were carried on through the whole time of his humiliation. Christ's satisfaction for sin was not only by his last sufferings, though it was principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by them; but all his sufferings, and all the humiliation that he was subject to from the first moment of his incarnation to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, were propitiatory or satisfactory. Christ's satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was chiefly by his death, because his sufferings and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that was greatest. But all his other sufferings, and all his other humiliation, all along had the nature of satisfaction. So had the me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n circumstances in which he was born. His being born in such a low condition, was to make satisfaction for sin. His being born of a poor virgin, in a stable, and his being laid in a manger; his taking the human nature upon him in its low state and under those infi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mities brought upon it by the fall; his being born in the form of sinfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> flesh, had the nature of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. And so all his sufferings in his infancy and childhood, and all that labour, and contempt, and reproach, and temptation, and difficulty of any kind, or that he suffered through the whole course of his life, was of a propitiatory and satisfactory nature.</p>
                     <p>And so his purchase of happiness by his righteousness was also
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:017525_0150_0FA12A2239817B38"/>
carried on through the whole time of his humiliation till his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; not only in that obedience he performed through the course of his life, but also in the obedience he performed in laying down his life.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It was by the same things that Christ hath satisfied God's justice, and also purchased eternal happiness. This satisfaction and purchase of Christ were not only both carried on through the whole time of Christ's humiliation, but they were both carried on by the same things. He did not make satisfaction by some things that he did, and then work out a righteousness by other different things; but in the same acts by which he wrought out righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he also made satisfaction, but only taken in a different rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. One and the same act of Christ, considered with respect to the obedience there was in it, was part of his righteousness, and purchased heaven: but considered with respect to the self-denial, and difficulty, and humiliation, with which he performed it, had the nature of satisfaction for sin, and procured our pardon. Thus his going about doing good, preaching the gospel, and teaching his disciples, was a part of his righteousness, and purchase of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as it was done in obedience to the Father; and the same was part of his satisfaction, as he did it with great labour, trouble, and weariness, and under great temptations, exposing himself hereby to reproach and contempt. So his laying down his life had the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of satisfaction to God's offended justice, considered as his bearing our punishment in our stead: but considered as an act of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God, who had given him this command, that he should lay down his life for sinners, it was a part of his righteousness, and purchase of heaven, and as much the principal part of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness as it was the principal part of his satisfaction. And so to instance in his circumcision, what he suffered in that, had the nature of satisfaction: the blood that was shed in his circumcision was propitiatory blood; but as it was a conformity to the law of Moses, it was part of his meritorious righteousness. Though it was not properly the act of his human nature, he being an infant; yet it being what the human nature was the subject of, and being the act of that person, it was accepted as an act of his obedience, as our mediator.</p>
                     <p>And so even his being born in such a low condition, had the nature of satisfaction, by reason of the humiliation th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uit; and it required obedience of the Jews to all the positive commands of their institution. When God commanded J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nah to arise and go to Nineveh, the law of works required him to obey: and so it required Christ's obedience to all the positive commands which God gave him.</p>
                     <p>But more particularly, <hi>the commands of God which Christ obeyed,</hi>
                        <pb n="149" facs="unknown:017525_0152_0FA12A236E66AD68"/>
were of three kinds; they were either such as he was subject to merely <hi>as m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>n,</hi> or such as he was subject to <hi>as he was a Jew,</hi> or such as he was subject to purely <hi>as Mediator.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. He obeyed those commands which he was subject to merely as <hi>man:</hi> and they were the commands of the moral law, which was the same with that which was given at Mount Sinai, written in two tables of stone, which are obligatory on mankind of all nations and all ages of the world.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He obeyed all those laws he was subject to as he was <hi>a Jew.</hi> Thus he was subject to the ceremonial law, and was conformed to it. He was conformed to it in his being circumcised the eighth day; and he strictly obeyed it in going up to Jerusalem to the temple three times a-year; at least after he was come to the ago of twelve years, which seems to have been the age when the males began to go up to the temple. And so Christ constantly attended the service of the temple, and of the synagogues.</p>
                     <p>To this head of his obedience to the law that he was subject to as a Jew, may be reduced his submission to John's baptism. For it was a special command to the Jews, to go forth to John the Baptist, and be baptized of him; and therefore Christ being a Jew, was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to this command: and therefore, when he came to be baptized of John, and John objected, that he had more need to come to him to be baptized of him, he gives this reason for it, That it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that he should do it, that he might fulfil all righteousness. See Matth. iii.13.14.15.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Another law that Christ was subject to, was <hi>the mediatorial law,</hi> which contained those commands of God to which he was subject, not merely as man, nor yet as a Jew, but which related purely to his mediatorial office. Such were the commands which the Father gave him, to teach such doctrines, to preach the gospel, to work such miracles, to call such disciples, to appoint such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and finally to lay down his life: for he did all these things in obedience to commands he had received of the Father, as he often tells us. And these commands he was not subject to merely as man; for they did not belong to other men: nor yet was he subject to them as a Jew; for they were no part of the Mosaic law; but they were commands that he had received of the Father, that purely respected the work he was to do in the world in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial office.</p>
                     <p>It is to be observed, that Christ's righteousness, by which he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited heaven for himself, and all who believe in him, consists prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in his obedience to this mediatorial law: for in fulfilling this law consisted his chief work and business in the world. The history of the evangelists is chiefly taken up in giving an account of his obedience to this law: and this part of his obedience was
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:017525_0153_0FA12A242F445780"/>
that which was attended with the greatest difficulty of all; and therefore his obedience in it was most meritorious What Christ had to do in the world by virtue of his being Mediator, was infinitely more difficult than what he had to do merely as a man, or as a Jew. To his obedience to this mediatorial law belongs his going through his last sufferings, beginning with his agony in the garden, and ending with his resurrection.</p>
                     <p>As the obedience of the first Adam, wherein his righteousness would have consisted, if he had stood, would have mainly consisted, not his in obedience to the moral law, to which he was subject merely as man, but in his obedience to that special law that he was subject to as moral head and surety of mankind, even the command of abstaining from the tree of knowledge of good and evil; so the obedience of the second Adam, wherein his righteousness consists, lies mainly, not in his obedience of the law that he was subject to merely as man, but to that special law which he was subject to in his office as Mediator and surety for man.</p>
                     <p>BEFORE I proceed to the next distribution of Christ's righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, I would observe three things concerning Christ's obedience to these laws.</p>

The angels perform their obedience with that love which is perfect, with sinless perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but Christ did not do so, but he performed his obedience with much greater love than the angels do theirs, even infinite love; for tho' the human nature of Christ was not capable of love abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely infinite, yet Christ's obedience that was performed in that human nature, is not to be looked upon as mearly the obedience of the human nature, but the obedience of his person, as God man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there was infinite love of the person of Christ manifest in that obedience.

<pb n="152" facs="unknown:017525_0155_0FA12A25AE0524A8"/>
for the three last years and an half of his life. Most of the history of the evangelists is taken up in giving an account of what passed during these three years and an half; so is all the history of the Evangelist Matthew, excepting the two first chapters. So is the whole of the history of the Evangelist Mark; it begins and ends with it. And so also is all the gospel of John, and all the gospel of Luke, excepting the two first chapters; excepting also what we find in the evangelists concerning the ministry of John the Baptist. Christ's first appearing in his public ministry, is what is often call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>coming,</hi> in scripture. Thus John speaks of Christ's coming as what is yet to be, though he had been born long before.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the public ministry of Christ, I would observe the following things. 1. The forerunner of it. 2. The manner of his first entring upon it. 3. The works in which he was employed during the course of it; and, 4. The manner of his finishing it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The forerunner of Christ's coming in his public ministry was John the Baptist; He came preaching repentance for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins, to make way for Christ's coming, agreeable to the prophecies of him, Is. xl.3.4.5. and Matth. iv.5.6. It is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that John the Baptist began the ministry about three years and an half before Christ; so that John's ministry and Christ's put together, made seven years, which was the last of Daniel's weeks; and this time is intended in Dan. ix<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>27. "He will confirm the covenant with many for one week." Christ came in the midst of this week, viz. in the beginning of the last half of it, or the last three years and an half, as Daniel foretold, as in the verse just now quoted: "And in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease." John Baptist's ministry consisted prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in preaching the law, to awaken men and convince them of sin, to prepare men for the coming of Christ, to comfort them, as the law is to prepare the heart for the entertainment of the gospel.</p>
                     <p>A very remarkable out pouring of the Spirit of God attended John's ministry; and the effect of it was, that Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan, were awakened, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, went out to him, and submitted to him baptism, confessing their sins. John is spoken of as the greatest of all the prophets who came before Christ: Matth. xi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>11. "Among those that are born of women, there hath not risen a greater than John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist;" <hi>i e.</hi> he had the most honourable office He was as the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-star, which is the harbinger of the approaching day, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of the rising sun. The other prophets were stars that were to give light in the night; but we have heard how those stars went out on the approach of the gospel-day. But now the coming of Christ being very nigh, the morning star comes before him, the brightest of all the stars, as John the Baptist was the greatest of all the prophets.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="151" facs="unknown:017525_0156_0FA12A266DF97478"/>When Christ came in this public ministry, the light of that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-star decreased too: as we see, when the sun rises, it diminishes the light of the morning-star. So John the Baptist says of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, John iii 30. "He must increase, but I must decrease." And soon after Christ began his public ministry, John the Baptist was put to death; as the morning-star is visible a little while after the sun is risen, yet soon goes out.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The next thing to be taken notice of is Christ's entrance on his public ministry, which was by baptism, followed with the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the wilderness. His baptism was as it were his solemn inauguration, by which he entered on his ministry; and was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with his being anointed with the Holy-Ghost, in a solemn and visible manner, the Holy Ghost descending upon him in a visible shape like a dove, attended with a voice from heaven, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased," Matt. iii.16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17.</p>
                     <p>After this he was led by the devil into the wilderness. Satan made a violent on set upon him at his first entrance on his work; and now he had a remarkable trial of his obedience; but he got the victory. He who had such success with the first Adam, had none with the second.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I would take notice of the work in which Christ was employed during his ministry. And here are <hi>three</hi> things chiefly to be taken notice of, v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>z his preaching, his working miracles, and his calling and appointing disciples and ministers of his kingdom.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) His preaching the gospel. Great part of the work of his public ministry consisted in this; and much of that obedience by which he purchased salvation for us, was in his speaking those things which the Father commanded him. He more clearly and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly revealed the mind and will of God, than ever it had been revealed before. He came from the bosom of the Father, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly knew his mind, and was in the best capacity to reveal it. As the sun, as soon as it is risen, begins to shine; so Christ, as soon as he came into his public ministry, began to enlighten the world with his doctrine. As the law was given at Mount Sinai, so Christ delivered this evangelical doctrine, full of blessings, and not curses, to a multitude on a mountain, as we have an account in the 5th, 6th, and 7th chapters of Matthew.</p>
                     <p>When he preached, he did not teach as the scribes, but he taught as one having authority; so that his hearers were astonished at his doctrine. He did not reveal the mind and will of God in the style in which the prophets used to preach, as not speaking their own words, but the words of another; and used to speak in such a style as this, "Thus saith the Lord;" but Christ, in such a style
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:017525_0157_0FA12A2860087C38"/>
as this, "I say unto you," thus or thus; "Verily, verily, I say unto you." He delivered his doctrines, not only as the doctrines of God the Father, but as his own doctrines. He gave forth his commands, not as the prophets were wont to do, as God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands but as his own commands. He spake in such a style as this, "This is <hi>my commandment,</hi>" John xv.12. "Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsover <hi>I command you,</hi>" ibid. 14.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) Another thing that Christ was imployed in during the course of his ministry, was working miracles. Concerning which we may observe several things.</p>
                     <p>Their <hi>multitude.</hi> Besides particular instances, we often have an account of mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>titudes coming at once with deseases, and his healing them.</p>
                     <p>They were <hi>works of mercy.</hi> In them was displayed not only his infinite power and greatness, but his infinite mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. He went about doing good, healing the sick, restoring sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, and the proper use of their limbs to the lame and halt; feeding the hungry, cleansing the leprous and raising the dead.</p>
                     <p>They were almost all of them <hi>such as had been spoken of as the peculiar works of God,</hi> in the Old Testament. So with respect to stilling the sea, Psal. cvii.29. "He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still." So as to walking on the sea in a storm: Job. ix.8. "Which alone—treadeth upon the waves of the sea." So as to casting our devils: Psal. lxxiv.14. "Thou breakest the heads of leviathan in pieces." So as to feeding a multitude in a wilderness: Deut. viii.16. "Who fed thee in the wilderness with manns." So as to telling man's thoughts: Amos iv.13. "Lo, he that—declareth unto man what is his thought— the Lord, the God of hosts is his name." So as to raising the dead: Psa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. lxviii 20. "Unto God the Lord belong the issues from death." So as to opening the eyes of the blind: Psal. cxlvi.8. "The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind." So as to healing the sick: Psal. ciii.3. "Who healeth all thy diseases." So as to lifting up those who are bowed together: Psal. cxlvi.8. "The Lord raiseth them that are bowed down."</p>
                     <p>They were in general such works as were <hi>images of the great work which he came to work on man's heart</hi>; representing that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, spiritual cleansing, healing, renovation, and resurrection, which all his redeemed are the subjects of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He wrought them in such a manner as to show, that he did them by his own power, and not by the power of another, at the other prophets did.</hi> They were wont to work all their miracles in the name of the Lord: but Christ wrought in his own name. Moses was forbidden to enter into Canaan, because he seemed by his
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:017525_0158_0FA12A28AE075728"/>
speech to assume the honour of working only one miracle to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Nor did Christ work miracles as the apostles did, who wrought them all in the name of Christ; but he wrought them in his own name, and by his own authority and will: Thus, saith he, "I will be thou clean." Matth. viii.3. And in the same strain he put the question, "Believe ye that I am able to do this?" Matth. ix.28.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) Another thing that Christ did in the course of his ministry, was to call his disciples. He called many disciples. There were many that he employed as ministers; he sent seventy disciples at one time in this work: but there were twelve that he set apart as apostles, who were the grand ministers of his kingdom, and as it were the twelve foundations of his church, See Rev. xxi.14. These were the main instruments of setting up his kingdom in the world, and therefore shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I would observe how he finished his ministry. And this was</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) In giving his dying counsels to his disciples, and all that should be his disciples, which we have recorded particularly in the 14th, 15th, and 16th chapters of John's g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>spel.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) In instituting a solemn memorial of his death. This he did in instituting the sacrament of the Lord's supper, wherein we have a representation of his body broken, and of his blood shed.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3) In offering up himself, as God's high priest, a sacrifice to God, which he did in his last sufferings. This act he did as God's minister, as God's anointed priest; and it was the greatest act of his public ministry, the greatest act of his obedience, by which he purchased heaven for believers. The priests of old used to do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things as God's ministers; but then were they in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>igh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est execution of their office when they were actually offering sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice on the altar. So the greatest thing that Christ did in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his priestly office, and the greatest thing that he ever did, and the greatest thing that ever was done, was the offering up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a sacrifice to God. Herein he was the antetype of all that had been done by all the priests, and in all their s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="3">III. THE third distribution of the acts by which Christ purchas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed redemption, regards <hi>the virtues that Christ exercised and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested</hi> in them. And here I would observe, that Christ in doing the work that he had to do here in the world for our redemption, exercised every possible virtue and grace. Indeed there are some particular virtues that sinful man may have, that were not in Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not from any want or defect of virtue, but because his virtue was perfect and without defect. Such is the vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. Those virtues were not in Christ, because he had no sin of his own

to repent of, nor any lust to deny. But all virtues which do not presuppose sin, were in him, and that in a higher degree than ever they were in any other man, or any mere creature. Every virtue in him was perfect. Virtue itself was greater in him than in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other; and it was under greater adva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The virtue that Christ exercised in the work he did, may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three sorts, v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>z the virtues which more immediately res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t God, those which immediately respect himself, and those which immediately respect men.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Those <hi>virtues which more immediately respect God,</hi> appeared in Christ in the work that he did for our red<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mption. There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in him an holy fear and reverence towards God the Father. Christ had a greater trial of his virtue in this respect than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had, from the honourableness of his person. This was the temptation of the angels that fell, to cast off their worship of God, and reverence of his majesty, that they were beings of such exalted dignity and worthiness themselves. But Christ was infi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>itely more worthy and honourable than they; for he was the eternal Son of God, and his person was equal to the person of God the Father: and yet, as he had taken on him the office of mediator, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, he was full of reverence towards God. He adored him in the most reverential manner time after time. So he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested a wonderful love towards God. The angels give great testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of their love towards God, in their constancy and agility in doing the will of God; and many saints have given great testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of their love, who, from love to God, have endured great labours and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>fferings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but none ever gave such testimonies of love to God as Christ has given; none ever performed such a labour of love as he, and suffered so much from love to God. So he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested the most wonderful submission to the will of God. Never was any one's submission so tried as his was. So he manifested the most wonderful spirit of obedience that ever was manifested.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In this work he most wonderfully manifested those <hi>virtues which more immediately respected himself</hi>; as particularly humility, patience, and contempt of the world. Christ, though he was the most excellent and honorable of all men, yet was the most humble; yea, he was the most humble of all creatures. No angel or man ever equalled him in humility, though he was the highest of all creatures in dignity and honorableness. Christ would have been under the greatest temptations to pride, if it had been possible for any thing to be a temptation to him. The temptation of the angels that fell was the dignity of their nature, and the honorableness of their circumstances; but Christ was infinitely more honorable than
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:017525_0160_0FA12A2A2F8CD618"/>
they. The human nature of Christ was so honored as to be in the same person with the eternal Son of God, who was equal with God; and yet that human nature was not at all lifted up with pride. Nor was the man Christ Jesus at all lifted up with pride with all those wonderful works which he wrought, of healing the sick, curing the blind, lame, and maimed, and raising the dead. Though he knew that God had appointed him to be the king over heaven and earth, angels and men, as he says, Matth. xi.27. "<hi>All</hi> things are delivered unto me of my Father;" tho' he knew he was such an infinitely honorable person, and thought it not robbery to be equal with G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d; and though he knew he was the heir of God the Father's kingdom: yet such was his humility, that he did not disdain to be abased and depressed down into lower and viler circumstances and sufferings than ever any other elect creature was; so that he became least of all, and lowest of all. The proper trial and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of humility, is stooping or complying with those acts or circumstances, when called to it, which are very low, and contain great abasement. But none ever stooped so low as Christ, if we consider either the infinite height that he stooped from, or the great depth to which he stood. Such was his hum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ity, that though he knew his infinite worthiness of honor, and of being honored ten thousand times as much as the highest prince on earth, or angel in heaven; yet he did not think it too much when called to it, to be bound as a cursed malefactor, and to become the laughi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Was not this a wonderful manifestation of humility, when be chearfuly and most freely submitted to this abasement?</p>
                     <p>How did his patience shine forth under all the terrible sufferings which he endured, when he was dumb, and opened not his mouth, but went as a lamb to the slaughter, and was like a patient lamb under all the sufferings he endured from first to last.</p>
                     <p>What contempt of the glory of this world was there, when he rather chose this contempt, and meanness, and suffering, than to wear a temporal crown, and be invested with the external glories of an earthly prince, as the multitude often solicited him?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Christ, in the work which he wrought out, in a wonderful manner exercised those <hi>virtues which more immediately respect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>her men.</hi> These may be summed up under two heads, viz. meekness, and love.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="156" facs="unknown:017525_0161_0FA12A2AEDFA5AF0"/>Christ's meekness was his humble calmness of spirit under the provocations that he met with. None ever met with so great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations as he did. The greatness of provocation lies in two things, viz. in the degree of opposition by which the provocation is given; and, secondly, in the degree of the unreasonableness of that opposition, or in its being very causeless, and without reason, and the great degree of obligation to the contrary. Now, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider both these things, no man ever met with such provocations as Christ did, when he was upon earth If we consider how much he was hated, what abuses he suffered from the vilest of men, how great his sufferings from men were, and how spiteful and how contemptuous they were, in offering him these abuses; and also consider how causeless and unreasonable these abuses were, how undeserving he was of them, and how much deserving of the contrary, viz. of love, and honor, and good treatment at their hands: I say, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider these things, no man ever met with a thousandth part of the provocation that Christ met with from men: and yet how meek w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s he under all! how composed and quiet his spirit! how far from being in a ruffle and tumult! When he was reviled, he reviled not again; and as a sheep before the shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth. No appearance was there of a revengeful spirit: on the contrary, what a spirit of forgiveness did he exhibit! so that he fervently and effectually prayed for their forgiveness, when they were in the highest act of provocation that ever they perpetrated viz. nailing him to the cross: Luke xxiii.34. "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do."</p>
                     <p>Never did there appear such an instance of love to men, Christ's love to men that he showed when on earth, and especially in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through his last sufferings, and offering up his life and soul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der those sufferings, which was his greatest act of love, was far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all parallel. There have been very remarkable manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of love in some of the saints, as in the Apostle Paul, the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle John, and others: but the love to men that Christ showed when on earth, as much exceeded the love of all other men, as the ocean exceeds a small stream.</p>
                     <p>It is to be observed, that all the virtues which appeared in Christ shone brightest in the close of his life, under the trials he met with then. Eminent virtue always shows brightest in the fire. Pure gold shows its purity chiefly in the furnace. It was chiefly under those trials which Christ underwent in the close of his life, that his love to God, his honor of God's majesty, and his regard to the honor of his law, and his spirit of obedience, and his humility, and contempt of the world, and his patience, and his meekness, and his spirit of forgiveness towards men, appeared. Indeed every thing that Christ did to work out redemption for us appears mainly in the close of his life. Here mainly i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">§ II. To take a view of them with respect to the <hi>satisfaction</hi> that he thereby made for sin, or the <hi>sufferings or humiliation</hi> that he was the subject of in them on our account. And here,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He was subject to uncommon humiliation and sufferings in his infancy. He was born to that end that he might die; and therefore he did as it were begin to die as soon as he was born. His mother suffered in an uncommon manner in bearing him. When her travail came upon her, it is said, "there was no room in the inn," Luke ii.7. She was forced to betake herself to a stable; and therefore Christ was born in the place of the bringing forth of the beasts. Thus he suffered in his birth, as though he had been meaner and viler than a man, and not possessed of the dignity of the human nature, but had been of the rank of the brute creatures. And we may conclude, that his mother's circumstances in other respects were proportionably strait and difficult, and that she was destitute of the conveniences necessary for so young an infant which others were wont to have; for want of which the new-born babe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt suffered much.</p>
                     <p>Besides, he was persecuted in his infancy. They began to seek his life as soon as he was born. Herod, the chief man of the land, was so engaged to him, that, in order to it, he killed all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under. Christ suffered banishment in his infancy, was driven out of his native country into Egypt, and without doubt suffered much by being carried so long a journey, when he was so young, into a strange country.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Christ was subject to great humiliation in his private life at Nazareth. He there led a servile obscure life, in a mean labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous occupation: for he is called not only the <hi>carpenter's son,</hi> but the <hi>carpenter</hi>: Mark vi.3. "Is not this the carpenter, the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of James and Joses, and Juda, and Simon?" He, by hard labour, earned his bread before he ate it, and so suffered that curse which God pronounced on Adam, Gen. iii.13. "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread." Let us consider how great a degree of humiliation the glorious Son of God, the creator of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, was subject to in this, that for about thirty years he should live a private obscure life among labouring men, and all this while be overlooked, and not taken notice of in the world, as more than other common labourers. Christ's humiliation in some res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects was greater in private life than in the time of his public mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry. There were many manifestations of his glory in the word he preached, and the great miracles he wrought; but the first thirty years of his life he spent among mean ordinary men, as it were in
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:017525_0163_0FA12A2D763CAC90"/>
silence, without those manifestations of his glory, or any thing to make him to be taken notice of more than any ordinary mechanic, but only the spotless purity and eminent holiness of his life; and that was in a great measure hid in obscurity; so that he was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle taken notice of till after his baptism.</p>
                     <p n="3">III Christ was the subject of great humiliation and suffering during his public life, from his baptism till the night wherein he was betrayed. As particularly,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He suffered great poverty, so that he had not "where to lay his head," Matth. viii.20. and commonly used to lodge abroad in the open air, for want of a shelter to betake himself to; as you will see is manifest, if you compare the following places together, which I shall but name to you, even Matth. viii.20. and John xviii.1.2. and Luke xxi.37. and ch xxii.39. So that what was spoken of Christ in Cant. v.2. "My head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night," was literally fulfiled. Through his poverty he doubtless was often pinched with hunger, and thirst, and cold. We read, Matth. iv.2 that he was an hungred; and so again in Matt. xxi.18 H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s mother and natural relations were poor, and not able to help him: and he was maintained by the charity of some of his disciples while he lived. So we read in Luke viii. at the beginning, of a certain women that followed his, and minister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him of their substance. He was so poor, that he was not able to pay the tribute that was demanded of him, without the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous coming of a fish to bring him the money out of the sea in his mouth. See Matth. xviii.27. And when he ate his last pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sover, it was not at his own charge, but at the charge of another, as appears by Luke xxii.7. &amp;c. From his poverty he had no grave of his own to be buried in. It was the manner of the Jews, unless they were very poor, and were not able, to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a sepulcher while they lived. But Christ had no land of his own, though he was possessor of heaven and earth; and therefore was buried by Joseph of Arimathea's charity, and in his own tomb, which he had prepared for himself.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He sufferd great hatred and reproach, He was despised and rejected of men. He was by most esteemed a poor insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant person; one of little account, slighted for his low parentage, and his mean city Nazareth. He was reproached as a glutton and drunkard, a friend of publicans and sinners; was called a deceiver of the people; sometimes was called a madman, and a Samaritian, and one possessed with a devil, John vii.20. and viii.48 and x.20. He was called a blasphemer, and was accounted by many a wizzard, or one that wrought miracles by the black art, and communication with Beelzebub. They excommunicated him, and agreed to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate any man that should own him, as, John ix.22. They wished
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:017525_0164_0FA12A2DEDA93968"/>
him dead, and were continually seeking to murder him; sometimes by force and sometimes by craft. They often took up stones to stone him, and once led him to the brow of a hill, intending to throw him down the precipice, to dash him in pieces against the rocks.</p>
                     <p>He was thus hated and reproached by his own visible people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> John i.11. "He came to his own, and his own received him not." He was principally despised and hated by those who were in chief repute, their greatest men. And the hatred wherewith he was hated was general. Into whatever part of the land he went, he met with hatred and contempt. He met with these in Capernaum, and when he went to Jericho, when he went to Jerusalem, which was the holy city, when he went to the temple to worship, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in Nazareth, his own city, and among his own relations and his old neighbours.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He suffered the buffetings of Satan in an uncommon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. We read of one time in particular, when he had a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with the devil, when he was in the wilderness forty days, with nothing but wild beasts and devils; and was so exposed to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's power, that he was bodily carried about by him from place to place, while he was otherwise in a very suffering state.</p>
                     <p>So much for the humiliation and suffering of Christ's public life from his baptism to the night wherein he was betrayed.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. I come now to his last humiliation and sufferings, from the evening of the night wherein he was betrayed to his resurection. Here was his greatest humiliation and suffering, by which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally he made satisfaction to the justice of God for the sins of men. First, his life was sold by one of his own disciples for thirty pieces of silver, which was the price of the life of a servant, as you may see in Exod. xxi.32. Then he was in that dreadful agony in the garden. There came such a dismal gloom upon his soul, that he began to be sorrowful and very heavy, and said, his "soul was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding sorrowful even unto death, and was sore amazed." So violent was the gloom of his soul, as to force the blood through the pores of his skin; so that while his soul was overwhelmed with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ing sorrow, his body was all clotted with blood. The disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, who used to be as his friends and family, at this time above all appeared cold towards him, and unconcerned for him, at the same time that his Father's face was hid from him. Judas, to whom Christ had been so very merciful, and treated as one of his family or familiar friends, comes and betrays him in the most deceitful, and treacherous manner. The officers annd soldiers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and bind him; his disciples forsake him, and flee; his own best friends do not stand by him to comfort him in this time of his distress. He is led away as a malefactor to appear before the
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:017525_0165_0FA12A2EAF6E5D50"/>
priests and scribes, his venomous, mortal enemies, that they might sit as his judges who sat up all night, to have the pleasure of insult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, now they had got him into their hands. But because they aimed at nothing short of his life, they set themselves to find some colour to put him to death, and seek for witnesses against him. When none appeared, they set some to bear false witness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when their witness did not agree together, then they go to examining him, to catch something out of his own mouth. They hoped he would say, that he was the Son of God, and then they thought they sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ld have enough. But because they see they are not like to obtain it without it, they then go to force him to say it, by adjuring him, in the name of God, to say whether he was or not: and when he confessed that he was, then they supposed they had enough; and then it was time of rejoiceing with them, which they show, by falling upon him, and spitting in his face, and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding him, and striking Christ in the face with the palms of their hands, and then bidding him prophesy who it was that struck him; thus ridiculing him for pretending to be a prophet. And the very servants have a hand in the sport: Mark, xiv.65. "And the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants did strike him with the palms of their hands."</p>
                     <p>During the sufferings of that night, Peter, one of the chief of his own disciples, instead of standing by him to comfort him, appears ashamed to own him, and denies and renounces him with oaths and curses. And after the chief priests and elders had finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the night in so shamefully abusing him, when the morning was come, which was the morning of the most wonderful day that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was, they led him away to Pilate, to be condemned to death by him, because they had not the power of life and death in their own hands. He is brought before Pilate's judgement-seat, and there the priests and elders accuse him as a traitor. When Pilate, upon examining into the matter, declared he found no fault in him, the Jews were but the more fierce and violent to have him condemned. Upon which Pilate, after clearing him, very unjustly brings him upon a second trial; and then not finding any thing against him acquits him again. Pilate treats him as a poor worthless fellow; but is ashamed on so little pretence to condemn him as a traitor.</p>
                     <p>Then he was sent to Herod to be tried by him, and was brought before Herod's judgment-seat; and his enemies followed, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulently accused him before Herod. Herod does not condemn him as a traitor, or one that would set up for a king, but looks upon him as Pilate did, as a poor worthless creature, not worthy to be taken notice of, and does but make a mere laugh of the Jews accusing him as a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous person to Caesar, as one that was in danger of setting up to be a king against him; and therefore, in derision, dresses him up in a mock robe, and makes sport of him, and sends him back through
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:017525_0166_0FA12A2F6F6FE3F0"/>
the streets of Jerusalem to Pilate with the mock robe on.</p>
                     <p>Then the Jews prefer Barabbas before him, and are instant and violent with loud voices to Pilate, to crucify him. So Pilate, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had cleared him twice, and Herod once, very unrighteously brings him on trial the third time, to try if he could not find some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against him sufficient to crucify him. Christ was stripped and scourged: thus he gave his back to the smiter. After that, though Pilate still declared that he found no fault in him; yet so unjust was he, that for fear of the Jews be delivered Christ to be crucified. But before they execute the sentence, his spiteful and cruel enemies take the pleasure of another spell of mocking him; they get round him, and make a set business of it. They stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe, and a reed in his hand, and a crown of thorns on his head. Both Jews and Roman soldiers were united in the transaction; they bow the knee before him, and in derision cry, "Hail, king of the Jews." They spit upon him also, and take the reed out of his hand, and smite him on the head. After this they led him away to crucify him, and made him carry his own cross, till he sunk under it, his strength being spent; and then they laid it on one Simon a Cyrenian.</p>
                     <p>At length, being come to Mount Calvary, they execute the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which Pilate had so unrighteously pronounced. They nail him to his cross by his hands and feet, then raise it erect, and fix one end in the ground, he being still suspended on it by the nails which pierced his hands and feet. Now Christ's sufferings are come to the extremity: now the cup, which he so earnestly prayed that it might pass from him, is come, and he must, he does drink it. In those days crucifixion was the most tormenting kind of death by which any were wont to be executed. There was no death wherein the person expired so much of mere torment: and hence the Roman word, which signifies <hi>torment,</hi> is taken from this kind of death. —Besides what our Lord endured in his excruciating death in his body, he endured vastly more in his soul. Now was that travail of his soul, of which we read in the prophet; now it pleased God to bruise him, and to put him to grief; now he pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out his soul unto death, as in Is. liii. If the mere forethought of this cup made him sweat blood, how much more dreadful and excruciating must the drinking of it have been! Many martyrs have endured much in their bodies, while their souls have been joyful, and have sung for joy, whereby they have been supported under the sufferings of their outward man, and have triumphed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them. But this was not the case with Christ; he had no such support; but his sufferings were chiefly those of the mind, tho' the other were extremely great. In his crucifixion Christ did not sweat blood, as he had before, because his blood had vent other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:017525_0167_0FA12A302EDD5468"/>
and not because his agony was now not so great. But tho' he did not sweat blood, yet such was the suffering of his soul, that probably it rent his vitals; as seems probable by this that when his side was pierced, there came forth blood and water. And so here was a kind of literal fulfilment of that in Psal. xxii.14. "I am poured out like water:—my heart is like wax, it is melted in the midst of my bowels."</p>
                     <p>Now under all these sufferings the Jews still mock him; and wagging their heads say, "Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself: if thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross." And even the chief priests, scribes, and elders, joined in the cry, saying, "He saved others, himself he cannot save." Probably the devil at the same time tormented him to the utmost of his power; and hence it is said, Luke xxii.53. "This is your hour, and the power of darkness."</p>
                     <p>Under these sufferings, Christ having cried out once and again with a loud voice, at last he said, "It is finished," (John xix.30), "and bowed the head, and gave up the ghost." And thus was finished the greatest and most wonderful thing that ever was done. Now the angels beheld the most wonderful fight that ever they saw. Now was accomplished the main thing that had been p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>inted at by the various institutions of the ceremonial law, and by all the typical dispensation, and by all the sacrifices from the beginning of the world.</p>
                     <p>Christ being thus brought under the power of death, continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it till the morning of the next day but one; and then was finished that great work, the purchase of our redemption, for which such great preparation had been made from the beginning of the world. Then was finished all that was required in order to satisfy the threatenings of the law, and all that was necessary in order to satisfy divine justice; then the utmost that vindictive justice demanded, even the whole debt was paid. Then was finished the whole of the purchase of eternal life. Now there is no need of any thing more to be done towards a purchase of salvation for sinners; nor has ever any thing been done since, nor will any thing more be done for ever and ever.</p>

If it be as we have heard, how greatly do these things reprove those who do not believe in, but reject the Lord Jesus Christ! i. e. all those who do not heartily receive him. Persons may receive him in profession, and carry well outwardly towards him, and may wish that they had some of those benefits that Christ has purchased, and yet their hearts not receive Christ; they may be hearty in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that they do towards Christ; they may have no high esteem of Christ, nor any sincere honour or respect to Christ; they may never have opened the door of their heart to Christ, but have kept him shut out all their days, ever since they first heard of Christ, and his salvation has been offered to them. Though their hearts have been opened to others, their doors have been flung wide open to them, and they have had free admittance at all times, and have been embraced and made much of, and the best room in their hearts has been given them, and the throne of their hearts has been allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them: yet Christ has always been shut out, and they have been deaf to all his knocks and calls.

                     <p n="2">II. What has been said, affords matter of reproof to those who, instead of believing in Christ, trust in themselves for salvation. It is a common thing with men to take it upon themselves to purchase salvation for themselves, and so to do that great work which Christ came into the world to do. Are there none such here who trust in their prayers, and in their good conversation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Consider three things:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. How great a thing is which you take upon you. You take upon you to do the work of the great Saviour of the world. You trust in your own doings to appease God for your sins, and to incline the heart of God to you. Though you are poor, worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, vile, polluted worms of the dust; yet so arrogant are you, that you take upon you that very work, that the only begotten Son of God did when upon earth, and that he became man to capacitate himself for, and in order to which God spent four thousand years in all the great dispensations of his providence in the government of the world, aiming chiefly at this, to make way for Christ's coming to do this work. This is the work that you take upon yourself, and foolishly think yourself sufficient for it; as though your prayers, and other performances, were excellent enough for this purpose. Consider how vain is the thought which you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of yourself. How much such arrogance appear in the sight of Christ, whom it cost so much to make a purchase of salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when it was not to be obtained even by him, so great and glorious a person, at a cheaper rate than his wading through a sea of blood, and passing through the midst of the furnace of God's wrath.

Your self-righteousness charges God with the greatest folly, as though he has done all things in vain, even so much in vain, that he has done all this to bring about an accomplishment of that which you alone, a little worm, with your poor polluted prayers, and the little pains you take in religion, mingled with all that hypocrisy and filthiness, are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to accomplish for yourself without Christ's help. For if you can appease God's anger, and can commend yourself to God by these means, then you have no need of Christ; but he is dead in vain: Gal. ii 21. "If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.</p>
                     <p>If you can do this by our prayers and good works, Christ might have spared his pains; he might have spared his blood; he might have kept within the bosom of his Father, without coming down into this evil world to be despised, reproached, and persecuted to death; God needed not haved busied himself, as he did for four thousand years together, causing so many changes in the state of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Alas! how blind are natural men! how sottish are the thoughts they have of things! and especially how vain are the thoughts which they have of themselves!

Yet this is that part which self-righteous persons go about to accomplish for themselves.

Their self-righteousness does in effect charge Christ's offering up himself in these sufferings, as the greatest instance of folly that ever men or angels saw, instead of being the most glorious display of the divine wisdom and grace that ever was seen.

                     <p>Let persons hence be warned against a self righteous spirit. You that are seeking your salvation, and taking pains in religion, take heed to yourselves that you do not trust in what you do; that you do not harbour any such thoughts; that God now, seeing how much you are reformed, how you take pains in religion, and how you are sometimes effected, will be pacified towards you with respect to your sins, and on account of it will not be so angry for your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sins; and that you shall gain on him by such things, and draw his heart to show you mercy; or at least that God ought to accept of what you do, so as to be inclined by it in some measure to forgive you, and have mercy on you. If you entertain this thought, that God is obliged to do it, and does not act justly if he refuse to regard your prayers and pains, and so quarrel with God, and complain of him for not doing, this shows what your opinion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s of your own righteousness, viz. that it is a valuable price of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and ought to be accepted of God as such. Such complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, and quarrelling with him, for not taking more notice of your righteousness, plainly shows that you are guilty of all that arrogance that has been spoken of, thinking yourself sufficient to offer the price of your own salvation.</p>

What has been said on this subject, affords matter of reproof to those who carelessly neglected the salvation of Christ; such as live a senseless kind of life, neglecting the business of religion and their own souls for the present, not taking any course to get an interest in Christ, or what he has done and suffered, or any part in that glorious salvation he has purchased by that price, but rather have their minds taken up about the gains of the world, or about the vanities and pleasures of youth, and so make light of what they hear from time to time of Christ's salvation, that they do not at present so much as seek after it.

                     <p n="1">1. The completeness of the purchase which has been made. As you have heard, this work of purchasing salvation was wholly
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:017525_0176_0FA12A386DCADEB0"/>
finished during the time of Christ's humiliation. When Christ rose from the dead, and was exalted from that abasement to which he submitted for our salvation, the purchase of eternal life was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely made, so that there was no need of any thing more to be done in order to it. But now the servants were sent forth with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> message <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hich we have account of in Matth. xxii.4. "Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fattlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage." There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things being ready, are your sins many and great? Here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> done by Christ to procure their pardon. There is no need of any righteousness of yours to obtain your pardon and jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification: no, you may come freely, without money and without price. Since therefore there is such a free and gracious invitation given you, come; come naked as you are; come as a poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned criminal; come and cast yourself down at Christ's feet, as one justly condemned, and utterly helpless in yourself. Here is a complete salvation wrought out by Christ, and through him offered to you. Come, therefore, accept of it, and be saved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For Christ to reject one that thus comes to him, would be to frustrate all those great things which you have heard that God brought to pass from the fall of man to the incarnation of Christ. It would also frustrate all that Christ did and suffered while on earth; yea, it would frustrate the incarnation of Christ itself, and all the great things done in preparation for his incarnation; for all these things were for that end, that those might be saved who should come to Christ. Therefore you may be sure Christ will not be backward in saving those who come to him, and trust in him: for he has no desire to frustrate himself in his own work; it cost him too dear for that. Neither will God the Father refuse you; for he has no desire to frustrate himself in all that he did for so many hundreds and thousands of years, to prepare the way for the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of sinners by Christ. Come, therefore, hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"Come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."</p>

               <p>But Christ having finished that greatest and most difficult of all works, the work of the purchase of redemption, now is come the time for obtaining the end of it, the glorious effect of it. This is the next work he goes about. Having gone thro' the whole course of his sufferings and humiliation, there is an end to all things of that nature: he is never to suffer any more. But now is the time for him to obtain the joy that was set before him. Having made his soul on offering for sin, now is the time for him to see his seed, and to have a portion divided to him with the great, and to divide the spoil with the strong.</p>
               <p>One design of Christ in what he did in his humiliation, was to lay a foundation for the overthrow of Satan's kingdom; and now is come the time to effect it, as Christ, a little before his crucifixion, said, John xii.31. "Now is the judgement of this world; now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

"Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered: and being made perfect, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him."

And all the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of God's providence henceforward, even to the final con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of all things, are to give Christ his reward, and fulfil his end in what he did and suffered upon earth, and to fulfil the joy that was set before him.</p>

                  <p>BEFORE I enter on the consideration of any particular things accomplished in this period, I would briefly observe some things in general concerning it; and particularly how the times of this period are represented in scripture.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The times of this period, for the most part, are those which in the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">II. The whole time of this period is sometimes in scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they were written from our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come." And the Apostle, Heb. ix.26, in this expression of <hi>the end of the world,</hi> means the whole of the gosple day, from the birth of Christ to the finishing of the day of judgment: "But now once in the end of the world, hath he appeared, to put away sin by the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of himself." This space of time may well be called <hi>the end of the world</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for this whole time was taken up in bringing things to their great end and issue, to that great issue that God had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the way for, in all the great dispensations of providance, from the first fall of man to this time.

                     </gap>shippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him." This is one instance of the temporary world's coming to an end, and the eternal world's beginning. After that, the outward temple, and the outward city Jerusalem, came to an end, to give place to the setting up of the spiritual temple and the spiritual city, which are to last to eternity; which is another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of removing those things which are ready to vanish away, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. After that the old Heathen empire comes to an end, to make way for the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Christ, which shall last to all eternity; which is another step of bringing the temporal world to an end, and of the beginning of the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After that, upon the fall of Antichrist and end is put to Satan's visible kingdom on earth, to establish Christ's kingdom, which is an eternal king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; as the prophet Daniel says, chap. vii.27.

Lastly, the very frame of this corruptible world shall come to an end, to make way for the church to dwell in another dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place, which shall last to eternity; which is the last instance of the same thing.</p>

                     <pb n="175" facs="unknown:017525_0180_0FA12A3C75B849F0"/>Because the world is thus coming to an end by various steps and degrees, the Apostle perhaps uses this expression, that the <hi>ends</hi> of the world are come on us; not the <hi>end,</hi> but the <hi>ends,</hi> of the plural number, as though the world as several endings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> after another.</p>
                  <p>The gospel-dispensation is the last state of things in the world; and this state is a finishing state: it is all spent in finishing things off which before had been preparing, or abolishing things which before had stood. It is all spent as it were in summing things up, and bringing them to their issues, and their proper fulfilment. Now all the old types are fulfiled, and all the prophecies of all the prophets from the beginning of the world shall be accomplished in this period.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. That state of things which is attained in the events of this period is called <hi>a new heaven and a new earth:</hi> Is. lxv.17.18. "For behold, I create new heavens, and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. But be you glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy." And ch. lxvi.22. "For as the new heavens and the new earth which I make, shall remain before me; so shall your seed and your name remain." See also ch. li.16. As the former state of things, or the old world, by one step after another, is through this period coming to an end; so the new state of things, or the new world, which is a spiritual world, is beginning and setting up.</p>
                  <p>The heaven and earth which are corruptable, are shaking, that the new heavens and new earth, which cannot be shaken, may be established and remain.</p>
                  <p>In consequence of each of these finishings of the old state of things, there is a new beginning of a new and eternal state of things. So was that which acconpanied the destruction of Jerusalem, which was an establishing of the spiritual Jerusalem, instead of the literal. So with respect to the destruction of the old Heathen empire, and all the other endings of the old state of things, till at length the very outward frame of the old world itself shall come to an end; and the church shall dwell in a world new to it, or to a great part of it, even heaven, which will be a new habitation; and then shall the utmost be accomplished that is meant by the new heavens and the new earth. See Rev. xxi.1.</p>
                  <p>The end of God's creating the world was to prepare a kingdom for his Son, (for he is appointed heir of the world), and that he might have the possession of it, and a kingdom in it, which shall remain to all eternity. So that, so far forth as the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ is set up in the world so far is the world brought to its end, and the eternal state of things set up. So far are all the great changes and revolutions of the ages of the world brought to their everlasting issue, and all things come to their ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate period. So far are the waters of the long channel of divine
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:017525_0181_0FA12A3D13032830"/>
providence, which has so many branches, and so many windings and turnings, emptied out into their proper ocean, which they have been seeking from the beginning and head of their course, and so are come to their rest. So far as Christ's kingdom is established in the world, so far are things wound up and settled in their everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing state, and a period put to the course of things in this changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble world; so far are the first heavens and the first earth come to an end, and the new heavens and the new earth come to an end, and the new heavens and the new earth, the everlasting heavens and earth, established in their room. This leads me to observe,</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. That the sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e of things which is attained by the events of this period, is what is so often called <hi>the kingdom of heaven,</hi> or <hi>the kingdom of God</hi> We very often read in the New-Testament of the kingdom of heaven. John the Baptist preached, that the kingdom of heaven was at hand; and so did Christ, and his disciples after him; refering to something that the Jews in those days expected, and very much talked of, which they called by that name. They seem to have taken their expectation and the name chiefly from that prophecy of Daniel in Nebuchadnezzar's dream, Dan. ii.44. "And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom;" together with that in chap. vii.13.14.</p>
                  <p>Now this kingdom of heaven is that evangelical state of things in his church, and in the world, wherein consists the success of Christ's redemption in this period. There had been often great kingdoms set up before, which were earthly kingdoms; as the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonish, Persian, the Grecian, and the Roman monarchies. But Christ came to set up the last kingdom, which is not an earthly kingdom, but an heavenly, and so is the kingdom of heaven: John xviii.36. "My kingdom is not of this world." This is the kingdom of which Christ speaks, Luke xxii.29. "My Father hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to me a kingdom." This kingdom began soon after Christ's resurrection, and was accomplished in various steps from that time to the end of the world. Sometimes by <hi>the kingdom of heaven,</hi> is meant that spiritual state of the church which began soon after Christ's resurrection; sometimes that more perfect state of the church which shall obtain after the downfall of Antichrist; and sometimes that glorious and blessed state to which the church shall be received at the day of judgement: 1 Cor. xv.50. the apostle, speaking of the resurrection, says, "This I say, that flesh and blood cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the kingdom of God."</p>
                  <p>Under this head I would obse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve several things particularly, for the clearer understanding of what the scripture says concerning this period</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The setting up of the kingdom of Christ is chiefly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished by four successive great events, each of which is in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture called <hi>Christ's coming in his kingdom.</hi> The whole success of
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:017525_0182_0FA12A3DAEAA9FF0"/>
Christ's redemption is comprehended in one word, viz. his setting up his kingdom. This is chiefly done by four great successive dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations of providence; and every one of them is represented in scripture as Christ's coming in his kingdom. The first is Christ's appearing in those wonderful dispensations of providence in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles days, in setting up his kingdom, and destroying the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his kingdom, which ended in the destruction of Jerusalem. This is called Christ's coming in his kingdom, Matth. xvi.28. "Verily I say unto you, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death till they see the Son of man coming in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom." And so it is represented in Matth. xxiv. The second is that which was accomplished in Constantine's time, in the destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heathen Roman empire. This is represented as Christ's coming, and is compared to his coming to judgement, in the 6th chapter of Revelation at the latter end. The third is that which is to be accomplished at the destruction of Antichrist. This also is represented as Christ's coming in his kingdom in the 7th chapter of Daniel, and in other places, as I may possibly show hereafter, when I come to speak of it. The fourth and last is his coming to the last judgement, which is the event principally signified in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by <hi>Christ's coming into his Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. I would observe, that each of the three former of these is a lively image or type of the fourth and last, viz. Christ's coming to the final judgement, as the principal dispensations of providence before Christ's first coming, were types of that first coming. — As Christ's last coming to judgement is accompained with a resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, so is each of the three foregoing with a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual resurrection. That coming of Christ, which ended in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Jerusalem, was preceded by a glorious spiritual resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of souls in the calling of the Gentiles, and bringing home such multitudes of souls to Christ by the preaching of the gospel. So Christ's coming in Constantine's time, was accompanied with a glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ious spiritual resurrection of the greater part of the known world, in a restoration of it to a visible-chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch state, from a state of Heathenism. So Christ's coming at the destruction of Antichrist, will be attended with a spiritual resurrection of the church after it had been long as it were dead, in the times of Antichrist. This is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>first resurrection</hi> in the 20th chapter of Revelations.</p>
                  <p>Again, as Christ in the last judgement will gloriously manifest himself coming in the glory of his Father, so in each of the th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> foregoing events Christ gloriously manifested himself in sending judgements upon his enemies, and in showing grace and favour to his church; and as the last coming of Christ will be attended with a literal gathering together of the elect from the four winds of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, so were each of the preceding attended with a spiritual gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:017525_0183_0FA12A3E6F3B6A58"/>
in of the elect. As this gathering together of the elect will be effected by God's angels with a great sound of a trumpet, as in Matth. xxiv.31.; so were each of the preceding spiritual in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therings effected by the trumpet of the gospel, founded by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ. As there shall precede the last appearance of Christ, a time of great degeneracy and wickedness, so this has been, or will be, the case with each of the other appearances. Before each of them is a time of great opposition to the church: before the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st by the Jews, in their persecutions that we read of in the New Testament; before the second, viz in Constantine's time, by the Heathen, in several successive persecutions raised by the Roman emperors against the Christians; before the third, by Antichrist; before the last, by Gog and Magog, as described in the Revelation.</p>
                  <p>By each of these comings of Christ God works a glorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance for his church. Each of them is accompanied with a glorious advancement of the state of the church. The first, which ended in the destruction of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> gospel, a glorious state of the church very much prophesied of old, whereby the church was advanced into far more glorious circumstances than it was in before under the Jewish dispensation. The second, which was in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine's time, was accompanied with an advancement of the church into a state of liberty from persecution, and the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of civil authority, and triumph over their Heathen persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. The third, which shall be at the downfall of Antichrist, will be accompanied with an advancement of the church into that state of the glorious prevalence of truth, liberty, peace, and joy, that we so often read of in the prophetical parts of scripture. The last will be attended with the advancement of the church to consum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Each of those comings of Christ is accompanied with a terrible destruction of the wicked, and the enemies of the church: the first with the destruction of the persecuting Jews, which was amazingly terrible; the second, with dreadful judgements on the Heathen persecutors of the church, of which more hereafter; the third, with the awful destruction of Antichrist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the most cruel and bitter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that ever the church had; the fourth, with divine wrath and vengeance on all the ungodly.</p>
                  <p>Further, there is in each of these comings of Christ an ending of the old heavens and the old earth, and a beginning of new hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and a new earth; or an end of a temporal state of things, and a beginning of an eternal state.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I would observe, that each of those four great dispensations which are represented as Christ's coming in his kingdom, are but so many steps and degrees of the accomplishment of one event.

This is what the Jews expected, and called "the coming of the kingdom of heaven;" and what John the Baptist and Christ had respect to, when they said, "The kingdom of heaven is at hand." This great event is gradually accomplished, or is accomplished, by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral steps. Those four great events which have been mentioned, were several steps towards the accomplishment of this grand event.</p>
                  <p>When Christ came with the preaching of the apostles, to set up his kingdom in the world, which dispensation ended with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Jerusalem, then it was accomplished in a glorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And because these four great events are but images one of another and the three former but types of the last, and since they are all only several steps of the ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>omplishment of the same things; hence we find them all from time to time prophecied of under one, as they are in the prophecies of Daniel, and as they are in the 24th chapter of Matthew, where some things seem more applicable to one of them, and others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <p n="4">4 I would observe, that as there are several steps of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of the kingdom of Christ, so in each one of them the event is accomplished in a further degree than in the foregoing. That in the time of Constantine was a greater and further accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of the kingdom of Christ, than that which ended in the destruction of Jerusalem; that which shall be at the fall of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, will be a further accomplishment of the same thing, than that which took place in the time of Constantine; and so on with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to each: so that the kingdom of Christ is gradually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing and growing by these several great steps of its fulfilment, from the time of Christ's resurrection, to the end of the world.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And lastly, It may be observed, that the great providences of God between these four great events, are to make way for the kingdom and glory of Christ in the great event following. Those dispensations of providence which were towards the church of God

                  <p>Thus I thought it needful to observe these things in general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this last period of the series of God's providence, before I take notice of the particular providences by which the work of redemption is carried on through this period, in their order: and before I do that, I will also briefly answer to an INQUIRY, viz. Why the setting up of Christ's kingdom after his humiliation, should be so gradual, by so many steps that are so long in accomplishing, since God could easily have finished it at once?</p>
                  <p>Though it would be presumption in us to pretend to declare all the ends of God in this, yet doubtless much of the wisdom of God may be seen in it by us; and particularly in these two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In this way the glory of God's wisdom, in the manner of doing this, is more visible to the observation of creatures. If it had been done at once, in an instant, or in a very short time, there would not have been such opportunities for creatures to perceive and observe the particular steps of divine wisdom, as when the work is gradually accomplished, and one effect of his wisdom is held forth to observation after another. It is wisely determined of God, to accomplish his great design by a wonderful and long series of events, that the glory of his wisdom may be displayed in the whole series, and that the glory of his perfections may be seen, appearing, as it were, by parts, and in particular successive mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festations: For if all that glory which appears in all these events had been manifested at once, it would have been too much for us, and more than we at once could take notice of; it would have dazzled our eyes and overpowered our sight.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Satan is more gloriously triumphed over —God could easily, by an act of almighty power, at once have crushed Satan. But by giving him time to use his utmost subtilty to hinder the success of what Christ had done and suffered, he is not defeated merely by surprise, but has large opportunity to ply his utmost power and subtilty again and again, to strengthen his own interest all that he can by the work of many ages Thus God destroys and confounds him, and sets up Christ's kingdom time after time, in spite of all his subtle machinations and great works, and by every step advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

it still higher and higher, till at length it is fully set up, and Satan perfectly and eternally vanquished in the end of all things.</p>
                  <p>I now proceed to take notice of the particular events, whereby, from the end of Christ's humiliation to the end of the world, the success of Christ's purchase has been or shall be accomplished.</p>

                  <p>I WOULD take notice, first, of those things by which Christ was put into a capacity for accomplishing the end of his purchase. They are two things, viz. his resurrection, and his ascension. As we observed before, the incarnation of Christ was necessary in order to Christ's being in a near capacity for the purchase of redemption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and ascension of Christ were requisite in order to his acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>plishing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of his purchase.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. His resurrection. It was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>cessary in order to Christ's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the end and effect of his purchase of redemption, that he should rise from the dead. For God the Father had committed the whole affair of redemption, not only the purchasing of it, but the bestowing of the blessings purchased, to his Son, that he should not only purchase it as priest, but actually bring it about as king; and that he should do this as God man. For God the Father would have nothing to do with fallen man in a way of mercy but by a mediator. But in order that Christ might carry on the work of redemption, and accomplish the success of his own purpose as God man, it was necessary that he should be alive, and so that he should rise from the dead. Therefore Chris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, after he had finished this purchase by death, and by continuing for a time under the power of death, rises from the dead, to fulfil the end of his purchase, and himself to bring about that for which he died: For this matter God the Father had committed unto him, that he might, as Lord of all, manage all to his own purposes: Rom. xiv.9.
<q>For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed Christ's resurrection, and so his ascension, was part of the success of what Christ did and suffered in his humiliation. For though Christ did not properly purchase redemption for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, yet he purchased eternal life and glory for himself by what he did and suffered; and this eternal life and glory was given him as a reward of what he did and suffered, Phil. ii.8.9. "He humbled himself, and become obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted him." It may be looked upon as part of the success of Christ's
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:017525_0187_0FA12A4235B66D60"/>
purchase, if it be so considered, that Christ did not rise as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate person, but as the head of the elect church; so that they did, as it were, all rise with him. Christ was justified in his resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, i. e. God acquited and discharged him hereby, as having done and suffered enough for the sins of all the elect: Rom. iv.25. "Who was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification." And God put him in possession of eternal life, as the head of the church, as a sure earnest that they should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ollow. For when Christ rose from the dead, that was the beginning of eternal life in him. His life before his death was a mortal life, a temporal life; but his life after his resurrection was an eternal life: Rom. vi.9. "Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him." Rev. i.18. "I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen,"—But he was put in possession of this eternal life, as the head of the body; and took possession of it, not only to enjoy himself, but to bestow on all who belive in him; so that the whole church, as it were, rises in him. And now he who lately suffered so much, after this is to suffer no more for ever, but to enter into eternal glory. God the Father neither expects nor desires any more suffering.</p>
                  <p>This resurrection of Christ is the most joyful event that ever came no pass; because hereby Christ rested from the great and difficult work of purchasing redemption, and received God's testimony, that it was finished. The death of Christ was the greatest and most wonderful event that ever came to pass; but that has a great deal in it that is sorrowful. But by the resurrection of Christ, that sorrow is turned into joy. The head of the whole church, in that great event, enters on the possession of eternal life; and the whole church is, as it were, "begotten again to a lively hope," 1 Pet. i.3. Weeping had continued for a night, but now joy-cometh in the morning, the most joyful morning that ever was. This is the day of the reigning of the head of the church, and all the church reigns with him. This is spoken of as a day which was worthy to be commemorated with the greatest joy of all days: Psal. cxviii.24. "This is the day which the Lord hath made, we will rejoice and be glad in it." And therefore this above all other days is appointed for the day of the church's spiritual rejoicing to the end of the world, to be weekly sanctified, as their day of holy rest and joy, that the church therein may rest and rejoice with her head. And as the 3d chapter of Genesis is the most sorrowful chapter in the Bible; so those chapters in the evangelists that give an account of the resurrection of Christ, may be looked upon as the most joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful chapters in all the Bible: for those chapters give an account of the finishing of the purchase of redemption, and the beginning of the glory of the head of the church, as the greatest seal and earnest
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:017525_0188_0FA12A42F18A5B98"/>
of the eternal glory of all the rest.</p>
                  <p>It is further to be observed, that the day of the gospel most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly begins with the resurrection of Christ.—Till Christ rose from the dead, the Old-Testament dispensation remained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but now it ceases, all being fulfilled that was shadowed forth in the typical ordinances of that dispensation; so that here most properly is the end of the Old-Testament night, and Christ rising from the grave with joy and glory, was as the joyful bride groom of the church, as a glorious conqueror to subdue their enemies under their feet; or was like the sun rising as it were from under the earth, after a long night of darkness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and coming forth as a bride groom, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared as a strong man to run his race, appearing in joyful light to enlighten the world. Now that joyful and excellent dispensation begins, that glorious dispensation, of which the prophets prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied so much; now the gospel sun is risen in glory, "and with healing in his wings," that those who fear God's name, may go forth, and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">II. Christ's ascension into heaven. In this I would include his sitting at the right hand of God. For Christ's ascension, and sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the right hand of God, can scarcely be looked upon as two distinct things: for Christ's ascension was nothing else, but ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God's right hand; it was coming to sit down at his Father's right hand in glory. This was another thing whereby Christ was put into a capacity for the accomplishing the effect of his purchas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

We are told, that Christ was exalted for this end, that he might accomplish the success of his redemption: Acts v.31. "Him hath God exalted with his right hand, for to give repentance unto Israel, and the remission of sins."</p>
                  <p>Christ's ascension into heaven was, as it were, his solemn enthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization, whereby the Father did set him upon the throne, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest him with the glory of his kingdom which he had purchased for himself, that he might thereby obtain the success of his redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in conquering all his enemies: Psal. cx.1. "Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool." Christ en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into heaven, in order to obtain the success of his purchase, as the high priest of old, after he had offered sacrifice, entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the holy of holies with the blood of the sacrifice, in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the success of the sacrifice which he had offered.

Here is something peculiar in this commission of the apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, viz to go forth from one nation to another, preaching the gospel in all the world. The apostles had something above what belonged to their ordinary character as ministers; they had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary power of teaching and ruling, which extended to all the churches; and not only all the churches which then were, but all that should be to the end of the world by their ministry. And so the apostles were, as it were, in subordination to Christ, made foundations of the Christian church. See Eph. ii.20. and Rev. xx.14.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Here is an appointment of Christian baptism. This or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance indeed had a beginning before; John the Baptist and Christ both baptized. But now especially by this institution is it esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished as an ordinance to be upheld in the Christian church to the end of the world.—The ordinance of the Lord's supper had been established be o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e, just before Christ's crucifixion.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The next thing to be observed, is the enduing the apostles and others, with extraordinary and miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost; such as the gift of tongues, the gift of healing, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, &amp;c The Spirit of God was poured out in great abundance in this respect, so that not only ministers, but a very great part of the Christians through the world were endued with them, both old and young; not only officers and more honourable persons, but the meaner sort of people, servants and handmaids, were commonly endued with them, agreeable to Joel's prophecy, Joel ii.28 29. of which prophecy the Apostle Peter takes notice, that it is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished in this dispensation, Acts ii.11.</p>
                     <p>How wonderful a dispensation was this! Under the Old Testament, but few had such honors put up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n them by God. Moses wished that all the Lord's people were prophets, N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d and Medad prophesied. But now we find the wish of Moses fulfilled. This continued in a very consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able degree to the end of the apostolic age, or the first hundred years after the birth of Christ, which is therefore called <hi>the age of miracles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This was a great means of the success of the gospel in that age, and of establishing the Christian church in all parts of the world; and not only in that age, but in all ages to the end of the world: fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Christianity being by this means established through so great a part of the known world by miracles, it was after that more easily continued by tradition; and then, by means of these extraordinary gifts of the Holy G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Furthermore, these miracles stand recorded in those writings as a standing proof and evidence of the truth of the Christian religion to all ages.</p>

                        </gap>uld observe is the revealing those glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious doctrines of the gospel fully and plainly, which had under the Old Testament been obscurely revealed.

The next thing that I would observe, is the appointment of the office of deacons in the Christian church, which we have an account of in the 6th chapter of the Acts, to take care for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward supply of the members of Christ's church, and the exercise of that great Christian virtue of charity.</p>

This was begun in his conversion as he was going to Damascus, and was one of the greatest means of the success of Christ's redemption that followed: for this success was more by the labours, preaching, and writings of this Apostle, than all the other apos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For, as he says, 1 Cor. xv.10. he "laboured more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly than they all;" so his success was more abundant than that of them all.

"Aristarchus, my fellow-prisoner, saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas; touching whom ye received com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment: if he come unto you, receive him." The apostles seem to have made great account of him, as appears by those places, and also by Acts xii.25. "And Barnabas and Saul returned from

                     <p>This Luke, who wrote the gospel of Luke and the book of Acts, was a great companion of the Apostle Paul. He is spoken of as being with him in the last-mentioned place, and speaks of himself a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The rest of the books were all written by the apostles themselves. The books of the New Testament are either historical, or doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinal, or prophetical The historical books are the writings of the four evangelists, giving us the history of Christ, and his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of redemption, and his resurrection and ascension; and the Acts of the apostles, giving an account of the great things by which the Christian church was first established and propagated. The doctrinal books are the epistles. These, most of them, we have from the great Apostle Paul. And we have one prophetical book, which takes place after the end of the history of the whole Bible, and gives an account of the great events which were to come to pass, by which the work of redemption was to be carried on to the end of the world.</p>
                     <p>All these books are supposed to have been written before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Jerusalem, excepting those which were written by the Apostle John, who lived the longest of all the apostles, and wrote what he wrote after the destruction of Jerusalem, as is supposed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To this beloved disciple it was that Christ revealed those wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things which were to come to pass in his church to the end of time; and he was the person that put the finishing hand to the canon of the scriptures, and sealed the whole of it.

And so all things are established and and completed which relate to the appointed means of grace. All the stated means of grace wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

or before the death of the Apostle John, and are to remain unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to the day of judgement.</p>
                     <p>Thus far we have considered those things by which the means of grace were given and established in the Christian church.</p>
                     <p n="2">§ II. THE other thing proposed relating to the success of Christ's redemption during the church's continuance under the means of grace, was to show how this success was carried on; which is what I would now proceed to do.</p>
                     <p>Here it is worthy to be remembered, that the Christian church during its continuance under the means of grace, is in two very different states.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In a suffering, afflicted, persecuted state, as, for the most part it is, from the resurrection of Christ till the fall of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In a state of peace and prosperity; which is the state that the church, for the most part, is to be in after the fall of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</p>
                     <p>FIRST, I would show how the success of Christ's redemption is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on during the continuance of the church's suffering state, from the resurrection of Christ to the fall of Antichrist. This space of time, for the most part, is a state of the church's sufferings, &amp; is so represented in scripture. Indeed God is pleased, out of love and pity to his elect, to grant many intermissions of the church's sufferings during this time, whereby the days of tribulation are as it were shortened. But from Christ's resurrection till the fall of Antichrist, is the appointed day of Zion's troubles. During this space of time, for the most part, some part or other of the church is under persecution; and great part of the time, the whole church, or at last the generality of God's people, have been persecuted.</p>
                     <p>For the first three hundred years after Christ, the church was for the most part in a state of great affliction, the object of reproach and persecution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> first by the Jews, and then by the Heathen. After this, from the beginning of Constantine's time, the church had r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>st and prosperity for a little while; which is represented in Rev. v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>i. at the beginning, by the angel's holding the four winds for a little while. But presently after, the church again suffered persecution from the Arians; and after that, Antichrist rose, and the church was driven away into the wilderness, and was kept down in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity, and contempt, and suffering, for a long time, under Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, before the reformation by Luther and others. And since the reformation, the church's persecutions have been beyond all that ever were before. Though some parts of God's church some times have had rest, yet to this day, for the most part, the true church is very much kept under by its enemies, and some parts of it under
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:017525_0196_0FA12A49AF5F26C8"/>
grevious persecution; and so we may expect it will continue till the fall of Antichrist; and then will come the appointed day of the church's prosperity on earth, the set time in which God will favour Zion, the time when the saints shall not be kept under by wicked men, as it has been hitherto; but wherein they shall be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost, and shall reign on earth, as it is said, Rev. v.10. "And the kingdom shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High," Dan. vii.27.</p>
                     <p>This suffering state of the church is in scripture represented as a state of the church's travail, John xvi.20.21. and Rev. xii.1.2. What the church is in travail striving to bring forth during this time, is that glory and prosperity of the church which shall be after the fall of Antichrist, and then shall she bring forth her child. This is a long time of the church's trouble and affliction, and is so spoken of in scripture, tho' it be spoken of as being but for a little season, in comparison of the eternal prosperity of the church. Hence the church, under the long continuance of this affliction, cries out, at in Rev. vi.10. "How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?" And we are told, that "white robes were given to every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also, and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfiled." So, Dan. xii.6. "How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?"</p>
                     <p>It is to be observed, that during the time of these sufferings of the church, the main instrument of their sufferings has been the Roman government: her afflictions have almost all along been from Rome. That is therefore in the New Testament called <hi>Babylon</hi>; because, as of old the troubles of the city Jerusalem were mainly from that adverse city Babylon, so the troubles of the Christian church, the spiritual Jerusalem, during the long time of its tribulation, is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Rome. Before the time of Constantine, the troubles of the Christian church were from Heathen Rome: since that time, its troubles have been mainly from Antichristian Rome. As of old, the captivity of the Jews ceased on the destruction of Babylon, so the time of the trouble of the Christian church will cease with the destruction of the church of Rome, that spiritual Babylon.</p>
                     <p>In showing how the success of Christ's redemption is carried on during this time of the church's tribulation, I would,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Show how it was carried on till the destruction of Jerusalem, with which ended the first great dispensation of Providence which is called <hi>Christ's coming in his kingdom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. How it was carried on from thence to the destruction of the Heathen empire in the time of Constantine, which is the second dispensation called <hi>Christ's coming,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="192" facs="unknown:017525_0197_0FA12A4A6E084D40"/>3. How it is carried on from thence to the destruction of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, when will be accompished the third great event called <hi>Christ's coming,</hi> and with which the days of the church's tribulation and travail end.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. I would show how the success of Christ's purchase of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was carried on from Christ's resurrection to the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jerusalem. In speaking of this, I would, 1. take notice of the success itself; and, 2. the opposition made against it by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of it; and, 3. the terrible judgements of God on those enemies.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I would observe the success itself. Soon after Christ had finished the purchase of redemption, and was gone into heaven, &amp; entered into the holy of holies with his own blood, there began a glorious success of what he had done and suffered. Having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the foundation of Satan's kingdom, it began to fall apace. Swiftly did it hasten to ruin in the world, which might well be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Satan's falling like lightning from heaven. Satan before had exalted his throne very high in this world, even to the very stars of heaven, reigning with great glory in his Heathen Roman empire; but never before had he such a downfal as he had soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ's ascension. He had, we may suppose, been very lately triumphing in a supposed victory, having brought about the death of Christ, which he doubtless gloried in as the greatest feat that ever he did; and probably imagined he had totally defeated God's design by him. But he was quickly made sensible, that he had only been ruining his own kingdom, when he saw it tumbling so fast so soon after, as a consequence of the death of Christ. For Christ, by his death, having purchased the Holy Spirit, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ascended, and received the Spirit, he poured it forth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly for the conversion of thousands and millions of souls.</p>
                     <p>Never had Christ's kingdom been so set up in the world. There probably were more souls converted in the age of the apostles than had been before from the beginning of the world till that time. Thus God so soon begins gloriously to accomplish his promise to his Son, wherein he had promised, that he should see his seed, and that the pleasure of the Lord should prosper in his hand, if he would make his soul an offering or sin. And,</p>
                     <p n="1">(1) Here is to observed the success, which the gospel had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews: for God first began with them. He being about to reject the main body of that people, first calls in his elect from among them, before he forsook them, to turn to the Gentiles. It was so in former great and dreadful judgements of God on that nation: the bulk of them were destroyed, and only a remnant sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or reformed. So it was in the rejection of the ten tribes, long before this rejection: the bulk of the ten tribes were rejected, when they left the true worship of God in Jeroboam's time, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:017525_0198_0FA12A4B322BB830"/>
more fully in Ahab's time. But yet there was a remnant of them that God reserved. A number left their possessions in these tribes, and went and settled in the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. And afterwards there were seven thousand in Ahab's time, who had not bowed the knee to Baal. And so, in the captivity into Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, only a remnant of them ever returned to their own land. And so now again, by far the greater part of the people were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected entirely, but some few were saved. Therefore the Holy Ghost compares this reservation of a number that were converted by the preaching of the apostles, to those former remnants: Rom. ix.27. Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, "Though the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the children be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved." See Is. x.22.</p>
                     <p>The glorious success of the gosple among the Jews after Christ's ascension, began by the pouring out of the Spirit upon the day of Pentecost, of which we read in Acts ii. So wonderful was the pouring out of the Spirit, and so remarkable and swift the effect of it, that we read of three thousand who were converted to the Christian faith in one day, Acts ii.41. Probably the greater part of these were savingly converted. And after this, we read of God's adding to the church daily such as should be saved, vers. 47. And soon after, we read, that the number of them were about five thousand. Thus were not only a multitude converted, but the church was then eminent in piety, as appears by Acts ii.46.47.iv.32.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Christian church was first of all of the nation of Israel: and therefore, when the Gentiles were called, they were but as it were added to Israel, to the seed of Abraham. They were added to the Christian church of Israel, as the proselytes of old were to the Mosaic church of Israel; and so were as it were only grafted on the stock of Abraham, and were not a distinct tree; for they are all still the seed of Abraham and Israel: as Ruth, the Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitess, and Uriah the Hittite, and other proselytes of old, were the same people, and ranked as the seed of Israel.</p>
                     <p>So the Christian church at first began at Jerusalem, and from thence was propagated to all nations: so that this church of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem was the church that was as it were the mother of all other churches in the world; agreeable to the prophecy. Is. ii.3.4. "Out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem: and he shall judge among the nations, and rebuke many people." So that the whole church of God is still God's Jerusalem: they are his spiritual Jerusalem, and are as it were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly added to the church, which was begun in the literal Jerusalem</p>
                     <p>After this, we read of many thousands of Jews that believed in Jerusalem, Acts xxi.20. And so we read of multitudes of Jews who were converted in other cities of Judea; and not only so, but
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:017525_0199_0FA12A4CF9D45DF8"/>
even in other parts of the world. For where-ever the apostles went, if there were any Jews there, their manner was, first to go into the synagogues of the Jews, and preach the gospel to them, and many in one place and another believed; as in Damascus &amp; Antioch, and many other places that we read of in the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
                     <p>In this pouring out of the spirit, which began at the Pentecost following Christ's ascension, began that first great dispensation which is called <hi>Christ's coming in his kingdom.</hi> Christ's coming thus in a spiritual manner for the glorious setting up of his kingdom in the world, is represented by Christ himself as his coming down from heaven, whither he had ascended, John xiv.18. There Christ having been speaking of his ascension, says "I will not leave you comfortless; I will come unto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" speaking of his coming by the coming of the Comforter, the Spirit of truth. And, verse 28. "Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you." Thus the apostles began to see the kingdom of heaven come with power, as he promised they should, Mark ix.1.</p>

But now salvation is brought from the Jews to them by the preaching of Philip, (excepting that before Christ had some success among them) with whose preaching there was a glorious pouring out of the Spirit of God in the city of Samaria, where we are told, that "the people believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of Christ, and were baptized, both men and women; and that there was great joy in that city," Acts viii.8.—12.</p>

                     <p n="3">(3) The next thing to be observed is the success there was of the gospel in calling the Gentiles. This was a great and glorious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of divine providence, much spoken of in the prophecies of the Old Testament, and spoken of by the apostles time after time, as a most glorious event of Christ's redemption. This was begun in the conversion of Cornelius and his family, greatly to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of Peter, who was used as the instrument of it, and of those who were with him, and of those who were informed of it; as you may see, Acts x. and xi. The next instance of it that we have any account of, was in the conversion of great numbers of Gentiles in Cyprus, and Cyrene, and Antioch, by the disciples that were scattered abroad by the persecution which arose about Stephen, as we have an account in Acts xi.19.20.21. Presently upon this the disciples began to be called Christians first at Antioch, verse 26.</p>
                     <p>After this, vast multitudes of Gentiles were converted in many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> parts of the world, chiefly by the ministry of the Apostle Paul, a glorious pouring out of the Spirit accompanying his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one place and another. Multitudes flocked into the church of Christ in a great number of cities where the Apostle came. So the number of the members of the Christian church that were Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, soon far exceeded the number of its Jewish members; yet so, that in less than ten years time after Paul was sent forth from Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och to preach to the Gentiles, it was said of him and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that they had turned the world upside down: Acts xvii.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. "These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also." But the most remarkable pouring out of the Spirit in a particular city that we have any account of in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, seems to be that in the city of Ephesus, which was a very great city. Of this we have an account in Acts xix. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

the greatest cities in all Greece. And after this many were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in Rome, the chief city of all the world; and the gospel was propogated into all parts of the Roman empire. Thus the gospel-son, which had lately risen on the Jews, now rose upon, and began to enlighten the Heathen world, after they had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in gross Heathenish darkness for so many ages.</p>
                     <p>This was a great thing, and a new thing, such as never had been before. All nations but the Jews, and a few who had at one time and another joined with them, had been rejected from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Moses's time. The Gentile world had been covered over with the thick darkness of idolatry; but now, at the joyful glorious sound of the gospel, they began in all parts to forsake their old idols, and to abhor them, and to cast them to the moles and to the bats, and to learn to worship the true God, and to trust in his Son Jesus Christ; and God owned them for his people; those who had so long been afar off, were made nigh by the blood of Christ. Men were changed from being Heathenish &amp; brutish, to be the children of God; were called out of Satan's kingdom of darkness, and bro't into God's marvelous light and in almost all countries thro' out the known world were assemblies of the people of God; joyful praises were sung to the true God, and Jesus Christ the glorious Redeemer. Now that great building which God began soon after the fall of man, rises glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, not in the same manner that it had done in former ages, but in quite a new manner; now Daniel's prophecies concerning the last kingdom, which should succeed the four Heathenish mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, begins to be fulfilled; now the stone cut out of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains without hands, began to smite the image on its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eet, and to break it in pieces, and to grow great, and to make great advances towards filling the earth; and now God gathers together the elect from the four winds of heaven, by the preaching of the apostles and other ministers, the angels of the Christian church sent forth with the great sound of the gospel-trumpet, before the destruction of Jerusalem, agreeable to what Christ foretold, Matth. xxiv.31.</p>
                     <p>This was the success of Christ's purchase during this first peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of the Christian church, which terminated in the destruction of Jerusalem.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I would proceed now, in the second place, to take notice of the opposition which was made to this success of Christ's purchase by the enemies of it.—Satan, who lately was so ready to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and exult, as though he had gained the victory in putting Christ to death, now finding himself fallen into the pit which he had digged, and finding his kingdom falling so fast, and seeing Christ's kingdom make such amazing progress, such as never had been before, we may conclude he was filled with the greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and astonishment, and hell seemed to be effectually-alarmed
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:017525_0202_0FA12A4EEFCF0768"/>
by it to make the most violent opposition against it. First, the devil stirred up the Jews, who had before crucified Christ, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the church: for it is observeable, that the persecution which the church suffered during this period, was mostly from the Jews. Thus we read in the Acts, when, at Jerusalem, the Holy Ghost was poured out at Pentecost, how the Jews mocked, and said, "These men are full of new wine;" and how the scribes and Pharisees, and the captain of the temple, were alarmed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirred themselves to oppose and persecute the apostles, and first apprehended and threatened them, and afterwards imprisoned and beat them; and breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, they stoned Stephen in a tumultuous rage; and were not content to persecute those that they could find in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, but sent abroad to Damascus and other places, to persecute all that they could find every where. Herod, who was chief among them, stretched forth his hands to vex the church, and killed James with the sword, and proceeded to take Peter also, and cast him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prison.</p>
                     <p>So in other countries, we find, that almost where-ever the apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles came, the Jews opposed the gospel in a most malignant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, contradicting and blaspheming. How many things did the blessed Apostle Paul suffer at their hands in one place and another! How violent and blood-thirsty did they shew themselves towards him, when he came to bring alms to his nation! In this persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and cruelty was fulfilled that of Christ, Matth. xxiii.34. "Behold, I send you prophets, and wise men, and scribes; and some of them ye shall kill and crucify, and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city."</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I proceed to take notice of those judgements which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted on those enemies of Christ, the persecuting Jews.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1) The bulk of the people were given up to judicial blindness of mind and hardness of heart. Christ denounced such a wo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in the days of his flesh; as Matth. 13.14.15.—This curse was also denounced on them by the Apostle Paul, Acts xxviii.25.26.27.; and under this curse, under this judicial blindness and hardness, they remain to this very day, having been subject to it for about 1700 years, being the most awful instance of such a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and monuments of God's terrible vengeance, of any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that ever were. That they should continue from generation to generation so obstinately to reject Christ, so that it is a very rare thing that any one of them is converted to the Christian faith, though their own scriptures of the Old Testament, which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, are so full of plain testimonies against them, is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable evidence of their being dreadfully left of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) They were rejected and cast off from being any longer God's

visible people. They were broken off from the flock of Abraham, and since that have no more been reputed his seed, than the Ishma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites or Edomites, who are as much his natural seed as they. The greater part of the two tribes were now cast off, as the ten tribes had been before, and another people were taken in their room, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the predictions of their own prophets; as of Moses, Deut. xxxii.21. "They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people, I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation;" and of Isaiah, lxv.1. "I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"—They were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly rejected and cast off, by God's directing his apostles to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Thus far we have had the scripture-history to guide us: hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward we shall have the guidance only of two things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viz. of scripture-prophecy, and God's providence, as related in human histories.—But I proceed.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3) The third and last judgement of God on th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then Christ warned them very particularly, and told them of their aproaching destruction, and at the thoughts of it wept over them. And then the apostles after Christ's ascension abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly warned them. But they proved obstinate, and went on in their opposition to Christ and his church, and in their bitter perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting practices.

                     <p>After this God was pleased to give them one more very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble warning by the Apostle Paul, in his epistle to the Hebrews, which is an epistle written to that nation of the Jews, as is suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

prove that Christ Jesus must be the Son of God, and that all their law pointed to him and typified him, and that their Jewish dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must needs have now ceased. For though the epistle was more immediately directed to the Christian Hebrews, yet the matter of the epistle plainly shows that the apostle intended it for the use and conviction of the unbelieving Jews. In this epistle he mentions particularly the approaching destruction, as chap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But the generality of them refusing to receive conviction. God soon destroyed them with such terrible circumstances, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of no country or city since the foundation of the world can parallel; agreeable to what Christ foretold, Matth xxiv.21. "For then shall be tribulation, such as was not from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be." The first destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians was very terrible, as it is in the most affecting manner described by the Prophet Jeremiah, in his Lamentations; but this was nothing to the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful misery and wrath which they suffered in the destruction; God, according as Christ foretold, bringing on them all the righteous blood that had been shed from the foundation of the world. Thus the enemies of Christ were made his footstool ofte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They had been kicking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christ, but they did not kick against the pricks. The briars and thorns set themselves against him in battle: but he went through them: he burned them together.</p>
                     <p>This destruction of Jerusalem was in all respects agreeable to what Christ had foretold of it, Matth. xxiv. by the account which Josephus gives of it, who was then present, and was one of the Jews, who had a share in the calamity, who wrote the history of their destruction. Many circumstana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their city and their temple were burnt, and rased to the ground, and the ground on which the city stood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was plowed; and so one stone was not left upon another, Matth. xxiv.2.</p>
                     <p>The people had ceased for the most part to be an independent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment after the Babylonish captivity: but the sceptre entirely departed from Judah on the death of Archelaus; and then Judea was made a Roman province; after this they were cast off from being the people of God; but now their very city and land are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly destroyed, and they carried away from it; and so have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

                     <p>Thus there was a final end to the Old-Testament world; all was finished with a kind of day of judgement, in which the people of God were saved, and his enemies terribly destroyed.— Thus does he who was so lately mocked, despised, and spit upon by the Jews, and whose followers they malignantly persecuted, appear gloriously exalted over his enemies.</p>
                     <p>Having thus shown how the success of Christ's purchase was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on till the destruction of Jerusalem, I come now.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. To show how it was carried on from that time till the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Heathen empire in the time of Constantine the Great, which is the second great event which is in scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Christ's coming to judgment.</p>
                     <p>Jerusalem was destroyed about the year of our Lord 68<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so before that generation passed away which was contemporary with Christ; and it was about thirty five years after Christ's death. The destruction of the Heathen empire under Constantine, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 260 years after this. In showing how the success of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was carried on through this time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would. 1. Take notice of the opposition made against it by the Roman empire. 2. How the work of the gospel went on notwithstanding all that opposition. 3. The peculiar circumstances of tribulation and distress that the church was in just before their deliverance by Constantine. 4. The great revolution in Constantine's time.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I would briefly show what opposition was made against the gospel, and the kingdom of Christ, by the Roman empire. The opposition that was made to the gospel by the Heathen Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, was mainly after the destruction of Jerusalem, though their opposition began before; but the opposition that was before the destruction of Jerusalem, was mainly by the Jews. But when Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem was destroyed, the Jews were put out of a capacity of much troubling the church. Now therefore the devil turns his hand else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were, and uses other instruments. The opposition which was made in the Roman empire against the kingdom of Christ, was chiefly of two kinds.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1) They employed all their learning, philosophy, and wit, in opposing it. Christ came into the world in an age wherein learning and philosophy were at their height in the Roman empire. This was employed to the utmost against the kingdom of Christ. The gospel, which held forth a crucified Saviour, was not at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the notions of the philosophers. The Christian scheme of trusting in such a crucified Redeemer, appeared foolish and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to them. Greece was a country the most famous for learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any in the Roman empire; but the apostle observes, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <pb n="201" facs="unknown:017525_0206_0FA12A52AF351540"/>
the doctrine of Christ crucified appeared foolishness to the Greeks, 1 Cor. i.23.; and therefore the wise men and philosophers oppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the gospel with all the wit they had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We have a specimen of their manner of opposing, in the story we have of their treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Apostle Paul at Athens, which was a city that had been for many ages the chief seat of philosophers of any in the whole world. We read in Acts xvii.18. that the philosophers of the Epicureans and Stoicks encountered him, saying, "What will this babler say? He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods." So they were wont to deride and ridicule Christianity. After the destruction of Jerusalem, several of these philosophers published books against it; the chief of whom were Celsus and Porphyry. These wrote books against the Christian religion with a great deal of virulence and contempt, much after the manner that the Deists of the present age oppose and ridicule Christianity. Something of their writings yet remains. As great enemies and despisers as they were of the Christian religion, yet they never denied the facts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of Christ and his apostles, in the New Testament, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the miracles which they wrought, but allowed them. They liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too near the times wherein these miracles were wrought to deny them; for they were so publicly done, and so lately, that neither Jews nor Heathens in those days appeared to deny them; but they ascribed them to the power of magic.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) The authority of the Roman empire employed all their strength, time after time, to persecute, and if possible to root out Christianity. This they did in ten general successive persecutions. We have heretofore observed, that Christ came into the world, when the strength of Heathen dominion and authority was the greatest that ever it was under the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>man monarchy, the greatest and strongest human monarchy that ever was on earth. All the strength of this monarchy was employed for a long time to oppose and persecute the Christian church, and if possible to destroy it, in ten successive attempts, which are called <hi>the ten Heathen persecutions,</hi> which were before Constantine.</p>
                     <p>The first of these, which was the persecution under Nero, was a little before the destruction of Jerusalem, in which the Apostle Peter was crucified, and the Apostle Paul beheaded, soon after he wrote his second epistle to Timothy. When he wrote that epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, he was a prisoner at Rome under Nero, and was soon after he wrote it beheaded, agreeable to what he says, chap. iv.6.7. "I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith."—There were many thousands of other Christians slain in that persecution. The other nine persecutions were all after the destruction of Jerusalem. Some of these were
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:017525_0207_0FA12A536D776398"/>
very terrible indeed, and far exceeded the first persecution under Nero. One emperor after another set himself with the utmost rage to root out the Christian church from the earth, that there should not be so much as the name of Christian left in the world. Thousands and millions were put to cruel deaths in these persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for they spared neither sex nor age, but killed them as fast as they could. Under the second general persecution, that which was next after the destruction of Jerusalem, the Apostle John was banished to the isle of Patmos, where he had those visions of which he has given an account in the Revelation. Under that persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it was reckoned, that about 40,000 suffered martydom; which yet was nothing to what were put to death under some succeeding persecutions. Ten thousand suffered that one kind of cruel death, crucifixion, in the third persecution under the Emperor Adrian. Under the fourth persecution, which began about the year of Christ 162, many suffered martyrdom in England, the land of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, where Christianity had been planted very early, and, as is supposed, in the days of the apostles. In the later persecutions, the Roman emperors being vexed at the frustration of their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, who were not able to extirpate Christianity, or hinder its progress, were enraged to be the more violent in their attempts.</p>
                     <p>Thus a great part of the first 300 years after Christ was spent in violent and cruel persecutions of the church by the Roman powers. Satan was very unwilling to let go his hold of so great a part of the world, and every way the chief part of it, as the countries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Satan thus exerting himself by the power of the Heathen Roman empire, is called <hi>the great red dragon</hi> in scripture, having seven heads and ten horns, fighting against the woman clothed with the sun, as in the 12th of Revelation. And the terrible conflict there was between the church of Christ, and the powers of the Heathen empire before Constantine's time, is there, in vers. 7. repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the war between Michael and his angels, and the dragon and his angels: "And there was war in heaven; Michael and his angels fought, and the dragon fought and his angels."</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I would take notice what success the gospel had in the world before the time of Constantine, notwithstanding all this opposition. —Though the learning and power of the Roman empire wer-so great, and both were employed to the utmost against Christiani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty to put a stop to it, and to root it out for so long a time, and in so many repeated attempts; yet all was in vain; they could neither root it out, nor put a stop to it. But still, in spite all that they
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:017525_0208_0FA12A542CBA0708"/>
could do, the kingdom of Christ wonderfully prevailed, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Heathen kingdom mouldered and consumed away before it, agreeable to the words of the text, "The moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool." It was very observable, that for the most part the more they persecuted the church, the more it increased; insomuch that it became a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon saying. The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church. Herein the church of Christ proved to be like a palm-tree; of which tree it is remarked, that the greater weight is laid upon it, or hung to its branches, the more it grows and flourishes; on which account probably the church is compared to a palm-tree in Cant. vii.7. "This thy stature is like to a palm-tree." Justin Martyr, an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent father in the Christian church, who lived in the age next after the apostles, in some writings of his, which are yet extant, says, that in his days there was no part of mankind, whether Greeks or barbarians, or by what name soever they were called, even the most rude and unpolished nations, where prayers and thanksgivings were not made to the great creator of the world, through the name of the crucified Jesus. Tertullian, another eminent father in the Christian church, who lived in the beginning of the following age, in some of his writings which are yet extant, sets forth how that in his day the Christian religion had extended itself to the utmost bounds of the then known world, in which he reckons Britain, the country of our forefathers; and thence demonstrates, that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ was then more extensive than any of the four great monarchies; and moreover says, that though the Christians were as strangers of no long standing, yet they had filled all places of the Roman dominions, their cities, islands, castles, corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, councils, armies, tribes, the palace, senate, and courts of judicature; only they had left to the Heathen their temples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that if they should all agree to retire out of the Roman empire, the world would be amazed at the solitude and desolation that would ensue upon it, there would be so few left; and that the Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians were enough to be able easily to defend themselves, if they were disposed to rise up in arms against the Heathen magistrates. And Pliny, a Heathen who lived in those days, says, multitude, of each sex, every age and quality, were become Christians. This superstition, says he, having infected and over-run not the city on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but towns and countries, the temples and sacrifices are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desolate and forsaken.</p>
                     <p>It was remarked by both Heathen and Christian writers in those days, that the famous Heathen oracles in their temples, where princes and others for many past ages had been wont to inquire and receive answers with an audible voice from their gods, which were indeed answers from the devil; I say, those oracles were now
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:017525_0209_0FA12A54EE38EE78"/>
silenced and struck dumb, and gave no more answers: and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the oracle at Delphos, which was the most famous Heathen oracle in the whole world, which both Greeks and Romans used to consult, began to cease to give any answers, even from the birth of Christ; and the false deity who was worshipped, and used to give answers from his oracle in that temple, being once inquired of, why he did now give answers as he was won<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> to do? made this reply, as several Heathen historians who lived about those times relate, There is an Hebrew boy, says he, who is king of the gods, who has commanded me to leave this house, and be gone to hell, and therefore you are to expect no more answers Many of the Heathen writers who lived about that time, speak much of the oracles being silenced, as a thing at which they wondered, not knowing what the cause should be. Plutarch, a Heathen writer of those times, wrote a particular treatise about it, which is still extant. And Porphyry, one of the Heathen writers before-mentioned, who opposed the Christian religion, in his writings has these words: It is no wonder if the city for these so many years has been over-run with sickness; Esculapius, and the rest of the gods, having withdrawn their converse with men "for since Jesus began to be worshipped, no man has received any public help or benefit by the gods."</p>
                     <p>Thus did the kingdom of Christ prevail against the kingdom of Satan.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I now proceed to take notice of the peculiar circumstances of tribulation and distress just before Constantine the Great came to the throne. This distress they suffered under the tenth Heathen persecution, which, as it was the last, so it was by far the heaviest, and most severe. The church before this, after the ceasing of the ninth persecution, had enjoyed a time of quietness for about forty years together; but, abusing their liberty, began to grow cold and lifeless in religion, and carnal, and contentions prevailed among them; by which they offended God to suffer this dreadful trial to come upon them. Satan having lost ground so much, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all his attempts, now seemed to bestir himself with more than ordinary rage. Those who were then in authority set themselves with the utmost violence to root out Christianity, by burning all Bibles, and destroying all Christians; and therefore they did not stand to try or convict them in a formal process, but fell upon them where ever they could; sometimes setting fire to houses where multitudes of them were assembled, and burning them all together; and at other times slaughtering multitudes together: so that sometimes their persecutors were quite spent with the labor of killing and tormenting them; and in some populous places, so many were slain together, that the blood ran like torrents. It is related, that seventeen thousand martyrs were slain in one month's
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:017525_0210_0FA12A55C6F22ED8"/>
time; and that during the continuance of this persecution, in the province of Egypt alone, no less than 144,000 Christians died by the violence of their persecutors, besides 700,000 that died through the fatigues of banishment, or the public works to which they were condemned.</p>
                     <p>This persecution lasted for ten years together; and as it exceeded all foregoing persecutions in the number of martyrs, so it exceeded them in the variety and multitude of inventions of torture and cruelty Some authors who lived at that time, say, they were innummerable, and exceed all account and expression.</p>
                     <p>This persecution in particular was very severe in England; and this is that persecution which was foretold in Rev. vi.9.10. "And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?"</p>
                     <p>At the end of the ten years during which this persecution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, the Heathen persecutors thought they had finished their work, and boasted that they had utterly destroyed the name and superstition of the Christians, and had restored and propagated the worship of the gods.</p>
                     <p>Thus it was the darkest time with the Christian church just before the break of day They were brought to the greatest extremity just before God appeared for their glorious deliverance, as the bondage of the Israelites in Egypt was the most severe and cruel just before their deliverance by the hand of Moses. Their enemies thought they had swallowed them up just before their destruction, as it was with Pharaoh and his host when they had hemmed in the children of Israel at the Red-Sea.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I come now, in the fourth place, to the great revolution which was in the world in the days of Constantine, which was in many respects like Christ's appearing in the clouds of heaven to save his people, and judge the world. The people of Rome being weary of the government of those tyrants to whom they had lately been subject, sent to Constantine, who was then in the city of York in England, to come and take the throne. He being encouraged, as is said, by a vision of a pillar of light in the heavens, in the form of a cross, in the fight of his whole army, with this inscription, <hi>In this overcome</hi>; and the night following, by Christ's appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him in a dream with the same cross in his hand, who directed him to make a cross like that to be his royal standard, that his army might fight under that banner, and assured him that he should overcome. Accordingly he did, and overcame his enemies, and took possession of the Imperial throne, and embraced the Christian
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:017525_0211_0FA12A578FA324B0"/>
religion, and was the first Christian emperor that ever reigned. He came to the throne about 320 years after Christ. There are several things which I would take notice of which attended or immediately followed Constantine's coming to the throne.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1) The Christian church was thereby wholly delivered from persecution. Now the day of her deliverance came after such a dark night of affliction: weeping had continued for a night, but now deliverance and joy came in the morning. Now God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to judge his people, and repented himself for his servants, when he saw their power was gone, and there was none shut up or left. Christians had no persecutions now to fear. Their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors now were all put down, and their rulers were some of them Christians like themselves.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) God now appeared to execute terrible judgements on their enemies. Remarkable are the accounts which history gives us of the fearful ends to which the Heathen empero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, and princes, and generals, and captains, and other great men came, who had exerted themselves in persecuting the Christians; dying miserably, one and another, under exquisite torments of body, and horrors of conscience, with a most visible hand of God upon them. So that what now came to pass might very fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ly be compared to their hiding themselves in the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>s and rocks of the mountains.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3) Heathenism now was in a great measure abolished through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Roman empire. Images were now destroyed, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then temples pulled down. Images of gold and silver were melted down, and coined into money. Some of the chief of their idols, which were curiously wrought, were brought to Constantinople, and there drawn with ropes up and down the streets for the people to behold and laugh at. The Heathen priests were dispersed and banished.</p>
                     <p n="4">(4) The Christian church was brought into a state of great peace and prosperity. Now all Heathen magistrates were put down, and only Christians were advanced to places of authority all over the empire. They had now Christian presidents, Christian governors, Christian judges and officers, instead of their old Heathenish ones. Constantine set himself to put honour upon Christian bishops or ministers, and to build and adorn churches; and now large and beautiful Christian churches were erected in all parts of the world, instead of the old Heathen temples.</p>
                     <p>This revolution was the greatest revolution and change in the face of things that ever came to pass in the world since the flood. Satan, the prince of darkness, that king and god of the Heathen world, was cast out. The roaring lion was conquered by the Lamb of God, in the strongest dominion that ever he had, even the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man empire. This was a remarkable accomplishment of, Jer. x.ii.
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:017525_0212_0FA12A57EEFA17B0"/>
"The Gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens." The chief part of the world was now brought utterly to cast off their old gods and their old religion, to which they had been accustomed much longer than any of their histories give an account of. They had been accustomed to worship the gods so long, that they khew not any beginning of it. It was formerly spoken of as a thing unknown for a nation to change their gods, Jer. ii.10.11.; but now the greater part of the nations of the known world were brought to cast off their former gods. That multitude of gods that they worshipped were all forsaken. Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of them were cast away for the worship of the true God, and Christ the only Saviour: and there was a most remarkable fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that in Is. ii.17.18. "And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. And the idols he shall utterly abolish." Since that, it has come to pass, that those gods that were once so famous in the world, as Jupiter, and Saturn, and Minerva, and Juno, &amp;c. are only heard of as things which were of old. They have no temples, no altars, no worshippers, and have not had for many hundred years.</p>
                     <p>Now is come the end of the old Heathen world in the principal part of it, the Roman empire. This great revolution and change of the state of the world, with that terrible destruction of the great men who had been persecutors, is compared, in Rev. vi. to the end of the world, and Christ coming to judgement; and is what is most immediately signified under the sixth seal, which followed upon the souls under the altar, crying, "How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?" This vision of the sixth seal, by the general consent of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and expositors, has respect to this downfal of the Heathen Roman empire; though it has a more remote respect to the day of judgement, or this was a type of it. The day of judgment cannot be what is immediately intended; because we have an account of many events which were to come to pass under the seventh seal, and so were to follow after those of the sixth seal. What came to pass now is also represented by the devil's being cast out of heaven to the earth. In his great strength and glory, in that mighty Roman empire, he had as it were exalted his throne up to heaven. But now he fell like lightning from heaven, and was confined to the earth. His kingdom was confined to the meaner and more barbarous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or to the lower parts of the world of mankind. This is the event foretold, Rev. xii.9. &amp;c.
<q>And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil and Satan, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:017525_0213_0FA12A58AEF4DBD8"/>
the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</q>
&amp;c. Satan tempted Christ, and promised to give him the glory of the kingdoms of the world, but now he is obliged to give it to him even against his will. This was a glorious fulfilment of that promise which God made to his Son, that we have an account of in Is. liii.12. "Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors, and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors." This was a great fulfilment of the prophecies of the Old Testament concerning the glorious time of the gospel, and particularly of the prophecies of Daniel. Now the kingdom of heaven is come in a glorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. It pleased the Lord God of heaven to set up a kingdom on the ruins of Satan's kingdom. And such success is there of the purchase of Christ's redemption, and such honour does the Father put upon Christ for the disgrace he suffered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when on earth. And now see to what a height that glorious building is erected, which had been building ever since the fall.</p>
                     <p>INFERENCE. From what has been said of the success of the gospel from Christ's ascension to the time of Constantine, we may deduce a strong argument of the true Christian religion, and that the gospel of Jesus Christ is really from God. This wonderful success of it which has been spoken of, and the circumstances of it which have been mentioned, are a strong argument of it several ways.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We may gather from what has been said, that it is the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and that only, which has actually been the means of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world to the knowledge of the true God. That those are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> gods whom the Heathen worshipped, and that there is but one only God, is what, now since the gospel has so taught us, we can see to be truth by our own reason: it is plainly agreeable to the light of nature: it can be easily shown by reason to be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly true. The very Deists themselves acknowledge, that it can be demonstrated, that there is one God, and but one, who has made and governs the world. But now it is evident that it is the gospel, and that only, which has actually been the means of bringing men to the knowledge of this truth: it was not the instructions of philosophers. They tried in vain: "The world by wisdom kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>w not God." Till the gospel and the holy scriptures came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the world, all the world lay in ignorance of the true God and in the greatest darkness with respect to the things of religion, embracing the absurdest opinions and practices, which all civilized nations now acknowledge to be childish fooleries. And so they lay one age after another, and nothing proved effectual to enlighten them. The light of nature, and their own reason, and all the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:017525_0214_0FA12A599C6560F0"/>
of learned men, signified nothing till the scriptures came. But when these came abroad, they were successful to bring the world to an acknowledgement of the one only true God, and to worship and serve him.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is that all that part of the world which now does own one only true God, Christians, Jews, Mahometans, and even Deists too, originally came by the knowledge of him. It is owing to this that they are not in general at this day left in Heathenish darkness. They have it all, first of all, either immediately from the scriptures or by tradition from their fathers, who had it first from the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And doubtless those who now despise the scriptures, and boast of the strength of their own reason, as being sufficient to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> to the knowledge of the one true God, if the gospel had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come a broad in the world to enlighten their forefathers, would have been as sottish and brutish idolaters as the world in general was before the gospel came abroad. The Mahometans, who own but one true God, at first borrowed the notion from the scriptures: for the first Mahometans had been educated in the Christian religion, and apostatized from it. This is evidential, that the scriptures were designed of God to be the proper means to bring the world to the knowledge of himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rather than human reason, or any thing else. For it is unreasonable to suppose, that the gospel, and that only, which God never de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>igned as the proper means for obtaining this effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should actually obtain it, and that after human reason, which he designed as the proper mean, had been tried for a great many ages without any effect. If the scriptures be not the word of God, then they are nothing but darkness and delusion, yea the greatest delusion that ever was. Now, is it reasonable to suppose, that God in his providence would make use of falsehood and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and that only, to bring the world to the knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and that no part of it should be brought to the knowledge of him any other way?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The gospel's prevailing as it did against such p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now, what other cause can be devised but only the divine power? It was not the outward strength of the instruments which were employed in it. At first, the gospel was preached only by a few fishermen, who were without power and worldly interest to support them. It was not their craft and policy that produced this wonderful effect; for they were poor illiterate men. It was not the agreeableness of the story they had to tell to the notions and principles of mankind. This was no pleasant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was not the agreeableness of their doctrines to the dispositions of men: for nothing is more contrary to the corruptions of men than the pure doctrines of the gospel. This effect therefore can have proceeded from no other cause than the power and agency of God: and if the power of God was what was exercised to cause the gospel to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, then the gospel i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"Verily verily I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth much fruit." And vers. 31.32. "Now is the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me." John xvi.8. "When he (the comforter) is come, he will reprove the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgement,—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the prince of this world is judged."</p>
                     <p>So the Apostle Paul, in 1 Cor. chap. i.21.—28. declares, how that after the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching, to save them that believe; and that God chose the foolish things of the world, to confound the wise; and weak things of the world, to confound the things which are mighty: and base things of the world, and things which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised, yea and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are.— If any man foretells a thing, very likely in itself to

come to pass, from causes which can be foreseen, it is no great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a revelation from God: but when a thing is foretold which is very unlikely ever to come to pass, is entirely contrary to the common course of things, and yet it does come to pass just agreeable to the prediction, this is a strong argument that the prediction was from God.</p>
                     <p>Thus the consideration of the manner of the propagation and success of the gospel during the time which has been spoken of, affords great evidence that the scriptures are the word of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. I am to show how the success of Christ's redemption is carried on from the time of the overthrow of the Heathen Roman empire in the time of Constantine the Great, till the fall of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and the destruction of Satan's visible kingdom on the earth, which is the third great dispensation which is in scripture compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Christ's coming to judgement. This is a period wherein many great and wonderful things are brought to pass. Herein is contained a long series of wonders of divine providence towards the Christian church. The greater part of the book of Revelation is taken up in foretelling the events of this period.</p>
                     <p>The success of Christ's purchase of redemption in this period, appears mainly at the close of it, when Antichrist comes to fall, when there will be a far more glorious success of the gospel than ever was before: and that long series of events which are before, seem to be only to prepare the way for it. In order to a more clear view of the great works of God in accomplishing the success of Christ's redemption, and our seeing the glory of them, it will be necessary, as we have done in the foregoing periods, to consider not only the success itself, but the opposition made to it, and the great works of Satan in this period against the church and kingdom of Christ: and therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in taking a view of this period, I would take notice of events which may be referred to either of these heads, viz. either to the head of Satan's opposition to the success of Christ's redemption, or to the head of success of Christ's redemption: and for the more orderly consideration of the events of this period, I would divide it into these four parts: the first reaching from the destruction of the Heathen empire to the rise of Antichrist; the second, from the rise of Antichrist to the reformation in Luther's time; the third, from thence to the present time; the fourth, from the present time, till Antichrist is fallen, and Satan's visible king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom on earth is destroyed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> I would consider the events of the first part of this period, reaching from the destruction of the Heathen empire to the rise of Antichrist. Here, <hi>first,</hi> I would take notice of the opposition Satan made in this space of time to the church: and, <hi>secondly,</hi> the success that the gospel had in it.</p>

But he is still in a rage, and renews his attempts, and has recourse to new devices against the church. The serpent, after he is cast out of heaven to the earth, casts out of his mouth water as a flood, to cause the woman to be carried away of the flood. The opposition that he made to the church of Christ before the rise of Antichrist, was principally of two sorts. It was either by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the church of Christ with heresies, or by new endeavours to restore Paganism.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1) I would observe, that after the destruction of the Heathen Roman empire, Satan infested the church with heresies. Though there had been so glorious a work of God in delivering the church from her Heathen persecutors, and overthrowing the Heathen empire; yet the days of the church's travail not being ended, and the set time of her prosperity not being yet come, as being what was to succeed the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l of Antichrist, therefore the peace and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity which the church enjoyed in Constantine's time, was but very shor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>: it was a respite, which gave the church a time of peace and silence, as it were, <hi>for half an hour,</hi> wherein the four angels held the four winds from blowing, till the servants of God should be sealed in their foreheads. But the church soon began to be greatly infested with heresies; the two principal, and those which did most infest the church, were the Arian and Pelagian heresies.</p>
                     <p>The Arians began soon after Constantine came to the throne. They denied the doctrine of the Trinity, and the divinity of Christ and the Holy Ghost, and maintained, that they were but mere crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. This heresy increased more and more in the church, and prevailed like a flood, which threatened to overflow all, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to carry away the church, insomuch that before that age was out, that is, before the fourth century after Christ was finished, the greater part of the Christian church were become Arians. There were some emperors, the successors of Constantine, who were Arians; so that the Arians being the prevailing party, and having the civil authority on their side, did raise a great persecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the true church of Christ; so that this heresy might well be compared to a flood out of the mouth of the serpent, which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to overthrow all, and quite carry away the woman.</p>
                     <p>The Pelagian heresy arose in the beginning of the next century. It began by one <hi>Pelagiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

name was <hi>Morgan.</hi> He denied original sin, and the influence of the Spirit of God in conversion, and held the power of free will, and many other things of like tendency; and this heresy did for a while greatly infest the church. Pelagius's principal antagonist, who wrote in defence of the orthodox faith, was St Augustin.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) The other kind of opposition which Satan made against the church, was in his endeavours to restore Paganism. His first attempt was to restore it in the Roman empire, was by Julian the apostate. Julian was nephew to Constantine the Great. When Constantine died, he left his empire to his three sons; and when they were dead, Julian the apostate reigned in their stead. He had been a professed Christian; but he fell from Christanity, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Pagan; and therefore he is called <hi>the apostate.</hi> When he came to the throne, he used his utmost endeavours to overthrow the Christian church, and set up Paganism again in the empire. He put down the Christian magistrates, and set up Heathens in their room: he rebuilt the Heathen temples, and set up the Heathen wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the empire, and become a most notorious persecutor of the Christians, and, as is thought, against his own light: he used to call Christ, by way of reproach, <hi>the Galilean</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He was killed with a lance in his wars with the Persians. When he saw that he was mortally wounded, he took a handful of his blood, and threw it up towards heaven, crying out, Thou hast overcome, O Galilean. He is commonly thought by divines to have committed the unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable sin.</p>
                     <p>Another way that Satan attempted to restore Paganism in the Roman empire, was by <hi>the invasions and conquests of Heathen nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> For in this space of time that we are upon, the Goths and Vandals, and other Heathen barbarous nations, that dwelt in the north of the Roman empire, invaded the empire, and obtained great conquest, and even over ran the empire, and in the fifth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury took the city of Rome, and finally subdued and conquered, and took possession of the Western empire, as it was called, or the western half of the empire, and divided it amongst them; divided it into ten kingdoms, with which began the ten horns of the beast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we are told, that the ten horns are ten kings, who should rise in the latter part of the Roman empire: these are also represented by the ten <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oes of Nebuchadnezzar's image. The invasion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests of these Heathen nations are supposed to be foretold in the 8th chapter of Revelation, in what came to pass under the sounding of the four first trumpets. Now these nations, who now took pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the Western empire, were Heathens; so that by their means Heathenism was again for a while restored after it had been rooted out.</p>
                     <p>

                        </gap>tion.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1) I would observe, that the opposition of Satan in those things was baffled. Though the dragon cast out of his mouth such a flood after the woman to carry her away, yet he could not obtain his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; but the earth helped the woman, and opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth. These heresies, which for a while so much prevailed, yet after a while dwindled away, and orthodoxy was again restored: and his attempt by Julian was baffled at his death.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) The gospel, during this space of time, was further propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated amongst many barbarous Heathen nations in the confines of the Roman empire. In the time of Constantine there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable propagation of the gospel in the East-Indies, chiefly by the ministry of one Frumentius. Great numbers of the Iberians an Heathen people, were converted to Christianity by a Christian woman of eminent piety, whom they had taken captive. Some account is given of several other barbarous nations who were not within the Roman empire, that great numbers of them were bro'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to receive the gospel by the teaching and example of captives whom they had taken in war. After this, about the year of Christ 372<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the gospel was propagated among the barbarous people that dwelt in Arabia; as it was also among some of the northern nations; particularly a prince of the country of the Goths about this time become Christian, and a great number of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this time, from the rise of Antichrist till the Reformation, was a space where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Christian church was in its greatest depth of depression, and its darkest time of all.

In speaking of the events of this space of time, I would, 1. Take notice of the great machinations and works of the devil against the kingdom of Christ during this time; 2.

                     <p n="1">1. I would take notice of the great works of the devil against the kingdom of Christ during this time. Satan had done great things against the Christian church before, but had been baffled once and again. Michael and his angels had obtained a glorious victory.

                     <p n="1">(1) With respect to the kingdom of Antichrist. This seem, to be the master piece of all the contrivances of the devil against the kingdom of Christ, and is evidently so spoken of in scripture, and therefore Antichrist is the man of sin, or <hi>that</hi> man of sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 Thes. ii.3.

But yet this is called <hi>the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> as though there were none but he, because he was so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, and above all others. So this contrivance of the devil, is called <hi>the mystery of iniquity,</hi> 2 Thes. ii.7. We find no enemy of Christ one half so much spoken of in the prophecies of Revelation as this; and the destruction of no enemy is spoken of as so glorious and happy for the church. The craft and subtilty of the devil, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all appears in this work of his; as might be shown, were it not that is would consume too much time.</p>
                     <p>This is a contrivance of the devil to turn the ministry of the Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church into a ministry of the devil, and to turn these angels of the churches into fallen angels, and so into devils. In the tyranny, and superstition, and idolatry, and persecution, which he sets up, he contrives to make an image of ancient Paganism, and more than to restore what was lost in the empire by the overthrow of Pagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism in the time of Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>I am far from pretending to determine the time when the reign of Antichrist began, which is a point that has been so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted among divines and expositors. It is certain that the 1260 days, or years, which are so often in scripture mentioned as the time of the continuance of Antichrist's reign, did not commence before the year of Christ 479<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because if they did, they would have ended, and Antichrist would have fallen before now. But I shall not pretend to determine precisely how long it was after this that
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:017525_0222_0FA12A602ED22CF0"/>
that period began. The rise of Antichrist was gradual. The Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church corrupted itself in many things presently after Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine's time, growing more and more superstitious in its worship, by degrees bringing in many ceremonies into the worship of God, till at length they brought in the worship of saints, and set up images in their churches, and the clergy in general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and especially the bishop of Rome, assumed more and more authority to himself. In the primitive times he was only a minister of a congregation; then a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>nding moderator of a presbytery; then adiocesan bishop; then a metropolitan, which is equivalent to an archbishop; then he was a patriarch; then afterwards he claimed the power of universal bishop over the whole Christian church through the world; wherein he was opposed for a while, but afterwards was confirmed in it by the civil power of the Emperor in the year 606. After that he claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the power of that temporal prince; and so was wont to carry two swords, to signify that both the temporal and spiritual sword was his; and claimed more and more authority, till at length he, as Christ's vicegerent on earth, claimed the very same power that Christ would have, if he was present on earth, and reigned on his throne, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the same power that belongs to God, and used to be called <hi>God on earth</hi>; and used to be submitted to by all the princes of Christendom. He claimed power to crown princes, and to degrade them at his pleasure; and this power was owned: and it came to that, that kings and emperors used to kiss his feet. The emperors were wont to receive their crowns at his hands, and princes were were wont to dread the displeasure of the Pope, as they would dread a thunderbolt from heaven; for if the Pope was pleased to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate a prince, all his subjects were at once freed from their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to him; yea, and obliged not to own him any more, on pain of excommunication; and not only so, but any man might kill him where ever he found him. And further, the Pope was believed to have power to damn men a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And several emperors were actually deposed, and ejected, and died miserable by his means; and if the people of any state or kingdom did not please him, he had power to lay that state or kingdom under an interdict, which was a sentence pronounced by the Pope against that state or kingdom, whereby all sacred adminis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By which means his party grew, and went on fighting till they conquered and brought over the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring countries; and so his party gradually grew till they over-ran a great part of the world. First, the Saracens, who were some of his followers, and were a people of the country of Arabia, where Mahomet lived, about the year 700, began dreadfully to waste the Roman empire.

Thus all those cities and countries where were those famous churches of old, that we read of in the New Testament, as Jerusalem, Antioch, Ephesus, Corinth, &amp;c. now all became subject to the Turks. And they took possession of Constantinople, which was named after Constantine, the Great, being made by him the head city of the Roman empire, whereas Rome had been till then.

                     <p n="1">(1) It is to be observed, that towards the former part of this space of time, some of the nations of Christendom held out a long time before they complied with the corruptions and usurpations of the church of Rome. Though all the world wondered after the beast, yet all nations did not fall in at once. Many of the principal corruptions of the church of Rome were brought in with a great deal of struggle and opposition; and particularly, when the Pope gave out, that he was universal bishop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many churches greatly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed him in it; and it was a long time before they would yield to his exorbitant claims. And so, when the worship of images was first brought into the churches, there were many who greatly

opposed it, and long held out against it. And so with respect to other corruptions of the church of Rome. Those people that dwelt nearer the city of Rome complied sooner, but some that were more remote, were a long time before they could be induced to put their necks under the yoke: and particularly ecclesiastical his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory gives an account, that it was so with great part of the churches in England, and Scotland, and France, who retained the ancient purity of doctrine and worship much longer than many others, who were nearer the chief seat of Antichrist.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) In every age of this dark time, there appeared particular persons in all parts of Christendom, who bore a testimony against the corruptions and tyranny of the church of Rome. There is one age of Antichrist, even in the darkest times of all, but ecclesiastical historians mention great many by name, who manifested an abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Pope, and his idolatrous worship, and pleaded for the ancient purity of doctrine and worship. God was pleased to maintain an uninterrupted succession of witnesses through the whole time, in Germany, France, Britain, and other countries; as historians demonstrate, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>mony which they held. Many of them were private persons, and many of them ministers, and some magistrates, and persons of great distinction. And there were numbers in every age who were persecuted and put to death for this testimony.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3) Besides these particular persons dispersed here and there, there was a certain people, called the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> who lived sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from all the rest of the world, who kept themselves pure, and constantly bore a testimony against the church of Rome through all this dark time. The place where they dwelt was the Vaudois, or the five valleys of Piedmont, a very mountainous county, between Italy and France. The place they lived was compassed about with those exceeding high mountains called <hi>the Alps</hi>

                        </gap> countries, was so difficult, that the valleys where this people dwelt were almost inaccessable. There this people lived for many ages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it were, alone, in a state of separation from all the world, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very little to do with any other people. There they served God in the ancient purity of his worship, and never submitted to the church of Rome. This place in this desert mountainous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, probably was the place especially meant in the 12th chapter of Revelation, 6th verse, as the place prepared of God for the woman, that they should feed her there during the reign of Antichrist.</p>
                     <p>Some of the Popish writers themselves own, that that people ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver submitted to the church of Rome. One of the Popish writers, speaking of the Waldenses, says. The heresy of the Waldenses i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to hide themselves from the severity of the Heathen persecutions which were before Constantine the Great. Thus the woman fled into the wilderness from the face of the serpent, Rev. xii.6. And so, vers. 14. "And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place: where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent." The people being settled there, their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity continued there from age to age afterwards: and being, as it were, by natural walls, as well as by God's grace, separated from the rest of the world, never partook of the overflowing corruption.</p>
                     <p>These especially were those virgins who were not defiled with the rest of women, or when other women prostituted themselves and were defiled; but they kept themselves pure for Christ alone: they followed the Lamb, their spiritual husband, whithersoever he went: they followed him into this hideous wilderness, Rev. xiv.4.5.—Their doctrine and their worship, as there still remain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of them, appear to be the same with the Protestant doctrine and worship; and by the confession of Popish writers, they were a people remarkable for the strictness of their lives, for charity and other Christian virtues. They lived in external poverty in this hideous country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they chose this rather than to comply with the great corruptions of the rest of the world.</p>
                     <p>They lived in so secret a place, it was a long time before they seem to have been much taken notice of by the Romanists; but a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So their persecutors could not by all their cruelties extirpate the church of God; so fulfilling his word, "that the gates of hell should not prevail against it."</p>
                     <p n="4">(4) Towards the latter part of this dark time, several noted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines openly appeared to defend the truth, and bear testimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the corruptions of the church of Rome, and had many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

and were cruelly persecuted, and multitudes put to death for their religion.</p>
                     <p>Wickliff had many disciples and followers, not only in England, but in other parts of Europe, whither his books were carried; and particularly in Bohemia, among whom were two eminent divines, the name of one was <hi>John Hus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="1">1. Here the first thing to be taken notice of is the Reformation. This was begun about 220 years ago: first in Saxony in Germany, by the preaching of Martin Luther, who, being stirred in his spir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, to see the horrid practices of the Popish clergy, and having set himself diligently to inquire after truth, by the study of the holy scriptures, and the writings of the ancient fathers of the church, very openly and boldly decried the corruptions and usurpations of the Romish church in his preaching and writings, and had soon a great number that fell in with him; among whom was the Elector of Saxony, the sovereign prince of the country to which he belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This greatly alarmed the church of Rome; and it did as it were rally all its force to oppose him and his doctrine, and fierce wars and persecutions were raised against it: but yet it went on by the labours of Luther, and Melancthon in Germany, and Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius in Switzerland, and other eminent divines, who were cotempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary with Luther, and fell in with him; and particularly Calvin, who appeared something after the beginning of the Reformation, but was one of the most eminent Reformers.</p>
                     <p>Many of the princes of Germany soon fell in with the Reformed religion, and many other states and kingdoms in Europe, as Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, great part of France, Poland, Lithuania, Switzerland and the Low Countries. So that it is thought, that heretofore about half Christendom were of the Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant religion; though, since, the Papists have gained ground; so that the Protestants now have not so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is said, R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He poured out his vial upon the throne of the beast, i. e. on the authority and dominion of the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>pe: so the word <hi>throne</hi> is often used in scripture; so 1 Kings i.37. "As the Lord hath been with my lord the king<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;" i e make his dominion and authority greater, and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom more glorious.</p>
                     <p>But now, in the Reformation, the vials of God's wrath were poured out on the thron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of the beast. His throne was terrible shaken and diminished. The Pope's authority and dominion was greatly diminished, both as to the extent and degree. He lost, as was said before, about half his dominions. Besides, since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He is not regarded, and his power is dreaded in no measure as it was wont to be. The powers of Europe have learned not to put their necks under the Pope's feet, as formerly they were wont to do.

But it proved that they were not able to perform their enterprize. The Reformed church, notwithstanding their holding so great a council, and for so long a time together against it remained, and remains still. So that the counsel of the froward is carried headlong, and their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is full of darkness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they weary themselves to find the door.</p>
                     <p>Thus the church of Rome, instead of repenting of their deeds, when such clear light was held forth to them by Luther and other servants of God, the Reformers, does, by general agreement in council, persist in their vile corruptions and wickedness, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate opposition to the kingdom of Christ. The doctrines an
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:017525_0230_0FA127C032FC6228"/>
practices of the church of Rome, which were chiefly condemned by the Reformed, were confirmed by the decrees of their council; and the corruptions, in many respects, were carried higher than ever before; and they uttered blasphemous reproaches and curses against the Reformed religion, and all the Reformed church was excommunicated and anathematized by them; and so, according to the prophesy, "they blasphemed God." Thus God hardened their hearts, intending to destroy them.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) The Papists have often endeavoured to overthrow the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation by secret plots and conspiracies. So there were many plots against the life of Luther. The Papists were engaged in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving to dispatch him, and to put him out of their way; and he, as he was a very bold man, often very much exposed himself in the cause of Christ: but yet they were wonderfully prevented from hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and he at last died in his bed in peace. And so there have been from time to time innumerable schemes secretly laid for the overthrow of the Protestant religion; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mong which, that which seem to be most considerable, and which seemed to be the most likely to have taken effect, was that which was in the time of King James II. of England, which is within the memory of many of us. There was at that time a strong conspiracy between the King of England and Lewis XIV. of France, who were both Papists, to extirpate the Northern heresy, as they called the Protestant religion, not only out of England, but out of all Europe; and had laid their schemes so, that they seemed to be almost sure of their purpose. They look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it, that if the Reformed religion were suppressed in the British realms, and in the Netherlands, which were the strongest part, and chief defence of the Protestant interest, they should have easy work with the rest. And just as their matters seemed to become to a head, and their enterprise ripe for execution, God, in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, suddenly dashed all their schems in pieces by the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at the coming in of King William and Queen Mary; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Thus they groped in darkness at noon day as in the night, and their hands could not perform their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, and their kingdom was full of darkness, and they gnawed their tongues for pain.</p>
                     <p>After this, there was a deep design laid to bring the same thing to pass in the latter end of Queen Anne's reign, by the bringing in of the Popish pretender: which was no less suddenly and totally baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled by divine Providence; as the plots against the Reformation, by bringing in the pretender, have been from time to time.</p>

So in the beginning of the reformation, the Emperor of Germany, to suppress the Reformation, declared war with the Duke of Saxony, and the principal men who favoured and received Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's doctrine.

                     <p>The Heathen persecutions had been very dreadful: but now persecution by the church of Rome was improved and studied, and cultivated, as an art or science. Such ways of afflicting and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting were found out, as are beyond the thought and invention of ordinary men, or men who are unstudied in those things, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the invention of all former ages. That persecution might be managed the more effectually, there were certain societies of men established in various parts of the Popish dominions, whose business it should be to study, and improve, and practise persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in its highest perfection, which are those societies called <hi>the courts of inquisition.</hi> A reading of the particular histories of the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="227" facs="unknown:017525_0232_0FA127C1AE87C610"/>
the church of Rome renewed its persecution of the poor Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses, and great multitudes of them were cruelly tortured and put to death. Soon after the Reformation, there were terrible persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in various parts of Germany; and especially in Bohemia, which lasted for thirty years together; in which so much blood was shed for the sake of religion, that a certain writer compares it to the plenty of waters of the great rivers of Germany. The countries of Poland, Lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>By means of these and other cruel persecutions, the Protestant Religion was in a great measure suppressed in Bohemia, and the Palatinate, and Hungary, which before were as it were Protestant countries. Thus was fulfilled what was foretold of the little horn, Dan. vii.20 21 "—and of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell, even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows. I beheld, and and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them." And what was foretold of the beast having seven heads and ten horns.

But in this persecution, the devil in a great measure failed of his purpose; as it issued in a great part of the Netherlands casting off the Spanish yoke, and setting up a wealthy and powerful Protestant state, to the great defence of the protestant cause ever since.</p>
                     <p>France also is another country, which, since the Reformation, in some respects, perhaps more than any other, has been a scene of dreadful cruelties suffered by the Protestants there. After many cruelties had been exercised towards the Protestants in that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, there was begun a persecution of them in the year 1571, in the reign of Charles IX. King of France. It began with a cruel massacre, wherein 70,000 Protestants were slain in a few days time, as the King boasted: and in all this persecution, be slew, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s. It is reckoned, that about this time, within thirty years, there were martyred in this kingdom, for the Protestant religion, 39 princes, 148 counts, 234 barons, 147,518 gentlemen, and 760,000 of the common people.</p>
                     <p>But all these persecutions were, for exquisite cruelty, far exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by those which followed in the reign of Lewis XIV. which indeed are supposed to exceed all others that ever have been; and

being long continued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by reason of the long reign of that King, almost wholly extirpated the Protestant religion out of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, where had been before a multitude of famous Protestant churches all over the kingdom. Thus it was given to the beast to make war with the saints, and to overcome them.</p>
                     <p>There was also a terrible persecution in England in Queen Mary's time, wherein <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>great numbers in all parts of the kingdom were burnt alive. After this, though the Protestant religion has been for the most part established by law in England, yet there have been very severe persecutions by the high church men, who symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize in many things with the Papists. Such a persecution was that which occasioned our forefathers to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ee from their native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to come and settle in this land, which was then an hideous howling wilderness. These persecutions were continued with little intermission till King William c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>me to the throne.</p>
                     <p>Scotland also has been the scene, for many years together, of cruelties and blood by the hands of high churchmen, such as came very little short of the Popish persecution in Queen Mary's days, and in many things much exceed it, which continued till they were delivered by King William.</p>
                     <p>Ireland also has been as it were overwhelmed with Protestant blood. In the days of King Charles I of England, above 200,000 Protestants were cruel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y murdered in that kingdom in a few days; the Papists, by a secret agreement, rising all over the kingdom at an apppointed time, intending to kill every Protestant in the kingdom at once.</p>
                     <p>Besides these, there have been very cruel persecutions in Italy, and Spain, and other places, which I shall not stand to relate.</p>
                     <p>Thus did the devil, and his great minister Antichrist, rage with such violence and cruelty against the church of Christ! and thus did the whore of Babylon make herself drunk with the blood of the saints and martyrs of Jesus! and thus, by these persecutions, the Protestant church has been much diminished! Yet with all have they not been able to prevail; but still the Protestant church is upheld, and Christ fulfils his promise, that "the gates of hell shall not prevail against his church."</p>
                     <p n="5">(5) The last kind of opposition that Satan has made to the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is by corrupt opinions. Satan has opposed the light of the gospel which shone forth in the Reformation with many corrupt opinions, which he has brought in and propagated in the world.</p>
                     <p>Here, in the first place, the first opposition of this kind was by raising up the sect of the Anabaptists, which began about four or five years after the Reformation itself began. This sect, as it first appeared in Germany<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were vastly more extravagant than the present Anabaptists, are in England. They held a great many exceeding corrupt opinions.
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:017525_0234_0FA127C443B518C0"/>
One tenet of theirs was, That there ought to be no civil authority, and so that it was lawful to rebel against civil authority. On this principle, they refused to submit to magistrates, or any human laws; and gathered together in vast armies, to defend themselves against their civil rulers; and put all Germany into an uproar, and so kept it for some time.</p>
                     <p>The next opposition of this kind to the Reformation was that which was made by enthusiasts. Those are called enthusiasts who falsely pretend to be inspired by the Holy Ghost as the prophets were. These began in Germany about ten years after Luther began the Reformation; and there arose various sects of them who were exceeding wild and extravagant. The followers of these are the Quakers in England, and other parts of the British dominions.</p>
                     <p>The next to these were the Socinians, who had their beginning chiefly in Poland, by the teaching of two men; the name of the one was <hi>Laelius Socinus,</hi> of the other, <hi>Faust<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> Socinus.</hi> They held, that Christ was a mere man, and denied Christ's satisfaction, and most of the fundamental doctrines of the Christian religion. Their heresy has since been greatly propagated among Protestants in Poland, Germany, Holland, England, and other places.</p>
                     <p>After these arose the Arminians. These first appeared in Holland about 130 years ago. They take their name from a Dutchman, whose name was <hi>Jacobus Van Harmin,</hi> which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> turned into Latin, is called <hi>Jacobus Arminius</hi>; and from his name the whole sect are called <hi>Arminians.</hi> This Jacobus Arminius was first a minister at Amsterdam, and then a professor of divinity in the university of Leyden. He had many followers in Holland. There was upon this a synod of all the Reformed churches called together, who met at Dort in Holland. The synod of Dort condemned them; but yet they spread and prevailed. They began to prevail in England in the reign of Charles I. especially in the church of England. The church of England divines before that were almost universally Calvinists: but since that, Arminianism has gradually more and more prevailed, till they are become almost universally Arminians. And not only so, but Arminianism has greatly prevailed among the Dissenters, and has spread greatly in New-England, as well as Old.</p>
                     <p>Since this, Arianism has revived. As I told you before, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism, a little after Constantine's time, almost swallowed up the Christian world, like a flood out of the mouth of the serpent which threatened to swallow up the woman. And of late years, this here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy has been revived in England, and greatly prevails there, both in the church of England, and among Dissenters. These hold, that Christ is but a mere creature, though they grant that he is the greatest of all creatures.</p>
                     <p>Again, another thing which has of late exceedingly prevailed

among Protestants, and especially in England, is Deism. The Deists wholly cast off the Christian religion, and are professed infi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>els. They are not like the heretics, Arians, Socinians, and others, who own the scripture to be the word of God and hold the Christian religion to be the true religion, but only deny these and these fundamental doctrines of the Christian religion: they deny the whole Christian religion. Indeed they own the being of God; but deny that Christ was the Son of God, and say he was a mere cheat; and so they say all the prophets and apostles we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e: and they deny the whole scripture. They deny that any of it is the word of God. They deny any revealed religion, or any word of God at all; and say, that God has given mankind no other light to walk by but their own reason. These sentiments and opinions our nation, which is the principal nation of the Reformation, is very much over-run with, and they prevail more and more.</p>
                     <p>Thus much concerning the opposition that Satan has made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Reformation.</p>

                     <p n="1">(1) As to the first, viz. reformation in doctrine, the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable success of the gospel that has been of late of this kind, has been in the empire of Muscovy, which is a country of vast extent. The people of this country, so many of them as call themselves Christians, professed to be of the Greek church; but were barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously ignorant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and very superstitious, till of late years. Their late Emperor Peter the Great, who reigned till within these twenty years, set himself to reform the people of his dominions, and took great pains to bring them out of their darkness, and to have them instructed in religion. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d to that end, he set up schools of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ordered the Bible to be printed in the language of the country, and made a law that every family should keep the holy scriptures in their houses, and that every person should be able to read the same, and that no person should be allowed to marry till they were able to read the scriptures. He also reformed the churches of his country of many of their superstitions, whereby the religion professed and practised in Muscovy is much nearer to that of the Protestants than formerly it used to be. This emperor g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ve great encouragement to the exercise of the Protestant religion in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. And since that Muscovy is become a land of light, in comparison of what it was before. Wonderful alterations have
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:017525_0236_0FA127C5706B1888"/>
been brought about in the face of religion for the better within these fifty years past.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) As to the second kind of success which the gospel has late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ad, viz its propagation among the Heathen, I would take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">[1] The propagation there has been of the gospel among the Heathen here in America. This American continent on which we live, which is a very great part of the world, and, together with its neighbouring seas adjoining, takes up one side of the globe, was wholly unknown to all Christian nations till these latter times. It was not known that there was any such part of the world, though it was very full of people: and therefore here the devil had the people that inhabited this part of the world as it were secure to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, out of the reach of the light of the gospel, and so out of the way of molestation in his dominion over them. And here the many nations of Indians worshipped him as God from age to age, while the gospel was confined to the opposite side of the globe. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> is a thing which, if I remember right, I have some where lit of, as probably supposed from some remaining accounts of things, that occasioned the peopleing of America was this, that the devil being alarmed and surprised by the wonderful success of the gospel which there was the first three hundred years after Christ, and by the downfal of the Heathen empire in the time of Constantine; and seeing the gospel spread so fast, and fearing his Heathenish king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom would be wholly overthrown through the world, led away a people from the other continent into America, that they might be quite out of the reach of the gospel, that here he might quietly possess them, and reign over them as their god. It is what many writers give an account of, that some of the nations of Indians, when the Europeans first came into America, had a tradition among them, that their god first led them into this continent, and went before them in an ark.</p>
                     <p>Whether this was so or not, yet it is certain that the devil did here quietly enjoy his dominion over the poor nations of Indians for many ages. But in later times God has sent the gospel into these parts of the world, and now the Christian church is set up here in New England, and in other parts of America, where before had been nothing but the grossest Heathenish darkness. Great part of America is now full of Bibles, and full of at least the form of the worship of the true God and Jesus Christ, where the name of Christ before had not been heard of for many ages, if at all. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> there has been but a small propagation of the gospel among the Heathen here, in comparison of what were to be wished for; yet there has been something worthy to be taken notice of. There was something remarkable in the first times of New England, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:017525_0237_0FA127C62DF85750"/>
remarkable has appeared of late here, and in other parts of America among many Indians, of an inclination to be instructed in the Christian religion.</p>
                     <p>However small the propagation of the gospel among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then here in America has been hitherto, yet I think we may well look upon the discovery of so great a part of the world as America, and bringing the gospel into it, as one thing by which divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is preparing the way for the future glorious times of the church; when Satan's kingdom shall be overthrown, not only throughout the Roman empire, but throughout the whole habitable globe, on every side, and on all its continents. When those times come, then doubtless the gospel, which is already brought over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to America, shall have glorious success, and all the inhabitants of this new discovered world shall become subjects of the kingdom of Christ, as well as all the other ends of the earth: and in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility providence has so ordered it, that the mariner's compass, which was an invention of later times, whereby men are enabled to sail over the widest ocean, when before they durst not venture far from land; should prove a preparation for what God intends to bring to pass in the glorious times of the church, viz. the sending forth the gospel where-ever any of the children of men dwell, how far soever off, and however separated by wide oceans from those parts of the world which are already Christianized.</p>
                     <p n="2">[2] There has of late years been a very considerable propagation of the gospel among the Heathen in the dominions of Muscovy. I have already observed the reformation which there has lately been among those who are called <hi>Christians</hi> there: but I now speak of the Heathen. Great part of the vast dominions of the Emperor of Muscovy are gross Heathens The greater part of Great Tartary, a Heathen country, has in later times been brought under the Muscovite government; and there have been of late great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of those Heathens who are renounced their Heathenism, and have embraced the Christian religion.</p>
                     <p n="3">[3] There has been lately a very considerable propagation of the Christian religion among the Heathen in the East Indies; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, many in a country in the East-Indies called <hi>Malabar,</hi> have been brought over to the Christian Protestant religion, chiefly by the labors of certain missionaries sent thither to instruct them by the King of Denmark, who have brought over many Heathens to the Christian faith, and have set up schools among them, and a printing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="3">(3) The last kind of success which there has lately been of the gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I shall take notice of, is the revivals of the power and practice of religion which have lately been. Here I shall take notice of but two instances.</p>

It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin only with his placing an alms-box at his study door, into which some poor mites were thrown, whereby books were bought for the instruction of the poor. God was pleased so wonderfully to smile on his design, and so to pour out a spirit of charity on people there on that occasion, that with their charity he was enabled in a little time to erect public schools for the instruction of poor children, and an orphan-house for the supply and instruction of the poor; so that at last it came to that, that near five hundred children were maintained and instructed in learning and piety by the charity of others; and the number continued to increase more and more for many years, and till the last accounts I have seen. This was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a wonderful reformation and revival of religion, and a spirit of piety, in the city and university of Hall; and thus it continued.

But now there is an exceeding great decay of vital piety; yea, it seems to be des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised, called <hi>enthusiasm, whimsy,</hi> and <hi>fanaticism.</hi> Those who are truly religious, are commonly looked upon to be crack brained, and beside their right mind; and vice and profaneness dreadfully prevail, like a flood which threatens to bear down all before it.— But I proceed now to show,</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) In what respect things are altered for the better from what they were in the first Reformation.</p>
                     <p n="1">[1] The power and influence of the Pope is much diminished. Although, since the former times of the Reformation, he has gained ground in extent or dominion; yet he has lost in degree of influence. The vial which in the beginning of the Reformation was poured out on the throne of the beast, to the great diminishing of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authority in the world, has continued running ever since. The Pope, soon after the Reformation, became less regarded by the princes of Europe than he had been before; and so he has been since less and less. Many of the Popish princes themselves them now to regard him very little more than they think will serve their own designs; of which there have been several remarkable proofs and instances of late.</p>
                     <p n="2">[2] There is far less persecution now than there was in the first times of the Reformation. You have heard already how dreadfully persecution raged in the former times of the Reformation; and there is something of it still. Some parts of the Protestant church are at this day under persecution, and so probably will be till the day of the church's suffering and travail is at an end, which will not be till the fall of Antichrist. But it is now in no measure as it was heretofore. There does not seem to be the same spirit of persecution prevailing; it is become more out of fashion even among the Popish princes. The wickedness of the enemies of Christ; and the opposition against his cause, seem to run in another channel. The humour now is, to despise the laugh at all religion; and their seems to be a spirit of indifferency about it. However, so far the state of things is better than it has been, that there is so much less of persecution.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3) There is a great increase of learning. In the dark times of Popery before the Reformation, learning was so far decayed, that the world seemed to be overrun with barbarous ignorance. Their very priests were many of them grossly ignorant. Learning began to revive with the Reformation, which was owing very much to the art of printing, which was invented a little before the Reformation; and since that, learning has increased more and more, and at this day is undoubtedly raised to vastly a greater
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:017525_0241_0FA127C92F022630"/>
height than ever it was before: and though no good use is made of it by the greater part of learned men, yet the increase of learning in itself is a thing to be rejoiced in, because it is a good, and, if duly applied, an excellent handmaid to divinity, and is a talent which, if God gives to men an heart, affords them a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to do great things for the advancement of the kingdom of Christ, and the good of the souls of men. That learning and knowledge should greatly increase before the glorious times, seems to be foretold, Dan. xii 4. "But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, an seal the book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even to the time of the end; many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased." And however little no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> learning is applied to the advancement of religion; yet we may hope that the days are approaching wherein God will make great use of it for the advancement of the kingdom of Christ.</p>
                     <p>God in his providence now seems to be acting over again the same part which he did a little before Christ came. The age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Christ came into the world, was an age wherein learning great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevailed, and was at greater height than ever it had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet wickedness never prevailed more than then. God was pleased to suffer human learning to come to such a height be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he sent forth the gospel into the world, that the world might see the insufficiency of all their own wisdom for the obtaining the knowledge of God, without the gospel of Christ, and the teachings of his Spirit: and then, after that, in the wisdom of God, the the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God, by the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness of preaching, to save them that believe. And when the gospel came to prevail first without the help of man's wisdom, then God was pleased to make use of learning as an handmaid. So now learning is at a great height at this day in the world far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what it was in the age when Christ appeared; and now the world, by their learning and wisdom, do not k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then shall human learning be subservient to the understanding of the scriptures, and to a clear explanation and a glorious defence of the doctrines of christianity. There is no doubt to be made of it, that God in his providence has of late given the world the art of printing, and such a great increase of learning, to prepare for what be designs to accomplish for his church in the approaching day of its prosperity. Thus the wealth of the wicked is laid up for the just<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> agreeable to Prov. xiii.22.</p>
                     <p>HAVING now shown how the work of redemption has been carried on from the fall of man to the present time, before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any further, I would make some APPLICATION.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 From what has been said, we may see great evidence of the truth of the Christian religion and that the scriptures are the word of God. There are three arguments of this, which I shall take notice of, which may be drawn from what has been said.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1) It may be argued from that violent and inveterate oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there has always appeared of the wickedness of the world against this religion. The religion that the church of God has professed from the first founding of the church after the fall to this time, has always been the same. Though the dispensations have been alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet the religion which the church has professed has always, as to its essentials, been the same. The church of God, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, has been one society. The christian church which has been since Christ's ascension, is manifestly the same society conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with the church, that was before Christ came. The Christian church is grafted on their root: they are built on the same founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The revelation on which both have depended, is essentially the same: for as the Christian church is built on the holy scriptures, so was the Jewish church though now the scriptures be enlarged by the addition of the New Testament; but still it is essentially the same revelation with that which was given in the Old Testament, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the subjects of divine revelation are now more clearly revealed in the New Testament than they were in the Old. But the sum and substance of both the Old Testament and New, is Christ and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. The religion of the church of Israel, was essentially the same religion with that of the Christian church, as evidently appears from what has been said. The ground work of the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the church of God, both before and since Christ has appeared, is the same great scheme of redemption by the Son of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so the church that was before the Israelitish church, was still the same society, as it was essentially the same religion that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed and practised in it. Thus it was from Noah to Abraham, and
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:017525_0243_0FA127CB6EB9CAC0"/>
thus it was before the flood And this society of men that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the church,</hi> has always been built on the foundation of those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations which we have in the scriptures, which have always been essentially the same, though gradually increasing The church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the flood, was built on the foundation of those revelations of Christ which were given to Adam, and Abel, and Enoch, of which we have an account in the former chapters of Genesis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and others of the like import. The church after the flood, was built on the foundation of the revelations made to Noah and Abraham, to Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedek, Isaac, and Jacob, to Joseph, Job, and other holy men of whom we have an account in the scriptures, or other revelations that were to the same purpose. And after this the church depended on the scriptures themselves as they gradually increased; so that the church of God has always been built on the foundation of divine revelation, and always on those revelations that were essentially the same, and which are summarily comprehended in the holy scriptures, and ever since about Moses's time have been built on the scriptures themselves.</p>
                     <p>So that the opposition which has been made to the church of God in all ages, has always been against the same religion, and the same revelation. Now therefore the violent and perpetual opposition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hat has ever been made by the corruption and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mankind against this church, is a strong ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ment of the truth of this religion, and this revelation, upon which this church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>as always been built. Contraries are well argued one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. We may well and safely argue, that a thing is good, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degree of opposition in which it stands to evil, or the degree in which evil opposes it, and is an enemy to it. We may well argue, that a thing is light, by the great enmity which darkness has to it. Now it is evident by the things which you have heard concerning the church of Christ, and that the holy religion of Jesus Christ which it has professed, that the wickedness of the world has had a perpetual hatred to it, and has made most violent opposition against it.</p>
                     <p>That the church of God has always met with great opposition in the world, none can deny. This is plain by profane history as far as that reaches; and before that, divine history gives us the same account. The church of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and its religion and worship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> began to be opposed in Cain's and Abel's time, and was so when the earth was filled with violence in Noah's time. After this, how was the church opposed in Egypt! and how was the church of Israel always hated by the nations round about, agreeable to that in Jer. xii.9 "Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round about are against her." After the Babylonish captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, how was this church persecuted by Antiochus Epiphanes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers!
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:017525_0244_0FA127CC304FA148"/>
and how was Christ persecuted when he was on earth! and how were the apostles and other Christians persecuted by the Jews, before the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans! How violent were that people against the church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and how dreadful was the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Heathen world against the Christian church after this before Constantine! How great was their spite against the true religion! Since that, how yet more violent, and spiteful, and cruel, has been the opposition of Antichrist against the church!</p>
                     <p>There is no other such instance of opposition. History gives no account of any other body of men that have been so hated, and so maliciously and insatiably pursued and persecuted, nor any thing like it. No other religion ever was so maligned age after age. The nations of other professions have enjoyed their religion in peace and and quietness, however they have differed from their neighbours. One nation has worshipped one sort of gods, and others another, without molesting or disturbing one another about it. All the spite and opposition has been against this religion, which the church of Christ has professed. All other religions have seemed to show an implacable enmity to this; and men have seemed to have, from one age to another, such a spite against it, that they have seemed as though they could never satisfy their cruelty. They put their inventions upon the rack to find out torments that should be cruel enough; and yet, after all, never seemed to be satisfied. Their thirst has never been satisfied with blood.</p>
                     <p>So that this is out of doubt, that this religion, and these scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, have always been malignantly opposed in the world. The only question that remains is, What it is that has made this oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition? whether it be the wickedness and corruption of the world, or not, that has done this? But of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> can be no greater doubt than of the other, if we consider how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>useless this cruelty has always been, who the opposers have been, and the manner in which they have opposed. The opposition has chiefly been from Heathenism and Popery; which things certainly are evil. They are both of them very evil, and the fruits of the blindness, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and wickedness of men, as the very Deists themselves confess. The light of nature shows, that the religion of Heathens, consisting in the worship of idols, and sacrificing their children to them, and in obscene and abominable rites and ceremonies, is wickedness. And the superstitions, and idolatries, and usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of the church of Rome, are no less contrary to the light of nature. By this it appears, that this opposition which has been made against the church of God, has been made by wicked men. With regard to the opposition of the Jews in Christ's and the apostles times, it was in a most corrupt time of that nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the people were generally become exceeding wicked, as some
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:017525_0245_0FA127CCEEFD6758"/>
of the Jewish writers themselves, as Josephus and others, who lived about that time, do expressly say. That it has been mere wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that has made this opposition, is manifest from the manner of opposition. the extreme violence, injustice, and cruelty, with which the church of God has been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>. It seems to show the the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Now what reason can be assigned, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y the corruption and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness of the world should so implacably set itself against this reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Jesus Christ, and against the scriptures, but only that they are contrary to wickedness, and consequently are good and holy? Why should the enemies of Christ, for so many thousand years together, manifest such a mortal hatred of this religion, but only that it is the cause of God? If the scriptures be not the word of God, and the religion of the church of Christ be not the true religion, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> it must follow, that it is a most wicked religion; nothing but a pack of lies and abominable delusions, invented by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God themselves. If this were so, it is not likely that the enemies of God, and the wickedness of the world, would have maintained such a perpetual and implacable enmity against it.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) It is a great argument that the Christian church and its reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is from God, that it has been upheld hitherto through all the opposition and dangers it has passed through. That the church of God and the true religion, which has been so continually and violently opposed, with so many endeavours to overthrow it, and which has so often been brought to the brink of ruin, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most swallowed up, through the greatest part of six thousand years, has yet been upheld, does most remarkably show the hand of God in favour of the church. If we consider it, it will appear one of the greatest wonders and miracles that ever came to pass. There is nothing else like it upon the face of the earth. There is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther society of man that has stood as the church has. As to the old world, which was before the flood, that was overthrown by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of waters: but yet the church of God was preserved. Satan's visible kingdom on earth was then once entirely overthrown; but the visible kingdom of Christ never has been overthrown. All those ancient human kingdoms and monarchies of which we read, and which have been in former ages, they are long since come to an end. Those kingdoms of which we read in the Old Testament, of the Moabites, the Ammonites, the Edomites, &amp;c. they are all long ago come to an end. Those four great monarchies of the world have been overthrown one after another. The great empire of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

other things, even the greatest and most glorious of them: they have all grown old, and have vanished away; "The moth has eaten them up like a garment, the worm eaten them like wool;" but yet God's church remains.</p>
                     <p>Never where there so many and so potent endeavours to destroy any thing else, as there have been to destroy the church.

The children of Israel were but a small handful of people, in comparison of the many who often sought their overthrow. And so in Christ's time, and in the beginning of the Christian church after Christ's resurrection, they were but a remnant: whereas the whole multitude of the Jewish nation were against them. And so in the beginning of the Gentile church, they were but a small number in comparison with the Heathen, who sought their overthrow. And so in the dark times of Antichrist, before the Reformation, they were but a handful; and yet their enemies could never overthrow them. It has commonly been so, that the enemies of the church have not only had the greatest number of their side, but they have had the strength of their side in other respects. They have commonly had all the civil authority of their side. So it was in Egypt: the civil authority was of the side of the Egyptians, and the church were only their slaves, and were in their hands; and yet they could not overthrow them. So it was in the time of the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes: the authority was all on the side of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors, and the church was under their dominion; and yet all their cruelty could not extirpate it. So it was afterwards in the time of the Heathen Roman government. And so it was in the time of Julian the apostate, who did his utmost to overthrow the Christian church, and to restore Heathenism. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> it has been for the most part since the rise of Antichrist: for a great many ages, the civil authority was all on the side of Antichrist, and the church seemed to be in their hands.</p>
                     <p>Not only has the strength of the enemies of the church been greater than the strength of the church, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>t ordinarily the church has not used what strength they have had in their own defence, but have committed themselves wholly to God. So i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> was in the time of the Jewish persecutions before the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans; and so it was in the time of the Heathen persecutions before Constantine; the Christians did not only not rise up in arms to defend themselves, but they did not pretend to make any forcible resistence to their Heathen persecutors. So it has for the most part
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:017525_0247_0FA127CE6D1D54E8"/>
been under the Popish persecutions; and yet they have never been able to overthrow the church of God; but it stands to this very day.</p>
                     <p>This is still the more exceeding wonderful, if we consider how often the church has been brought to the brink of ruin, and the case seemed to be desperate, and all hope gone, and they seemed to be swallowed up. In the time of the old world, when wickedness so prevailed, as that but one family was left, yet God wonderfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and overthrew the wicked world with a flood, and preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his church. So at the Red sea, when Pharoah and his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ost though they were quite sure of their prey; yet God appeared, and destroyed them, and delivered his church. So was it from time to time in the church of Israel, as has been shown. So under the tenth and last Heathen persecution, their persecutors boasted that now they had done the business for the Christians, and had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the Christian church; yet in the midst of their triumph, the Christian church rises out of the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>st and prevails, and the Heathen empire totally falls before it. So when the Christian church seemed ready to be swallowed up by the Arian heresy; so when Antichrist rose and prevailed, and all the world wondered after the beast, and the church for many hundred years was reduced to such a small number, and seemed to be hidden, and the power of the world was engaged to destroy those little remainders of the church; yet they could never fully accomplish their design, and at last God wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully revived his church in the time of the Reformation, and made it to stand as it were on its feet, in the sight of its enemies, and raised it out of their reach. So since, when the Popish powers have plotted the overthrow of the Reformed church, and have seemed just about to bring their matters to a conclusion, and to finish their design, then God has wonderfully appeared for the deliverance of his church, as it was in the time of the Revolution by King William. So it has been from time to time: presently after the darkest times of the church, God has made his church most gloriously to flourish.</p>
                     <p>If such a preservation of the church of God, from the beginning of the world hitherto, attended with such circumstances, is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to shew a divine hand in favour of it, what can be devised that would be sufficient? But if this be from the divine hand, then God owns the church, and owne her religion and owns that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and those scriptures on which she is built; and so it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that their religion is the true religion, or God's religion, and that the scriptures, which they make their rule, are his word.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3) We may draw this further argument for the divine authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the scriptures from what has been said, viz. that God has so fulfilled those things which are foretold in the scriptures. —I have already observed, as I went along, how the prophecies of the scripture were fulfilled: I shall now therefore single out but two instances of the fulfilment of scripture prophecy.</p>
                     <p n="1">

I have just now shown what an evidence this is of the divine authority of the scriptures in itself considered: I now speak of it as a fulfilment of scripture-prophecy. This is abundantly foretold and promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the scriptures, as particularly in the text; there it is foretold that other things should fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l, other kingdoms and monarchies, which set themselves in opposition, should come to nothing: "The moth should eat them up like a garment, and the worm should eat them like wool." So it has in fact come to pass. But it is here foretold, that God's covenant-mercy to his church should continue for ever; and so it hath hitherto proved, tho' now it be so many ages since, and though the church has passed through so many dangers. The same is promised, Is. liv.17. "No weapon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that is formed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee, shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against the in judgement, thou shalt condemn." And again, Is. xlix.14.15 16. "But Zion said, The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me. Can a woman forget her sucking child, that should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands, thy walls are continually before me." The s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>me is promised again in Is. lix.21. and Is. xliii.1.2. and Zech. xii.2.3. So Christ promises the same, when he says, "On this rock will I build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." Now if this be not from God, and the scriptures be not the word of God, and the church of Christ built on the foundation of this word be not of God, how could the persons who foretold this, know it? for if the church were not of God, it was a very unlikely thing ever to come to pass. For they foretold the great opposition, and the great dangers, and also foretold that other kingdoms should come to nought, and that the church should often be almost swallowed up, as it were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"For that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition."—It is prophesied, that this Antichrist, or man of sin, should be one, that should set himself up in the temple or visible church of God, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be vested with the power of God himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as head of the

church, as in the same chap. vers. 4. All this is exactly come to pass in the church of Rome. Again, it is intimated, that the rise of Antichrist should be gradual, as there, vers. 7. "For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth, will let, until he be taken out of the way" This also came to pass.—Again, it is prophesi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was foretold that this Antichrist should be eminent and remarkable for the sin of pride, pretending to great things, and assuming very much to himself: so in the forementioned place in Thessalonians, "That he should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt himself above all that is called God," or that is worshiped. So Rev. xiii.5. "And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things, and blasphemies." Dan. vii.20. the little horn is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This also came to pass in the Pope, and the church of Rome.—It was also prophesied, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist should be an exceeding cruel persecutor, Dan. vii.21. The same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them: Rev. xiii.7. "And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them." Rev. xvii.6.

"Even so that horn that had eyes." This also came to pass in the church of Rome.—It was foretold, that the kings of Christendom should be subject to

This also came to pass in the church of Rome. Fire's coming down from heaven, seemed to have reference to their excommunications, which were dreaded like fire from heaven. — It was foretold, that he should forbid to marry, and to abstain from meats: 1 Tim. iv.3. "Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving." This also i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"And the woman was arrayed in purple, and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones, and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand." And so chap. xviii.7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>12.13.16. This also is come to pass with respect to the church of Rome.—It was foretold, that he should forbid any to buy or sell, without they had his mark: Rev. xiii.17.

                        </gap>ffer the bodies of God's people to be put into graves: Rev. xi.8.9. "And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, — and they — shall not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uffer their dead bodies to be put in graves." This also has literally come to pass with respect to the church of Rome.—I might mention many other things which were foretold of Antichrist, or that great enemy of the church so often spoken of in scripture, and show that they were fulfiled most exactly in the Pope and the church of Rome.</p>
                     <p>How strong an argument is this, that the scriptures are the word of God?</p>
                     <p n="2">2 But I come now to a second <hi>inference</hi>; which is this: From what has been said, we may learn what the spirit of true Christians
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:017525_0251_0FA127D22CFE8E00"/>
is, viz. a spirit of suffering. Seeing God has so ordered it in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that his church should for so long a time, for the greater part of so many ages, be in a suffering state, yea, and often in a state of such extream suffering, we may conclude, that the spirit of the true church is a suffering spirit, otherwise God never would have ordered so much suffering for the church; for doubtless God accommodates the state and circumstances of the church to the spirit that he has given them. We see by what has been said, how many and great sufferings the Christian church for the most part has been under for these 1700 years: no wonder therefore that Christ so much inculcated upon his disciples, that it was necessary, that if any would be his disciples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'They must deny themselves, and take up their cross and follow him.'</p>
                     <p>We may argue, that the spirit of the true church of Christ is a suffering spirit, by the spirit the church has shown and excercised under her suffering. She has actually, under those terrible persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions though which she has passed, rather chosen to undergo those dreadful torments, and to sell all for the pearl of great price, to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all that her bitterest enemies could inflict, than to renounce Christ and his religion. History furnishes us with a great number of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable instances, sets in view a great cloud of witnesses. This abundantly confirms the necessity of being of a spirit to sell all for Christ, to renounce our own case, our own worldly profit, and honour, and our all, for <hi>him,</hi> and for the gospel.</p>
                     <p>Let us inquire, whether we are of such a spirit. How does it prove upon trial? Does it prove in fact that we are willing to deny ourselves, and renounce our own worldly interest, and to pass through the trials to which we are called in providence? Alas, how small are our trials, compared with those of many of our fellow Christians in former ages! I would on this occasion apply that in Jer. xii.5. "If thou hast run with the footmen, and they wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thee, then how canst thou contend with horses?" If you have not been able to endure the light trials to which you have been called in this age, and in this land, how would you be able to endure the far greater trials to which the church has been called in former ages? Every true Christian has the spirit of a martyr, and would suffer as a martyr, if he were called to it in providence.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Hence we learn what great reason we have, assuredly to expect the fulfilment of what yet remains to be fulfilled of things foretold in scripture. The scriptures foretel many great things yet to be fulfilled before the end of the world. But there seem to be great difficulties in the way. We seem at present to be very far from such a state as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> foretold in the scriptures; but we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant reason to expect, that these things, however seemingly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, will yet be accomplished in their season. We see the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of God to his promises hitherto. How true has God been
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:017525_0252_0FA127D2F3ED7CD0"/>
to his church, and remembered his mercy from generation to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration! We may say concerning what God has done hitherto for his church, as Joshua said to the the children of Israel, Josh. xxi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>iled of all that the Lord our God hath spoken concerning his church;" but all things are hitherto come to pass agreeable to the divine prediction. This should strengthen our faith in those promises, and encourage us, and stir us up to earnest prayer to God for the accomplishment of the great and glorious things which yet remain to be fulfilled.</p>
                     <p>IT has already been shown how the success of Christ's redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was carried on through various periods down to the present time.</p>
                     <p n="4">4thly. I come now to show how the success of Christ's redemption will be carried on from the present time, till Antichrist is fallen, and Satan's visible kingdom on earth is destroyed. —And with res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to this space of time, we have nothing to guide us but the prophecies of scripture. Through most of the time from the fall of man to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, we had scripture history to guide us; and from thence to the present time we had prophecy, together with the accomplishment of it in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as related in human histories. But henceforward we have only prophecy to guide us. Here I would pass by those things that are only conjectural, or that are surmised by some from those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies which are doubtful in their interpretation, and shall insist only on those things which are more clear and evident.</p>
                     <p>We know not what particular events are to come to pass before that glorious work of God's Spirit begins, by which Satan's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is to be overthrown. By the consent of most divines, there are but few things, if any at all, that are foretold to be accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the beginning of that glorious work of God. Some think the slaying of the witnesses, Rev. xi.7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>8 is not yet accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished. So divines differ with respect to the pouring out of the seven vials, of which we have an account, Rev xvi. how many are already poured out, or how many remain to be poured out; though a late expositor, whom I have before mentioned to you, seems to make it very plain and evident, that all are already pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out but two, viz the sixth on the river Euphrates, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth into the air. But I will not now stand to inquire what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the pouring out of the sixth vial on the river Euphrates, that the way of the kings of the east may be prepared; but only would say, that it seems to be something immediately preparing the way for the destruction of the spiritual Babylon, as the drying up of the river Euphrates, which ran through the midst of old Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, was what prepared the way of the kings of the Medes and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, the kings of the east, to come in under the walls, and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy that city.</p>

                        <pb n="248" facs="unknown:017525_0253_0FA127D3AEF67600"/>But whatever this be, it does not appear that it is any thing which shall be accomplished before that work of God's Spirit is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, by which, as it goes on, Satan's visible kingdom on earth shall be utterly overthrown. Therefore I would proceed directly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what the scripture reveals concerning the work of God itself, by which he will bring about this great event, as being the next thing w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>First<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would observe two things in general concerning it.</p>

                        </gap>old in scripture, that it shall be a time of but little religion, when Christ shall come to set up his kingdom in the world. Thus when Christ spake of his coming to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>courage his elect, who cry to him day and night, in L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ke xviii 8 he adds this, "Nevertheless, "when the Son of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Though Christ's coming at the last judgement is not here to be excluded, yet there seem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to be a special respect to his coming to deliver his church from their long continued suffering persecuted state, which is accomplished only at his coming at the destruction of Antichrist. That time that the elect cry to God, as in Rev. vi.10. "How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?" and the time spoken of in Rev. xviii.20. "R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It is now a very dark time with respect to the interests of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and such a time as this prophesied of in this place; wherein their is but little faith, and a great prevailing of infidelity on the earth. There is now a remarkable fulfilment of that in 2 Pet. iii.3. "Knowing this, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts." So Jude, 17.18. "But beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" Whether the times shall be any darker still, or how much darker, before the beginning of this glorious work of God, we cannot tell.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is no reason from the word of God to think any other,
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:017525_0254_0FA127D4707AFAF0"/>
than that this great work of God will be wrought, though very swiftly, yet gradually. As the children of Israel were gradually brought out of the Babylonish captivity, first one company, and then another, and gradually rebuilt their city and temple; and as the Heathen Roman empire was destroyed by a gradual, though a very swift prevalency of the gospel; so, though there are many things which seem to hold forth as though the work of God would be exceeding swift, and many great and wonderful events should very suddenly be brought to pass, and some great parts of Satan's visible kingdom should have a very sudden fall, yet all will not be accomplished at once, as by some great miracle, as the resurrection of the dead at the end of the world will be all at once; but this is a work which will be accomplished by means, by the preaching of the gospel, and the use of the ordinary means of grace, and so shall be gradually brought to pass. Some shall be converted, and be the means of others conversion. God's Spirit shall be poured out first to raise up instruments, and then those instruments shall be used and succeeded. Doubtless one nation shall be enlightened and converted after another, one false religion and false way of worship exploded after another. By the representation in Dan. ii.3.4. the stone cut out of the mountains without hands gradually grows. So Christ teaches us, that the kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard-seed, Matth. xiii.31.32. and like leaven hid in three measures of meal, verse 33. The same representation we have in Mark iv.26.27.28. and in the vision of the waters of the sanctuary, Ezek. xlvii. —The scriptures hold forth as though there should be several successive great and glorious events, by which this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work should be accomplished. The angel, speaking to the prophet Daniel of those glorious times, mentions two glorious periods, at the end of which glorious things should be accomplished: Dan. xii.11. "And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days." But then he adds in the next verse, "Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days;" intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that something very glorious should be accomplished at the end of the former period, but something much more glorious at the end of the latter.</p>
                     <p>But I now proceed to show how this glorious work shall be accomplished.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Spirit of God shall be gloriously poured out for the wonderful revival and propagation of religion. This great work shall be accomplished, not by the authority of princes, nor by the wisdom of learned men, but by God's Holy Spirit: Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This pouring out of the Spirit of God, when it is begun, shall soon bring great multitudes to foresake that vice and wickedness which now so generally prevails, and shall cause that vital religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is now so despised and laughed at in the world, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive.

So that the gospel shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be preached with abundantly greater clearness and power than had heretofore been: for this great work of God shall be brought to pass by the preaching of the gospel, as it is represented in Rev. xiv.6 7.8 that before Babylon falls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the gospel shall be powerfully preached and propagated in the world.</p>
                     <p>This was typified of old by the sounding of the silver trumpets in Israel in the beginning of their jubilee: Lev. xxv.9. "Then shal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>use the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land." The glorious times which are approaching, are as it were the church's jubilee, which shall be introduced by the sounding of the silver trumpet of the gospel, as is foretold in Is xxvii.13. "And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and the outcast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of the land of Egypt, and shall worship the Lord in the holy mount at Jerusalem." There shall be a glorious pouring out of the Spirit with this clear and powerful preaching of the gospel, to make it successful for reviving those holy doctrines of religion which are now chiefly ridiculed in the world, and turning many from heresy, and from Popery, and from other false religion; and also for turning many from their vice and profaneness, and for bringing vast multitudes savingly home to Christ.</p>
                     <p>That work of conversion shall go on in a wonderful manner, and spread more and more. Many shall flow together to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

"Lift up thine eyes round about, and see; all they gather themselves together, they come to thee; thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side. Then thou shalt see and flow together." And so vers. 8. "Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?" It being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in the forementioned place in the Revelation, that the gospel shall be preached to every tongue, and kindred, and nation, and people, before the fall of Antichrist; so we may suppose, that it will soon be gloriously successful to bring in multitudes from every nation; and it shall spread more and more with wonderful swiftness, and vast numbers shall suddenly be brought in as at once, as you may see, Is. lxvi.7 8.9.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This pouring out of the Spirit of God will not affect the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Satan's visible kingdom, till there has first been a violent and mighty opposition made. In this the scripture is plain, that when Christ is thus gloriously coming forth, and the destruction of Antichrist is ready at hand, and Satan's kingdom begins to totter, and appear to to be imminently threatened, the powers of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of darkness will rise up, and mightily exert themselves to prevent their kingdom being overthrown. Thus after the pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the sixth vial, which was to dry up the river Euphrates, to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>epare the way for the destruction of the spiritual Babylon, it is represented in Rev. xvi. as though the powers of hell will be mightily alarmed, and should stir up themselves to oppose the kingdom of Christ, before the seventh and last vial shall be poured out, which shall give them a final and compleat overthrow. We have an account of the pouring out of the sixth in vers. 12. Upon this, the beloved disciple informs us that in the following verses, that "three unclean spirits like frogs shall go forth unto the kings of the earth, to gather them together to the battle of the great day of God Almighty." This seems to be the last and greatest effort of Satan to save his kingdom from being overthrown; though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he may make as great towards the end of the world to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain it.</p>
                     <p>When the Spirit begins to be so gloriously poured forth, and the devil sees such multitudes flocking to Christ in one nation and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and the foundations of his kingdom daily undermining, and the pillars of it b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eaking, and the whole ready to come to swift and sudden destruction, it will greatly alarm all hell. Satan has ever had a dread of having his kingdom overthrown, and he has been opposing of it ever since Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s ascension, and has been doing great works to fortify his kingdom, and to prevent it, ever since the day of Constantine the Great. To this end he has set
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:017525_0257_0FA127D7AF58DD68"/>
up those two mighty kingdoms of Antichrist and Mahomet, and brought in all the heresies, and superstitions, and corrupt opinions which there are in the world. But when he sees all begins to fail it will rouse him exceedingly. If Satan dreaded being cast out of the Roman empire, how much more does he dread being cast out of the whole world!</p>
                     <p>It seems as though in this last great opposition which shall be made against the church to defend the kingdom of Satan, all the forces of Antichrist, and Mahometanism, and Heathenism, will be united; and all the forces of Satan's visible kingdom through the whole world of mankind, Therefore it is said, that "spirits of devils shall go forth unto the kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to gather them together to the battle of the great day of God Almighty." These spirits are said to come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophets; i. e. there shall be the spirit of Popery, and the spirit of Mahometanism, and the spirit of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenism, all united. By the beast is meant Antichrist; by the dragon, in this book, is commonly meant the devil, as he reigns over his Heathen kingdom; by the false prophet, in this book, is sometimes meant the Pope and his clergy: but here an eye seems to be had to Mahomet, whom his followers call a great prophet of God. This will be as it were the dying struggles of the old ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: a battle wherein he will fight as one that is almost desperate.</p>
                     <p>We know not particularly in what manner this opposition shall be made. It is represented as a battle; it is called <hi>the battle of the great day of God Almighty.</hi> There will be some way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a mighty struggle between Satans kingdom and the church, and probably in all ways of opposition that can be; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less great opposition by external force; wherein the princes of the world who are on the devil's side shall join hand in hand: for it is said, "The kings of the earth are gathered together to battle;" Rev. xix.19. Probably withal there will be a great opposition of subtle disputers and carnal reasoning, and great persecution in many places, and great opposition by virulent reproches, and also great opposition by craft and subtlety. The devil now doubtless will ply his skill, as well as strength, to the utmost. The devils, and those who belong to their kingdom, will every where be stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, and engaged to make an united and violent opposition against this holy religion, which they see prevailing so mightily in the world.— But,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Christ and his church shall in this battle obtain a compleat and entire victory over their enemies. They shall be totally rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and overthrown in this their last effort. When the powers of hell and earth are thus gathered together against Christ, and his

To represent to us how great the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory should be which they should obtain, and how mighty the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of their enemies, it is said, vers. 17 &amp; 18. that "all the fowls of heaven are called together, to eat the great supper given them, of the flesh of kings, and captains, and mighty men," &amp;c.; and then, in the following verses, we have an account of the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and overthrow.</p>
                     <p>In this victory, the seventh vial shall be poured out. It is said, Rev, xvi 16. of the great army that should be gathered together against Christ: "And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue <hi>Armageddon</hi>:" and then it is said, "And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, it is done." Now the business is done for Satan and his adherents. When this victory is obtained, all is in effect done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Satan's last and greatest opposition is conquered; all his measures are defeated; the pillars of his kingdom broken asunder, and will fall of course. The devil is utterly baffled and confounded, and knows not what else to do. He now sees his Antichristian, and Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ometan, and Heathenish kingdoms through the world, all tumbling about his ears. He and his most powerful instruments are taken captive. Now that is in effect done which the church of God had been so long waiting and hoping for, and so earnestly crying to God for, saying, "How long, O Lord, holy and true?" now the time is come.</p>
                     <p>The angel who set his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the earth, lift up his hand to heaven, and swore by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and all things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that when the seventh angel should come to sound, the time should be no longer. Now the time is come; now the seventh trumpet sounds, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth vial is poured out, both together; intimating, that now all is finished as to the overthrow of Satan's visible kingdom on earth. This victory shall be by far the greatest that ever was obtained over Satan and his adherents. By this blow, with which the stone cut out of the mountain without hands, shall strike the image of gold, and silver, and brass, and iron, and clay, it shall all be broken to pieces. This will be a finishing blow to the image, so that it shall become as the chaff of the summer threshing-floor.</p>
                     <p>In this victory will be a most glorious display of divine power. Christ shall therein appear in the character of King of kings, and Lord of lords, as in Rev. xix, 16; Now Christ shall dash his

enemies, even the strongest and proudest of them, in pieces; as at potter's vessel shall they be broken to shivers. Then shall strength be shown out of weakness, and Christ shall cause his church as it were to thresh the mountains, as in Is. x<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>i.15: "Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing-instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff." Then shall be fulfilled that in Is. xlii.13 14 15.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Consequent on this victory, Satan's visible kingdom on earth shall be destroyed. When Satan is conquered in this last bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the church of Christ will have easy work of it; as when Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua and the children of Israel had obtained that great victory over the five kings of the Amorites, when the sun stood still, and God sent great hail-stones on their enemies, they after that went from one city to another, and burnt them with fire: they had easy work of subduing the cities and country to which they belonged. So it was also after that other great battle that Joshua had with that great multitude at the waters of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rom. So after this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious victory of Christ and his church over their enemies, over the chief powers of Satan's kingdom, they shall destroy that kingdom and all those cities and countries to which they belonged. After this the word of God shall have a speedy and swift progress through the earth; as it is said, that on the pouring out of the seventh vial, the cities of the nations fell, and every island fled away, and the mountains were not found," Rev. xvi.19 20. When once the stone cut out of the mountain without hands had broken the image in pieces, it was easy to abolish all remains of it. The very wind will carry it away as the chaff of the summer threshing floor. Because Satan's visible kingdom on earth shall now be destroyed, therefore it is said, that the seventh vial, by which this shall be done, shall be poured out into the air; which is represented in scripture as the special seat of his kingdom; for he is called <hi>the prince of the power of the air,</hi> Eph. ii.2. Now is come the time of punishing Leviathan, that piercing serpent, of which we read in Is. xxvii.1. "In that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword, shall punish Leviathan the piercing serpent, even Leviathan, that crooked serpent, and he shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

"And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one Lord, and his name one." Then shall be abolished all superstitious ways of worship, and all shall agree in worshipping God in his own ways: Jer. xxxii.39. "And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them."</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) The kingdom of Antichrist shall be utterly overthrown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His kingdom and dominion has been much brought down already by the vial poured out on his throne in the Reformation; but then it shall be utterly destroyed. Then shall be proclaimed, "Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon is fallen, is fallen." When the seventh angel sounds, "the time, times and half, shall be out, and the time shall be no longer." Then shall be accomplished concerning Antichrist the things which are written in the 18th chapter of Revelation of the spiritual Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, that great city Rome, or the idolatrous Roman government, that has for so many ages been the great enemy of the Christian church, first under Heathenism, then under Popery; that proud city which lifted herself up to heaven, and above God himself in her pride and haughtiness; that cruel, bloody city, shall come down to the ground. Then shall that be fulfilled, Is. xxvi.5.

However ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate they have been now for above 1700 years in their rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ, and instances of the conversion of any of that nation have been so very rare ever since the destruction of Jerusalem, but they have against the plain teachings of their own prophets, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to approve of the cruelty of their forefathers in crucifying Christ; yet when this day comes, the thick vail that blinds their eyes shall be removed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 Cor. iii.16.; and divine grace shall melt and renew their hard hearts, "and they shall look on him whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness as one that is in bitterness for his first born," Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And there are also many passages of the Old Testament which cannot be interpreted in any other sense, which I cannot now stand to mention. Besides the prophecies of the calling of the Jews, we have a remarkable seal of the fulfilment of this great event in providence, by a thing which is a kind of continual miracle, viz. their being preserved a distinct nation in such a dispersed condition for above 1600 years. The world affords nothing else like it. There is undoubtedly a remarkable hand of providence in it. When they shall be called, then shall that ancient people, that were alone God's people for so long a time, be God's people again, never to be rejected more: they shall then be gathered into one fold together with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; and so also shall the remains of the ten tribes, wherever they be, and though they have been rejected much longer than the Jews, be brought in with their brethren the Jews. The prophecies of Hosea especially seem to hold this forth, that in the future glorious
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:017525_0262_0FA127DB2D8C1C48"/>
times of the church, both Judah and Ephraim, or Judah and the ten tribes, shall be brought in together, and shall be united as one people, as they formerly were under David and Solomon; as Hos. i.11.; and so in the last chapter of Hosea, and other parts of his prophecy.</p>
                     <p>Though we do not know the time in which this conversion of the nation of Israel will come to pass; yet thus much we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine by scripture, that it will be before the glory of the Gentile part of the church shall be fully accomplished; because it is said, that their coming in shall be life from the dead to the Gentiles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rom. xi.12.15.</p>
                     <p n="5">(5) Then shall also Satan's Heathenish kingdom be overthrown. Gross Heathenism now possesses a great part of the earth, and there are supposed to be more heathens now in the world, than of all other professions taken together, Jews, Mahometans, or Christians. But then the Heathen nations shall be enlightened with the glorious gospel. There will be a wonderful spirit of pity towards them, and zeal for their instruction and conversion put into multitudes, and many shall go forth and carry the gospel unto them; and then shall the joyful sound be heard among them, and the Sun of righteousness shall then arise with his glorious light shining on those many vast regions of the earth that have been covered with Heathenish dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for many thousand years, many of them doubless ever since the times of Moses and Abraham, and have lain thus long in a miserable condition, under the cruel tyranny of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, who has all this while blinded and befooled them, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neered over them, and made a prey of them from generation to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Now the glad tidings of the gospel shall found there, and they shall be brought out of darkness into marvellous light.</p>
                     <p>It is promised, that Heathenism shall thus be destroyed in many places. God has said, That the gods that have not made these heavens and this earth, shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens, Jer. x.11. and that he will utterly abolish idols, Is. ii.18.— Then shall the many nations of Africa, the nations of negroes, and other Heathens who chiefly fill that quarter of the world, who now seem to be in a state but little above the beasts, and in many respects much below them, be enlightened with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious light, and delivered from all their darkness, and shall become a civil, Christian, understanding, and holy people.

Now shall the promise made to Abraham be fulfilled, That "in him and in his seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed;" and Christ now shall become the desire of all nations, agreeable to Haggai ii.7. Now the kingdom of Christ shall in the most strict and literal sense be extended to all nations, and the whole earth. There are many passages of scripture that can be understood in no other sense. What can be more universal than that in Is. xi.9. "For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea." As much as to say, As there is no part of the channel or cavity of the sea any where, but what is covered with water; so there shall be no part of the world of mankind but what shall be covered with the knowledge of God. So it is foretold in Is. xlv.22. that all the ends of the earth shall look to Christ, and be saved. To show that the words are to understood in the most universal sense, it is said in the next verse, "I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, that unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear."</p>
                     <p>So the most universal expression is used, Dan. vii.27. "And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High God." You see the expression includes <hi>all</hi> under the <hi>whole heaven.</hi>

                        </gap> Rev. xvi.15. There, after the sixth vial, and after the devil's armies were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together to their great battle, and just before Christ's glorious victory over them, it is said, "Behold I come quickly; blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments." So it is called <hi>Christ's coming</hi> in 2 Thes. ii 8. Speaking of Antichrist, it is said, "And then shall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming." See also Dan. vii.13.14. where Christ's coming to set up his kingdom on earth, and to destroy Antichrist, is called <hi>with clouds of heaven.</hi> And this is more like Christ's last coming to judgement, than any of the preceding dispensations which are so called, on these accounts.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1) That the dispensation is so much greater and more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, and so more like the day of judgement, which respects the whole world.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) On account of the great spiritual resurrection there will be of the church of God accompanying it, more resembling the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral resurrection, at the end of the world than any other. This spiritual resurrection, is the resurrection spoken of as attended with judgement, Rev. xx.4.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3) Because of the terrible judgements and fearful destruction which shall now be executed on God's enemies. There will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less at the introducing of this dispensation be a visible and awfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Then shall this cruel persecuting church suffer those judgements from God, which shall be far more dreadful than her cruelest persecutions of the saints, agreeable to Rev. xviii.6.7.— The judgements which God shall execute on the enemies of the church, are so great, that they are compared to God's sending great hail-stones from heaven upon them, every one of the weight of a talent, as it is said on the pouring out of the seventh vial,
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:017525_0265_0FA127DE2DCAAFD0"/>
Rev. xvi.21. "And their fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent; and men blaphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med God, because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great." Now shall be that treading of the wine-press spoken of, Rev. xiv.19.20.</p>
                     <p n="4">(4) This shall put an end to the church's suffering state, and shall be attended with their glorious and joyful praises. The church's afflicted state is long, being continued, excepting some short intermissions, from the resurrection of Christ to this time. But now shall a final end be put to her suffering state. Indeed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this near the end of the world, the church shall be greatly threatened; but it is said, it shall be but for a little season, Rev. xx.3.: for at the times of the church's rest are but short, before the long day o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> her afflictions are at an end: so whatever afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on she may suffer after this, it will be very short; but otherwise the day of the church's affliction and persecution shall now come to a final end. The scriptures, in many places, speak of this time as the end of the suffering state of the church. So Is li.22. God says to his church with respect to this time, "Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury, thou shalt no more drink it again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" Then shall that be proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the church, Is. xl.1.2. "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins." Also that in Is. liv.8.9 belongs to this time. And so that in Is. lx.20. "The Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended." And so Zeph iii.15. "The Lord hath taken away thy judgements, and hath cast out thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: the King of Israel, even the Lord, is in the midst of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thee: thou shalt not see evil any more."</p>
                     <p>The time which had been before this, had been the church's sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein she sowed in tears and in blood; but now is her harvest, wherein she will come again rejoicing, bringing her sheaves with her. Now the time of the travail of the woman clothed with the sun is at an end: now she hath brought forth her son; for this glorious setting up of the kingdom of Christ through the world, is what the church had been in travail for, with such terrible pangs for so many ages: Is. xxvi.17. "Like as a woman with child draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O Lord" See Is. lx 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lxi.10.11. — And now the church shall forget her sorrow, since a manchild is born into the world: now succeed her joyful praise and triumph. Her praises shall then go up to God

from all parts of the earth; as Is: xlii.10.11.12. And praise shall not only fill the earth, but also heaven. The church on earth, and the church in heaven, shall both gloriously rejoice and praise God, as with ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> will be in Is xliv.23. "Sing, O ye heavens, for the Lord hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel." See what joyful praises are sung to God on this occasion by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal church in heaven and earth, in the beginning of the 19th chapter of Revelation.</p>
                     <p n="5">(5) This dispensation is above all preceding ones like Christ's coming to judgement, in that it so puts an end to the former state of the world, and introduces the everlasting kingdom of Christ. Now Satan's visible kingdom shall be overthrown, after it had stood ever since the building of Babel; and the old heavens and the old earth shall in a greater measure be passed away then than before, and the new heavens and the new earth set up in a far more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner than ever before.</p>

                     <p>SECONDLY, To show how the success of redemption will be carried on through that space wherein the Christian church shall for the most part be in a state of peace and prosperity. In order to this, I would,</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Of the great apostasy there shall be towards the close of it: how greatly then the church shall be threatened by her enemies for a short time.</p>

                     <p n="1">(1) It will be a time of great light and knowledge. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent days are days of darkness, in comparison of those days. The light of that glorious time shall be so great, that it is represented as though there should then be no night, but only day; no evening nor darkness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So Zech. xiv.6.7. "And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark. But it shall be one day, which shall be known to the Lord, not day, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light." —It is further represented, as though God would then give such light to his church, that it should so much exceed the glory of the light of the sun and moon, that they should be ashamed: Is. xxiv.23. "Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the Lord of hosts shall reign in Mount Zion, and in Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and before his ancients gloriously."</p>
                     <p>There is a kind of a vail now cast over the greater part of the world, which keeps them in darkness: but then this vail shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed: Is. xxv.7.

Difficulties in scripture shall then be cleared up, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things shall be discovered in the word of God, which were never discovered before. The great discovery of those things in religion which had been before kept hid, seems to be compared to removing the vail, and discovering the ark of the testimony to the people, which before used to be kept in the secret part of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and was never seen by them. Thus, at the sounding of the seventh angel, when it is proclaimed, "that the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ;" it is added that "the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament." So great shall be the increase of knowledge in this time, that heaven shall be as it were opened to the church of God on earth.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) It shall be a time of great holiness. Now vital religion shall every where prevail and reign. Religion shall not be an empty profession, as it now mostly is, but holiness of heart and life shall abundantly prevail. Those times shall be an exception from what Christ says of the ordinary state of the church, viz. that there shall be but few saved; for now holiness shall become gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: Is. lx.21. "Thy people also shall be all righteous." Not that there will be none remaining in a Christless condition; but that visible wickedness shall be suppressed every where, and true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness shall become general, though not universal.

"There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old, but the sinner being an hundred years old, shall be accursed."

And so Zech. xiv.20.21. — as God's people then shall be eminent in holiness of heart, so they shall be also in holiness of life and practice.</p>

It shall be had in great esteem and honor. The saints have hitherto for the most part been kept under, and wicked men have governed. But now they will be uppermost.

The great men of the world, and the rich merchants and others who have great wealth and influence, shall devote all to Christ and his church: Psal. xlv.12.

                     <p n="2">II. I now come to speak of the great apostasy there shall be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the close of this period, and how imminently the church shall be for a short time thre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tened by her enemies. This I shall do under three particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A little before the end of the world, there shall be a very great apostasy, wherein great part of the world shall fall away from Christ and his church. It is said in Rev. xx.3. that Satan should be cast into the bottomless pit, and shut up, and have a seal set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that he should deceive the nations no more till the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years should be fulfilled; and that after that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e must be loosed out of his prison for a little season. Accordingly we are told, in the 7th and 8th verse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, that when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and should go forth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the nations, which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog. Which seems to show as though the apostasy would be very general The nations of the four quarters of the earth shall be deceived; and the number of those who shall now turn enemies to Christ shall be vastly great, as the army of Gog and Magog is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>kiel, and as it is said in Rev. xx.8. that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them is as the sand of the sea, and that they went upon the bread<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h of the earth, as though they were an army big enough to reach from one side of the earth to the other.</p>
                     <p>Thus after such an happy and glorious season, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> day of light and holiness, of love, and peace, and joy, now it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> again to be a dark time. Satan shall begin to set up his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion again in the world. This world shall again become a scene of darkness and wickedness. The bottomless pit of hell shall be opened, and devils shall come up again out of it, and a dreadful smoke shall ascend to darken the world. The church of Christ, instead of extending to the utmost bounds of the world, as it did before, shall be reduced to narrow limits again. The world of mankind being continued so long in a state of such great prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, shall now begin to abuse their prosperity, to serve their lust and corruption. This we learn from Luke xvii.26 &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Those apostates shall make great opposition to the church of God. The church shall seem to be imminently threatened with a sudden and entire overthrow by them. It is said, Satan shall gather them together to battle, as the sand on the sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>shore; and they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city. So that this beloved city shall seem just ready to be swallowed up by them: for her enemies
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:017525_0273_0FA127E4ED4BE2E0"/>
shall not only threaten her, but shall actually have gathered together against her; and not only so, but shall have besieged her, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> have compassed her about on every side.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing in the prophecy which seems to hold forth as though the church had actually fallen into their hands, as the church had fallen into the hands of Antichrist, to whom it was given to make war with the saints, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them. God will never suffer this to be again after the fall of Antichrist; for then the day of her mourning shall be ended. But the church shall seem most eminently threatened with utter and sudden destruction.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Now the state of things will seem most remarkably to call for Christ's immediate appearance to judgement. For them the world shall be filled with the most aggravated wickedness that ever it was. For much the greater part of the world shall have become visibly wicked and open enemies to Christ, and their wickedness shall be dreadfully aggravated by their apostasy. Before the fall of Antichrist, most of the world was full of visi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ly wicked men. But the greater part of these are poor Heathens, who never enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the light of the gospel; and others are those that have been bred up in the Mahometan or P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pish darkness. But these are those that have apostatised from the Christian church, and the visible king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ, in which they enjoyed the great light and privileges of the glorious times of the church, which shall be incomparably greater than the light and privileges which the church of God enjoys now. This apos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>y will be most like the apostasy of the devils of any that ever had before been: for the devils apostatised, and turned enemies to Christ, tho' they enjoyed the light of heaven; and these will apostatise, and turn enemies to him, though they have enjoyed the light and privileges of the glorious times of the church. That such should turn open and avowed enemies to Christ, and should s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ck the ruin of his church, will cry aloud for such immediate ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance as was executed on the devils when they fell.</p>
                     <p>The wickedness of the world will remarkably call for Christ's immediate appearing in flaming fire to take vengeance on them, because of the way in which they shall manifest their wickedness, which will be by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        </gap>spheming Christ and his holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and particularly, they will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> at the notion of Christ's coming to judgement, of which the church shall be in expectation, and of which they will warn them. For now doubtless will be another fulfilment, and the greatest fulfilment, of 2 Pet. iii 3.4. "Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last day sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>, and saying. Where is the promise of his coming? For since the fathers fell a sleep, all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the beginning of the creation." They shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> in no expectation of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oming of Christ to judgement, and
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:017525_0274_0FA127E5AE3DB520"/>
shall laugh at the notion. They shall trample all such things under foot, and shall give up themselves to their lusts, or to eat and drink, and wallow in sensual delights, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> though they were to be here for ever. They shall despise the warnings the church shall give them of the coming of Christ to judgement, as the people of the old world despised what Noah told them of the approaching flood, and as the people of Sodom did when Lot said to them, "The Lord will destroy this city." Their wickedness on this account will cry aloud to heaven for Christ's appearing in flaming fire to take vengeance of his enemies; and also because another way that they shall exercise their wickedness will be in the wicked design and violent attempt they shall be engaged in against the holy city of God, against that holy city, wherein lately, and for so long a time, so much of the religion of Christ had been seen. They shall then be about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate the most horrid design against this church.</p>
                     <p>The numerousness of the wicked that shall then be, is another thing which shall especially call for Christ's coming: for the world will doubtless then be exceeding full of people, having continued so long in so great a state of prosperity, without such terrible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solating extremities, as wars, pestilences, and the like, to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them. The most of this world, which shall be so populous, will be such wicked contemptuous apostates from God. Undoubtedly that will be a day wherein the world will be by far fuller of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness than ever before it was from the foundation of it. And if the wickedness of the old world, when men began to multiply on the earth, called for the destruction of the world by a deluge of waters, this wickedness will as much call for its destruction by a deluge of fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e.</p>
                     <p>Again, the circumstances of the church at that day will also em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inently call for the immediate appearing of Christ, as they will be compassed about by their blasphemous murderous enemies, just ready to be swallowed up by them. And it will be a most distressing time with the church, excepting the comfort they will have in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> hope of deliverance from God: for all other help will seem to fail. The case will be come to the last extremity, and there will be an immediate need that Chris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> should come to their deliverance. Tho' the church shall be so eminently threatened, yet so will Providence order it, that it shall be preserved till Christ shall appear in his immediate presence, coming in the glory of his Father with all his holy angels. Then will come the time when all the elect shall be gathered in. That work of conversation which has been carried on from the beginning of the church after the fall through all those ages, shall be carried on no more. There never shall another soul be converted. Every one of those many millions, whose name, were written in the book of life before the foundation of the worlds
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:017525_0275_0FA127E66D798290"/>
shall be brought in; not one soul shall be lost. The mystical body of Christ, which has been growing since it first began in the days of Adam, will be complete as to number of parts, having every one of its members. In this respect, the work of redemption will now be finished. And now the end for which the means of grace have been instituted shall be obtained. All that effect which was intended to be accomplished by them shall now be accomplished.</p>

                     <head>SECT. II.</head>
                     <p>THUS I have shown how the success of Christ's redemption has been accomplished during the continuance of the Christian church under the means of grace. We have seen what great revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions there have been and are to be, during this space of time; how the great wheels of providence have gone round for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of that kind of success of Christ's purchase, which consists in the bestowment of grace on the elect: and we are, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of the subject, come to the time when all the wheels have gone round; the course of things in this state of it is finished, and all things are ripe for Christ's coming to judgement.</p>
                     <p>You may remember, that when I began to discourse of this third proposition, viz. That from the resurrection of Christ to the end of the world, the whole time is taken up in procuring the success and effect of Christ's purchase of redemption, I observed, that the success of Christ's purchase is of two kinds, consist-either in grace or glory; and that the success consisting in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of these, is to be seen in those works of God which are wrought during those ages that the church is continued under the means of grace; and that the success, consisting in the latter, will chiefly be accomplished at the day of judgement.</p>
                     <p>Having already shown how the former kind of success has been accomplished, I come now, in the second place, to the latter, viz. that kind of success which is accomplished in the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>owment of glory on the church, which shall chiefly be bestowed on the church at the day of judgement.—Here I would mention two o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> three things in the general concerning this kind of success of Christ's purchase.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. How great the success of Christ's purchase is, chiefly appears in this. The success of Christ's purchase does summarily consist in the salvation of the elect. But this bestowment of glory is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently called <hi>their salvation</hi>: Heb. ix.28. "To them that look for him, shall he appear the second time, without sin unto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation". — So it is called <hi>redemption,</hi> being eminently tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> wherein the redemption of the church consists. So in Eph. iv.30. "Sealed unto the day of redemption;" and Luke xxi.28. and Eph. i.14. "Redemption of the purchased possession."</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="271" facs="unknown:017525_0276_0FA127E8A85CD320"/>2. All that is before this, while the church is under the means of grace, is only to make way for the success which is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished in the bestowment of glory. The means of grace are to fit for glory; and God's grace itself is bestowed on the elect to make them meet for glory.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. All those glorious things which were brought to pass for the church while under the means of grace, are but images <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd shadows of this. So were those glorious things which were accomplished for the church in the days of Constantine the Great; and so is all that glory which is to be accomplished in the glorious times of the church which are to succeed the fall of Antichrist. As great as it is, it is all but a shadow of what will be bestowed at the day of judgement; and therefore, as I have already often observed, all those preceding events, by which God wrought glorious things for his church, are spoken of in scripture as images of Christ's last coming to judgement.</p>
                     <p>But I hasten more particularly to show how this kind of success of Christ's purchase is accomplished.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Christ will appear in the glory of his Father, with all his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly angels, coming in the clouds of heaven. When the world is thus revelling in their wickedness, and compassing the holy city about, just ready to destroy it, and when the church is reduced to such a great strait, then shall the glorious Redeemer appear. He through whom this redemption has all along been carried on, he shall appear in the sight of the world; the light of his glory shall break forth; the whole world shall immediately have notice of it, and they shall lift up their eyes and behold this wonderful sight. It is said, "Every eye shall see him," Rev. i.7—Christ shall appear coming in his human nature, in that fame body which was brought forth in a stable, and laid in a manger, and which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was so cruelly used, and nailed to the cross.</p>
                     <p>Men shall now lift up their eyes, and see him coming in such majesty and glory as now is to us utterly inconceivable.

                     <p>Now the work of redemption shall be finished in another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, viz. that all the elect shall now be actually redeemed in both soul and body. Before this, the work of redemption, as to its actual success, was but incomplete and imperfect; for only the souls or the redeemed were actually saved and glorified, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in some few instances: but now all the bodies of the saints shall be saved and glorified together; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Now shall the whole church of saints be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and all wicked men and devils shall be arrainged before the judgement seat. When the dead saints are raised, then the whole church, consisting of all the elect through all ages, will be standing together on the face of the earth, at least all excepting those few whose bodies were glorified before; and then they shall all mount up as with wings in the air to meet Christ: for it seems that Christ, when he comes to judgement, will not come quite down to the ground, but his throne will be fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the air, in the region of the clouds, whence he may be seen by all that vast multitude that shall be gathered before him. The church of saints therefore shall be taken up from the earth to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend up to their Saviour. Thus the apostle tells us, that when the dead in Christ are raised, and the living changed, then those who are alive and remain, shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air, and so shall we be ever with the Lord, 1 Thes. iv.16 17. What a wonderful sight will that be, when all the many millions of saints are seen thus mounting up from all parts of the world!</p>
                     <p>Then shall the work of redemption be finished in another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect: then shall the whole church be perfectly and for ever deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this present evil world, for ever forsake this cursed ground: they shall take their everlasting leave of this earth, where they have been strangers, and which has been for the most part such a scene of their troubles and sorrow; where the devil for the most part has reigned as god, and has greatly molested them, and which has been such a scene of wickedness and abomination; where Christ their

Lord has been cruelly used; and where they have been so hated, and reproached, and persecuted, from age to age, through most of the ages of the world. They shall leave it under foot to go to Christ, and never shall set <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oot on it again. And there shall be an everlasting separation made between them and wicked men. Before they were mixed together, and it was impossible in many instances to determine which were which; but now all shall become visible; both saints and sinners shall appear in their true characters.</p>
                     <p>Then shall all the church be seen flowing together in the air to the place where Christ shall have fixed his throne, coming from the east and west, and north and south, to the right hand of Christ. What a mighty cloud of them then will there be, when all that ever have been of the church of God, all that were before Christ, all that multitude of saints that were in the apostles time, and all that were in the days of Constantine the Great, and all that were before and since the Reformation, and also all that great multitude of saints that shall be in all the glorious times of the church, when the whole earth shall for so many generations be full of saints, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so all that shall be then living when Christ shall come; I say, what a cloud of them will there be, when all these are seen flocking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the region of the clouds at the right hand of Christ!</p>
                     <p>Then also the work of redemption will be finished in another respect, viz. that then the church shall all be gathered together. They all belonged to one society before, but yet were greatly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated with respect to the place of their habitation; some being in heaven, and some on earth; and those who were on earth together were separated one from another, many of them by wide oceans, and vast continents. But now they shall all be gathered together, never to be separated any more. Not only shall all the members of the church now be gathered together, but all shall be gathered unto their Head, into his immediate glorious presence, never to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from him any more. This never came to pass till now.</p>
                     <p>At the same time, all wicked men and devils shall be brought before the judgement seat of Christ. These shall be gathered to the left hand of Christ, and, as it seems, will still remain upon the earth, and shall not be caught up into the air, as the saints shall be. The devil, that old serpent, shall now be dragged up out of hell. <hi>He,</hi> that first procured the fall and misery of mankind, and has so set himself against their redemption, and has all along shown him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self such an inveterate enemy to the Redeemer; now he shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more have any thing to do with the church of God, or be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the least to afflict or molest any member of it any more for ever. Instead of that, now he must be judged, and receive the due reward of his deeds. Now is come the time which he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways dreaded, and trembled at the thought of; the time wherein he
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:017525_0281_0FA127EBADBE6B30"/>
must be judged, and receive his full puishment. He who by his temptation malicously procured Christ's crucifiction, and triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it, as though he had obtained the victory, even <hi>he</hi> shall see the consequences of the death of Christ which he procured: for Christ's coming to judge him in his human nature is the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it; for Christ obtained and purchased this glory to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by that death. Now he must stand before that same Jesus whose death he procured, to be judged, condemned, and eternally destroyed by him. If Satan, the prince of hell, trembles at the thought of it thousands of years beforehand, how much more will he tremble, as proud and as stubborn as he is, when he comes to stand at Christ's bar!</p>
                     <p>Then shall he also stand at the bar of the saints, whom he has so hated, and afflicted, and molested: for the saints shall judge him with Christ: 1 Cor. vi.3 "Know ye not that we shall judge angels?" Now shall he be as it were subdued under the church's feet, agreeable to Rom. xvi.20 — Satan, when he first tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our first parents to fall, deceitfully and lyingly told them, that they should be gods: but little did he think that the consequence should be, that they should indeed be so much as gods, as to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors with God to judge him. Much less did he think, that that consequence would follow, that one of that nature which he then tempted, one of the posterity of those persons whom he tempted, should actually be united to God, and that as God he should judge the world, and that he himself must stand trembling and astonished before his judgement-seat. But thus all the devils in hell, who have so opposed Christ and his kingdom, shall now at last stand in utmost amazement and horror before Christ and his church, who shall appear to condemn them.</p>
                     <p>Now also shall all Christ's other enemies be brought to appear before him. Now shall wicked proud scribes and Pharisees, who had such a malignant hatred of Christ while in this state of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and who persecuted Christ to death, those before whose judgement-seat Christ was once called and stood, as a malafactor at their ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They shall stand before his judgement-seat with inconceivable hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and amazement, with ghastly countenances, and quaking limbs, and chattering teeth, and knees smiting one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>Now also all the cruel enemies and persecutors of the church that have been in all ages, shall come in sight together. Pharaoh and the Egyptians, Antiochus Epiphanes, and the persecuting scribes

and Pharisees, the persecuting Heathen emperors, Julian the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postate, the cruel persecuting Popes and Papists, Gog and Magog, shall all appear at once before the judgement-seat of Christ. They and the saints who have in every age been persecuted by them, shall come in sight one of another, and must confront one another now before the great Judge. Now shall the saints on their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thrones be made the judges of those unjust kings and rulers who have before judged and condemned them, and cruelly put them to death. Now shall those persecutor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thus wonderfully will the face of things be altered from what used to be in the former times of the world; now will all things be coming to rights.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The righteousness of the church shall be manifested, and all the wickedness of their enemies shall be brought to light. Those saints who had been the objects of hatred, reproach, and contempt in the world, and were reviled and condemned by their persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors without cause, shall now be fully vindicated. They shall now appear clothed with the glorious robe of Christ's righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. It shall be most manifest before the world, that Christ's righteousness is theirs and they shall as it were gloriously shine forth in it. Then also shall their inherent holiness be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, and all their good works shall be brought to light. The good things which they did in secret shall now be manifested openly. Those holy ones of God, who had been treated as though they were the filth and offscouring of the earth, as though they were not fit to live upon earth, as worse than beasts or devils, shall now, when things shall appear as they are, appear to have been the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of the earth. Now God will bring forth their righteousness as the light, and their judgement as the noon-day. Now it shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear who were those wicked persons that were not fit to live, when all the wickedness of the enemies of Christ and his church, their pride, their malice, their cruelty, their hatred of true religion, shall be set forth in all the horrid acts of it, and with all its aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in its proper colours.</p>
                     <p>Now the righteous may be heard before this great Judge, who could not be heard before those unjust judges. Now they shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their cause, and shall rise up in judgement against their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors, and shall declare how they have been treated by them. Now all the wickedness of the wicked of the whole world shall be brought to light. All their secret wickedness, and their very hearts, shall be opened to the view, and as it were turned inside

Christ, the glorious judge, shall pass that blessed sentence on the church at his right hand, "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." This sentence shall be pronounced with infinite love, and the voice will be most sweet, causing every heart to flow with joy. Thus Christ shall pronounce a sentence of justification on thousands and millions, who have before had a sentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation passed upon them by their persecuting rulers. He will thus put honor upon those who have been before despised: he will own them for his, and will as it were put a crown of glory upon their heads before the world; and then shall they shine forth as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Then shall the sentence of condemnation be passed on the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." Thus shall the church's enemies be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; in which sentence of condemnation, the holy martyrs, who have suffered from them, shall concur. When the words of this sentence are pronounced, they will strike every heart of those at the left hand with inconceivable horror and amazement Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry syllable of it will be more terrible than a stream of lightning through their hearts. We can conceive but very little of those signs and expressions of horror which there will be upon it, of shrieking, quaking, gnashing of teeth, distortions of countenance, hideous looks, hideous actions, and hideous voices, through all that vast throng.</p>

When they are gone, this world shall be set on fire, and be turned into a great furnace, wherein all the enemies of Christ and his church shall be tormented for ever and ever. This is manifest by 2 Pet. iii.7. "But the heavens and the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgement, and perdition of ungodly men." When Christ and his church are ascended to a distance from this world, that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable company of wicked being left behind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to have their sentence executed upon them here, then, some way or other, this whole lower world shall be set on fire, either by fire from heaven, or by fire breaking out of the bowels of the earth, or both, as it was with the water in the time of the deluge. However, this lower world shall be set all on fire.— How will it strike the wicked with horror, when the fire begins to lay hold upon them, and they find no way to escape it, or flee or hide from it!

So fierce shall be its heat, that it shall burn the earth into its very centre: which seems to be what is meant, Deut. xxxii.22.

Here the bodies of all the wicked shall burn, and be tormented to all eternity, and never be consumed; and the wrath of God shall be poured out on their souls. Though the souls of the wicked in hell do now suffer dreadful punishment, yea their punishment will be increased at the day of judgement, that what they suffered before, is, in comparison of it, as an imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the execution which follows it.

At the same time, all the church shall enter with Christ, their glorious Lord, into the highest heaven, and there shall enter on the state of their highest and eternal blessedness and glory.

And when Christ shall bring his church into his Father's house in heaven, after the judgement, he shall bring her thither as his bride, having there presented her, whom he loved, and gave himself for, to himself without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing.</p>
                     <p>The bridegroom and the bride shall then enter into heaven, both having on their wedding-robes, attended with all the glorious angels. And there they enter on the feast and joys of their marriage before the Father; they shall then begin an everlasting wedding-day. This shall be the day of the gladness of Christ's heart, wherein he will greatly rejoce, and all the saints shall rejoice with them. Christ shall rejoice over his bride, and the bride shall rejoice in her husband, in the state of her consummate and everlasting blessedness, of which we have a particular description in the 21st and 22d chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Revelation.</p>
                     <p>Now the whole work of redemption is finished. We have seen how it has been carried on from the fall of man to this time. But now it is complete with respect to all that belongs to it. Now the top stone of the building is laid. In the progress of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course on this subject, we have followed the church of God in all the great changes, all her tossings to and fro that she has been sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, in all the storms and tempests through the many ages of the world, till at length we have seen an end to all these storms. We have seen her enter the harbour, and landed in the highest heavens, in complete and eternal glory, in all her members, soul and body. We have gone through time, and the several ages of it, as the providence of God, and the word of God, have led us; and now we have issued into eternity after time shall be no more. We have seen all the church's enemies fixed in endless misery, and have seen the church presented in her perfect redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the Father in heaven, there to enjoy this most unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and inconceivable glory and blessedness; and there we leave her to enjoy this glory throughout the never ending ages of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                     <p>Now all Christ's enemies will be perfectly put under his feet, and and he shall have his most perfect triumph over sin and Satan, and all his instruments, and death, and hell. Now shall all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses made to Christ by God the Father before the foundation of the world, the promises of the covenant of redemption, be fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished.

Christ shall now perfectly have obtained the joy that was set before him, for which he undertook those great sufferings which he underwent in his state of humiliation. Now shall all the hopes and expectations of the saints be fulfilled. The state of things that the church was in before, was a progressive and preparatory state: but now she is arrived to her most perfect state of glory. All the glory of the glorious times of the church on earth is but a faint shadow of her consummate glory in heaven.</p>

"And I saw a new heaven, and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away."—Now will the great Redeemer have perfected every thing that appertains to the work of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which we began so soon after the fall of man. And who can conceive of the triumph of those praises which shall be sung in heaven on this great occasion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so much greater than that of the fall of Antichrist, which occasions such praises as we have described in the 19th chapter of Revelation! The beloved disciple John seems to want expressions to describe those praises, and says, "It was as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, saying, Alleluia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth." But much more inexpressible will those praises be, which will be sung in heaven after the final consummation of all things. How shall the praises of that vast and glorious multitude be as mighty thunderings indeed.</p>
                     <p>Now how are all the former things passed away, and what a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious state are things fixed in to remain to all eternity! — As Christ, when he first entered upon the work of redemption after the fall of man, had the kingdom committed to him of the Father, and took on himself the administration of the affairs of the universe, to manage all so as to subserve the purposes of this affair; so now, the work being finished, he will deliver up the kingdom to God even the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 Cor. xv.24 "Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule, and all authority and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er."

that which shall not be destroyed." But the meaning is, that Christ shall deliver up that kingdom or dominion which he has over the world, as the Father's delegate or vicegerent, which the Father committed to him, to be managed in subserviency to this great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of redemption.

               <p>I PROCEED now to enter upon some improvement of the whole that has been said from this doctrine.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Hence we may learn how great a work this work of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is. We have now had it in a very imperfect manner set forth before us, in the whole progress of it, from its first beginning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fall, to the end of the world, when it is finished. We have seen how God has carried on this building from the first foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, by a long succession of wonderful works, advancing it higher and higher from one age to another, till the top-stone is laid at the end of the world. Now let us consider how great a work this is. Do men, when they behold some great palaces or churches, sometimes admire their magnificence, and are almost astonished to consider how great a piece of work it was to build such an house? then how well may we admire the greatness of this building of God, which he builds up age after age, by a series of such great things which he brings to pass! There are three things that have been exhibited to us in what has been said, which do espicially show the greatness of the work of redemption.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The greatness of those particular events, and dispensations of providence, by which it is accomplished. How great are those things which God has done, which are but so many parts of this great work! What great things were done in the world to prepare the way for Christ's coming to purchase, and what great things were done in the purchase of redemption! What a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing was that which was accomplished to put Christ in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate capacity for this purchase, viz, his incarnation, that God should become man! What great things were done in that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, that a person, who is the eternal Jehovah, should live upon earth four or give and thirty years together, in a mean despised condition, and that he should spend his life in such labors and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and that at last he should die on the cross! What great things have been done to accomplish the success of Christ's redemption! what great things to put him into a capacity to accomplish this suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess! For this purpose he rose from the dead, and ascended up into heaven, and all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were made subject to him. How
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:017525_0289_0FA127F26E068438"/>
many miracles have been wrought, what mighty revolutions have been brought to pass in the world already, and how much greater shall be brought to pass, in order to it!</p>
               <p n="2">2, The number of those great events by which God carries on this work, shows the greatness of the work. Those mighty revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions are so many as to fill up many ages. The particular won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful events by which the work of creation was carried on filled up six days: but the great dispensations by which the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is carried on, are so many, that they fill up six or seven thousand years at least, as we have reason to conclude from the word of God.—There were great things wrought in this affair before the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ood, and in the flood the world was once destroyed by water, and God's church was so wonderfully preserved from the flood in order to carry on this work. After the flood, what great things did God work relating to the resettling of the world, to the building of Babel, the dispersing of the nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the shortening of the days of man's life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the calling of Abraham, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and that long series of wonderful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences relating to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and Joseph, and those wonders in Egypt, and at the Red sea, and in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and in Canaan in Joshua's time, and by a long succession of wonderful providences from age to age towards the nation of the Jews!</p>
               <p>What great things were wrought by God, in so often overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world before Christ came, to make way for his coming! What great things were done also in Christ's time, and then after that in overturning Satan's kingdom in the Heathen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

How many great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things will be effected in accomplishing the glorious times of the church, and at Christ's last coming on the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the destruction of the world, and in carrying the whole church into heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The glorious issue of this whole affair, in the perfect and eternal destruction of the wicked, and in the consummate glory of the righteous. Now let us once more take a view of this build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now all is finished and the top-stone laid. It appeared in a glorious height in the apostles time, and much more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the time of Constantine, and will appear much more glorious still after the fall of Antichrist; but at the consummation of all things, it appears in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> immensely more glorious height than ever before. Now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t appears in its greatest magnificence, as a compleat lofty structure, whose top reaches to the heaven of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; a building worthy of the great God, the King of kings.</p>
               <p>From what has been said, one may argue, that the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is the greatest of all God's works of which we have any
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:017525_0290_0FA127F330FD2340"/>
notice, and it is the end of all his other works. It appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from what has been said, that this work is the principa of all God's works of providence, and that all other works of providence are reducible hither; they are all subordinate to the great affair of redemption. We see that all the revolutions in the world are to subserve this grand design; so that the work of redemption is, as it were, the sum of God's works of providence.</p>
               <p>This shows us how much greater the work of redemption is, than the work of creation: for I have several times observed, that the work of providence is greater than the work of creation, because it is the end of it; as the use of an house is the end of the building of the house. But the work of redemption, as I have just said, is the sum of all God's works of providence; all are subordinate to it: so the work of the new creation is more excellent than the old. So it ever is, that when one thing is removed by God to make way for another, the new one excels the old. Thus the temple excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the tabernacle; the new covenant the old; the new dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the gospel the dispensation of Moses; the throne of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid the throne of Saul; the priesthood of Christ the priesthood of Aaron: the new Jerusalem the old; and so the new creation far excels the old.</p>
               <p>God has used the creation which he has made, for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose but to subserve the designs of this affair. To answer this end, he hath created and disposed of mankind, to this the angels, to this the earth, to this the highest heavens. God created the world to provide a spouse and kingdom for his Son: and the setting up of the kingdom of Christ, and the spiritual marriage of the spouse to him, is what the whole creation labours and travails in pain to bring to pass. This work of redemption is so much the greatest of all the works of God, that all other works are to be looked upon either as parts of it, or appendages to it, and all are some way reducible to it; and so all the decrees of God do some way or other belong to that eternal covenant of redemption which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and the Son before the foundation of the world. Every decree of God is some way or other reducible to that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>Seeing this work of redemption is so great a work, hence we need not wonder that the angels desire to look into it. We need not wonder that so much is made of it in scripture, and that it is so much insisted on in the histories, and prophecies, and songs of the Bible; for the work of redemption is the great subject of the whole, of its doctrines, its promises, its types, its songs, its histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and its prophecies.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Hence we may learn how God is the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and ending of all things. Such are the character, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> titles we find often ascribed to God in scripture, in those place,
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:017525_0291_0FA127F3F283AFB8"/>
where the scripture speaks of the course of things, and series of events in providence: Is. xli.4.
<q>Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I the Lord the first, and with the last, I am he,</q>
And particularly does the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ascribe such titles to God, where it speaks of the providence of God, as it relates to, and is summed up in the great work of redemption; as Is xliv 6 7. and xlviii.12. with the context, beginning with the 9th verse. So God eminently appears as the first and the last, by considering the whole scheme of divine providence as we have considered it, viz. as all reducible to that one great work of redemption.</p>
               <p>Therefore, when Christ reveals the future great events of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence relating to his church and people, and this affair of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the end of the world, to his discipl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> John, he often reveals himself under this character. So Rev. i.8. "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord which, is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty." So again, verse 10.11. "I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last." Alpha and Omega are the names of the first and last letters of the Greek al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet, as <hi>A</hi> and Z are of ours; and therefore it signifies the same as his being the first and the last, and the beginning and the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Thus God is called in the beginning of this book of Revelation, before the course of the prophecy begins; and so again he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the end of it, after the course of events is gone through, and the final issue of things is seen: as Rev. xxi.6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end." And so chap. xxii.12 13. "And behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. I am Alpha and Omega, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and the end, the first and the last."</p>
               <p>We have seen how this is true in the course of what I have laid before you upon this subject. We have seen how things were from God in the beginning; on what design God began the course of his providence in the beginning of the generations of upon the earth; and we have seen how it is God that has all along carried things on agreeable to the same designs without ever failing; and how at last the conclusion and final issue of things are to God; and so we have seen how all things are of him, and through him, and to him; and therefore may well now cry out with the apostle, Rom. xi.33 "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgements, and his ways past finding out!" and vers. 36. "For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever, Amen."</p>

                  <pb n="287" facs="unknown:017525_0292_0FA127F4AEB945F0"/>We have seen how other things came to an end one after another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how states, and kingdoms, and empires, one after another, fell and came to nothing, even the greatest and strongest of them; we have seen how the world has been often overturned, and will be more remarkably overturned than ever it has been yet; we have seen how the world comes to an end, how it was first destroyed by water, and how at last it shall be utterly destroyed by fire: but yet God remains the same through all ages. He was before the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this course of things, and he will be after the end of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> agreeable to Psal. cii.25.26.—Thus God is he that is, and that was, and that is to come.</p>
               <p>We have seen, in a variety of instances, how all other gods perish: we have seen how the ancient gods of the Heathen in the nations abou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We have seen what mighty changes there have been in the world; but God is unchangeable, "the same yesterday, to day, and for ever."</p>
               <p>We began at the head of the stream of divine providence, and have followed and traced it through its various windings and turnings, till we are come to the end of it, and we see where it is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues. As it began in God, so it ends in God. God is the infinite ocean into which it empties itself.—Providence is like a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wheel, whose circumference is so high that it is dreadful, with the glory of the God of Israel above upon it; as it is represented in E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ekiel's vision. We have seen the revolution of this wheel, and how, as it was from God, so its return has been to God again. All the events of divine providence are like the links of a chain; the first link is from God and the last is to him.</p>
               <p n="3">III. We may see by what has been said, how Christ in all things has the pre-eminence. For this great work of redemption is all his work: he is the great Redeemer, and therefore the work of redemption being as it were the sum of God's works of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, this shows the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, as being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, and through all, and in all. That God intended the world for his Son's use in the affair of redemption, is one reason that is to be given why he created the world by him, which seems to be intimated by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>postle in Eph. iii.9.—12. What has been said, shows how all the purposes of God are purposed in
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:017525_0293_0FA127F56ECE5490"/>
Christ, and how he is before all and above all, and all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist by him, and are governed by him, and are for him, Colos. i.15 16.17.18. We see by what has been said, how God makes him his first born, higher than the kings of the earth, and sets his throne above their thrones; how God has always upheld his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, when the kingdoms of others have come to an end; how that appears at last above all, however greatly opposed for so many ages; how finally all other kingdoms fell, and his kingdom is the last kingdom and is a kingdom that never gives place to any other.</p>
               <p>We see, that whatever changes there are, and how ever highly Christ's enemies exalt themselves, that yet finally all his enemies become his footstool, and he reigns in uncontrouled power and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense glory: in the end his people are all perfectly saved and made happy, and his enemies all become his footstool.—And thus God gives the world to his Son for his inheritance.</p>
               <p n="4">IV Hence we may see what a consistent thing divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is. The consideration of what has been said, may greatly serve to show us the consistency, order, and beauty, of God's works of providence. If we behold the events of providence in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other view than that in which it has been set before us, it will all look like confusion, like a number of jumbled events coming to pass without any order or method, like the tossing of the waves of the sea; things will look as though one confused revolution came to pass after another, merely by blind chance, without any regular or certain end.</p>
               <p>But if we consider the events of providence in the light in which they have been set before us under this doctrine, in which the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures set them before us, they appear far from being jumbled and confused, an orderly series of events, all wisely ordered and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in excellent harmony and consistence,. tending all to one end. The wheels of providence are not turned round by blind chance, but they are full of eyes round about, as Ezekiel represents, and they are guided by the spirit of God: where the spirit goes, they go: and all God's works o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> providence through all ages meet in in one at last, as so many lines meeting in one centre.</p>
               <p>It is with God's work of providence, as it is with his work of creation; it is but one work. The events of providence, are not so many distinct, independent, works of providence, but they are rather so many different parts of one work of providence: it is all one work, one regular scheme. God's works of providence are not disunited and jumbled without connection or dependence, but are all united, just as several parts of one building: there are many stones, many pieces of timber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but all are so joined, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly formed together, that they make but one building: they have all but one foundation, and are united at last in one top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</p>

                  <pb n="289" facs="unknown:017525_0294_0FA127F62FDE8FF8"/>God's providence may not unfitly be compared to a large and long river, having innumerable branches, beginning in different regions, and at a great distance one from another, and all co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After their very diverse and contrary courses which they held for a while<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they all gather more and more together, the nearer they come to their common end, and all at length discharge themselves at one mouth into the same ocean.

A man who sees but one or two streams at a time, cannot tell what their course tends to. Their course seems very crooked, and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent streams seem to run for a while different and contrary ways: and if we view things at a distance, there seem to be innumerable obstacles and impediments in the way to hinder their ever uniting, and coming to the ocean, as rocks and mountains, and the like; but yet if we trace them, they all unite at last, and all come to the same issue, disgorging themselves in one into the same great ocean. No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From the whole that has been said, we may strongly argue, that the scriptures are the word of God, because they alone inform us what God is about, or what he aims at, in these works which he is doing in the world. God doubtless is pursuing some design, and carrying on some scheme, in the various changes and revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which from age to age came to pass in the world. It is most reasonable to suppose, that there is some certain great design to which Providence subordinates all the great successive changes in the affairs of the world which God has made.

Nothing else pretends to show, with any distinctness or certainty, how the world began at first, or to tell us the original of things. Nothing but the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures sets forth how God governed the world from the beginning of the generations of men upon earth, in an orderly history; and nothing else se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Reason shows, that it is fit and requisite, that the intelligent and rational beings of the world should know something of God's scheme and design in his works: for they doubtless are beings that are principally concerned. The thing that is God's great design in his works, is doubtless something concerning his reasonable creatures, rather than brute beasts and lifeless things. The revolution by which God's great design is brought to pass, are doubtless revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons chiefly among them, and which concern their state, and not the state of things without life or reason. And therefore surely it is requisite, that they should know something of it; especially seeing that reason teaches, that God has given his rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures reason, and a capacity of seeing God in his works; for this end, they see God's glory in them, and give him the glory of them. But how can they see God's glory in his works, if they do not know what God's design in them is, and what he aims at by what he is doing in the world?</p>
               <p>Further, it is fit that mankind should be informed something of God's design in the government of the world, because they are made capable of actively falling in with that design, and promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and acting herein as his friends and subjects; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reasonable to suppose, that God has given mankind some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to inform them of this: but there is nothing else that does it but the Bible. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">VI. From what has been said, we may see the glorious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and power of God in this affair of redemption: especially is God glorious in power. His glorious power appears in uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his church for so long a time, and carrying on this work; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding it oftentimes when it was but as a little spark of fire, or as smoking flax<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which the fire was almost gone out, and the power of earth and hell were combined to destroy it. Yet God has never suffered them to quench it, and finally will bring judgement forth unto victory God glorifies his strength in his church's weakness: in causing his people, who are like a number of little infants, finally to triumph over all earth and hell; so that they should tread on the lion and adder; the young lion and dragon shall they trample under foot. The glorious power of God appears in conquering his many and mighty enemies by that person who was once an infant in a manger, and appeared as a poor, weak, despised man. He conquers them, and triumphs over them in their own weapon, the cross.</p>
               <p>The glorious majesty of God appears in conquering all those mighty enemies of the church one age after another; in conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Satan, that proud and strong spirit, and all his hellish host; in bringing him down under foot, long after he had vaunted himself as god of this world, and when he did his utmost to support himself in his kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>God's power gloriously appears in conquering Satan when exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that strongest and most potent Heathen kingdom that ever he had, the Roman empire. Christ, our Michael, has overcome him and the devil was cast out, and there was found no more place for him in heaven; but he was cast out unto the earth, and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:017525_0297_0FA127F98EB1EAC8"/>
were cast out with him. Again, his power gloriously appears in conquering him in that kingdom wherein his pride, and subtlety, and cruelty, above all appears, viz. the kingdom of Antichrist. It gloriously appears in conquering him in that greatest and strongest combination and opposition of the devil and his adherents against Christ and his church, just before the fall of Antichrist, wherein his visible kingdom has a fatal blow given it, on which a universal downfall of it follows all over the world.</p>
               <p>The glorious power of God appears in thus conquering the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and bringing him under foot, time after time, after long time given him to strengthen himself to his utmost, as he was once o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown in his Heathen Roman empire, after he had been mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself strong in those parts of the world, ever since the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bel. It appears also in overthrowing his kingdom more fatally and universally all over the world, after he had again ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opportunity given him to strengthen himself to his utmost for many ages, by setting up those two great kingdoms of Antichrist and Mahomet, and to establish his interest in the Heathen world. We have seen how these kingdoms of God's enemies, that, before God appears, look strong, as tho' it was impossible to overthrow them; yet, time after time, when God appears, they seem to melt away, as the fat of lambs before the fire, and are driven away as the chaff before the whirlwind, or the smoke out of the chimney.</p>
               <p>Those mighty kingdoms of Antichrist and Mahomet, which have made such a figure for so many ages together, and have tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled the world under foot, when God comes to appear, will vanish away like a shadow, and will as it were disappear of themselves, and come to nothing as the darkness in a room does, when the light is brought in. What are God's enemies in his hands? How is their greatest strength weakness when he rises up! and how weak will they all appear together at the day of judgement! Thus we may apply those words in the song of Moses, Exod. xv.6. "Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in peices the enemy." How great doth the majesty of God appear in overturning the world from time to time, to accomplish his designs, and at last in causing the earth and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens to flee away, for the advancement of the glory of his kingdom!</p>
               <p n="7">VII. From what has been said, we may see the glorious wisdom of God. It shows the wisdom of God in creating the world, in that he has created it for such an excellent use, to accomplish in it so glorious a work. And it shows the wisdom of divine Providence, that he brings such great good out of such great evil, in making the fall and ruin of mankind, which in itself is so sorrowful and deplorable, an occasion of accomplishing such a glorious work as this work of redemption, and of erecting such a

How glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious doth the wisdom of God appear in that long course and series of great changes in the world, in bringing such order out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, in so frustrating the devil, and so wonderfully turning all his most subtle machinations to his own glory, and the glory of his Son Jesus Christ, and in causing the greatest works of Satan, those in which he has most glorified himself, to be wholly turned into oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of so much the more glorious triumph of his Son Jesus Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How wonderful is the wisdom of God, in bringing all such mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and various changes and overturnings in the world to such a glorious period at last, and in so directing all the wheels of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by his skilful hand, that every one of them conspires, as the manifold wheels of a most curious machine, at last to strike out such an excellent issue, such a manifestation of the divine glory, such happiness to his people, and such a glorious and everlasting kingdom of his Son!</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. From what has been said, we may see the stability of God's mercy and faithfulness to his people; how he never forsakes his inheritance, and remembers his covenant to them throughout all generations. Now we may see what reason there was for the words of the text, "The moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but my righteousness shall endure for ever and ever, and my salvation from generation to generation." Now we may see abundant reason for that name of God which he reveals to Moses, Exod. iii.14. "And God said unto Moses, <hi>I am that I am:</hi>" i. e. I am the same that I was when I entered into covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and ever shall be the same: I shall keep covenant for ever: I am self-sufficient, all-sufficient, and immutable.</p>
               <p>Now we may see the truth of that, Psal. xxxvi.5.6. "Thy mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds. Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgements are a great deep." If we consider what has been said, we need not wonder that the Psalmist, in the 13<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Psalm, so so often repeats this, <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever</hi>; as if he were in an ecstasy at the consideration of the perpetuity of God's mercy to his church, and delighted to think of it, and knew not how but continually to express it. Let us with like pleasure and joy celebrate the everlasting duration of Gods mercy and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to his church and people, and let us be comforted by it under the present dark circumstances of the church of God, and all the uproar and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ook it for their sakes, and for their sakes he carries it on, from the fall of man to the end of the world; it is because he has loved them with an everlasting love. For their sakes he overturns states and kingdoms. For their sakes he shakes heaven and earth. He gives men for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and people for their life. Since they have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in God's fight, they have been honorable; and therefore he first gives the blood of his own Son to them, and then, for their sakes, gives the blood of all their enemies, many thousands and millions, all nations that stand in their way, as a sacrifice to their good.</p>
               <p>For their sakes he made the world, and for their sakes he will destroy it: for their sakes he built heaven, and for their sakes he makes his angels ministring spirits. Therefore the Apostle says as he does, 1 Cor. iii.21 &amp;c. "All things are yours: whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the world, or life, or death, or things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, or things to come; all are yours." How blessed is this people who are redeemed from among men, and are the first fruits unto God, and to the Lamb; who have God in all ages for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and help! Deut. xxxiii.29. "H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ppy art thou, O "Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael: who is like unto thee, O people saved by the Lord, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword thy excellency! and thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies shall be found liars unto thee, and thou shalt tread upon their high places."</p>
               <p>Let who will prevail now, let the enemies of the church exalt themselves as much as they will, these are the people that shall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally prevail. The last kingdom shall finally be theirs; the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom shall finally be given into their hands, and shall not be left to other people. We have seen what a blessed issue things shall finally be brought to as to them, and what glory they shall arrive at, and remain in possession of, for ever and ever, after all the kingdoms of the world are come to an end, and the earth is removed, and and the mountains are carried into the depth of the sea, or where the sea was, and this lower earth shall all be dissolved. O happy people, and blessed society! Well may they spend an eternity in praises and hallalujahs to him who loved them from eternity, and will love them to eternity.</p>
               <p n="10">X. And, lastly, hence all wicked men, all that are in a Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less condition, may see there exceeding misery. You that are such, whoever you are, you are those who have no part nor lot in this matter. You are never the better for any of those things of which you have heard: yea, your guilt is but so much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the misery you are exposed to so much the more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. You are some of that sort, against whom God, in the progress of the work, exercises so much manifest wrath; some of those ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

who are liable to be made Christ's footstool, and to be ruled with a rod of iron, and to be dashed in pieces. You are some of the seed of the serpent, to bruise the head of which is one great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of all this work. Whatever glorious things God accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes for his church, if you continue in the state you are now in, they will not be glorious to you. The most glorious times of the church are always the most dismal times of the wicked and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. This we are taught in Is. lxvi.14.—And so we find, where ever glorious things are foretold concerning the church, there terrible things are foretold concerning the wicked, its enemies. And so it ever has been in fact; in all remarkable deliverances wrought for the church, there has been also a remarkable execution of wrath on its enemies. So it was when God delivered the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel out of Egypt; at the same time he remarkably pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out his wrath on Pharaoh and the Egyptains. So when he brought them into Canaan by Joshua, and gave them that good land he remarkably executed wrath upon the Canaanites. So when they were delivered out of the Babylonish captivity, signal ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance was inflicted on the Babylonians. So when the Gentiles were called, and the elect of God were saved by the preaching of the apostles, Jerusalem and the persecuting Jews were destroyed in a most awful manner. I might observe the same concerning the glory accomplished to the church in the days of Constantine, at the overthrow of Satan's visible kingdom in the downfall of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and at the day of judgement. In all these instances, and especially in the last, there have been, or will be, exhibited most awful tokens of the divine wrath against the wicked. And to this class of men you belong:</p>
               <p>You are indeed some of that sort that God will make use of in this affair; but it will be for the glory of his justice, and not of his mercy. You are some of those enemies of God who are reserved for the triumph of Christ's glorious power in overcoming and punishing them. You are some of that sort that shall be consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this accursed world after the day of judgement, when Christ and his church shall triumphantly and gloriously ascend to heaven.</p>
               <p>Therefore let all that are in a Christless condition amongst us seriously consider these things, and not be like the foolish people of the old world, who would not take warning, when Noah told them, that the Lord was about to bring a flood of waters upon the earth; or like the people of Sodom, who would not regard, when Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="unknown:017525_0301_0FA127FC2D8E52B0"/>I would conclude my whole discourse on this subject, in words like those in the last of the Revelation: "These sayings are faithful and true, and blessed is he that keepeth these sayings. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, Christ cometh quickly, and his reward is with him, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to every man according as his work shall be. And he that is unjust, shall be unjust still; and he that is filthy, shall be filthy still; and he that is holy, shall be holy still. Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city: for without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie. He that testifieth these things, saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen; even so come Lord Jesus."</p>

            <p>THE late learned and ingenious Mr. Edwards left in MS. several hundred sermons on doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinal and practical subjects, explications of above 500 texts of scripture, and essays on the truth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Christian religion, the harmony of the Old and New Testament, the divinity of Christ, the necessity and reasonableness of atonement and of the imputation of merit, the eternity of hell-torments, the foreknowledge of God, predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on universal and particular redemption, efficacious grace, justification, perseverance, &amp;c. Though he had no design to publish these in the form in which he left them, yet, in the opinion of good judges in America who have perused them, they contain a variety of new and striking sentiments, on many important and difficult subjects, which might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the Christian world much useful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. When writers excel only in style and composition, they can derive little honour, and the public can reap small improvement, from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their loose unfinished papers; but important original thoughts, tho' not accurately methodized, nor adorned with the beauties of eloquence, will merit being preserved from oblivion. If so much of the authors penetration and judgement appear in the preceding sheets, written about 20 years before his death, much more may be expected from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions in a period, when years, study and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, had greatly increased his stock of knowledge. Whether the publisher shall favour the world with any more of these valuable remains, will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably in a good measure depend on the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this work meets with.</p>
