            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>IT may not be improper for the Author to apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize for the free manner in which he has cenſured the Society of Friends, in the following treatiſe. The ſubject here diſcuſſed has long occupied his mind; and being fully perſuaded the ſyſtem of Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among that people is wrong, he could not omit expreſſing his ſentiments thereon. It ſeemed more eſpecially neceſſary, as an Apology for the ſociety of which he is a member. In order to ſhew why they do not excommunicate upon any account, it appeared proper to point out the evils which reſult from the practice. Although the Author firmly believes, that friends err in judgment in adminiſtring the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; yet, as a ſociety, he acknowledges they are reſpectable, and that many among them are eminent for their piety and virtue. And if, in the courſe of handling this ſubject, any thing has dropped from his pen that appears unfriendly, let it be attributed to a difficulty which he found in expreſſing his ſentiments in milder terms, againſt that which is ſo inconſiſtent with the Goſpel of our Lord and Saviour, and the great end and deſign of his coming.</p>

               <hi>AN APOLOGY,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Chriſtian religion is a religion of love; love even to enemies; yet the genuine effect of it has been ſo little experienced by many of its profeſſors, that it has often been a pretence for the moſt ſevere cenſures, and cruel perſecutions. In the courſe of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, this aſperity is worn off in ſome degree; yet that this benign diſpenſation of heaven is not yet fully underſtood, the excommunications ſtill practiſed by divers churches, clearly demonſtrate. The moſt able and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular treatiſe upon the ſubject of church authority, and excommunication, is a treatiſe by Robert Barclay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <q>The Anarchy of the Ranters and other Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines; the Hierarchy of the Romaniſt, and other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Churches, equally refuſed, and refuted, in a two-fold apology for the Church and People of God, called in deriſion Quakers,</q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The publication intitled as above, is ingeniouſly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as are all the works of that pious Author; yet the writer of this, being firmly perſuaded that Barclay hath erred, conceives it his buſineſs to ſhow wherein.</p>
            <p>The principle laid down by him, and upon which his ſyſtem of church-diſcipline is founded, is, that the people called Quakers were, in his day, the pure and only Church of Chriſt; that there ſhould be order in the church, and that excommunication is a part of this order, and ordained by Chriſt. The people called Quakers, in the preſent day, hold the ſame doctrine, and Barclay is eſteemed unanſwerable. I ſhall, in the firſt place, ſhow what the Church of Chriſt is; in doing this, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035015_0004_0FFFE940934E8910"/>
that the people called Quakers are not the Church of Chriſt as deſcribed by Barclay; and therefore have not thoſe powers given by Chriſt to his Church. And, laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that were they the Church of Chriſt, they could not excommunicate; becauſe Chriſt hath expreſsly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the members of Chriſt's body, are thoſe who are engrafted on him the vine. "I am the vine," ſaith he, "ye are the branches, he that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit, for without me ye can do nothing." The Church of Chriſt, therefore, includes all thoſe, whoever they are, that by love to Chriſt are ſo united to him, as branches are united to the vine; ſuch receive from him that ſpirit which ſanctifieth them, and leadeth them into all truth. This is agreeable to Barclay, ſee page 84, London edition. <q>None truly ought, nor can be accounted the Church of Chriſt, but ſuch as are in a meaſure ſanctified, or ſanctifying by the grace of God, and led by his Spirit, nor yet any made officers in the church but by the grace of God, and inward revelation of his Spirit." And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, page 29. "The church is ſuch as are ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, called to be ſaints.</q> Now, as no one is a member, much leſs an officer in the Church of Chriſt, but thoſe who are thus ſanctified, or ſanctifying, called to be ſaints, agreeable to Barclay; and as all who are under this operation, are members of his church, let them belong to whatever ſociety they may; ſo thoſe righteous perſons, collectively, conſtitute the church over which Chriſt is head. It will not be controverted, I truſt, but that there are pious perſons among all other ſocieties. If there are, to whom do they belong? Do the people called Quakers conſtitute the body of Chriſt complete in all its parts? and are the pious of other ſocieties merely ſuperfluous members of his body? or do they not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thereto? The pious of other ſocieties muſt have the ſame relationſhip to Chriſt, which the pious among the Quakers have; and therefore the pious among each ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety conſtitute the church of Chriſt in the ſame ſenſe as the pious among the Quakers conſtitute his church; and as all ſocieties are made up of thoſe who are virtuous,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035015_0005_0FFFE9421EBCC640"/>
and thoſe who are not; ſo neither of them are the church of Chriſt in contradiſtinction to all the reſt: Upon the whole, then, this truth follows, a truth comfortable to every Catholic mind, that the church of Chriſt is made up of the righteous of every denomination.</p>
            <p>The people called Quakers, are, like other ſocieties, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of perſons who are religious and irreligious. Now, the irreligious, tho' not members of Chriſt's body, are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs intitled to memberſhip in this church; it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follows, they are not the pure church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>A man has a right of memberſhip among the people called Quakers, by being born of believing parents; ſo that it is rather accidental that many are Quakers: had their parents been of any other perſuaſion, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves might have been of another ſociety. Now, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip in the church of Chriſt cannot be by accident, nor lineal deſcent: it were unreaſonable to ſuppoſe ſo extraordinary a privilege depended upon thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and, therefore, the people called Quakers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Church of Chriſt, in that ſenſe of the word for which Barclay contends.</p>
            <p>Chriſt cannot have a regard for one part of mankind in preference to the reſt—he muſt view them with equal love; it is then far from Catholic in any ſociety, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they are his church, diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>The terms of union among the people called Quakers conſiſt very much in things which may be ſtrictly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, by corrupt men, and which may yet be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the virtuous: It is not ſo in the church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Again. Chriſt gave his life for his church, that he might ſanctify it, and cleanſe it with the waſhing of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by the word; that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh. Can this be applicable to the people called Quakers, or to any diſtinct ſociety whatever? Did Chriſt give his life for them alone? The truth is, that no one church or ſociety can appropriate this ſacred character to themſelves: it
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035015_0006_0FFFE943D45542E0"/>
belongeth only to the righteous of all ſocieties, who joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſtitute the church over which Chriſt is head.</p>
            <p>What thoſe perſons meant, who, as Barclay ſays, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny any ſuch thing as a Church of Chriſt, I cannot tell. Barclay has not quoted their expreſſions, nor explained their meaning. If they meant that there was no ſociety of Chriſtians that could with propriety call themſelves the Church of Chriſt, in contradiſtinction to all the reſt, they were right. Barclay has aſſerted, that all churches are fallen, and only pretended churches, excepting the one of which he himſelf was a member. Now, if it can be proved, as I truſt it will be in the ſequel, that this Church (ſuppoſing the people called Quakers in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day to be the ſame Church) is not the chaſte ſpouſe of Chriſt, but is a mixed multitude, compoſed of perſons of various deſcriptions, as other churches are,—it will then follows, upon Barclay's own principles, that Chriſt hath not a diſtinct and viſible church on earth.</p>
            <p>Barclay, in explaining what is, or may be properly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the church, ſays, <q>Some were afraid of the church, the power of the church, the order of the church, the judgment of the church, and ſuch-like pretences; becauſe, ſaith he, theſe have been the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons wherewith Antichriſt, and the apoſtate chriſtians, have been theſe many generations perſecuting the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and warring againſt the man-child. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed great diſputes have been among the Rabbies in the apoſtacy concerning this church; what it is, or what may be ſo accounted, which I find not my place to dive much into; but ſhall only give the true ſenſe of it, according to truth, and the ſcriptures plain teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</q> Barclay here refers to a church which for many generations had been inviſible; to explain which he found not his place to dive much into; but only to give, he ſays, the true ſenſe of it, according to truth, and the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures plain teſtimony. Now, to give the true ſenſe of this ſubject, according to truth, and the ſcriptures plain teſtimony, is certainly diving into it; yet he has waved it altogether, and proceeds to give an explanation of the word church—<q>That it is a gathering of certain people together, in the belief of the ſame principles.</q> He
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035015_0007_0FFFE94729116D80"/>
then goes on to diſtinguiſh between that church, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or aſſembly of people, whereof Chriſt truly is the head, from ſuch as pretend falſely thereto. "Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much," ſaith he, <q>as ſanctification and holineſs is the great and chief end among Chriſtians, which moves them to gather together, therefore the apoſtle Paul defines the church in his ſalutation to the Corinthians, 1. Cor. 1.2. Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, them that are ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus called to be ſaints.</q> This is a proper explanation of the Church of Chriſt, and it is much to be deſired that all churches or ſocieties in Chriſtendom were ſuch; but what pretenſions have the people called Quakers, more than other ſocieties, to this diſtinguiſhing character, of ſaints, and ſanctified? wherein do they demonſtrate this? are their affections weaned from the world, and more placed upon things that are above? have they more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine benevolence, and philanthropy, and do they follow more perfectly, than others, the great example of Chriſt? No doubt but divers among this people, as well as Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay, will anſwer in the affirmative, and roundly condemn all others; and we ſhould find ſome among all ſocieties aſſerting the ſame of themſelves, and as confidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning their neighbours; but what would an impartial being ſay? An impartial being would ſay, that no one church, or ſociety, is the pure Church of Chriſt; that they are all fallen, and therefore none of them have thoſe powers, and that authority which was veſted in the primitive church, and which we hope the church will again poſſeſs, when ſhe ſhall be brought out of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, leaning upon the breaſt of her beloved: and for any church in the preſent day, to pretend to thoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, is preſumption. Were an individual, ſolely led by the ſpirit of Chriſt, and veſted with miraculous powers, he would make no high pretenſions to extraordinary endowments; and the authority that he was clothed with, would make itſelf manifeſt, without any pains of the creature to ſet it off; and its authority would be, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of the benevolent, and god-like kind; it would be that of opening the eyes of the blind, unſtopping the ears of the deaf, healing the ſick, raiſing the dead, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035015_0008_0FFFE94989D44410"/>
preaching the everlaſting goſpel to the poor. And wherever there are extraordinary pretenſions to ſanctity, not accompanied with extraordinary love, and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to mankind, we may be aſſured they are preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions only. So great a degree of modeſty always accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies real ſanctity, that the poſſeſſor can never ſound forth his own fame. The ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the rock from which they were hewn, and the pit from whence they were digged: They do not forget when they were upon the brink of the pit of deſtruction, and that it was of the Lord's mercy they were reſcued, and that it is by the guardian angel of his preſence they are preſerved and enabled to ſing upon the banks of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. A remembrance of the Lord's gracious deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with them, keeps them in his fear, and from every thing that looks like boaſting. This is the diſpoſition of all who are ſanctified; and as Chriſt's Church is made up of thoſe individuals, ſo is ſhe his chaſte and humble bride. If any one ſociety in Chriſtendom was wholly compoſed of ſuch members, that ſociety would be as a city ſet on an hill, which could not be hid: there would be light, and love, and good works, accompanied with the greateſt humiliation and modeſty; the poſſeſſion of the pearl of mighty price, the real riches of eternity, being a gift of God, is accompanied with the deepeſt humiliation.</p>
            <p>The writer of this would be ſorry to aſperſe an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, much leſs a whole ſociety: he knows the Friends are reſpectable; that there are many among them who are eminently virtuous; yet having ſhewn, he conceives, they are not the Church of Chriſt, according to Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay's definition of the church, it follows they have not thoſe powers given by our Lord to his Church, which ſome may think they poſſeſs; that what they bind on Earth is bound in Heaven, and what they looſe on Earth is looſed in Heaven, and to gainſay the whole flock draws after it a far deeper judgement, than if a millſtone was hanged about the offender's neck, and he was drowned in the depth of the ſea. In this reſpect the ſociety of Friends are as weak as any other ſociety. <q>God hath not through them reſtored the golden age," as ſaith Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035015_0009_0FFFE94B14C4DD30"/>
"and bringing them into the holy order and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his own ſon, who is ruling and to rule in the midſt of them, ſetting forth counſellors as at the beginning and judges as at firſt, and eſtabliſhing truth, mercy, righteouſneſs and judgment again in the earth:" Neither have they "power in caſes of faith and conſcience, to give a poſitive ſentence and deciſion, which may be obligatory upon believers, or ſuch as are of their ſociety, under pain of being bound on Earth, and bound in Heaven, and lying under a far deeper judgment, than if a millſtone was hanged about the offender's neck, and he drowned in the depth of the ſea.</q> Anarchy of the Ranters, page 14, 41, and 47.</p>
            <p>As all the arguments of Barclay, on the power and authority of the Church, apply only to the true Church of Chriſt, or powers poſſeſſed by the primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and as it has been ſhown, that the people called Quakers are not the ſanctified church or ſpouſe of Chriſt, it follows they have not thoſe powers; neither hath any other ſociety in Chriſtendom, and it is the height of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in any to aſſume them in the preſent day.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt, the head of the Church, ſhall be pleaſed to reſtore the golden age, bring his Church out of the wilderneſs; and give her counſellors as at the beginning, and judges as at the firſt, and eſtabliſh truth, mercy, righteouſneſs and judgment again in the earth; then will order be reſtored; for God is a God of order; but what will be the rules and regulations, in this renovated ſtate of things, is not for us to determine: they will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mind of Chriſt, altogether benevolent, and worthy of him the great law-giver.</p>
            <p>It has been generally taken for granted, that excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication is a prerogative of the Church of Chriſt; all churches who exerciſe it, do it upon this principle. The deſign of this eſſay is to ſhow that Chriſt hath not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed it. Barclay, to prove his poſition, quotes the following expreſſions of our Lord: <q>Moreover, if thy brother ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee, go tell him his fault between thee and him alone; if he ſhall hear thee, thou haſt gained thy brother; but if he will not hear
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035015_0010_0FFFE94D72A0D0C0"/>
thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes every word may be eſtabliſhed, and if he ſhall neglect to hear them, tell it the church; but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and publican; verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven, and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven. From which ſcripture," ſaith he, "it doth manifeſtly, and evidently follow, Firſt, that Jeſus Chriſt intended there ſhould be a certain method and order in his church, in the proceeding towards ſuch a tranſgreſs. Secondly, that he that refuſeth to hear two, is become more guilty than hardened in refuſing to hear him that firſt reproved alone. Thirdly, that refuſing to hear the judgment of the church, or whole aſſembly, he doth thereby exclude himſelf, and ſhut out himſelf, from being a member, and is juſtly judged by his brethren as a heathen and publican.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That there ſhould be order and method in the church is granted, but what that order and method ſhould be, is the queſtion. The propriety of excommunicating is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; there being no warrant for it from the text, as will appear upon examination. <q>If thy brother ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee, go tell him his fault between thee and him alone." Here is a perſonal injury done by a brother. "If he refuſes to hear thee, take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes every word may be eſtabliſhed. And if he neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church, but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and publican.</q> The plain ſenſe of the text is, that although he be thy brother who has done thee this injury, yet refuſing to hear thee, and your friends, and the church, he ſhews by his injuſtice, that the ſtate of his mind is that of an heathen man and publican.—Here is no excommunication in the caſe. Jeſus does not ſay, let him then be caſt out of the church. It will be ſaid, that it is implied, becauſe heathen men and publicans do not belong to the Church of Chriſt; but it ſhall be ſhewn, that excommunication is contrary
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035015_0011_0FFFE94F1D4F9DC8"/>
to the firſt great principle of Chriſtianity, and by Jeſus expreſsly forbidden; and therefore could not have been the meaning of our Lord. This man, although he may remain within the pale of the church, is neceſſarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded memberſhip from the myſtical body of Chriſt; he is to be conſidered in the ſtate of an heathen man and publican. Now, what is the buſineſs of the church with heathens and publicans? Is it not to inform their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and to convert them to the Chriſtian faith? So that, inſtead of caſting the man out, and having nothing further to do with him, the church has a great and an important work before it; it is to open and manifeſt the grounds and reaſons of the Chriſtian faith; to ſhew this man, that although he has been a profeſſor of Chriſt, he is yet unacquainted with the firſt rudiments of the goſpel. All this is to be done, and whatever more which in divine wiſdom may be manifeſted as proper. And for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the diſciples, Jeſus aſſures them that this labour of their's in this important work ſhall be approved in heaven; whatſoever ye ſhall bind on earth, is bound in heaven, and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth is looſed in heaven. This is evidently the doctrine from the text, and context, as will clearly appear if it be taken together. That which is recommended by our Lord to his diſciples, correſponds with his own great work and labour of love. He introduced what he ſaid reſpecting the brother who treſpaſſed, as follows: <q>The ſon of man is come to ſave that which was loſt. How think ye, if a man have an hundred ſheep, and one of them be gone aſtray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountain and ſeeketh that which is gone aſtray, and if ſo be, that he find it, verily I ſay unto you, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceth more over that ſheep than of the ninety and nine which went not aſtray. Even ſo, it is not the will of your father who is in heaven, that one of theſe little ones ſhould periſh." Jeſus then adds to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, "moreover, if thy brother ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee, tell him his fault between thee and him alone,</q> and ſo directs, how this treſpaſſing brother is to be dealt with, in order to be reclaimed: to reſtore the loſt ſheep is the object in view. And can it be ſuppoſed, that he
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035015_0012_0FFFE9545C1F2478"/>
who came to ſeek and to ſave that which is loſt, and gave his life for this purpoſe, would direct, that any perſon whatever ſhould be placed in ſuch a ſituation as to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the bleſſing of the church? But it may be ſaid, the man refuſes that help which is offered by the church, and is as an heathen man and publican. Why not then ſet him aſide? To which I reply: Becauſe Jeſus hath expreſsly forbidden it, as will be further ſhewn in the ſequel. Jeſus knows it is impoſſible for men to make ſuch a diſcrimination, as that the righteous ſhall make up a diſtinct ſociety from the reſt of mankind. He who knows what lodges in men, has with infinite wiſdom warned his followers againſt the attempt: he could have expelled Judas from the company of his followers; but as an example of compaſſion, and a leſſon to future ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, ſuffered him to remain with them, until the laſt ſolemn ſupper. The ſalvation of men being of infinite importance; what ſituation can a man be placed in, ſo favourable to him in this reſpect as within the pale of the church? If he be caſt out, whither is he to go? If he may be reformed as well out of the pale, as within, then indeed his being within is but of little conſequence; but if it operates as an injury, or is leſs favourable to him, it is wrong to ſet him aſide. The truth is, it is not proper for us to ſay, when men may, or may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, nor ſhould we do any thing which might operate to the diſcouragement of a perſon, in a matter of ſo much importance to him as his reformation. Times and ſeaſons in this reſpect, are neither in the power of thoſe who wiſh the man's good, nor in the man himſelf: the Lord's gracious viſitation is the time in which alone he can be reformed. This he will meet with either ſooner or later, and if he then be obedient to the gracious call, he ſhall be ſanctified.</p>
            <p>That our Lord hath expreſsly forbidden excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is plain from the following parable. <q>The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven," ſays he, "is likened unto a man which ſowed good ſeed in his field, but while men ſlept, his enemy came and ſowed tares among the wheat, and went his way; but when the blade was ſprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035015_0013_0FFFE955E5892180"/>
tares alſo; ſo the ſervants of the houſehold came and ſaid unto him, ſir, didſt not thou ſow good ſeed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? he ſaid unto them, an enemy hath done this: the ſervants ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? but he ſaid nay, leſt while ye gather up the tares, ye root up alſo the wheat with them: let both grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether until the harveſt, and the time of harveſt. I will ſay to the reapers gather ye together, firſt the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.</q> And when his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples requeſted an explanation of the parable, Jeſus ſaid unto them, <q>he that ſoweth the good ſeed is the ſon of man, the field is the world, the good ſeed is the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the kingdom, but the tares are the children of the wicked one, the enemy that ſowed them is the devil, the harveſt is the end of the world, and the reapers are the angels; as therefore the tares are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and burned in the fire, ſo ſhall it be in the end of the world. The ſon of man ſhall ſend forth his angels, and they ſhall gather out of his kingdom all things which offend, and them which do iniquity, and ſhall caſt them into a furnace of fire, there ſhall be wailing and gnaſhing of teeth. Then ſhall the righteous ſhine forth as the ſun in the kingdom of their father.</q> Jeſus concluded this explanation very remarkably, "who hath ears to hear let him hear." Happy had it been for the profeſſors of Chriſtianity, if their ears had been open to hear the gracious word of their maſter. Has not every church in Chriſtendom diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded the doctrine contained in the parable? The tares in their opinion muſt be ſeparated from the wheat; but in this attempt, have not all churches uniformly done as Jeſus ſaid there would be a danger of doing? <q>The ſervants ſaid unto him, wilt thou then that we go and gather them up:" meaning the tares? "but he ſaid nay, leſt while ye gather up the tares, yet root up alſo the wheat with them?</q> What miſchief has the Roman church made in this attempt, much precious grain has been deſtroyed, under a pretence, or from an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion they were tares. Many virtuous men have been
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035015_0014_0FFFE95770D23AE0"/>
excommunicated by that church; and moſt, if not all other churches, have done the ſame; excommunications are not confined to immoralities only; but men are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned for their ſentiments alſo, and even the people called Quakers have expelled men from them for that which was highly meritorious. As a proof of this, I may inſtance Ralph Sandiford, and Benjamin Lay, who were diſowned for their teſtimony againſt keeping Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes in bondage.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible, by any literal rule, to ſeparate the tares from the wheat: this can never be done, until the ſon of man ſhall ſend forth his angels, and gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and thoſe who do ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. It may be queried of me, wouldſt thou then ſuffer immoralities of every kind to remain in the church, and go unrebuked? No: Rebuke, exhort, teſtify againſt all evil, from time to time, as thou mayeſt be enabled. But what if ſinners ſtiffen their necks, and harden their hearts, are they ſtill to remain in the church? It is not in the wiſdom of man to ſeparate the virtuous from the vicious. But may not divine wiſdom direct us to make ſuch rules as will keep the church clean? This hath never yet been done. Divine wiſdom, foreſeeing the evils that would enſue in the attempt, hath forbidden it. How is it poſſible a line can be drawn, or any rule made, ſo as that all virtuous characters ſhall conſtitute a diſtinct ſociety? We will ſuppoſe, for example, that a good moral character ſhall be the teſt to entitle to member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in ſociety; but how ſhall we eſtabliſh a criterion to determine this good moral character? A man may not ſteal, or be guilty of a manifeſt act of injuſtice, yet ſo cloſe, artful, and hard in his dealings, as in the ſight of heaven ſhall amount to the ſame thing: a man may be covetous, over-reach his neighbour, and grind the face of the poor, and no rule can lay hold on him. Then, covetouſneſs, which is as the ſin of idolatry, remains in the church. Further, we will ſay a drunkard ſhall be diſowned; but may there not be ſo great a degree of ſenſuality, as to be equally criminal with drunkenneſs, and yet no rule which can lay hold on the man? Again, what is worſe than pride? and can a rule be made ſo as
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035015_0015_0FFFE9590D0F0098"/>
to point it out? May it not remain in the church in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of all rules? May it not be active in church affairs? May not envying, back-biting, and evil reports prevail, and yet no rule ſo to diſcriminate offenders as they can be excluded from memberſhip? Again: may there not be a total lifeleſſneſs in religion, a dry and barren ſtate, as far from any thing which is good, and divine, as immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conduct; and yet, as we cannot ſee the hearts of men, no rule would point out ſuch caſes? Thoſe things may and will prevail. Seeing, then, it is impoſſible, ſo to cleanſe the church, but that there will be as unworthy characters within the pale as without; and when no good can be done by diſowning; but, on the contrary, many individuals and families made extremely unhappy by it, is it not then better to let it alone?</p>
            <p>The following query, is often read in the meeting. Is tale-bearing, back-biting, and evil reports diſcouraged? And yet, adminiſtering the rules of the ſociety often ſpread ſcandal far and wide. The overſeers of the church are ſpies upon the conduct of the members. (I doubt not they mean well.) Scarce one can paſs unnoticed; and when any thing of an immoral nature is heard of, the matter is ſifted to the bottom; and if a perſon is found guilty, his caſe is taken to the monthly meeting, and laid open before great numbers. Suppoſe a young woman, ſeduced by a man, who had gained her affections: She is expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before ſome hundreds; many of whom are giddy and thoughtleſs: we ſee them ſmiling perhaps in the meeting at her diſaſter; and when they mingle among their acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, are repeating the ſorrowful tale. The caſe of this poor creature is called over once a month, until ſhe is pronounced either a penitent, or not ſo. In either caſe, ſhe is further expoſed: if a penitent, ſhe condemns her conduct, and it is read at a public meeting for worſhip before ſome thouſands: if ſhe is ſuppoſed not penitent, ſhe is publicly caſt out of the church. Oh! Jeſus, thou compaſſionate Saviour of men, thou friend of publicans and ſinners, is this done in thy name, and by thy autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? Thou, who reſcued the poor woman who was taken in adultery, from the hands of the Phariſees; thou who caſt ſeven devils out of Mary Magdalen, and who reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035015_0016_0FFFE95D305225D0"/>
thyſelf more clearly and explicitly to the woman at Jacob's well than to many others; thou who ſwate drops of blood in the garden of Gethſemane, and who died upon the croſs to ſave ſinners, and whoſe whole divine proceſs was a myſtery of love, which angels deſired to look into! are thoſe things done in thy name? Haſt thou authoriſed ſinners thus to deal with ſinners? Verily, nay. But as has been before obſerved, it is not for things which are ſinful only, but for thoſe which are innocent, that ſome are diſowned. Perſons are diſowned for marrying thoſe of another ſociety: men may be diſowned for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a tax, or a fine, or for defending that government, by which thoſe very perſons, who exerciſe this authority of excommunication, hold their lives and their property. Perſons may be diſowned who are virtuous, and yet the vicious eſcape<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Theſe are caſes which not only may happen, but they are facts which do frequently happen. A long liſt of the diſowned, perſonally known to the author, might be enumerated, of as reſpectable charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as any that are members of the ſociety. The following is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of Thomas Thomas, drawn up by a few of his acquaintance, to preſerve in their families the memory of that amiable man.</p>
                  <p>"On the twelfth of the tenth month, 1780, died Thomas Thomas, of Richland, Bucks County, in the ſixty-ſecond year of his age. A man who, through the courſe of his life, was eminently diſtinguiſhed by his integrity and exemplary piety. In him were eminently joined the principal virtues that adorn the Chriſtian,—a true evangelical cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity crowning the whole. In him the poor, the widow, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, had ever a ſincere ſympathiſing friend and liberal benefactor. To theſe his memory will remain peculiarly dear and venerable. He was many years an honourable elder, and overſeer of Richland month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting, faithfully labouring, and cheerfully ſpending himſelf in the diſcharge of the duties of thoſe important ſtations,—religiouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying himſelf with unwearied diligence, to cultivate peace, brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love, and righteouſneſs, through may painful exerciſes and fatigue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing travels, until (Oh, for a veil if poſſible broad enough to cover the remainder of the ſcene) the ſame congregation a few months before the cloſe of his pious life, which had been devoted to their ſervice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded him with a total excommunication; becauſe he could not in conſcience deviate from the great example of our bleſſed Saviour, and the clear precepts of his apoſtles, in rendering tribute to the preſent government, from which alone he could receive protection; believing it his duty, to yield a peaceable ſubjection, to whatever form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment it pleaſed divine providence to place over him. This ſevere meaſure, though deeply wounding and afflictive, he ſuſtained with a meek and patient fortitude, truly becoming his exemplary and unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed character. This ſhort memorial we owe to the memory of the upright man, our dear friend, who having paid the debt of nature, has left his ſurvivors to mourn their loſs, and is gone before, to obey with joy the gracious call, of <q>come ye bleſſed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here let my reader pauſe! and if he be one of the people called Quakers, let me aſk him, how many ſuch characters have they remaining in their ſociety? What proportion in number do they bear to the whole? And is it poſſible, the ſociety can ſuppoſe they are right, in diſowning ſuch men, whilſt many thouſands among them eſcape cenſure, who have no religion at all? Alas! if this is not blindneſs, I know not what can be called ſo.</p>
               </note>. Can thoſe rules be of divine authority,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035015_0017_0FFFE95F9B29ACA0"/>
which operate thus? But was the end attainable, which is aimed at by the diſcipline, which is that of ſeparating the vicious from the virtuous, it would even then be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, as will be further ſhewn in the ſequel.</p>
            <p>Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners: he laid down his life for ſuch. Is it poſſible, then, to reconcile ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication with ſuch love? But ſaith Barclay, <q>were ſuch a principle to be received, or believed, that in the Church of Chriſt, no man ſhould be ſeparated from, no man condemned, or excluded from the fellowſhip and communion of the body, for his judgment or opinion in matters of faith, then what blaſphemies ſo horrid, what hereſies ſo damnable, what doctrine of devils but might harbour itſelf in the Church of Chriſt, what need then of ſound doctrine, if no doctrine make unſound.</q> To this I reply: No man ſhould be ſo ſeparated from the fellowſhip and communion of the body, as implies an inconſiſtency, with that funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of the goſpel, viz. Chriſt laying down his life for the ſins of the world. The virtuous cannot have fellowſhip, or be pleaſed with the conduct of the vicious, or they would ceaſe to be virtuous; but the virtuous, and the vicious may belong to the ſame outward ſociety, and aſſemble together in a place appointed for divine worſhip, and this may well be ſuppoſed without coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing that which is wicked. It is the caſe in all ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And if there ſhould be in the church, even horrid blaſphemies, and damnable doctrines of devils, it does not follow, that unleſs the perſons who hold them are diſowned, that thoſe evils are countenanced; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is not to the purpoſe to ſay, as Barclay has ſaid, what need of ſound doctrines, if no doctrine make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound? what need of convincing, and exhorting gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers, if to gainſay be no crime? Does this follow, as a neceſſary conſequence, if perſons are not excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035015_0018_0FFFE96126A4F1C0"/>
for evils? Is there no alternative between excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating and countenancing them? May not all who abhor iniquity bear as ſtrong a teſtimony againſt it, if wicked or miſtaken men remain within the pale of the church, as if they were turned out? If we were at liberty only to reprove wickedneſs, may we not deteſt it as much as if we were obliged to put ſinners to death? So that, when I contend againſt excommunication, and maintain it inconſiſtent with the goſpel, it is not to make light of evils of any kind: There is great need of ſound doctrine; and there is none more worthy of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention than that of love to mankind. Let thoſe who are influenced by it, endeavour to convince: let them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, and teſtify with great zeal, againſt all that is wrong: The virtuous muſt of neceſſity do it; yet there is a wide difference between that deteſtation and teſtimony, which the righteous bear againſt iniquity, and that teſtimony againſt tranſgreſſors, which often operates to their injury. To omit diſowning, therefore, would not be an inlet, as Barclay aſſerts it would, <q>to all manner of abominations, and make void the whole tendency of Chriſt and his apoſtles' doctrine, and a bidding farewell to all Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, or to the maintaining any ſound doctrine in the Church of Chriſt:</q> (page 51.) All that can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be done to prevent thoſe evils, may be done more effectually, without excommunicating the ſinner. It is generally the caſe, after a few months viſiting ſuch who act amiſs, if there is no appearance of reformation, they are diſowned, after which they are lightly eſteemed, and neglected; and are in danger of being loſt; whereas, were they ſtill members of the ſociety, and favourable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities taken with them in brotherly love, many might be reſtored to virtue.</p>
            <p>One argument, urged in favour of diſowning, is, that it is neceſſary for the reputation of the ſociety. To allow wicked perſons to remain in the church, it is ſaid, would be a reproach to it. Were ſinners ſuffered to retain a right of memberſhip in ſociety, with a view to countenance that which is evil, it would then be reproachful indeed; but no ſuch thing is contended for. Barclay has taken for granted, that the people called Quakers were the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035015_0019_0FFFE962FA3B3230"/>
Church of Chriſt; that Chriſt's Church is pure, having no ſpot or blemiſh or any ſuch thing; therefore, all evil muſt be condemned, and the ſinner, unleſs he repent, expelled from the church; but, it has and will be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhewn, that until Chriſt Jeſus ſhall come again, no ſuch church can exiſt, and that which is true of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Church, the bride of Chriſt only, is aſſumed by a ſociety of frail and imperfect men.</p>
            <p>All mankind are, or were ſinners; and, therefore, while ſo, are not members of Chriſt's myſtical body, or of his pure church; but he came to ſeek and to ſave that which is loſt, or to initiate them into memberſhip in his church. Now, can putting away be right, when the ſole object of Jeſus is to ſave that which is loſt? If memberſhip in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety be an advantage, muſt not diſowning be a diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage? Muſt it not place a man in an unfavourable ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation; and is it not ſtrange, that ſinners who have been reclaimed, or improved in virtue by means of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip in ſociety, ſhould be zealous for putting others away, and thereby deprive them of thoſe advantages, which they themſelves profeſs to have received? It will be ſaid they are not put away, until they are laboured with, and refuſe to be reclaimed; but it is not for us to ſet limits to the love of Jeſus, neither ſhould men ſet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to their own labours of love: We ought never to give over ſtriving: it is imitating the great example of him who ſleepeth not by day, nor ſlumbereth by night; but is always waiting to be gracious to every ſon of fallen Adam.</p>
            <p>As to the reproach which would fall on the church, from the unrighteous, let it be remembered that Chriſt Jeſus left that ſociety who poſſeſs tranſcendant virtue, and came among ſinners. He converſed with Mary Magdalen, with the woman at Jacob's well, with the woman taken in adultery, and was frequently a gueſt with ſinners. And was it not becauſe all men are ſinners that he came into the world? If, then, it was no reproach to Jeſus, that he accompanied with ſinners, it would be no reproach to any ſociety, if bad characters were among them, if thoſe perſons were continued in memberſhip with a view to their reformation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:035015_0020_0FFFE96808A760B8"/>Suppoſe there were a ſociety of Chriſtians, every member of which was perfect: If it be right to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own men becauſe they are imperfect, it could not be right to admit any into memberſhip unleſs they were perfect; and if men may attain perfection independent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſuch a ſociety, what advantage could they derive from joining them? as improvement in virtue is that which is propoſed by all religious aſſociations.</p>
            <p>Imperfect men will conſtitute a great part of all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties; and if ſo, how ſhall we aſcertain, what charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to admit, and what to reject? Is there a line ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſible, as that we can draw it with ſafety, and ſay all on one ſide are of right members, and all on the other ſide are properly excluded? Attempts have been made by moſt ſocieties; a line has been drawn; but as injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, as if an ingenious geographer ſhould attempt to mark out the boundaries of heaven, and of hell, and the line which ſeparates them. It is granted, there is a perfect diſtinction between good and evil, yet good and evil are often blended together in the ſame perſon; and among virtuous men, ſome are more eminently ſo than others; ſo among bad characters, there are ſome more depraved than others, and as there are degrees of virtue and vice, ſo the leaſt among the virtuous muſt approach ſo near to the leaſt among the vicious, as that no man can ſay to which claſs they belong; and, therefore, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus hath forbidden to diſcriminate by expulſion from his Church, having reſerved it to a future day.</p>
            <p>Improvement in piety and virtue, is the object inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by all religious aſſociations. Is it not then highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to expel men from ſociety, merely becauſe they want that which is aimed at by the aſſociation?</p>
            <p>A religious ſociety ſhould be a ſpiritual infirmary, where meaſures ought to be taken to heal the diſeaſed. Shall we then, if perſons appear dangerouſly ill, turn them out of doors?</p>
            <p>It will be objected to the foregoing, that the primitive Church was in the practice of diſowning. Barclay has quoted much ſcripture to prove this, and that the church he was a member of had the ſame authority. I truſt it
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035015_0021_0FFFE96A70CB3218"/>
will appear he was miſtaken in both caſes. He proceeds, (See Anarchy of the Ranters, page 18, 22, and 49.) <q>1. Corinthians, 5. Chap. 3 and 4 ver. I, indeed, as abſent in body, but preſent in ſpirit, have judged alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as though I were preſent, concerning him that hath ſo done this deed. In the name of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, when ye are gathered together, and my ſpirit, with the power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to deliver ſuch a one to ſatan for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord." And 2d Theſſalonians, 3d Chap. 6th ver. "Now we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you brethren in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye withdraw yourſelves from every brother that walketh diſorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us;" Verſe 14th, "and if any man obey not our word by this epiſtle, note that man, and have no company with him that he may be aſhamed. (Galations 1ſt Chap. 8 Verſe:) But though we or an angel from Heaven, preach any other goſpel unto you, than that we have preached unto you, let him be accurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: as we ſaid before, ſo ſay I now again, if any man preach any other goſpel unto you, than that we have preached unto you, let him be accurſed. Again, (1. Tim. 1ſt chap. 19th and 20th verſes) Holding faith and a good conſcience, which ſome having put away concerning faith have made ſhipwreck, of whom is Hymenias, and Alexander, whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaſpheme.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The foregoing is produced, together with various other texts to prove the propriety of diſowning. What the apoſtle meant by delivering perſons over to ſatan that they may learn not to blaſpheme, or the curſe denounced upon ſuch as preach any other goſpel than that he had preached, is not eaſy to underſtand. It is ſufficient for us to know what Barclay meant. Now, curſing, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering perſons to ſatan, or aſſigning them over to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture damnation, or diſowning, are all ſynonimous with him; and it muſt be ſo, if his firſt principles are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for if the people called Quakers are Chriſt's Church on earth, all who are expelled from this church, are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely excluded memberſhip from Chriſt's Church in
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035015_0022_0FFFE96C018F1BE0"/>
Heaven; becauſe, the ſame power and ſpirit rules in both. The people called Quakers profeſs to be led and guided in their deciſions by the Holy Spirit. Upon this principle they call themſelves the Church of Chriſt. If, then, they are led by the Holy Spirit to diſown, the perſons ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned are in a moſt fearful ſituation. Barclay has taken a great deal of pains to prove that the people called Quakers were the Church of Chriſt: that what they bound on earth, was bound in Heaven, and what they looſed on earth was looſed in Heaven; and that for a man to offend one of thoſe little ones, it were better that a mill-ſtone hanged about his neck, and he drowned in the depth of the ſea, and to gainſay the whole flock, muſt be more criminal, and draw after it a far deeper judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now, what can this deeper judgment mean? Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal damnation upon Barclay's principles. Let me aſk the Friends of the preſent day whether this is what they mean? If they mean this, is it not preſumption to pronounce a ſentence in the name of the moſt high, againſt a man of ſober life, which implies he is aſſigned over to damnation? Here ſome will exclaim, and ſay, that no ſuch thing is meant. Thoſe Friends may be told, that excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Church of Chriſt, implies an excluſion from the kingdom of Heaven, which Barclay well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and has ſtrongly expreſſed in the treatiſe now quoted; and if the Friends of the preſent day do not mean it, I may aſk them whether they have not departed from the principle of their forefathers? All churches who have excommunicated, have done it upon this ground, that they were the pure Church of Chriſt; and excommunication with them meant damnation. The Roman Catholics ſpeak plain, and curſe ſuch whom they diſown, with a moſt fearful curſe.</p>
            <p>If friends do not mean by it an excluſion from the kingdom of heaven, it may be aſked what do they mean? It will be replied, we mean to bear our teſtimony againſt certain conduct which we diſapprove. And might you not bear your teſtimony againſt thoſe things without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning for them? There are many things for which men are diſowned, which will not be alledged againſt them, as ſinful, by the judge of all the earth; and on the other
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035015_0023_0FFFE96E6DCC6168"/>
hand, there are many evils, for which you do not diſown which will at the day of judgment, exclude men from admittance among the bleſſed.</p>
            <p>Having remarked as above, I proceed to take ſome notice of thoſe anathemas of the apoſtle Paul. It is granted, that on ſome extraordinary occaſions, the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pronounced a fearful curſe. What was the ceremony, on thoſe occaſions, we are not told in the text, though ſome eccleſiaſtical writers have given their conjectures. It does not appear that thoſe perſons were caſt out of the church; the inceſtuous Corinthian, though he was delivered over to Satan, for the deſtruction of the fleſh, yet it was, that the ſpirit might be ſaved in the day of the Lord. This cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and proceſs, whatever it might have been, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ſalutary, and ſo it proved; for the apoſtle, in his ſecond epiſtle to the Corinthians, recommended it to them to forgive and comfort this man, leſt he ſhould be ſwallowed up with over-much ſorrow. And the Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians, although commanded in the name of the Lord Jeſus, to withdraw from every brother that walked diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, and to note the man who obeyed not the word of that epiſtle, to have no company with him, that he may be aſhamed; yet the apoſtle adds, count him not an enemy, but admoniſh him as a brother. So that, whatever was done to the man, his ſalvation was kept in view: they were not to forget he was their brother, and therefore he could not have been excommunicated.</p>
            <p>As to the curſe pronounced upon thoſe who preached another goſpel than that which the apoſtle preached, it is to be preſumed, that ſuch did not wiſh to aſſociate with the apoſtles of our Lord, and ſo going off from them, if they ever belong to the church, there could not be a neceſſity for an excommunication. If the apoſtle ſaw ſuch were in a ſtate of damnation, it was his duty to declare it, as a warning to the believers not to be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them. This affords no argument for excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. With reſpect to Hymenius, and Alexander, whom the apoſtle delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaſpheme, we muſt ſuppoſe the ſame was intended as was in the caſe of the inceſtuous Corinthian: whether the ſame ſalutary effects followed, we are not informed; but that they were not diſowned, is evident from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035015_0024_0FFFE970D9F43210"/>
This Hymenius is probably the ſame perſon the apoſtle has ſpoken of in his ſecond epiſtle to Timothy: he has there Philetus for a companion. It appears they were <q>prophane bablers, whoſe words eat as doth a canker, who concerning the truth had erred, ſaying the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is paſt already, and overthrew the faith of ſome" Nevertheleſs," ſays the apoſtle, "the foundation of God ſtands ſure, having this ſeal, the lord knoweth them that are his, and let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt depart from iniquity." He then adds, But in a great houſe there are not only veſſels of gold, and of ſilver, but alſo of wood and of earth, and ſome to honour, and ſome to diſhonour. It a man therefore purge himſelf from theſe, he ſhall be a veſſel unto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſanctified and meet for the maſter's uſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto every good work.</q> From the foregoing, it is plain, that Hymenius, Alexander and Philetus were not diſowned. The great houſe here ſpoken of, is no doubt the church; in this houſe, there are not only veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of gold, and of ſilver, but alſo of wood and of earth, and ſome to honour and ſome to diſhonour. Now altho' Hymenius, Alexander, and Philetus, could not be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt's myſtical church, they yet might belong to the viſible church, or ſociety; they were veſſels of ſome kind or other in the great houſe, and although not veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of gold, or of ſilver; not veſſels of honour, not ſanctified and meet for the maſter's uſe, and prepared unto every good work, they might comparatively be veſſels of wood, or of earth, or of diſhonour. The apoſtle has here given a ſtriking illuſtration of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward church, and ſuch as correſponds exactly with what is contended for in this eſſay; but far different from that which was attempted by Barclay, and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. According to them, none ought to belong to this houſe, but ſuch as are ſanctified and meet for the matter's uſe, expreſsly contrary to the words of the apoſtle, who admits that unſanctified veſſels may remain in the houſe. Yet after all the pains taken by the Friends, thus to purge their ſociety, they are nevertheleſs ſuch an houſe, who have among them veſſels of various kinds, veſſels of gold, of ſilver, of wood, and of earth; ſome to honour, and ſome to diſhonour. The apoſtle, no doubt, made uſe of
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035015_0025_0FFFE9733705C8F0"/>
the above ſimilitude, to ſhew it was beſt to let Hymenius and Philetus, together with other unſanctified perſons, remain in the houſe. And to excite in them, a virtuous emulation, ſays, If a man purge himſelf from the evils above, he ſhall be a veſſel unto honour, ſanctified, and meet for the maſter's uſe, and prepared unto every good work. The apoſtle holds up the poſſibility of this, and therefore admits them a part of the great family. And let me aſk the people called Quakers, whether they have not in their great houſe, unſanctified veſſels, for which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs they find ſome uſe?</p>
            <p>Altho' virtue is very deſirable among men, as it adds to their uſefulneſs in all the various concerns of life, yet we muſt not put away thoſe perſons that appear not to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs it. All mankind are veſſels in the houſe of the great maſter, he hath thoſe of gold, of ſilver, of wood, and of earth; he has his veſſels of honour and of diſhonour, and they are all uſed by him according to their fitneſs for his purpoſes.</p>
            <p>At the time John wrote his revelations, the Chriſtians were numerous: there were ſeven churches in Aſia; and yet only two of them that were not rebuked, ſome of them very ſeverely, many great evils had crept in among them. Had the apoſtles ſeen it were poſſible to prevent thoſe evils, there is no doubt but they would have uſed means for the purpoſe. If they had ever excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and it was well adapted for this end, there muſt have been great remiſſneſs in the churches to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted evils to have gotten to ſuch a heighth; but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuppoſe during the life of John the Divine, any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were omitted that were proper to preſerve the church pure, and therefore the churches could not have excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. And it deſerves eſpecial notice, that this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere reprehenſion of our Lord, was the effects of his love, ſuch as I love I rebuke and chaſten, be zealous therefore and repent. We may therefore fairly infer, that thoſe men tho' wicked, being the objects of the love of Jeſus, were permitted to remain in that ſituation, which was the moſt likely to favour their reformation: that ſituation is the outward church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I truſt it is already proved, that diſowning cannot be reconciled with the great principle upon which Chriſt
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035015_0026_0FFFE974C6ABF648"/>
came into the world. Had it even appeared, that in ſome inſtances it was practiſed in the days of the apoſtles, that would not make wrong right. Many of the primitive Chriſtians had belonged to the church of the Phariſees, and as excommunication was a part of their diſcipline, ſo thoſe converts might have carried with them a prepoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in favour of the practice. We read that Diotrephes, loving to have the pre-eminence, caſt ſome out of the church. This is the only plain inſtance mentioned in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an excommunication, and which was cenſured by John; but as is above obſerved, if in other inſtances it had been practiſed in the church, and that it was what eccleſiaſtical writers ſuppoſe it to have been, aſſigning men over to the Devil, with all the curſes of the Moſaic law denounced againſt them; what have we to do with this Judaiſm? Are we under that diſpenſation? And is it not ſurpriſing, that Barclay ſhould have produced the curſes of the Moſaic law, to illuſtrate, or to prove diſowning to be agreeable to the nature of the goſpel? If it be juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiable to curſe a man for ſome horrid crime, did Moſes, or the apoſtle Paul, ever mean, that all the curſes of the law ſhould be pronounced upon every member of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, who ſhould defend his own life, or his friends, or the government under which he lived, or who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a woman except of a particular tribe? The goſpel is not curſing, but bleſſing, and doing good even to ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>Diſowning even in criminal caſes is a remnant of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm. The Pharaſaical church diſowned for things inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and praiſe-worthy, and it will always reduce that ſociety who practiſes it to a reſemblance with them. Such will ſtrain at a gnat and ſwallow a camel. Innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will be diſowned, and ſinners remain in the church: the rules operate thus unavoidably. Many have been dealt with for that which was not ſinful, who yet have been made ſinners before the meeting had done with them. There is ſcarce a member of the ſociety who has not heard of the famous, or rather infamous George Keith; yet but few are acquainted with his caſe; and it calls for more pity, than has been generally beſtowed upon it. George was a man of great talents, and learning, an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent miniſter among Friends, and high in eſteem; but
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035015_0027_0FFFE976520E44C8"/>
holding an opinion reſpecting the future ſtate of the ſoul, different from what was generally held, and happening to expreſs this ſentiment in his public teſtimony, he was called to an account, as one not orthodox; he ſupported his opinion, as might be expected, and ſo a field of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy was opened. George being a man of high tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and thoſe who oppoſed him, men not thoroughly ſanctified, or they would have been wiſer than to have made a man an offender, for an opinion in metaphyſics. The breach, by degrees, grow wider, and wider, until George was at length diſowned. This, to a man who had been ſo much eſteemed, and one perhaps of an irritable temper, was more than he could bear: It ſo operated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his mind, that at length he caſt off the Quaker entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and oppoſed the ſociety with great acrimony. Many a man ſince his day has met with a fate ſomewhat ſimilar.</p>
            <p>Numbers have been dealt with for that which was not ſinful, and far the doing of which they were not ſorry; yet have been obliged to condemn it rather than be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned, and thereby were made ſinners, when they were not ſo before. In many inſtances, perſons have deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly planned a violation of the rules of the ſociety, and at the ſame time planned an acknowledgment for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; which has been received and all ſeemed well.</p>
            <p>Manifold are the evils that attend diſowning: it leads to inſincerity, ſubterfuge, and diſſimulation; and not only individual members are embarraſſed in this reſpect by it, but the ſociety at times are ſo likewiſe. A remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this kind happened ſome years ago.</p>
            <p>A number of wicked men, inhabitants of Lancaſter county, having an hatred for the Indians without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aſſembled together, and fell upon a ſettlement in ſaid county, and murdered every one who happened to be at home. The reſt of the tribe being diſperſed about the country, ſelling their baſkets and brooms; upon hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſad cataſtrophe which befel their relations, fled, ſome of them to Lancaſter, and begged the protection of the inhabitants. The beſt protection which could be given theſe poor creatures, was to lock them up in a priſon; but bolted doors and brick walls, were poor defence. Theſe ſoon gave way to thoſe deſperate men; and every man, woman, and child, incloſed within the walls, were murdered. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035015_0028_0FFFE97A977AB630"/>
of this wretched tribe collected together, and haſtened to Philadelphia, and put themſelves under the protection of the inhabitants. They were purſued, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes came to this City, giving an account that thoſe wicked men, not only vowed deſtruction to the Indians, but the death of ſeveral Friends likewiſe. At length, an expreſs came in the morning, before the dawning of the day, with information, that thoſe inſurgents were within a few miles of the city. The inhabitants were called up, and aſſembled in the ſtreets in great numbers, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation was held, to know what meaſures ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at this alarming criſis. What could be done? There was no doubt of the bloody deſign of the men: they had given an unqueſtionable proof of this. Nothing could be done, but either quietly give up the Indians, and ſome Friends as a ſacrifice, or gird on the ſword, and defend them. It was determined to defend them: great expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was uſed accordingly; and ſuch of the inhabitants who had ſome knowledge in military affairs, took the lead, and prepared for defence. Divers Friends joined in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary parade. Not an individual in the ſociety appeared to diſcountenance the thing. Why ſhould they? A formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble appearance was ſoon made, which ſo intimidated thoſe aſſaſſins, that they halted at ſome diſtance from the city, gave over their deſign, and returned home. Thus, this black and terrible ſtorm blew over—a ſtorm, which in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, ſeemed to portend ſomething more deſperate and bloody, than what had happened before, bad as it was. A calm enſued, and ſerious reflection returned to the people called Quakers. They ſaw their teſtimony was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated, and it became a queſtion of importance, to know what ſhould be done, to wipe away the reproach, as it was termed by ſome. Strange, indeed, that it ſhould be thought a reproach, for men who were not in danger themſelves, to ſtep forward, and at the riſk of their own lives, defend the lives of others! every other part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, would term it an high inſtance of heroic virtue. There were divers conferrences held upon this ſubject, in which the members of the ſociety were divided in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſome thought they ſhould proceed as the diſcipline directs; which requires an acknowledgment for ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, or that the ſociety ſhould bear a teſtimony againſt
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035015_0029_0FFFAE1E8438BFE0"/>
the violators of the rule. But there were other perſons, men of virtue, and ſuperior underſtanding, who could not proceed to condemn men for doing that, which, at the time of trial was generally approbated. Theſe Friends prevailed over the others, and the buſineſs ended: had the ſentiments of the other Friends prevailed, the ſociety would have merited the higheſt reproach.</p>
            <p>In many reſpects men are free agents. Were there ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral roads all leading to the ſame place, a traveller might take his choice. A man intending to viſit his friend may do it to day, or to-morrow, or at another time. If a man ſhould think the plain language moſt agreeable, he can uſe it. If he likes a plain dreſs, he can put it on. He may go to any place of worſhip which ſuits his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or accompliſh his marriage in a way he likes beſt. But with reſpect to reſiſtance or non-reſiſtance, the caſe is very different. A man cannot either reſiſt, or let it alone, as he may pleaſe: no man can ſay, I will not defend my life, or the life of my wife and children, or the life of my friend, or my country. And to make a rule, that a man ſhould not do it, is above all things the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and improper; much more ſo, than it would be, to make a rule, that a man ſhould neither rejoice nor be ſorrowful, upon any occaſion whatever. Men are not machines, or automatons: they cannot act, in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, even according to their own previous determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, much leſs according to that of others.</p>
            <p>Since the people called Quakers firſt came forth, the evils occaſioned by their diſcipline, to many families, and individuals, have been numerous<note n="*" place="bottom">Oh! how great has been the anguiſh which ſome perſons have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured on this account. The author, ſome years ago, ſpent about a week with two friends, a man and his wife, who were excommunicated, the man was diſowned for his attachment to his country during the American revolution, though he had done nothing contrary to the rules of the ſociety, being an eminent public Friend, and as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a man as the writer ever knew: his wife was diſowned becauſe ſhe loved her huſband, and could not join the meeting in their cenſure againſt him: ſhe was an amiable woman, and an approved miniſter. This circumſtance of excommunication, was ſo ſevere an affliction to her, ſhe being a very tender, delicate, and weakly woman, as that it encreaſed her complaints; and her huſband told the writer whilſt he was in their family that he was aſſured it would coſt him the loſs of his wife. Some time after the author had returned home, he ſaw this Friend in this city, and was informed by him, that his wife was dead, and that her death was occaſioned, or haſtened by the circumſtance above mentioned.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:035015_0030_0FFFE97F84C924B8"/>To require one uniform ſentiment, and line of conduct, of every individual, is very injudicious. In this caſe, men nave not liberty for the free exerciſe of that underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſtowed by the Deity upon them; when at the ſame time, there is ſcarce any ſubject whatever, upon which men will not differ in opinion. The occaſions for cenſure, according to the diſcipline are ſo numerous, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to expect any other than that great numbers will get entangled therein. There are the tythe and church rates in England, marrying perſons of another ſociety, or marrying a member of the ſociety not according to the rules of the ſociety, paying a tax for military purpoſes, or paying a fine for non-compliance with the laws, or defending the government under which a man lives. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things are contrary to the diſcipline; but for violating the rules of the ſociety in the above caſes, many reſpectable characters have been diſowned.</p>
            <p>This eſſay is to ſhow that diſowning is wrong in any caſe; but to diſown a man for defending his life, or the life of his friend, or the government under which he lives, are extraordinary caſes. The people called Quakers, from the firſt, have been advocates for government, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that it is a divine ordinance; have held the higheſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in government; hold large property; claim of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment a protection for their perſons and property, and yet if a member of the ſociety ſhould join with his fellow-citizens in ſupporting this government, in the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way in which in extreme caſes it can be maintained, this man is diſowned. They bear a teſtimony againſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive war, and yet admit the neceſſity of government. I aſk them, if government itſelf is not a defenſive war? Is it not under an abſolute neceſſity to lay hold on the wicked diſturbers of its peace, and to puniſh them, ſome by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement to hard labour, and others by putting them to death? I will grant all this may be done without an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent warfare: there may be no military parade. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an armed banditti ſhould aſſemble, as in the affair of the riot before mentioned, and ſhould be determined to maſſacre the citizens; what is to be done in this caſe? Suppoſing all the officers of the government were of the people called Quakers, what would they do? They would be under an abſolute neceſſity of violating their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035015_0031_0FFFE982EE524AA8"/>
I may be aſked how I know that would be the caſe?— might not divine providence interpoſe? Divine providence might interpoſe: far be it from me to ſet limits to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection But I aſk, why is government inſtituted? Might not divine providence interpoſe and prevent thoſe evils which government is intended to ſuppreſs? The forming a government, ariſes from the probability of a combination of wicked men to do miſchief; and to repel ſuch attacks it is ordained. It would ſeem ſtrange, that a perſon ſhould take on him an office of a coerſive nature, and yet when an occaſion offered for exerting this power, he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it, on a preſumption that divine providence might interpoſe, and render his exertions unneceſſary. If thoſe were his ſentiments, why hold the office? If government is a divine ordinance, it cannot be a want of confidence in divine protection, to uſe means for its ſupport.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a man was alarmed at midnight, by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of villains, who meant to rob and murder him, his wife and children; the diſcipline ſays, in effect, he muſt ſubmit to it, rather than prevent it by violence; and if the man could prevent it no other way than by the death of thoſe men, and ſhould ſlay them, he muſt condemn his conduct, or he is liable to be diſowned.</p>
            <p>This doctrine of non-reſiſtance does not ſtand upon the ſame ground as other doctrines do. A man may change his opinion from time to time, and as he changes, may be eſteemed a proper member of that ſociety, whoſe doctrines correſpond with his own; but with reſpect to non-reſiſtance, the criterion of fellowſhip is made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, not in ſentiment, but in ſo acting, as not one man in an hundred thouſand could act, were he brought to the teſt; and thoſe very men, who excommunicate for ſelf-defence, would do the ſame thing, were the trial brought home to themſelves. Muſt not that diſcipline then be founded in error, which requires an impoſſibility?</p>
            <p>It is agreed that government is a divine ordinance: the people called Quakers admit it. I truſt it is here ſhewn that government cannot exiſt without defence, the ſword being its ſinews. Government in its eſſence is a defenſive war; a defenſive war therefore of that kind is not ſinful.</p>
            <p>But tho' a defence of this nature is not ſinful, yet our bleſſed Lord has pointed to a ſtate more deſirable, even
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035015_0032_0FFFE984774DE9C8"/>
that in which there is no ſtrife—a ſtate of abſolute chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian perfection. And, as he ſaid upon another occaſion, ſo let it be ſaid upon this occaſion, he that is able to receive it, let him receive it; but few among the profeſſors of chriſtianity, ſince the coming of Chriſt, have been able to receive it. It is a different thing from embracing a ſyſtem of religious tenets, which may render a man a member of that ſociety, which is diſtinguiſhed for holding them. To be a chriſtian, is to be made a new creature; it is to experience a thorough ſanctification; being inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, ſuch as Chriſt was, and thereby manifeſting an outward conformity to the great example ſet us by him. This ſtate is not to be attained inſtantly, even by thoſe who ſincerely wiſh to attain it: It is therefore as unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to expect that all who profeſs the chriſtian name, ſhould, in all caſes, act the part of perfect chriſtians, as it would be, to expect that a new born babe, ſhould poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs all the faculties, and bodily ſtrength, of a man in the prime of life. As it is only the perfect man in Chriſt who reſiſteth no evil, ſo to expect this of all, under pain of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, is to expect children to read, who have never learned their letters, and yet, for their deficiency, to expel them the college.</p>
            <p>The impropriety of diſowning, has been diſcuſſed, chiefly upon the principle of its being ſuppoſed a prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of the Church of Chriſt. But there are ſome that approve it, who found their opinion upon other grounds: they will not contend, that Friends are the pure Church of Chriſt; but they ſay, that all ſocieties have a right to lay down ſuch rules as they may think proper, for the well-ordering of the body, and for a teſt of chriſtian fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip: that all who do not comply with thoſe rules, have no reaſon to complain when they are diſowned, as they ſhould not have violated them. Friends of this deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription, do not ſuppoſe that a teſtimony given againſt ſuch who tranſgreſs, implies an excluſion from heaven, they yet contend, it is expedient to keep up the rules of the ſociety. Here are two kinds of men, who differ widely in their principles, yet practically agree. Thoſe who believe the ſociety of Friends are the Church of Chriſt, that they have the mind of Chriſt, and that diſowning neceſſarily implies an excluſion from heaven, are, according to the ancient
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035015_0033_0FFFE986E0FD9650"/>
principle laid down by Barclay, the true and orthodox Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. The others who do not ſuppoſe the ſociety are the pure Church, who do not pretend to binding, and looſing in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and on earth, are moſt catholic and modeſt. But let me aſk thoſe Friends, ſuppoſing a number of men were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves into a religious ſociety, for the purpoſes of improvement in piety and virtue, would the preſent diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Friends be the moſt proper rules to produce this effect? Would they agree, that no one among them ſhould marry a perſon of any other ſociety, tho' ever ſo amiable, under pain of being expelled from the body; nor even a member of their own ſociety, unleſs they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed their marriage agreeable to one particular form? that no man ſhould defend his own life, nor the life of his friend, nor the government under which he lived, nor pay taxes for military purpoſes, nor a fine for not complying with the laws in certain caſes? that no man ſhould publiſh a religious, or political treatiſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſent of the ſociety, under the penalty of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled from the body? Can it be ſuppoſed, that any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men of ſound underſtanding, would, in the preſent day, lay down ſuch a plan, and make a compliance with thoſe rules the teſt of chriſtian fellowſhip? If then it is impoſſible to ſuppoſe ſuch a caſe, are they wiſe, who make thoſe rules the teſt of chriſtian fellowſhip, merely becauſe they were made the conditions of fellowſhip by their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors? How much more reaſonable would it be in them to ſay, the deſign of this inſtitution is, that we may be mutually inſtrumental in promoting the temporal and eternal felicity one of another. We feel the importance of a virtuous life, we will therefore uſe all the means with which divine providence may favour us ſolely for this end. If then a brother ſhould be overtaken in a fault, we will endeavour to reſtore ſuch a one in the ſpirit of meekneſs, conſidering ourſelves, leſt we alſo be tempted; but in no caſe whatever, ſhall any one be expelled from the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, leſt it ſhould prove his ruin. How greatly prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble would ſuch a ſyſtem of church government be? How much better adapted to the purpoſes of religious aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? How perfectly correſponding with the goſpel of our Lord and Saviour, and the great end and deſign of his coming? Such then is the plan of the religious ſociety of Free-Quakers in the city of Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:035015_0034_0FFFE9886A8C0760"/>It may be objected to the foregoing, that if every man is to enjoy his opinions without cenſure, he muſt be at liberty to publiſh or to preach them, and that this would render the ſociety, rather a Bable, than a Chriſtian church.</p>
            <p>ANSWER.</p>
            <p>The moſt perfect plan that can be formed for a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſociety is liable to ſome inconveniences; but thoſe inconveniences are to be ſubmitted to, in order to avoid greater. The evils of diſowning are manifeſted in the foregoing treatiſe. Although the right of individuals are to be maintained, yet the church has its prerogative alſo, which is that of determining, whether what is offered to them is edifying or otherwiſe: here wiſdom is neceſſary, mutual love and forbearance ought to be exerciſed; and although the individuals who compoſe a ſociety, may differ in opinion in leſſer matters, yet if the love and fear of the Lord prevail, they will be favoured with diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo as to encourage that which is good and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and ſuppreſs that which is otherwiſe. It does not then follow, that becauſe no one ſhall be diſowned, that therefore that which is evidently of evil tendency is to be received, or countenanced. A variety of opinions may prevail, yet perfect order and decency may be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the church. After all the pains taken by the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſocieties in Chriſtendom to preſerve what each of them call orthodoxy, yet contradiction frequently appears. If then, a diverſity of ſentiment is unavoidable, may it not as well be admitted, and acquieſced in? Is it not a vain attempt to aim at that which is impoſſible? And may not a variety of opinions be made an occaſion of mutual love, forbearance, and charity? and ſo a means of manifeſting more conſpicuouſly, the graces of the goſpel? Religion conſiſteth more in love to the Lord, and to one another, than in ſameneſs of opinion: the latter is deſirable, but not eſſential: it may happen where there is but little vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and on the other hand, there may be a diverſity of ſentiments accompanied with a virtuous life this is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable. Such then is that which is propoſed and deſired by the religious ſociety called Free Quakers.</p>

            <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>ON a review of the foregoing, the author expects he ſhall give offence to Friends. He has endeavoured to lay waſte that which by ſome is held ſacred; the diſcipline in their opinion, being of divine origin. Numbers, both men and women, who are virtuous, and ſincere, make the maintaining thoſe rules a great part of their religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern: for this do they croſs ſea and land, and undergo great difficulty, dangers and hardſhip. What can the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then expect, but that he ſhould be eſteemed an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to truth, and even reviled by ſome? But the motive to this publication is known to the ſearcher of hearts: the author believes, that all men will be called to account for their deeds, whether they be good or evil. Under an impreſſion of this ſolemn truth, and for the cauſe and teſtimony of Jeſus, is this publication ſent forth. If it is now rejected, as there is reaſon to expect it will be, the writer believes, the day is coming, when the nature of the goſpel will be better underſtood, and when the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical government of the people called Quakers will be reformed, and grounded upon principles more evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical than at preſent it is. May Jeſus, for the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his people, haſten the day.—<hi>Amen.</hi>
