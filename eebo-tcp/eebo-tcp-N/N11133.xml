            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THOUGH the author of the following diſcourſe might avail himſelf of the common apology for publiſhing Sermons, viz. The importunity of friends; yet he ſhould have been averſe to this publication had it not been that the ſubject and occaſion gave him opportunity to caſt in his mite for the relief of the oppreſſed and injured Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, whoſe cauſe he thought himſelf bound to plead, and to bear his teſtimony againſt the cruel and barbarous Slave Trade. He is ſenſible the arguments on that ſubject might be treated, more at large, and to better advantage; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to treat the ſubject only in a moral and religious view, and he could only hint a few thoughts on <hi>that</hi> branch of the argument, in a ſhort diſcourſe in which ſeveral other things were conſidered.</p>
            <p>The author pretends not to pronounce on the impropriety of the Slave Trade in a political view—this would be out of his province: but he would ſubmit to the gentlemen of the law, whether the admiſſion of ſlavery in a government ſo democratical as that of the colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> doth not tend to the ſubverſion of its happy conſtitution. Be this as it may, if the Slave Trade is contrary to the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is the law of God, it is more than time it was effectually prohibited, and until that is done we, are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God for all the ſufferings which we bring upon the unhappy Negroes; for whatever difficulties there may be in the way of freeing the ſlaves already among us (as there are confeſſedly ſome) theſe cannot be reaſonably advanced, againſt prohibiting the importation of more. Should it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:014100_0004_0F92DB43D1D56248"/>
that preaching and printing againſt the ſlave trade will tend to encourage ſervants in diſobedience to their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and ſupport them in diſorder and rebellion, the author need only reply, that though he is fully convinced that there is no more reaſon or juſtice in our enſlaving the Africans than there would be in their enſlaving us, yet he thinks the Negro ſlaves among us are bound by motives of duty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to "be obedient to their own maſters," and to "ſhew all good fidelity" in their ſervice, agreeable to apoſtolic di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and as the moſt probable method to make their yoke eaſy, and pave the way for obtaining their freedom, or, if not their own, that of their poſterity.</p>
            <p>He would be ſorry to be, even the innocent, occaſion of diſorders in families, but ſhould this be the caſe it is no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient objection againſt aſſerting the truth on this ſubject: there is, perhaps, ſcarce any doctrine of chriſtianity but what hath been made the occaſion of ſin, through the perverſeneſs of wicked men; eſpecially hath this been true of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of grace—Muſt the doctrines of grace therefore not be preached?</p>
            <p>In fine, it is ardently wiſhed that the divine bleſſing may attend the addreſs to the ſlaves of ſin and ſatan—that they may eſcape from their bondage, and be made partakers of the glorious liberty of the ſons of God.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O aſſert and maintain the cauſe of Liberty, is far from being pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Britiſh colonies in North-America, at the preſent day; our venerable Anceſtors ſought and found it in this weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern world, and at no ſmall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of their treaſure and blood, purchaſed it for, and conveyed it down to us. The moſt diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and worthy characters in Great-Britain have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronized, ſpoke and written, and ſome of them even died, in defence of the ſacred rights of Liberty!
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014100_0006_0F92DB4554697E90"/>
Thoſe antient, renowned States of Greece and Rome, in their moſt flouriſhing condition, received their greateſt luſture from a ſet of pubilc ſpirited, patriotic men, whoſe hearts glowed with the love of liberty, who were her defenders and ſupporters, and whoſe names and writings are venerable to diſtant ages and nations of men, even long after thoſe once mighty empires are gone to decay, and periſhed through neglecting to follow the maxims of thoſe wiſe men, thoſe patrons of liberty, who pointed out the path to laſting empire and glory.</p>
            <p>INDEED, the ſacred cauſe of liberty ever hath been, and ever will be venerable in every part of the world where knowledge and learning flouriſh, and men are ſuffered to think and ſpeak for themſelves. Yea, it muſt be added, that Heaven hath appeared in the cauſe of liberty, and that in the moſt open and deciſive manner: For this, the Son of God was manifeſt in the fleſh, that he might deſtroy the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of ſin and ſatan, aſſert and maintain the equal government of his Father, redeem the guilty ſlaves from their more than Egyptian bondage, and cauſe the oppreſſed to go free.</p>
            <p>THE whole plan of Redemption, which is by far the greateſt and moſt noble of all the works of God made known to us, to which they all tend, and in which they centre, is compriſed in procuring, preaching and beſtowing liberty to the captives, and the opening of the priſon to the bound: And the goſpel of our ſalvation is principally taken up in deſcribing that glorious liberty which is purchaſed for ſinners by the Son of God—the bondage from which he redeem us—the ranſom which he paid
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014100_0007_0F92DB460BD367A0"/>
for our redemption—the way to obtain and enjoy this Liberty, and in ſtating and urging the moſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and endearing arguments, and motives, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us to come out of our bondage, and accept of the Liberty wherewith Chriſt maketh his people free. It is on this account denominated <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or <hi>Good News;</hi> and is to the ſinner, like the jubilee trumpet to the enſlaved Iſraelite.</p>
            <p>BUT it muſt be remembered, that in proportion as Liberty is excellent, and to be deſired on the one hand, ſo ſlavery or bondage is terrible and to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided on the other. Theſe are juſtly eſteemed the two extremes of happineſs and miſery in Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It will not therefore be thought foreign to our ſubject, or an unſuitable attempt upon the preſent occaſion, to enquire into the various ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of theſe two oppoſite terms, as they are uſed in the ſeveral kinds of ſociety with which we are concerned, eſpecially as they are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in our text as oppoſed to each other, and it is intimated, that the moſt fond aſſertors of liberty, may after all, be themſelves in a ſtate of the moſt abject ſlavery and bondage.</p>
            <p>LIBERTY may be defined in general, <hi>a power of action,</hi> or a certain ſuitableneſs or prep aredneſs for exertion, and a freedom from force, or hindrance from any external cauſe; <hi>Liberty</hi> when predicated of man as a moral agent, and accountable creature, is that ſuitableneſs or preparedneſs to be the ſubject of voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or exerciſes of will, with reference to moral objects; by the influence of motives, which we find belongeth to all men of common capacity, and who are come to the years of underſtanding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:014100_0008_0F92DB46C9E0FDE0"/>THIS Liberty is oppoſed to that want of capacity, by which there is a total ignorance of all moral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and ſo, a natural incapacity of chuſing with regard to them. <hi>Again,</hi> the term Liberty is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed to denote a power of <hi>doing as we pleaſe,</hi> or of executing our acts of choice; this refers prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to external action, or bodily motion; and is oppoſed to force or oppoſition:— thus the priſoner who is bound in fetters, and ſecured with bolts and bars of a priſon, is not at liberty to go out, he is deprived of this kind of liberty, and is in bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, Liberty may be conſidered and defined with reference to ſociety:— Mankind in a ſtate of nature, or conſidered as individuals, antecedent to the ſuppoſition of all ſocial connections, are not the ſubjects of <hi>this freedom,</hi> but it is abſolutely neceſſary to the well being of ſociety.</p>
            <p>HUMAN ſociety is founded originally in compact, or mutual agreement. All the larger circles of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety originate from family connection or mutual compact between huſband and wife; and mutual compact neceſſarily implieth certain rules and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations which neither of the parties may violate with impunity.</p>
            <p>IN the early ages of the world, before vice and wickedneſs had corrupted and deſtroyed the original natural form of civil government, as a fine writer of our own nation expreſſeth it;—"each patriarch ſat king, prieſt and prophet of his growing ſtate." <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. POPE.</note> But when the wickedneſs of man was become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014100_0009_0F92DB4795DC7F20"/>
great, and every imagination of his heart evil, <hi>the earth was filled with violence:</hi> by the daring efforts of wicked men to ſubvert the original ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent form of ſociety, and introduce deſpotic rule where the lives and happineſs of many, even whole kingdoms ſhould depend on the will, and be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the pleaſure of <hi>one man.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Geneſis vi. 4, 5, and x. 8, 9.</note> But as ſociety evidently originates from mutual compact or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo it is equally evident, that the members who compoſe it, unite in one common intereſt; each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual gives up all private intereſt that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the general good, the intereſt of the whole body: And, conſidered as a member of ſociety, he hath no other intereſt but that of the whole body, of which he is a member: The caſe is ſimilar to that of a trading company, poſſeſſed of a common ſtock, into which every one hath given his proportion; the intereſt of this common ſtock is now the property of the whole body, and each individual is benefited in proportion to the good of the whole, and is a good or bad member in proportion as he uniteth to, or counteracteth the intereſt of the body. And thus it is in the preſent caſe: civil ſociety is formed for the good of the whole body of which it is compoſed. Hence the welfare and proſperity of the ſociety is the <hi>common good,</hi> and every individual is to ſeek and find his happineſs in the welfare of the whole, and every thing to be tranſacted in ſociety, is to be regulated by this ſtandard.—In particular, all the laws and rules formed in ſuch ſociety muſt tend to promote the general welfare; this is the teſt by which they muſt be tried, and by which they muſt ſtand or fall; all regulations in the body, and all rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014100_0010_0F92DB491F9488A0"/>
to individuals, muſt be determined agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this.—Thoſe who ſeek and promote the public intereſt, are to be eſteemed and rewarded; and thoſe who counteract and oppoſe it, muſt be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in proportion to the injury aimed or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the public welfare.</p>
            <p>WE may add, that as the good of the public is the end and deſign of all good laws and rules, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in a well regulated ſociety, ſo they muſt be enacted by the public, <hi>i. e.</hi> by the wiſeſt and beſt men in the ſociety, appointed by the body for this purpoſe.—Men who beſt underſtand the public good, and have a common intereſt with the body, and who are above the narrow purſuits of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intereſt.—If Laws and rules in ſociety are eſtabliſhed by any man, or body of men, who have not a common intereſt with the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the members, but the contrary, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent at firſt view, they will be expoſed to act in oppoſition to the general good.—None therefore but the repreſentatives of the whole body, in whom as far as poſſible, the intereſt of all ranks is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are proper to make laws for the regulation of ſociety. For the ſame reaſon, thoſe who are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the laws, ſhould be appointed in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and by ſuch authority, as in the beſt poſſible way ſecures their attachment to the general good: And, the members of civil community who are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to <hi>ſuch laws</hi> and oppoſe the adminiſtration of <hi>ſuch authority</hi> agreeable to them, deſerve puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to the degree of their oppoſition, and their opportunity to promote, or counteract the general good. The crime of every private mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in oppoſing the intereſt of ſociety, is greater
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014100_0011_0F92DB49C9F3ED88"/>
than that of oppoſition to the intereſt of an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, as much (other things being equal) as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the ſociety is greater and of more worth than that of an individual.</p>
            <p>IN this view of our ſubject, we may form ſome conception of the crime of a civil ruler, who ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth the public intereſt committed to his truſt by ſociety, for the ſake of his own private gain;—who betrayeth that ſacred depoſit, to gratify his nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſordid thirſt of wealth or honour:—We may form <hi>ſome conceptions</hi> of his crime, but we want words to paint the horrors of it.—If a private man is without excuſe, and is juſtly doomed to die as a traitor and rebel, when he deſerts his country's cauſe, or baſely betrays it, though to ſave his life, what epithets of laſting infamy are black enough to draw the picture of the inhuman paricide, who baſks in the glare of riches and grandeur, at the expence of the public welfare: Yea, may we not depend that heaven itſelf will aſſert the cauſe of liberty, defend the injured innocent, and diſcharge its thunderbolts on the guilty head of the oppreſſor, red with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common wrath, to blaſt the man that owes his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his country's ruin?</p>
            <p>FROM this general view of ſociety, we are led to obſerve, that civil liberty doth not conſiſt in a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from all law and government,—but in a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from unjuſt law and tyrannical government:—In freedom, to act for the general good, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring the diſpleaſure of the ruler or cenſure of the law:—And civil ſlavery or bondage conſiſteth in being obliged either by a bad ſet of laws, or bad and tyrannical rulers, to act in oppoſition to the good
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014100_0012_0F92DB4CE4DDD9D8"/>
of the whole, or ſuffer puniſhment for our ſteady at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the general good.</p>
            <p>RELIGIOUS LIBERTY is the opportunity of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and practiſing <hi>that religion</hi> which is agreeable to our judgment and conſciences, without interruption or puniſhment from the civil magiſtrate. And reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious bondage or ſlavery, is when we may not do this without incurring the penalty of laws, and being expoſed to ſuffer in our perſons or property.—</p>
            <p>ECCLESIASTICAL LIBERTY, is ſuch a ſtate of order and regularity in chriſtian ſociety, as gives every member opportunity to fill up his place in acting for the general good of that great and holy ſociety to which the true church of Chriſt belongs, and of which they are a part. And <hi>eccleſiaſtical ſlavery,</hi> is ſuch a ſtate as ſubjects ſome branches of this ſociety to the will of others, (not to the good of the whole glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kingdom) and puniſheth them with the loſs of ſome, or all of the priviledges of eccleſiaſtical ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, if they diſobey ſuch tyrannical will, however they may act for the good of the whole, and ſo, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the law of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, there is another kind of liberty and bondage, which deſerve particular attention in this place, only as they are eſpecially pointed to in our text, but as being of principle concern to men, they may be denominated <hi>ſpiritual liberty and bondage.</hi>— This liberty is ſpoken of by our Lord, John viii. 32, 36. Ye ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you <hi>free,</hi>—if the Son make you <hi>free,</hi> ye ſhall be <hi>free</hi> indeed. And, by the Apoſtle, Rom. vi, 18. Being then made <hi>free</hi> from ſin, ye became the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of righteouſneſs. Gallat. v. 1. ſtand faſt in
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014100_0013_0F92DB4E4BAE5370"/>
the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us <hi>free.</hi> 2. Cor. iii. 17. Where the ſpirit of the Lord is, there is <hi>liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SPIRITUAL LIBERTY then, is freedom or readineſs and engagedneſs of ſoul in the love and ſervice of God and Chriſt, and diſcharge of the various branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of chriſtian duty.</p>
            <p>SPIRITUAL BONDAGE, takes place in the dominion of ſin and ſatan in the ſoul, or that ſtate of alliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God and Chriſt, to which all impenitent ſinners are ſubject.</p>
            <p>THIS brief view of the various ſignifications of the terms <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>ſlavery,</hi> might be uſefully improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in many inferences and remarks. I will detain you only with thoſe which follow.</p>
            <p>INFERENCE firſt.</p>
            <p>IF civil liberty conſiſteth in acting freely, and without conſtraint, or fear of puniſhment, for the public good, and tyranny and ſlavery are the reverſe of this,—it followeth, that every one who acts for the general good of ſociety, is entitled to the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and aſſiſtance of the body. None can juſtly fall under the frowns of ſociety, but thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſome private benefit to the public welfare: And every ſociety which ſuffers, or even <hi>connives at</hi> the practice, in any of its members, of taking away the liberty or property of thoſe who have done nothing againſt the public intereſt, connives at injuſtice, and is ſo far guilty of tyranny and oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:014100_0014_0F92DB4E87502970"/>OF all the enjoyments of the preſent life that of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is the moſt precious and valuable, and a ſtate of ſlavery the moſt gloomy to a generous mind—to enſlave men, therefore, who have not forfeited their liberty, is a moſt attrocious violation of one of the firſt laws of nature, it is utterly inconſiſtant with the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principle and chief bond of union by which ſociety originally was, and all free ſocieties ever ought to be formed. I mean that of a general union for the common good, by which every individual is ſecure of public approbation ſo long as he acts for the public welfare.</p>
            <p>COULD it be thought then that ſuch a palpable vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the law of nature, and of the fundamental principles of ſociety, would be practiſed by individuals &amp; connived at, &amp; tolerated by the public in Britiſh A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica! this land of liberty where the ſpirit of freedom glows with ſuch ardour.—Did not obſtinate inconteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble facts compel me, I could never believe that Britiſh Americans would be guilty of ſuch a crime—I mean that of <hi>the horrible ſlave-trade,</hi> carried on by numbers and tolerated by authority in this country. It is not my deſign to enter largely into the arguments on this ſubject; all who agree to the general principles alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy laid down, will join in pronouncing the African ſlave-trade <hi>a flagrant violation of the law of nature, of the natural rights of mankind.</hi> What have the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Africans committed againſt the inhabitants of the Britiſh colonies and iſlands in the Weſt-Indies; to authorize <hi>us</hi> to ſeize them, or bribe them to ſeize one another, and tranſport them a thouſand leagues into a ſtrange land, and enſlave them for life? For life did I ſay? From generation to generation to the end of time! However the cruel bondage is ſomewhat light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014100_0015_0F92DB4F33C22EE0"/>
in theſe northern colonies, through the kindneſs and lenity of the maſters—kindneſs and lenity, I mean as far as theſe terms are applicable in the preſent caſe; I ſay, however the cruel bondage of the poor Africans is ſomewhat lightened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; if we would for a juſt eſtimate of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſlave trade we muſt be acquainted with the method of procuring the ſlaves—tranſporting them, and their treatment in the Weſt-Indies, to which, and the ſouthern colonies a great part of them are tranſported, and where the nature of the ſlave trade is <hi>conſiſtently</hi> diſplayed.</p>
            <p>WHEN the Guinea traders arrive on that coaſt if the trading natives are not already ſupplied with a proper number of ſlaves, they go into the back ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and either by ſecret ambuſh, or open force, ſeize a ſufficient number for their purpoſe; in accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which great numbers, many times are ſlain, and whole towns laid in aſhes. When taken they are driven like cattle to the ſlaughter, to the ſea ſhore, and ſold to our Guinea traders, often for a ſmall quantity of that ſoul and body deſtroying liquor, <hi>rum,</hi> qualified however with a large proportion of water, by which the ignorant natives are impoſed upon, cheated, and diſappointed.—The poor ſlaves are bound and thruſt into the filthy holds of the ſhips— men, women, fathers, daughters, mothers, ſons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction; where they are obliged to <hi>rot together</hi> thro' a long ſea paſſage, which happily releives num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers from more intolerable ſufferings on the ſhore.—</p>
            <p>WHEN they are arrived at the Weſt-Indies they are again <hi>expoſed</hi> in the markets, and ſold like beaſts of burden to the inhuman planters, by whoſe cruelty many more of them periſh. It is ſuppoſed that out
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014100_0016_0F92DB4FDB6F9328"/>
of near an hundred thouſand which are computed to be tranſported from Africa annually, almoſt one third periſh on the paſſage and in ſeaſoning; and thoſe unhappy numbers whoſe hard lot it is to be doomed to longer ſlavery, wear out their wretched lives in miſery which wants a name. The Egyptian bondage was a ſtate of liberty and eaſe compared with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of theſe unhappy ſufferers; and for a trifling offence their barbarous maſters will ſeize and butcher them, with as little, and in many inſtances, perhaps leſs ceremony or regret than you would take away the life of one of your domeſtic animals. It would be an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to your underſtandings to enter on a long courſe of reaſoning to prove the injuſtice and cruelty of ſuch a trade as this. Let us for once put ourſelves in the place of the unhappy Negroes. Suppoſe a number of ſhips arrived from Africa at a neighbouring ſea port to purchaſe ſlaves, and tranſport them to that diſtant and to us inhoſpitable climate and thoſe burning ſands—put the caſe that a prevailing party in the neighbouring towns were ſo loſt to all ſenſe of public welfare and to the feelings of humanity as to accept their bribes and join with them to effect the ruin of their fellow men. Let <hi>this</hi> be the devoted town—and even now while you are met to aſſert and exerciſe that invaluable liberty which is the diſtinguiſhed glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Engliſhmen, the honour and ſafety of Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut; in this diſtined hour while your hearts glow with the love of liberty and exult in her poſſeſſion; behold this houſe ſurrounded, whole armies from the neighbouring towns ruſh on you, thoſe who reſiſt are at once overpowered by numbers and butchered, the ſurvivors, huſbands, wives, parents, children, breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, ſiſters, the ardent lover and his darling fair one, all ſeized, bound and driven away to the neighbouring
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014100_0017_0F92DB508BB37008"/>
ſea-port, where all ranged on the ſhore promiſcuouſly, in a manner that pity and modeſty relent to name: you are ſold for a trifling ſum, and ſee your inhuman purchaſers rejoiceing in their ſucceſs. But the time is come for a laſt farewell, you are deſtined to differnt ſhips bound to different and far diſtant coaſts, go huſbands and wives, give and receive the laſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace; parents bid a laſting adieu to your tender off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring. What can you ſay? What do to comfort or adviſe them? Their caſe and yours admit not of conſolation—go, mothers, weep out your ſorrows on the necks of your beloved daughters whom you have nurſed with ſo much care, and educated with ſuch delicacy; now they muſt go to a diſtant clime, to attend the nod of an imperious miſtreſs, covered with rags and filth (if covered at all) they muſt deſcend to the moſt ſervile and intolerable drudgery, and every the leaſt ſymptom of uneaſineſs at their hard uſuage, meet the frowns and ſuffer the mercileſs laſh of a cruel maſter.—But why ruminate on this; behold the inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man monſters tear you from your laſt embrace, bound in chains you are hurried to different veſſels, croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their holds and tranſported away forever from the ſight of all you love, to diſtant cruel lands, to live and die in ſlavery and bondage, without the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hope of ever enjoying the ſweets of liberty, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſiting your dear native country, with this only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, that your ſons and daughters are ſuffering the ſame cruel bondage, and that from you a race of abject ſlaves will, probably, be propagated down for hundreds of years! <hi>Such are the ſweets of this beloved ſlave trade!</hi> It is the ſame to the unhappy ſufferers now, that it would be to us if it was our own caſe; and the reaſons againſt it are as ſtrong and powerful as they would be then—in ſhort the man that can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014100_0018_0F92DB518D95F760"/>
attend to this ſubject and not feel the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of pity, or indignation, or both, appears to be ſunk quite below the feelings of humanity! Is it not high time for this colony to wake up and put an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual ſtop to the cruel buſineſs of ſtealing and ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our fellow men, ſo far as it can be ſtopped by one province?</p>
            <p>WITH what a very ill grace can we plead for ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry when <hi>we</hi> are the tyrants, when we are engaged in one united ſtruggle for the enjoyment of liberty; what inconſiſtence and ſelf-contradiction is this! Who can count us the true friends of liberty as long as we deal in, or publicly connive at ſlavery.—</p>
            <p>THE general aſſembly of a neighbouring colony<note n="*" place="bottom">Rhode-Iſland.</note> have prohibited the importation of Negro ſlaves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a large penalty, and have enacted that ſuch ſlaves ſhall be free as ſoon as they ſet foot on the ſhore within the colony. Can this Colony want motives from reaſon, juſtice, religion, or public ſpirit, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the example? When, O when ſhall the happy day come, that Americans ſhall be <hi>conſiſtently</hi> engaged in the cauſe of liberty, and a final end be put to the cruel ſlavery of our fellow men? Then may we not expect that our liberties will be eſtabliſhed on a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foundation and that Britiſh America and Engliſh liberty will flouriſh to the lateſt poſterity!</p>
            <p>INFERENCE 2. IF civil liberty conſiſteth in acting freely and without conſtraint or fear of puniſhment for the public good, and ſo, agreeable to the laws framed to promote and ſecure it, and civil bondage or ſlavery is the reverſe of this. We learn the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of intruſting thoſe, and none but thoſe, with
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:014100_0019_0F92DB522349B100"/>
the guardianſhip of our civil liberties who are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves free, who are not under the dominion of that ſordid ſelfiſhneſs and narrowneſs of ſoul by which they will betray their country, our dear Country for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle private profit or honor to themſelves.</p>
            <p>MEN who know the worth of public liberty, and are able and willing defenders of it, be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences what they may to their private intereſt, are the only proper perſons to be rulers or repreſentatives of this free and happy colony. In ſuch the votes of the freemen ſhould unite, without the leaſt regard to party, intereſt, or any private views, agreeable to the nature and ſolemnity of their oath, and as they value their ineſtimable liberties, and would dread to fall a helpleſs prey to tyranny and oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>INFERENCE 3. IF it is of ſuch importence that we enjoy and ſecure civil liberty, which reſpects only a comparatively ſmall circle of ſociety which muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, at the lateſt, with the cloſe of fleeting time; of what moment is it to us all, that we are the ſubjects of that ſpiritual liberty, which unites us to, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts us in the good of the whole kingdom of God our Saviour, and which ſhall laſt forever!</p>
            <p>IT is a juſt way of reaſoning in the preſent caſe, from the leſs to the greater, let me ſay then, with what aſtoniſhment and abhorrence ſhould we look on a perſon who chuſes ſlavery and bondage under the moſt cruel tyrant, with the certain proſpect of a ſhameful, painful death, by the hand of the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, rather than all the ſweets of Engliſh liberty!</p>
            <p>BUT with what an unſpeakable greater madneſs is be chargable who prefers the guilty ſlavery of ſin and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014100_0020_0F92DB52EA28F800"/>
ſatan, to the glorious, perfect liberty of the children of God! Yet how many make this fatal choice! How many too, who are at great expence and trouble in the cauſe of civil liberty and zealous aſſertors of it! What ſelf-contradiction and inconſiſtence is here! Is not this to ſtrain out a gnat and ſwallow a cammel? What is Engliſh liberty? What is American free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? When compared with the glorious liberty of the ſons of God? And what is ſlavery under the gauling yoke of oppreſſion, to the hard bondage of ſin and ſatan! Let the hitherto, willing ſlaves of ſin and ſatan then <hi>rouſe up,</hi> there is now an opportunity to eſcape from bondage; there is one come to preach deliverance to the captives, and the opening the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to them who are bound. Jeſus Chriſt the mighty king and Saviour, the ſcourge of tyrants, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſin and ſatan, the aſſertor, the giver and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter of original, perfect freedom; he ſets open your priſon doors, knocks off your chains, and calls you to come forth. Oh! What priſoner who will not leap for joy at the ſound of this jubilee trumpet, accept the offered pardon, embrace the given freedom,—bid adieu to ſlavery and bondage, and ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt makes his ſubjects free. Here the moſt perfect liberty may be enjoyed. The exalted king ſeeks and ſecures the public intereſt; to <hi>this</hi> all the branches of his good government and wiſe adminiſtration tend, and in this they centre, for <hi>this</hi> joy which was ſet before him, he came into our nature and world, and even endured the croſs and diſpiſed the ſhame.—All the ſubjects in this happy kingdom are united in the ſame honourable cauſe, to them their is neither Barbarian, Scythian, Greek, or Jew, bond or free, they are all one, in one cauſe, and purſue it animated by one ſpirit; they feel how good
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014100_0021_0F92DB5389BAA190"/>
and pleaſant it is for brethren to dwell together in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.—In vain ſhall the tyrant ſatan vent his impotent rage againſt theſe happy <hi>ſons of liberty:</hi> be wiſe in ſeaſon then, bid adieu to the kingdom of darkneſs, the cauſe of tyranny and oppreſſion, inliſt under the Captain of the Lords hoſt, fight under his banner, you may be ſure of victory, and liberty ſhall be your laſting reward, for whom the ſon maketh <hi>free</hi> ſhall be <hi>free indeed.</hi>
