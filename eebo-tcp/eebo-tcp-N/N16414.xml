            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE writing of the following pages was occaſioned by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a paragraph in a news paper, relative to a woman in the city who had deſtroyed herſelf on account of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity in marriage. The author reflecting how many there might probably be, who were completely wretched, and who, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, did not plunge themſelves into another world to avoid the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this, thought it might be a ſubject worthy the conſideration of every humane perſon; and therefore has, in the ſubſequent pages, ſet forth the miſery of marriage in thoſe who are unſuitably united together, and endeavoured to ſhow the cauſes of ſuch infelicity, and the lawfulneſs and neceſſity of divorce, in other caſes beſide thoſe at preſent admitted. And although no eſſay on this ſubject has yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in this country, that he has ſeen, yet this does not prove it unneceſſary; and, whatſoever may be the merits of the work, if it opens a way for abler diſcuſſion of the ſubject, the writer will not think his labour entirely loſt.</p>
            <p>ALL that he can ſay of his performance, is, that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to undertake it from a ſtrong ſympathetic feeling for the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſtreſſes of human nature; and has endeavoured to execute it in a manner moſt likely to communicate the ſame to his Readers. He has chiefly aimed at brevity and perſpicuity, and if he has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced any thing new, it is in the way of opinion only, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requeſts the attention of his Readers to the matter, and not to the manner, of his remarks. But if any ſhould think any thing in the former worthy of making objections to, the writer has more to ſay, but in regard to the latter, he only requeſts of the Public a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable reception.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>MERICA has been famous for her love of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and hatred of tyranny of every kind; ſhe has not only by arms expelled her foreign foes, but generouſly extended her liberality, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, even unto the African ſlaves. Therefore, it is hoped, the ſame ſpirit of indulgence will extend ſtill further—to thoſe unhappy individuals, mixed among every claſs of mankind, who are frequently united together in the worſt of bondage to each other; occaſioned by circumſtances not in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to foreſee, or prevent, at the time of their union; which ſhould entitle them to relief from humane legiſlators and the reſt of mankind. We believe it will be readily admitted, that there is no circumſtance in life, on which our happineſs ſo much depends, as being ſuitably united together in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; and that no foreſight that people are capable of, at that time, is ſufficient to foreſee, or prevent, the many cauſes that are likely to deſtroy the felicity of that union; and that it is equally certain, that various cauſes do deſtroy it, and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:021076_0004_0FB22FA987471150"/>render them completely miſerable; from hence ariſes the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of divorce in ſuch ſituations, under ſuch reſtrictions as may be deemed neceſſary.</p>
               <p>The large portion of moral eſſays generally taken up in lectures on the ſubject of marriage, ſhows of what conſequence that ſingle, important action of our lives is eſteemed to be to mankind; which could not be of ſo much importance if we were allowed to rectify paſt errors by future experience. But the whole of our inſtruction, on that head, generally amounts to little more than if ſuch inſtruction as this ſhould be given to a traveller in a ſtrange country: that in the midſt of the highway, that he muſt unavoidably paſs, there is a deep and dreadful pit, curiouſly covered from view, into which, if he falls, he can never extricate himſelf therefrom, but muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably die a miſerable death. And truly ſuch is the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage lot at preſent to many, and to more than can eaſily be conceived, becauſe the greateſt ſufferers thereby, for the moſt part, conceal their ſituation, to keep themſelves from being deſpiſed by the reſt.</p>
               <p>We ſhall recite, in the firſt place, the probable cauſes of ſuch infelicity; in the next place, the miſerable proſpect of an unhappy couple, and the evil they are the occaſion of, not only to themſelves but others; and laſtly, of the lawfulneſs and neceſſity of divorce. The caſes we ſhall briefly ſtate, by way of example, will be taken from the middling claſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as the neareſt repreſentation of the others. And we ſhall only mention the leading and principal diſpoſitions, and leave the judicious reader, from obſervations and reflections in his own mind, to purſue the deſcription more minutely.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, the unſuitableneſs ariſing from circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: as when a gentleman from the country, or farmer's ſon, marries a young woman educated in the city, perhaps of ſmaller fortune, but of genteel family, he takes her home; after the firſt formality of viſiting being over, the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of every thing around diſpleaſes her; ſhe cannot help, after a while, making remarks; ſometimes, perhaps, ſuch as theſe: of his want of nearneſs in his dreſs, of the furniture of his houſe, of the requiſites that are wanting on his table, of the indecency of his ſervants and domeſties, of the ruſticity of his neighbours and acquaintance. He thinks himſelf juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in retaliating, in ſome degree, in remarks on the need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs formality, appearances, dreſs and addreſs, of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; for the preſent it paſſes off, but the ſcene is again of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten renewed with more diſlike than before on each part: from remarks they go to diſpute, after a while to jeſt, ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule and contempt, and theſe, by imperceptible degrees, from
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:021076_0005_0FB22FAB06C2A6E0"/>time to time, as occaſion occurs. The ſervants, neighbours and relatives of the huſband, mock and ſneer at all the wife ſays or does; ſhe has the dairy, poultry and houſewiſery to manage and conduct in a manner ſhe never ſaw in her life, and is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to perform; her huſband complaining of her doing needleſs things and leaving the neceſſary undone, which equally diſpleaſes him. They diſagree in their humours about dreſs, table, recreations, ſervants and every thing. From the repetition of diſputes (which are the effect of their different feelings only) paſſions are exited in each, which were before unknown to either. They then mutually torment, thwart, plague, revile, and hate one another; and this, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, takes place in no long time after marriage. I need not add more. It is eaſy to conceive a great many different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of unſuitableneſs, ariſing from the ſame cauſe, that is, in the manner of their education, that ſooner or later has the ſame effect. But if they are well-bred people they conceal their ſituation from the world as much as poſſible.</p>
               <p>If a gentleman of good rank and education marries a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of mean birth, but ſuperior fortune, the caſe is no better: ſhe deſpiſes him for his notions of dignity and elegance that ſhe cannot comprehend; and he reproaches her for her mean, low conceptions and appearances, in every thing; ſhe cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures him for his want of wealth, and he retorts upon her for the want of every thing elſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, thoſe who marry of different profeſſions in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, although they may not be ſo zealous themſelves as to differ about it much at firſt; yet, when the warmth of their paſſion has abated, they will each of them feel their former prejudices, and their reſpective relatives, on each ſide, in all their ſeparate converſations with them, will imperceptibly, without deſign, inſpire each of them by degrees, with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation, diſlike, and contempt of the manners, cuſtoms, appearances and principles of each other; and each of them will be more and more inclined to vindicate their own. All the errors, faults, and misfortunes will be magnified and miſrepreſented, and charged upon each other by the friends of each party; which will, by degrees, create reflections; ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, diſlike and contempt will encreaſe, eſpecially if there is any harſhneſs of temper in either party, and falſhood, for the moſt part, will not be wanting on one ſide or other to keep up a ferment, until a ſteady hatred enſues.<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſteady hatred will always begin, as ſoon as the pain they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from each other is greater than the pleaſure.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, if a young couple marry without conſent of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents on each ſide, the conſequence is nearly the ſame as the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021076_0006_0FB22FAD2EA6A080"/>laſt; the animoſity of the friends of each party is greater; they refuſe to aſſiſt their children in a ſettlement in the world, but reflect on each other, and foment uneaſineſs and ſourneſs in their children, which encreaſes with their ſtrait circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the world; each of them become weary of their ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; their company grows painful with each other, for the ſame reaſon as in the laſt caſe; they conceive an averſion to each other they know not why, and their tempers are ſoured towards others they know not for what; this creates enemies; poverty, contempt and averſion follows.</p>
               <p>Thus it is with the paſſions of the human ſoul, as with the ſtrings of a muſical inſtrument: one being diſordered, ſpoils the muſick of the whole, and produces nothing but diſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when a couple, with mutual aſſection, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally good diſpoſitions, agree to unite in marriage; but, through warmth of paſſion, or affection, that would not perhaps wait until a ſettlement, or means of a living, could be provided; they miſconduct, or make what is called a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep: they are then without remedy not only diſowned, but expoſed to the world; and now they are not only looked upon as children of ſin and diſobedience, but as malcontents and enemies to the ſociety in which they were educated. In this ſituation, deprived of the confidence of their fellow ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, they are left to provide for themſelves;—their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents<note n="*" place="bottom">Though as children have nothing but what they receive by nature and education from their parents, tutors and companions, the infamy reſts ultimately on their parents and thoſe who have the care of their education, (eſpecially when they live among thoſe of their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) and not on themſelves, who are ignorant of their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and of the evil conſequences that will attend, until it is too late to prevent them. The Chineſe laws make communities anſwerable for offences committed within their reſpective authorities; parents for the miſbehaviour of their children; concluding that they muſt have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected their education, and magiſtrates are ſeverely puniſhed for thoſe crimes committed within the diſtricts of their authority. Modern Univerſal Hiſtory, vol. viii. p. 153, 172. Antient Univerſal Hiſtory, vol. viii. p. 266.</note> chooſe rather to give or truſt their property in the hands of children who have conducted better; a coldneſs and ſhyneſs takes place among all their acquaintance; they ſeem as if they belonged to nobody, and nobody to them; they muſt aſſociate with inferiors, or none at all. Viſits are made into the neighbourhood, and enquiries into every part of their conduct, and how they behave, and if they are like to make out in the world. And thoſe viſitors being fully prepoſſeſſed with the above opinion, they operate as ſieves,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021076_0007_0FB22FAE07AE7DE0"/>or ſkimmers; they take away all the droſs, and leave the good behind; their characters are too reſpectable to be queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; they ſow their tares as they go, the opinion of the world is ſoon formed in regard to their worthleſſneſs, and they are accordingly treated with contempt.</p>
               <p>The unthinking couple cannot help murmuring at thoſe from whom they receive unmerited affronts; this never fails of creating a number of real enemies, who conſtantly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify their faults, and miſrepreſent all they ſay or do; they find themſelves not only deſerted by their acquaintance, but their neareſt and deareſt friends are hoſtily armed to do them every injury.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation, unconſcious of any fault, they reflect on each other as the cauſe of their misfortune, by ſome indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or other. They tire each other with complaints they cannot relieve, and in this ſtate of ſourneſs and diſcontent, every tale of calumny and falſhood, makes deep impreſſion on them; and lowneſs of ſpirits, and inactivity of body enſues, when the contrary is moſt requiſite for their ſupport; then poverty and ill-humour, and all the train of evils and calamities that can befal human creatures in diſtreſs, attend them to the end of their days.<note n="*" place="bottom">See page 12, 13, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> For the honour of human nature we could wiſh the above repreſentation was entirely groundleſs; yet we believe this will not be found an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary deſcription by thoſe who will be at the pains to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what becomes of many of thoſe who are thus diſowned.</p>
               <p>And here we cannot help making a reflection, though not immediately relating to the ſubject.</p>
               <p>O ye paſtors of flocks and heads of ſocieties, what ſentence do you expect to receive at the laſt day, for making theſe numerous ſacrifices of your moſt innocent lambs? The powers of nature are ſtrong in the moſt perfect parts of the creation; youth may plead ignorance of the conſequence, but age cannot; you know well, by experience, what you are about and what will be the conſequence of your doings; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does it deter from theſe offences, becauſe they know not their puniſhment until it arrives, nor even then from whence it ſprings. Their crime certainly hurts not you; but it is not the ruin and deſtruction of their periſhable beings and livings here alone you ſeek or effect; but perhaps of their precious, immortal ſouls for ever hereafter, at leaſt as far as you are capable of effecting it.</p>
               <p>How differently did the Saviour and Judge of mankind ſentence the woman taken in adultery: "Neither do I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:021076_0008_0FB22FAF863F4228"/>thee, go and ſin no more," was all his reproof to her, when ſhe told him no man had condemned her. Not ſo his ſentence when he pronounced condemnation, and ſo many woes, on the teachers of that day, that bound grievous bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens on other men's ſhoulders that themſelves would not move with one of their fingers; think to yourſelves if this be not a parallel caſe, and how you will anſwer for it; think where the rich man lifted up his eyes in torment, and how you will abide a like ſituation, if the ſcene ſhould be changed for you. But if you are more innocent than theſe victims, heaven will regard you, and this reflection will not hurt you.</p>
               <p>But to return from this digreſſion: the obſervations we ſhall make next, are, upon unſuitableneſs of temper. If a man of a ſubtil, proud, unforgiving temper, marries a woman of a paſſionate, provoking, unreſerved diſpoſition, he acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently affronts her; ſhe immediately, in the moſt unreſerved manner, affronts him in return; he conceals his reſentment, but will frequently afterwards ſting her with his witty ſneers, in a manner ſhe cannot guard againſt nor eaſily bear; her anger is over; ſhe bears it for a while; but at laſt ſhe affronts him ſtill worſe where he can leaſt bear it: he now never omits any opportunity of exerciſing his malicious wit upon her; they ſoon grow intolerably weary and hateful to each other.</p>
               <p>There are many other bad tempers and diſpoſitions that would tend to make any unhappy if indulged to extreme: ſuch as inceſſant ſcolding, abuſive and indecent language, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty to children, exceſſive fretfulneſs and impatience about things unavoidable; many of theſe qualities would become mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated on a change of companions, ſo as to become agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accompliſhments: as when a compaſſionate man of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune marries a tender and weakly woman that is ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining; he affectionately ſympathizes with her in all her complaints, and exerciſes a very ſenſible and peculiar plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his own, in giving her thoſe conſtant proofs of his affection, in the attention he ſhows to her wants; and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hers in return, which he could not do in a woman other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe conſtituted. Alſo a very good-natured man married to a paſſionate, ſevere-tongued, though otherwiſe good wife; when ſhe is ſuddenly provoked, he is remarkably pleaſed with thoſe ſudden ſallies of her wit and eloquence, although it ſhould be directed againſt himſelf; he looks upon them as marks of her wit and ſpirit, and attention to her buſineſs.</p>
               <p>A very paſſionate couple that ſometimes vent their full rage at each other on certain occaſions, having fully ſatisfied their reſentment, their aſſection returns again to each other,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021076_0009_0FB22FB1C73AFB90"/>like a tide, with more fondneſs than before, and rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes than abates affection.</p>
               <p>Cruelty to children is ſo unnatural, one would be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think it could not exiſt, did not experience evince it: it muſt proceed from affections wholly miſplaced on objects quite diſtinct from the human being, and themſelves tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with ſome kind of paſſions or deſires unlawful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactory, or impoſſible to be enjoyed; or what will be found to be the ſame thing, when kind and natural affection on companions to each othr is loſt, and bitterneſs and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſucceed.</p>
               <p>A liberal and a mercenary, a polite and an impolite, a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and a deceitful diſpoſition, are unhappy united together; but happy if their qualities are alike. But more unſuitable ſtill are thoſe of religious and irreligious principles when they are united together.</p>
               <p>A couple kept low in the world by the hand of Providence only, go through a ſeries of trials, hardſhips and difficulties together in raiſing a family; their affections and attachments encreaſe, like two caſt away ſeamen, or unfortunate ſoldiers, that have been companions, and ſhared the ſame toils, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, dangers, and diſtreſſes together, and mutually aſſiſted each other for a long ſeries of time, have a greater attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to each other than they can poſſibly have to any elſe whatever.</p>
               <p>Moreover there are incidental circumſtances that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely deſtroy the happy marriage-union; lying, that father and mother of all wickedneſs, becauſe it ſcreens and protects it, is yet unreſtrained and unpuniſhed by any law, civil or religious; and hateful as it is to God and man, doubtleſs prevails among ſome of thoſe eſteemed the beſt, as well as the worſt of mankind: I ſay lying is in full practice among us, and one judicious, well framed tale, by a malicious perſon, will excite ſuch ſecret jealouſy, uneaſineſs, and doubts of each other, and open the way for ſo many more of the ſame kind, of whatever kind they may be; they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never are got over, but foment, by degrees, to the greateſt hatred and rancour.</p>
               <p>Some are compelled to marry through the force, fraud, deception, or artifice of their friends or others, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the greateſt averſion immediately. We do not ſay theſe will not ever be reconciled to each other, but that much ſmaller matters of diſturbance, ſuch as we have deſcribed, will render them thoroughly irreconcilable.</p>

                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:021076_0010_0FB232ED0E700B80"/>
The laſt inſtance we ſhall mention, is, a violent, unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able affection for ſome other perſon beſides thoſe unto whom they are married. William Penn, ſomewhere ſays, marry a woman thou loveſt, or thou wilt love a woman thou never married; this may be equally true when we ceaſe to love thoſe unto whom we are married.</p>
               <p>It may be thought needleſs, perhaps, to mention thoſe inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that ſo ſeldom happen, but we believe it very often happens, ſometimes to our certain knowledge, perhaps much oftener than can eaſily be conceived; and when that is the caſe very great diſturbance muſt enſue; in public places they are likely to happen moſt frequently, but it is not likely they ſhould often come to any ones knowledge, much leſs to the public: more eſpecially when we conſider the powerful effect of ſhame, and the propenſity it has to conceal what is thought to be a diſgraceful paſſion. Read the accounts phyſicians ſometimes give of modeſt women, of otherwiſe unblemiſhed character, actually expiring in child-birth, in the moſt excru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating tortures, rather than own their ſituation, although cameſtly urged to it with promiſes of ſecrecy, and this is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were unmarried, and thought it would be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace they could never ſurvive.</p>
               <p>Plutarch relates an anecdote of the Mileſian virgins, which merits the attention of the philoſopher: "Multitudes fell by their own hands, doubtleſs in that trying age when nature, giving birth to reſtleſs and turbulent deſires, inflames the imagination, and when the heart, aſtoniſhed at new wants which virtue forbids to gratify, feels pining melancholy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the ſportful tranquillity of child-hood. Nothing could ſtop the contagion; a law was made condemning the firſt who ſhould be guilty of ſelf-murder, to be brought naked and expoſed in the market place; thoſe young women were not afraid of death, but they were afraid of ſhame even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death. Not one of them, henceforth, made an attempt on her life."</p>
               <p>It had more became the wiſdom and goodneſs of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature to have prevented, if poſſible, the temptation, than to have inflicted a puniſhment worſe than death, on a crime that proceeded from the powerful effect of nature only, and that in its moſt innocent ſtate and ſtage of life.</p>
               <p>We have had accounts lately of the Reverend Mr. Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, falling violently in love with a Miſs Ray; a lady who lived ſixteen years in the family of lord Sandwich by whom ſhe had nine children; he grew ſo inſupportable to himſelf, that he meditated the deſtruction of both her and himſelf; he loaded two piſtols, and as ſhe was entering a coach he
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021076_0011_0FB232EE8FE98838"/>diſcharged one at her and ſhot her dead, and the other at himſelf, without effect; then delivered himſelf up to juſtice and was executed. This appears to have been the caſe by his confeſſion, in the pathetic ſpeech he made at his trial.</p>
               <p>And here we might fill a chapter with quotations, but as they generally miſlead the Reader, we will omit them. But to what other account can we ſo reaſonably attribute the ſtrange diſturbance of mind we ſee people undergo, without knowing the cauſe: the many diſorders beſides melancholy, dejection of ſpirits, diſtraction and ſuicide, phyſicians tell us, proceed from a diſturbance of mind. All our paſſions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe with age though more concealed; this, as well as others; and we believe the moſt gentle, mild and friendly diſpoſitions, are the moſt likely to be liable thereto.</p>
               <p>Thus we have recited a great many cauſes;<note n="*" place="bottom">More cauſes might be enumerated, eſpecially in ſecond marriages, but thoſe we have recited are ſufficient for our preſent deſign.</note> any one of them may be ſufficient to deſtroy the felicity of marriage, and render perfectly miſerable that union, that ſhould, of all things in this world, yield us the moſt perfect enjoyment; or, at leaſt, ſweeten the bitter potion that ſo frequently falls to the lot of human nature.</p>
               <p>But it often happens that many of theſe cauſes do unite and join in one and the ſame effect, and proportionably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the miſchief they tend to create; and when that is the caſe, who can conceive the diſturbance they may probably give, or a remedy equal to the diſeaſe, other than a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>BUT it may not be improper, in the firſt place, to ſet forth the bleſſings and advantages of an happy union in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, in order that the different conſequences may appear more diſtinctly in the compariſon.</p>
               <p>When each party with ſincere, mutual affection, and good diſpoſitions, nearly equal in fortune, and with the approbation of parents and friends, the ſame in education and way of life and religion; are fortunately joined together in marriage, all things ſeem then to ſtrengthen the union and not deſtroy it; ſuch appear to every one as if actuated by one ſoul, a moſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021076_0012_0FB232F109566180"/>conſummate pleaſure, joy, and ſatisfaction appear in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of each; their preſence, and all their behaviour to each other, ſeem to inſpire a kind of inexpreſſible pleaſure to the beholder, like the joys of the bleſſed; for good, as well as evil, is communicative by ſympathy or example, and ſuch being perfectly happy themſelves, it gives full and free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe for all the gentle, kind and friendly diſpoſitions of the human ſoul toward themſelves and others, even of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, if they have any; but as their friendlineſs appears on all occaſions, there is none but thoſe perfectly overcome with evil diſpoſitions themſelves, have any inclination to injure them, but on the contrary, a kind of zeal to do them good. Their relatives by marriage, on each ſide, inſtead of detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from, are commending them to each other, and aſſiſting them in the world; and the bulk of mankind appear to them as the moſt upright and friendly beings in nature. And as their paſſions and deſires are moderate, they ſee things nearly as they are, and plan their conduct more wiſe accordingly; and as they feel their ſpirits lively, they are active in buſineſs, and if their circumſtance is but middling in the world, their gains are ſure and conſtant, and in a few years are encreaſed beyond expectation.</p>
               <p>Their good example not only ſpreads a kind of luſtre round them, and communicates its likeneſs every where, but operates as an impenetrable guard to their character; if ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice or ill-will ſhould raiſe a tale of calumny againſt them, it dies where it begins, and its author is deteſted. Their children partake of the good qualities of the parents, both by nature and example. Thus it will appear, if the above caſe is truly ſtated, that happineſs cauſes virtue and not vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue happineſs, as is generally ſuppoſed; and whoever will be ſufficiently attentive to what paſſes in his own breaſt, will be ſatisfied of the truth of the obſervation.</p>
               <p>But now let us reverſe the ſcene: a man and a woman of good diſpoſitions naturally, but who unfortunately marry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one, or all, of the before-mentioned diſadvantages, have all the evils reſulting from them; their little comforts leave them one, by one, and peace and tranquility become ſtrangers to their breaſts; and ſinding themſelves miſerable at home, they muſt and will ſeek enjoyment ſomewhere; we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the danger of an unchangeable affection where it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be indulged, and ſurely we need not mention the many wandering imaginations and deſires of every kind; the many paſtimes, amuſements, and, perhaps, vices that muſt and will enſue; the continual increaſe and exerciſe of all the vicious.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021076_0013_0FB232F24E4BA330"/>irritating paſſions and pleaſures; we need not be particular, the bad example they ſet to others, and the many innocent people they draw into their practices; the loſs of time, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of oeconomy, diſregard of their worldly intereſts; or, if reſtrained from theſe by religion, the fear of looſing their reputation, or of excommunication; then melancholy, extreme avarice, or paſſionate deſires after worldly poſſeſſions and honours alone, as their only enjoyment, frequently take place: here they have the men of the world to contend with and oppoſe; intereſt againſt intereſt, and honour againſt honour; a thouſand croſſes and diſappointments, unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly interſere and irritate them; every affront makes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable wound; every virtuous feeling is ſacrificed for the ſmalleſt gain; the greateſt ſeverity is uſed in their families to gain an eſtate, and the greateſt oppreſſion and diſhoneſty abroad; in either caſe their vices are ſo conſpicuous that the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous part of mankind become their enemies; their enjoyments are precarious, unnatural and unſatisfactory, and their ſouls ſtill wandering in ſearch of what they cannot find, and being extremely wretched themſelves, they cannot help ſtriving to make others ſo by detraction, from envy, ſelfiſhneſs and views of competition: all mankind are intereſted in oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in their own kind, and do it accordingly; which makes the whole maſs appear to them as a race of devils, and the unhappy wretch is viewed in the ſame light by others. Their children are miſ-uſed and miſ-taught, both by precept and example; and all the evil they intend others is generally returned back on themſelves tenſold. As old age advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and naturally draws them toward their latter end, their pleaſures of ſenſe are abated; they can only exerciſe reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on what is paſt and what is to come; weakneſs and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes encreaſe, and give them warning the awful period is not far off, when their being and exiſtence here muſt ceaſe, and they muſt give way to another generation. Alas, on what can they reflect but on a long life paſt of extreme wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and pain, amidſt ſurrounding felicity? On the many ways and means they have uſed to afflict others, and others them, more eſpecially thoſe who ſhould have been the dear companion of their lives? and alſo of the manifold ſins and tranſgreſſions they have committed, in conſequence thereof? And laſtly, on what is to come? How ſhall we deſcribe it, ſeems it not like a dark and hedious monſter ſtretching forth her dreadful jaws to cloſe upon the trembling wretch forever? And this is the final end and final hope of him, or her, who but a ſew years before thought, that binding themſelves in the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021076_0014_0FB232F3CFD6DAF8"/>bands of wedlock, was leaping into the lap of Paradiſe, and entering in the ſure road to heaven and happineſs, and the joy of angels. And yet, unwelcome as this proſpect of final diſſolution appears, it ſeems it is more welcome, oftentimes, than a being in this world under the before-mentioned diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable circumſtances. But nevertheleſs, we do not pretend to ſay, that all this is the certain conſequence of infelicity in marriage; but only that it moſt frequently is ſo. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding conſtant private devotion, frequent converſation with ſincere friends, or engagement in ſome very pleaſing ſtudy or employment, will in a good degree ſupply the deficiency of marriage bliſs, and prevent, in a meaſure, the evil conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But are we to expect every one wiſe, or fortunate enough to obtain them? if they are not, their misfortunes are without remedy. And here the ſcene is changed; misfortunes produce vice, inſtead of vice producing misfortunes, as is moſtly ſuppoſed; or rather that they go hand in hand, and promote each other.</p>
               <p>Thus, if the foregoing obſervations are juſt, there appears to have been one general miſtake, that teachers in religion, moraliſts, and mankind in general have adopted; that is, that reaſon doth, or ought, to preſide over our affections, when the fact in reality is otherwiſe; our reaſon, commonly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, neither can, doth, nor ought to govern our affections, but only regulate them, and govern our actions and contrive and contribute means to indulge them; if our affections did not rule, neither man nor woman would ever marry, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate their kind, labour for poſterity, or hazard their lives in defence of their friends without reward, or do any thing through pity, compaſſion, or diſintereſted regard to their kind; or, in other words, be good or virtuous; but exceed beaſts in ſavageneſs and yet be leſs wiſe. And our affections, if ſtrong, will be found, in reality, rather to encreaſe, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the endeavours we uſe to ſuppreſs them; becauſe it cauſeth us to meditate on the object of our affection or averſion, and by conſtant meditation to fix our love or hatred more durable than before: neither can we eaſily expel from our thoughts, the object of our attention, if a lively ſenſation of the good or evil we have received from them be often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And it is the duty of rulers and inſtructors, to lead and direct our good affections, and to indulge them in good and worthy objects, and not to force them, otherwiſe they will be found to exert themſelves like forced waters and break the ſtrongeſt bounds; or ſecretly undermine the works of the workman, to their great damage and hurt. For our evil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021076_0015_0FB232F54B98A0C0"/>are frequently no other than our good affections forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or miſled from their proper objects; and this indulgence of our good affections is the only ſure way of preventing our evil ones, otherwiſe one miſchief begets another, and we pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſh misfortune inſtead of vice; it is like an unſkilful ſurgeon that cuts off a limb he can not cure, to hide his ignorance and ſave his credit.</p>

               <p>THE reflections that naturally and unavoidably ariſe from the above recited facts and conſiderations, are: doth God require this ſacrifice of our happineſs, or in other words, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of our deſtruction? or, would not this ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be more applicable to the enemy of mankind, who, they ſay, goes about like a roaring lion ſeeking whom he may devour? If our Creator ſeeketh or rejoiceth in our infelicity, for what purpoſe did he pour forth in the creation ſuch a profuſion of ornaments and delights? delightful objects for ſenſation and reflection; ſuch multitudes of fruits and and flowers, meats and drinks, pleaſing objects for the eyes, and ſounds for the ears, and grateful ſmells for the noſtrils, and ten thouſand pleaſing ſubjects of contemplation for the underſtanding; and herbs for food and for medicine, and remedies for almoſt every diſeaſe, ſo various and numerous, that it is impoſſible to enumerate them in every part of the creation.</p>
               <p>The pangs of child-birth are to give life and joy to the child and parent; the pains of ſickneſs and wounds to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the patient to his bed until he is healed, and to warn him to take eſpecial care of that tender frame his Maker hath been pleaſed to give him, and his ſenſations of pain and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure are his motives to action and means of happineſs. But for what end was unhappy matrimony inſtituted or compelled to be born, when there is an eaſy remedy always at hand, and not denied to the meaneſt ſlave, that of changing his or her maſter?</p>
               <p>And as ſlave-keeping is juſtly becoming deteſtable in this country, it may not be improper, in this place, to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon between a ſlave and an unhappy, married free perſon: ſo that a relief may appear as neceſſary to the one as to the other, if the married perſon, as ſuch, may be eſteemed equally worthy of our attention and regard.</p>

Slaves,<note n="*" place="bottom">Alluding to the ſlaves of Pennſylvania and New-Jerſey.</note> almoſt always, by complaint or remonſtrance to their maſter or others, may change their maſter, until they have found out the moſt moderate. And although always at call to come and go, yet their common portion of labour is ſeldom equal to that of a free perſon; they moſtly eat the ſame kind of food with their maſter, their cloaths are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to keep them from ſuffering; they are relieved from the care and concern of providing for themſelves and ſamilies: bodily correction they can moſtly avoid by ſubmiſſion and fair promiſes, and this they often regard no longer than it ſmarts. which is ſoon over; they are not confined to their maſter's apartment, to be always tormented and abuſed; they have frequent holidays of ſport, recreation, and paſtime, at which they contrive to crib for a feaſt, and revel the whole night in merriment; where the moſt unreſtrained liberty and joy abounds; they are under no reſtraint from religion, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality or fear of loſing their reputation, or of excummuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; their love is all delight; they feel no dread from fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conſequences; they marry with whom, and for as long as they pleaſe, and no longer.</p>
               <p>They are all of one ſentiment in morality and religion; they are always eſteemed by their maſters and others, if they perform their ſervice faithfully, and when age comes on they are ſure of ſubſiſtance for life, as good and much eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than when young.</p>
               <p>But where is there any relief to the miſerable, hen-pecked huſband, or the abuſed, and inſulted, deſpiſed wife? We for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to recite the many ways and means they take to afflict and torment one another.<note n="†" place="bottom">That the pains of the mind exceed thoſe of the body we may learn from hence: heroes, martyrs and thoſe perſecuted for religion, receive the greateſt bodily torments not only with patience, but tokens of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſeek occaſions of receiving them when they think the cauſe they are ſuffering for redounds to their honour or glory. But the moſt delicate fare of the moſt voluptuous perſon, yields him not the leaſt pleaſure whenever ſo little galled or fretted in his mind.</note> They are not only confined like a criminal to their puniſhment, but their confinement muſt laſt till death.</p>
               <p>But perhaps it may be ſaid, that if mankind were at liberty to ſeparate and marry again, the matrimonial tie would become leſs binding; one ſeparation would make way for another, and men and women would change from one to another like beaſts and their families and kindred would be unknown and unprovided for, and their names and deſtinctions loſt.</p>

We ſhould not propoſe to ſet men and women wholly at liberty to ſeparate and marry at pleaſure; but only on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of each or either party, and the cauſe inquired into, and their children, if any, provided for out of their eſtate equally, and liberty given to marry again and their eſtate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided between them; but not at liberty to repeat the like often. This much might ſerve for a trial. But we do not ſuppoſe an inclination to part would often happen, or any inconvenience ariſe, if they were left wholly at liberty in this reſpect.</p>
               <p>For we ſee, in the order of the creation, thoſe creatures who bring forth their young quite helpleſs into the world, where the female alone is unable to defend and provide for them, nature has impelled them, by ſecret and powerful inſtinct, to pair together in couples for their mutual defence, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, without which it would be impoſſible for them to exiſt; as we ſee remarkably in birds and ſome beaſts, that are helpleſs when young; it is not ſo in cattle that are able to ſhift and provide for themſelves immediately.</p>
               <p>And mankind, in a ſtate of nature, all of one religion, cuſtom, and manners, never incline to ſeparate, although not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to remain together; there appears to have been no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement thereto, as has ariſen through the various ſtages and changes of our civilized ſtate, without a change of cuſtom, as was neceſſary in this reſpect; civilization having, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, changed our natures, by introducing new kinds of ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as deſcribed in the foregoing part of this eſſay.</p>
               <p>And as there is no creature nearly ſo helpleſs as the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpecies in infancy, ſo neither is their any nearly ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently attached to each other; not in the way of ſudden paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but unchangable affection. Providence having wiſely proportioned their affections, in ſuch a degree as the neceſſity of their nature and ſituation requires, in order to go through and bear a ſeries of trials, troubles, anxieties, and cares, needful to raiſe and ſupport their otherwiſe helpleſs offspring.</p>
               <p>And when the human ſpecies are confined, in their choice, to thoſe of the ſame way of life, manners, religion, or edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and unite through mutual affection, they are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſecret inſtinct to thoſe whoſe tempers, qualities and diſpoſitions are moſt ſuitable to their own. Or if it does not, it is moſtly owing to ſome ſeparate views, ſuch as the proſpect of an eſtate or other circumſtances, or perhaps, when too much confined in their choice, as is the caſe with ſome young people reſtrained by their parents, (to uſe my former ſimilie) like confined waters breaking bounds, too ſudden a flow of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021076_0018_0FB232FA8DE148A0"/>paſſion enſues toward thoſe objects whom chance preſents to their view and acquaintance, and overcomes and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitates them into a union, before they have time to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine their own breaſts; or, in other words, paſſion overcomes their judgment, when both ſhould unite together in forming the happy connection.</p>
               <p>Living together as man and wife, is, doubtleſs, as old as the creation; but many ages paſſed away before any form of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was inſtituted, and the man took the woman with the parents' conſent, and lived with her, and ſhe became his wife.</p>
               <p>Thus we read of Abraham ſending his ſervant to take a wife for his ſon Iſaac; he did according to his inſtructions and brought her home with the conſent of her parents, and Iſaac received and took her into his Mother's tent, and he loved her and ſhe became his wife; and this was all the ceremony; the whole of the tranſaction is very particularly related by the hiſtorian, and ſo material a circumſtance as marriage would not have been leſt out. It was nearly the ſame with Jacob; he agreed to ſerve Laban ſeven years for his daughter Rachel, and they ſeemed to him but a ſew days for the love he had to her, and at the end of the time he ſaid, give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Moſes allowed a man to put away his wife at pleaſure, yet we do not find that it was often practiſed; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they had the greateſt difficulty to ſeparate thoſe who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into ſtrange nations in the time of the Jewiſh captivity, as may be ſeen in Ezra, chapters ix. and x. and we read in Nehemiah, on the ſame occaſion, in the xiiith. chap. and 25th. verſe, that he contended with them; and curſed them, and ſmote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to ſwear by God, ſaying, you ſhall not give your daughters unto their ſons, nor take their daughters unto your ſons, or for yourſelves. So ſenſible were the Jews of the impropriety of ſtrange marriages; yet we do not read that a ſeparation was really eſſected. Theſe inſtances ſhow how little danger there is of ſeparations becoming too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
               <p>But it is probable they will become more neceſſary, and frequent as our manners ſhall become changed and varied from thoſe of the primitive ages: but never, in no age or nation, was marriage eſteemed any other than a civil contract, or any thing ſo divine, holy, or ſacred in it that it might not be diſſolved by the parties contracting, until Chriſtianity took place, which leads us naturally to conſider of Chriſt's command in this reſpect: if there was any thing in the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021076_0019_0FB232FC0FD67D38"/>Chriſtian doctrine that would tend to deſtroy the peace and happineſs of mankind, we ſhould be apt to reject it entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as ſomething that had got in by miſtake. But perhaps it may appear otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>The Phariſees came unto him, tempting him; ſaying, <hi>Is it lawful for a man to put away his wiſe for every cauſe?</hi> The queſtion is doubtful in every ſenſe, for they came to him, tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. It is impoſſible, without hearing the words ſpoken, to determine the full meaning of the queſtion, for if the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis of the ſpeaker ſhould be placed on the words <hi>lawful;</hi> the queſtion would then be, not concerning who might put her away, or for what cauſe, but if a ſeparation at all was <hi>lawful.</hi> If the emphaſis of the ſpeaker ſhould be placed on the word <hi>man,</hi> the queſtion would then be, not concerning the lawfulneſs of the ſeparation, or for what cauſe, but if the <hi>huſband</hi> alone, without conſent of his wife or any other perſon, might put her away.</p>
               <p>But if the emphaſis ſhould be placed on the word <hi>cauſe,</hi> the queſtion would then be, not concerning who might put her away, or the lawfulneſs of the ſeparation, but whether ſhe might be put away for <hi>every cauſe,</hi> or only <hi>ſome cauſes,</hi> and as the queſtion is doubtful, ſo is the anſwer. He tells them, in the beginning God created male and female, for which cauſe a man ſhould leave father and mother, cleave unto his wife, and they twain ſhould be one fleſh; what therefore God hath joined together let not man put aſunder. That Moſes indulged them in putting away their wives on account of their hard hearts; that it was not ſo in the beginning, that whoſoever put away his wife, except for fornication, and married again, committed adultery.</p>
               <p>In the fore part of his diſcourſe he undoubtedly referred to that ſecret and powerful inſtinct, or ſtrong mutual affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that joined men and women together as at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in a ſtate of nature; ſuch as we before obſerved unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Jacob unto Rachel when ſeven years ſeemed but as a few days, for the love he had unto her, and theſe he calls thoſe whom God hath joined together; and ſuch let not man put aſunder, he could not mean the prieſt, the magiſtrate, or themſelves, for they are not God.</p>
               <p>In the next place, he ſorbids the cruel cuſtom of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band alone putting away his wife for every cauſe; without regarding her ſeeling or ſituation, and declares, ſuch as do and marry again, commit adultery.</p>
               <p>The whole of the diſcourſe amounts to this, that ſuch as are joined together by ſtrong, mutual affection, let none cauſe
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:021076_0020_0FB232FD8DA627E8"/>their ſeparation, and let the huſband alone put away his wife for no cauſe but fornication.</p>
               <p>Neither of which declarations affects our argument in the leaſt, that men and women may not part by mutual conſent, or laws of the land, or when mutual hatred has taken place, and marry again when God ſhall join them together as at the beginning. But it ſeems as if this paſſage had been the occaſion of all thoſe ſcruples, concerning the ſeparation of man and wife, in the early ages of Chriſtianity, and handed down to us until this day.</p>
               <p>And ſo it ſhould ſeem from the three ſucceeding verſes of of the ſame chapter, Matthew xix. from verſe the 10th. to the 13th. compared with Matthew, chapter v. from the 27th. to the 31ſt. verſe, as if emaſculation was adviſed; and as ſuch, ſome of the firſt fathers of the church believed it, and received it; but ſurely ſuch doctrines need not a ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation.</p>
               <p>And here we ſubmit to the judicious Reader, what merit is due to thoſe (the greater part of mankind) who implicitly ſollow guides; and what to thoſe who reject them, in many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in favour of common ſenſe and their own underſtandings.</p>
               <p>If our Creator, as we before obſerved, ſeeketh or requireth our infelicity, he hath then no longer the attribute of a God, but of a devil. But if our good affections are miſled by our inſtructors, they are converted into evil affections, and drawn from their proper objects, while we ourſelves have eyes to ſee and hearts to underſtand, then is our Creator guiltleſs. For if we, having eyes and underſtanding, freely give them to our guides and walk without, then are our ſelves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accountable for our ſtumbling and the pains and bruiſes we feel in conſequence thereof.</p>
               <p>It will be next ſaid, what has been the univerſal cuſtom for ſo many ages, muſt have had ſome great advantage or benefit ariſing therefrom; ſound out by the experience of paſt ages that we cannot immediately apprehend, but upon a trial, otherwiſe would be found extremely injurous to ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. This obliges us, as far as we know, to relate the cuſtoms of other countries.</p>
               <p>The Indians of America and Negroes of Africa, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage nations of various kinds, live according to nature, that is, they unite or part, as pleaſes them, without compulſion; generally unite and live as man and wife, and are faithful to each other as long as they live agreeably to natural inſtinct.</p>
               <p>In France and Italy every man has but one wife, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wife has, if ſhe pleaſes, a lover that conſtantly viſits and attends her, with her huſband, to all public places, and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:021076_0021_0FB232FF194F56F0"/>the huſband looks upon him as his friend, and eſteems his wife in proportion to the rank and quality of her lover; this gives him no uneaſineſs, becauſe he act in the ſame capacity to another lady, if he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>In England, it is ſaid, the nobility marry to add to their rank and eſtates, but indulge ſeparate pleaſures afterwards, at plays, balls, maſquerades, dancing matches, and other diverſions, without offence taken on either ſide.</p>
               <p>In Turkey a man may have four wives and as many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines as he pleaſes, but if a complaint comes to a magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate that he doth not perform the duty of an huſband once a week, he is obliged to put ſome of them away. In Perſia a man takes as many wives as he pleaſes, and for what time they agree.</p>
               <p>In India the women are compelled, by the cuſtom of the country, to burn themſelves alive with their diſeaſed huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, in honour to their memory.<note n="*" place="bottom">As ſome of our Readers may incline to doubt the truth of this account, we refer them to Doctor Hard's Hiſtory of the Religion of different Nations, where they may ſee the practice largely and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly related. Alſo Marius D'Aſſigny, in his Hiſtory of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Deities, faith it is a cuſtom of the indians in Aſia to this day to ſacrifice and bury the deareſt wives of Princes with them; for they believe in the immortality of the ſoul, and therefore ſend ſuch perſons as have been dear to them, to ſerve them in another world, and keep them company; but later <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

                  </note> This is fulfilling the text literally, what God hath joined together, let no man put aſunder; and ſhows the impropriety of adhering too ſtrictly to the letter, in matters of great importance to our welfare.</p>
               <p>Here are two extremes, and it is moſt probable, that there are different degrees of practice between them. And if we may judge reaſonably here, as in moſt other caſes, the beſt mark to ſtop at is the middle way, for the powers of nature in all animate, as well as inanimate bodies, gravitate to a middle line, like the vibrations of a pendulum, whoſe center of gravity is equidiſtant from the extremes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> motion, and our preſent practice is but one degree diſtant from the laſt mentioned worſt extreme.</p>
               <p>From the above-mentioned inſtances it doth appear, the ſentiments of mankind in general are very different from thoſe of our preſent practice, and that there are no inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences ariſing to the public from one cuſtom more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, except the happineſs the parties may receive themſelves, and thereby communicate to others; which ſurely themſelves ought to be the beſt judges of.</p>
               <p>Then the queſtion will finally terminate here, are they, or are they not, judges of their own happineſs? If they are, why
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021076_0022_0FB233008B9FEBF0"/>are they reſtrained by law and religion from exerciſing it? if they are not, why are they allowed the liberty of exerciſing it in other things? why are they not compelled to follow the ſame calling, live on the ſame land, and poſſeſs the ſame property they have received by gift or purchaſe during their lives, or the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of ſaid property? are not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the one as ſtrong as for the other?</p>
               <p>We would not, by any means, be underſtood, by propoſing divorce, that we deſire to leſſen the ſolemnity of marriage, or weaken the ſacredneſs of the marriage promiſe in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, during their union; but only, that a ſincere union of hearts do accompany a union of hands, from which alone, all our other enjoyments, as from a ſecret ſource, are derived: as ſtreams flowing from a ſweet, clear, and pure fountain, without which every thing is lifeleſs, inſiped and diſagreeable; and that in proportion to the diſharmony that ſubſiſts here, or on the contrary, all is pleaſing.</p>
               <p>And here we beg leave to communicate our ſentiments on marriage in the lines of that elegant and ſublime poet, who is ſaid once to have employed his pen in vindicating the ſame cauſe we do now.</p>

               <p>The above muſt be underſtood to mean virtuous pleaſure, in common occurrences and occaſions of life, as well as thoſe of religion; and if ſuch are its ſalutary effects, what muſt be the effect of the contrary, I leave the Reader to judge, by attending to his own feelings in ſome unhappy moments he may have experienced.</p>
               <p>We believe it will be readily admitted, that there is no portion of the lives of mankind ſo extremely pleaſant; as when about to take poſſeſſion of a lovely and agreeable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion: except the enjoyment they may receive after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in finding their expectations fully ſatisfied: until ſome untoward circumſtance, incident, or misfortune puts an end to their felicity. And yet this bleſſing, according to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent practice, can never be enjoyed by one of the parties, but once in a life-time. And if their joys ſhould chance to be ſhort, all the reſt is little better than diſtraction. In vain will they ſtrive to find them again in wealth, honours, or promotion; they may kindle the fires of hell, and ranſack nations, or deſtroy neighbours, according to their reſpective ſituations and capacities in life, yet they will ſtill meet with nothing but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment in their enjoyments. Or if there is any thing in this world, that would excite virtuous and amiable diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in men and women, it is the thought and ambition of recommending themſelves to virtuous and amiable compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; more eſpecially when in diſtreſs with one that is otherwiſe. The expectation of ſuch good fortune if it ſhould never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, would make them incline more to good, virtuous, and worthy actions than otherwiſe they would do.</p>
               <p>If divorce was declared not only lawful by the legiſlature, but honourable by the miniſters and elders of religious bodies, (without which, the law would not have its full effect) it would probably remove one of the moſt melancholy misfortunes of the human being—ſuicide.<note n="*" place="bottom">We may obſerve, our Creator in framing the paſſions of the human ſoul, has wiſely preſerved a balance between our private and public affections; in order to ſecure the duty we owe to others as well as our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for where there is a ſtrong propenſity to private aſſection, there is one equally ſtrong to the public—a love of reputation. And when a ſtrong private affection, no way interfering with the good of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, is rendered infamous by means of law and religion; then the ſoul is exceedingly agitated by different Impulſes; and ſtrongly impelled different ways and greviouſly tormented. And if the ſenſation is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent it will occaſion involuntary watching or waking, and when this is the caſe, body and mind reciprocally act as a ſtimulus upon each other, encreaſing their ſenſations; until the ſoul, inflamed with furious impatience, inſtantly burſts the ſtrongeſt bands and bounds of nature, and ſlings herſelf into the ocean of ſpirits from whence ſhe ſprang. And the diſaſter ſpeaks aloud to the world, in the moſt pointed, explicit language, that may not be miſtaken; that the laws of men have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the laws of Providence, and theſe cataſtrophies are as beacons ſet upon a hill that cannot be hid, to warn foreigners and all others of the danger of breathing the tainted air of ſuch a ſoil: for although the body may eſcape deſtruction the ſoul or mind may not, if we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the ſame cauſes to have the ſame effect, on the ſame kind of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and we believe if the number of theſe in this country, were ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken and made public, they would greatly exceed what can caſily be imagined.</note> For certainly it is a moſt odious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:021076_0025_0FB233052C130CF0"/>to the rulers of any people, to ſee their ſubjects go diſtracted and deſtroy themſelves on account of their miſ-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or misfortunes that might eaſily be removed.</p>
               <p>Cruel men and women would then be afraid to miſuſe and abuſe their good, worthy partners, whom they know to be better than themſelves; but would be induced to act the lover inſtead of acting the tyrant.</p>
               <p>It would probably prevent fraud and deception in court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. It would tend greatly to induſtry, as men and women would exert themſelves much more to ſupport thoſe they loved, than thoſe they did not; this is plain in the change we often ſee in young people, for the better or worſe after mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <p>Parents might not then forever lament the loſs of an only ſon, or an only daughter, by an imprudent, precipitate mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Many bachelors might not then remain ſo long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, and diſgrace religion and mankind with their vices. Many young women would then become virtuous wives and mothers; comfortable to their friends, uſeful and ornamental to ſociety, who, as circumſtances are at preſent, do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently bring diſgrace upon themſelves and their ſex, and a burden on others. And we believe the like of theſe would not ſo often be forſaken by thoſe who have deceived them, if the ideas of perpetual bondage did not intimidate them. Every plea whatever for unlawful commerce between the ſexes would then be taken away. If reaſonable liberty of parting was given, the deſire of it would be frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. Continual enmity and ill-will between the relatives of the reſpective parties diſagreeing in marriage would ceaſe. It would inculcate more friendly and beneficent ideas of the wiſdom and goodneſs of Divine Providence in the diſpoſition of human affairs, and diſpoſe mankind more ſincerely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and adore the great Author of their being.</p>

If the number of objects that wiſh for a change are but few, their liberty can do no harm; if many, they ought to be the more regarded, and attention paid to their ſituations.</p>
               <p>The offspring of happy matches would be, by nature as well as by education and example, leſs viciouſly inclined. For we believe the qualities and diſpoſitions that are contracted by habit, are propagated afterwards by generation, as is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in the wildneſs and tameneſs of young animals from their reſpective parents: alſo in the ferocity and docility of thoſe perſons deſcended from free or enſlaved nations: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the uncivilized nature of young ſavages, longing to live the ſame ſort of life of their parents, although otherwiſe edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it might be a ſtep towards reſtoring the golden age ſo much deſired, for certainly thoſe countries approach the neareſt to it where there are no wars, but where agriculture and population are in their higheſt perfection, as in China, where their cuſtoms are very different from ours in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
               <p>Perhaps none would oppoſe this alteration but thoſe who were conſcious of having companions better than themſelves, and who might be apprehenſive ſuch would become diſſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their ſituation.</p>
               <p>No diſtinction of preference in favour of either ſex ought to be made when nature has made none.</p>
               <p>Thus, free citizens of America, we have briefly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ornament of ſtile, repreſented to you ſuch of the many truths, relative to our ſituation in reſpect to marriage, as muſt ſtrike the apprehenſion of the moſt indifferent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver. It would be doing injuſtice to your humanity and feelings, as men and as Chriſtians, to ſuppoſe you will not take the ſubject under your ſerious conſideration, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate your ſentiments to each other; and finally propoſe ſuch alterations and amendments in the laws and cuſtoms of our country, as will tend to the benefit of thoſe unhappy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals who have never wilfully, in this reſpect, tranſgreſſed the laws of God or man; or, done any thing to incur your reſentment or diſpleaſure, and whoſe infelicity calls yet louder for relief than their failings call for cenſure; and that you will not let other matters ſo much engroſs your care and attention, that you cannot ſympathize with, and feel for, the afflictions and diſtreſſes of ſuch of your worthy fellow-citizens, who are united to you by the ſtrongeſt ties of affinity and affection, and alſo as neighbours, friends, and members of the ſame community with yourſelves; neither ſuffer them to remain under that contempt and diſregard that ever is the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:021076_0027_0FB233080E234EF8"/>lot of the unfortunate; nor let ignorance, blgotry and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, any longer govern your underſtanding, by ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one doubtful text of ſcripture (which is evidently miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood) a means of deſtroying the happineſs of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, without a proſpect of redreſs, for endleſs generations; therefore, we truſt, that you will generouſly ſhow an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of liberality and wiſdom to the reſt of the Chriſtian na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by immediately ſetting at liberty all thoſe who ſuffer under the ſevere reſtrictions of cruel, tormenting partners; which would make them valuable and worthy members of ſociety; a comfort to themſelves and their friends, and an ornament to human nature; and by ſo doing you will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs receive the grateful thanks of ſuch, and the honour and approbation of all good men.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now conclude, with addreſſing a few words to thoſe on whoſe behalf we have been writing this eſſay.</p>
               <p>O ye unhappy people, unto whom the bands of wedlock has entailed wretchedneſs inſtead of joy! Perhaps your ſituations may be without remedy; it is ſo, doubtleſs, without you ſeek it, which it is your duty to do both for yourſelves and for poſterity. But it is not without hope if you exert yourſelves according to your ability; be not aſhamed of your ſituation; it is your misfortune and not your fault; either of you might have been completely bleſt and happy with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partner, had it been your good fortune to have united with one ſuitable to your diſpoſition and circumſtances: but it is never too late to try to be revenged on fortune. Let your ſituation in life be what it may, your circumſtances high or low, if you can but be thoroughly reconciled to thoſe who where once your fond choice, and renew the days of courtſhip and felicity you once felt, not only by avoiding every thing that is found to be diſagreeable to your ſpouſes, but alſo exerting yourſelves in every thing that is ſervicable, generous, kind and freindly; you will then be revenged on fortune, and heaven will have bleſſings yet in ſtore. But if this is not practicable, as is moſt commonly the caſe, apply decently to the legiſlature for redreſs, to paſs ſuch laws for your relief, and others in the like ſituation, as they ſhall think neceſſary and proper; they certainly cannot refuſe ſo reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a requiſition who have granted relief to a leſs reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble claſs of mankind, without requeſt, in a leſs painful ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But nevertheleſs, as ſudden innovations from cuſtoms long eſtabliſhed in any country, are not eaſily obtained, more eſpecially where it is a part of the eſtabliſhed religion of the people. Thoſe of ſome rank and character in the world, who ſhall have virtue and reſolution enough, to ſet ſome exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:021076_0028_0FB233098B9DD4C8"/>of ſeparating and marrying again, great part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind would be more indebted to them for their liberty and happineſs, than unto thoſe who delivered this country from Britiſh oppreſſion. For their virtuous courage, reſolution and magnanimity, would break the way for others to follow; and a law would at laſt be obtained in their favour. Thus we ſee the firſt advocate for the liberty of ſlaves in America, Benjamin Lay,<note n="*" place="bottom">Succeeding writers have ungenerouſly paſſed over this worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's name in ſilence, and given the honour of the teſtimony to thoſe people who excommunicated him from their ſociety, for this very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. See his own writngs.</note> a worthy and good man, gave away great part of his ſubſtance, when in Jamaica, to relieve them; and wrote and teſtified, in all places, violently againſt the practice of ſlave-keeping; and, when in America, would ſometimes enter meeting-houſes, and ſprinkle blood upon the people, and tell them the blood of the ſlaves was in like manner up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads, if they did not repent and free their ſlaves.</p>
               <p>It was by ſuch remarkable exertions as theſe, that almoſt every ſect in religion has been eſtabliſhed, without which the attention of mankind are not rouſed or excited, but every thing goes on in its former courſe, and glides down the ſtream of time unnoticed; and the misfortunes of a few are unregarded and unrelieved; or, according to the expreſſion of a poet, on another occaſion,</p>
