            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He lived many years; was well acquainted with the public affairs, and ſaw great improvements in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. His papers after his deceaſe, in 1725, were delivered to <hi>David Lloyd</hi> and <hi>Iſaac Norris;</hi> and afterwards to <hi>James Logan,</hi> about the year 1732. From theſe perſons, who made ſuch additions, as came within their obſervation, they afterwards paſſed to <hi>John Kinſey;</hi> who, in conjunction with ſeveral others, his friends, reviſed them; and they remained in his poſſeſſion till his death, in the year 1750.</p>
            <p>The character of theſe perſons, above mentioned, who, at different periods of time, filled ſome of the moſt eminent public ſtations in the province, will further appear in the enſuing hiſtory; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men who had not only the beſt opportunity of knowing the variety of incidents, and the true ſtate of its internal affairs, from the beginning, but alſo were themſelves actively concerned in a large ſhare of the public tranſactions; and ſome of them, in the different intereſts both of the proprietary and of his oppoſers.</p>

Smith's manuſcript, but alſo divers particulars therein, are here much abbreviated, eſpecially reſpecting the long and tedious diſputes between ſome of the governors and aſſemblies; and conſiderable addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are made, from other accounts, of ſuch things as were either not at all touched upon, or but ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned, by him; beſides moſt of the notes, with the <hi>introduction,</hi> and the <hi>deſcription</hi> of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and its <hi>preſent ſtate,</hi> between the years 1760 and 1770; both which laſt, not being attempted by him, are, for the moſt part, entirely new:—So that the whole comprizes, beſides what may be found of veracity, in other publications, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the province, a true and genuine narrative of the different public tranſactions, the great and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious improvements, memorable incidents, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining anecdotes, and things worthy to be known, for above ſixty years, beſides the ſaid <hi>preſent ſtate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION. PART THE FIRST. CONTAINING, MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE OF WILLIAM PENN, Prior to his founding the Province of <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> AND INCLUDING, <hi>A general and comprehenſive view of the riſe, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, religious ſyſtem and practice, or manners, of the people called QUAKERS, who firſt ſettled the province, under his government.</hi>

            <p>THE wiſdom of former ages, when tranſmitted,<note place="margin">Office and uſe of hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, &amp;c.</note> in writing, to poſterity, is an ineſtimable treaſure; but the actions of illuſtrious and virtuous perſons, in the ſame manner exhibited, is ſtill more benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial: by the former our judgments are rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and our minds brought into a proper way of thinking; by the latter we are animated to an imitation; and while the excellency of noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples is diſplayed before our underſtandings, our minds are inſpired with a love of virtue. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be the office of hiſtory; by which every ſucceeding age may avail itſelf of the wiſdom, and, even, of the folly, of the preceding, and become wiſer and happier by a proper application. Through

this medium when we view the conduct of thoſe great men of antiquity, who have benefited man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, in their moſt eſſential intereſts, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear frequently to have been actuated by motives, the moſt diſintereſted, and attended with a ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more than human!—Adverſity, which refines men, and renders them more fit to benefit the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race, is a frequent concomitant of worthy minds; and apparent ſucceſs doth not always imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately attend noble and juſt deſigns:—When a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> is put to death, wiſdom and truth ſeem to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; and when an <hi>Ariſtides</hi> is exiled, juſtice appears to be in diſgrace. But virtue is its own reward, and depends not on the fluctuating opinions of mortals, nor on the breath of popular applauſe; which is often on the ſide of error, and entirely oppoſite to the real intereſts of its votaries.</p>

In both of which his engagement for the happineſs of men was not unattended with a large ſhare of that difficulty and oppoſition, to which the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent undertakings are generally expoſed: but minds of ſuch exalted virtue are actuated by motives above mortality, and indiſputably are influenced by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>divine;</hi> without which, as <hi>Cicero ſays, "there never was a really good and great man.</hi>

                  <p>W.

His ſervice, therefore, being wholly foreign, he may be truly ſaid to ſerve his country, rather than either of theſe intereſt, ſo far as they were diſtinct front each other."—Again, "In the attack on <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> his employ was only as general of the fleet; from which the miſcarriage did not ariſe; it was owing to the land forces, over which he had no command.</p>
                  <bibl>PENN'S Works</bibl>
               </note> He was born in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> anno 1621; and married <hi>Margaret,</hi> daughter of <hi>John Jaſper,</hi> of <hi>Rotterdam</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> merchant;<note place="margin">Biographia Britannica.</note> by whom he had his ſon <hi>William Penn.</hi> He was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the ſon of captain <hi>Giles Penn,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>He was addicted from his youth to maritime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and made captain at twenty-one years of age;<note place="margin">His offices.</note> rear admiral of <hi>Ireland,</hi> at twenty-three; vice ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of <hi>Ireland,</hi> at twenty-five; admiral to the Straits, at twenty-nine; vice admiral of <hi>England,</hi> at thirty-one; and general in the firſt <hi>Dutch</hi> war, at thirty-two. Whence returning, anno 1655, he was a parliament man for the town of <hi>Weymouth;</hi> in 1660, he was made commiſſioner of the admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and navy, governor of the town and fort of <hi>Kingsail;</hi> vice admiral of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and a member of that provincial council; and anno 1664, he was choſen great captain commander under the <hi>Duke of York,</hi> in that ſignal, and moſt evidently ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſight with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet.</p>
            <p>Thus he took leave of the ſea, but continued ſtill in his other employments, till 1669;<note place="margin">His death.</note> at which time, through bodily infirmities, contracted by the

care and fatigue of public affairs, he withdrew, prepared and made for his end. He died at <hi>Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead,</hi> in the county of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> on the 16th. day of September 1670, in the 49th. year of his age; leaving a plentiful eſtate, in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> with his paternal bleſſing to his ſon <hi>William;</hi> to whom he was perfectly reconciled, after the great diſpleaſure, he had before conceived at his joining in religious ſociety with the <hi>Quakers;</hi>—"Thus (ſays his ſon) from a lieutenant he paſſed through all the eminent offices of ſea employment, and arrived to that of general, about the 30th. year of his age; in a time full of the biggeſt ſea action, that any hiſtory mentions; and when neither bribes nor alliance, favour nor affection, but ability only, could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote."—Having acquitted himſelf with honor and fidelity, in all his public offices, after the reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he was knighted by king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, and became a peculiar favorite of <hi>James,</hi> duke of <hi>York;</hi>

He was endowed with a good genius; and his father, from the promiſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, which he had, of his advancement was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to give him a liberal education: He accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly made ſuch early improvements in literature, that, about the fifteenth year of his age, he was entered a ſtudent at <hi>Chriſt's church college</hi> in <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">His behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our at Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</note>At this time more particularly (ſays the writer of his life) began to appear in him a diſpoſition of mind after true ſpiritual religion; of which before he had received ſome ſenſe and taſte, through the miniſtry of <hi>Thomas Loe,</hi> a preacher under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032729_0023_0FF4EDFDDDF54BD8"/>
of a <hi>Quaker.</hi> In this place, he, and certain ſtudents of that univerſity, withdrawing themſelves from the national way of worſhip, held private meetings, for the exerciſe of religion; where they both preached and prayed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which gave great offence to the heads of the college. He, being then but ſixteen years of age, was fined for non-conformity; and, at laſt, for his perſevering in the like religious practices, was expelled the college.</p>
            <p>From thence, after he returned home,<note place="margin">His father's conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him.</note> he ſtill retained the ſame turn of mind, and continued to prefer the ſociety of ſober and religious perſons. His father, judging this to be a great obſtacle in the way of his ſons preferment, endeavoured, by divers means to deter and divert him from it. For which purpoſe, after having uſed both the force of perſuaſion upon his mind, and the ſeverity of ſtripes upon his body, without ſucceſs, he at length was ſo far incenſed againſt him, that, in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of rage, he turned him out of his houſe!</p>
            <p>His patience ſurmounted this difficulty,<note place="margin">He ſends him to France.</note> till his father's affection had ſubdued his anger. He then ſent him to <hi>France</hi> in company with ſome perſons of quality, who were making a tour thither. He continued there a conſiderable time, till a quite different, converſation had diverted his mind from the ſerious thoughts of religion. There he acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the knowledge of the <hi>French language,</hi> and a perfectly accompliſhed, polite and courtly behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. His father, on his return, thinking the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his travels was fully anſwered, received him with great ſatisfaction. His conduct and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, for ſome time after this, being repreſented to be ſuch as juſtly entitled him to the character of a complete young gentleman.</p>
            <p>About the year 1664 his ſpiritual conflict,<note place="margin">1664.</note> or religious exerciſe of mind, is ſaid to have been very great: his natural inclination, his lively and active

diſpoſition,<note place="margin">His great conflict of mind and reſolution.</note> his acquired accompliſhments, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's favour, the reſpect of his friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances, did ſtrongly preſs him to embrace the glory and pleaſures of this world, then, as it were, courting and careſſing him, in the bloom of youth, to accept them; but, his earneſt ſupplication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Almighty for preſervation, he was, in due time, providentially favoured with reſolution and ability to overcome all oppoſition and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue his religious proſpect, and what he believed was his beſt intereſt, through all the reproaches, and perſecutions which attended him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">He is fully convinced of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note>In the year 1666, and the 22d. of his age, his father committed to his care and management a conſiderable eſtate, in <hi>Ireland;</hi> which occaſioned his reſidence in that country; there, being at <hi>Cork,</hi> at a religious meeting of the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> he was thoroughly and effectually convinced of their principles, by means of the preaching of <hi>Thomas Loc,</hi> before mentioned; whoſe miniſtry ten years before had made ſome impreſſions; upon his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; ſo that he afterwards conſtantly attended the religious meetings of that people, even through the heat of perſecution.</p>

               <note place="margin">1667.</note>Being again at a meeting in <hi>Cork,</hi> in the year 1667,<note place="margin">W.

<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032729_0025_0FF4EDFF6DE2D768"/>
eſpecially in <hi>Ireland.</hi> The earl immediately ordered his diſcharge. But his impriſonment was ſo far from terrifying him, that it ſtrengthened him in his reſolution of a cloſer union with that people, whoſe religious innocence appeared to be the only crime, for which they ſuffered.</p>
            <p>His more openly joining with the <hi>Quakers</hi> now brought him under that reproachful name;<note place="margin">1667.</note>
               <note place="margin">He openly joins the Quakers.</note> and the compliments and careſſes of his companions were changed into ſcoffs and deriſion; and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a by-word, and the ſubject of ſcorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt both to the profeſſor of religion, and to the profane.</p>
            <p>His father by a letter from a nobleman of his acquaintance,<note place="margin">Great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his father and him.</note> being informed of the ſituation of his ſon, ſent for him home.

long ſeries of years, the rigour of ſuch laws, as either deſignedly, or otherwiſe, affected their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and were uſed to force, or compel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, in religious matters; which they always diſtinguiſhed from civil affairs, ſo abundantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the Chriſtian patience and fortitude of this people, that it would fill a large volume to ſpecify only the principal, or at leaſt, the common incidents of this nature, which have been conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous among them: therefore, referring to their own writings, for an account of them, I ſhall only here inſert what <hi>R.

                  <hi>"Firſt,</hi> In that, among all the plots contrived by others againſt thee, ſince thy return into <hi>Britain,</hi> there never was any, owned by that people, found or known to be guilty (though many of them have been taken and impriſoned on ſuch kind of jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies) but were always found innocent and harmleſs, us became the followers of Chriſt; not coveting after, nor contending for, the kingdoms of this world, but ſubject to every ordinance of man, for conſcience ſake."</p>

               <p>"It will not be denied but that men ought to be more in love of God, than of any other thing;<note place="margin">R.

<pb n="56" facs="unknown:032729_0056_0FF4EDDBA1DFEBB8"/>
yet will he avoid, as death itſelf, to do thoſe things that may offend the party ſo beloved, or croſs his deſign in obtaining the thing ſo earneſtly deſired: though there may be ſome ſmall uſe in them, the great deſign, which is chiefly in his eye, will ſo balance him, that he will eaſily look over, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with ſuch petty neceſſities, rather than endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the loſs of the greater by them. Now, that men ought to be thus <hi>in love with God,</hi> and <hi>the life to come,</hi> none will deny; and the thing is apparent from theſe ſcriptures, Matt. vi. 20. <hi>but lay up for yourſelves treaſures in heaven.</hi> Col. iii. 2. <hi>ſet your affections on things above, &amp;c.</hi> and that this hath been the experience and attainment of ſome the ſcripture alſo declares, Pſalm lxiii. 1, 8. 2 Cor. v. 2."</p>

               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Not fighting, but ſuffering,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">They did not fight but ſuffer, &amp;c.</note> is another teſtimony, peculiar to this people, in the words of <hi>W. Penn, viz.</hi> "They affirm, That <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> teacheth people to <hi>beat their ſwords into plowſhares,</hi> and <hi>their ſpears into pruning hooks, and to learn war no more; that ſo the wolf may lie down with the lamb, and the lion with the calf, and nothing that deſtroys be entertained in the hearts of the people:</hi> exhorting them to employ their zeal againſt <hi>ſin,</hi> and turn their anger againſt <hi>Satan,</hi> and no longer war one againſt another; becauſe <hi>all wars and fightings</hi> come of men's own hearts luſts, according to the apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> and not of the meek ſpirit of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> who is captain of another <hi>warfare;</hi> and which is carried on with other weapons. Thus, as <hi>truth ſpeaking</hi> ſucceeded <hi>ſwearing,</hi> ſo <hi>faith and patience</hi> ſucceeded fighting, in the doctrine and practice of this people. Nor ought they, for this, to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to civil government; ſince if they cannot <hi>fight for it,</hi> neither can they <hi>fight againſt it;</hi> which is no mean ſecurity to any ſtate: nor is it reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that people ſhould be blamed for not doing more for others, than they can do for themſelves. And, Chriſtianity ſet aſide, if the coſts and fruits of war were well conſidered, peace, with all its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, is generally preferable. And though they were not for <hi>fighting,</hi> they were for <hi>ſubmitting</hi> to government; and that not only for <hi>fear,</hi> but for <hi>conſcience ſake,</hi> where government doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with conſcience; believing it to be an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:032729_0060_0FF4EFDCF20CDDC0"/>
of God, and where it is juſtly adminiſtered, a great benefit to mankind.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is obſervable, that though they abſolutely declined all military ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, not only in their perſons, but alſo in their refuſing to procure ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes, or others, in their room, by hiring, or in anywiſe paying, or contributing for the perſonal ſervice of ſuch for them, in that capacity, or for any particular military purpoſe ſolely; yet in all other reſpects, they punctually and willingly paid their taxes, though of a mixed nature, that is both military and civil, for the ſupport of government, as before obſerved. Vide page 51.</note> Though it has been their lot, through blind zeal in ſome, and intereſt in others, to have <hi>felt</hi> the <hi>ſtrokes</hi> of it with a greater weight and rigour, than any other <hi>perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> in this age; while they, of all others, religion ſet aſide, have given the civil magiſtrate the leaſt occaſion of trouble, in the diſcharge of his office."</p>
               <p>Concerning this point it may be further obſerved from <hi>R. Barclay, viz.</hi>—"For it is as eaſy to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure the ſun, at mid-day, as to deny that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians renounced all revenge and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and although this thing be ſo much known, yet it is as well knows, that almoſt all the modern ſects live in the neglect and contempt of this law of Chriſt, and likewiſe oppreſs others, who in this agree not with them, for conſcience ſake towards God: even, as we have ſuffered much in this our own country, becauſe we could neither ourſelves bear arms, nor ſend others in our places, nor give our money for the buying of drums, ſtandards, and other military attire. And laſtly, becauſe we could not hold our doors, windows and ſhops cloſe, for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake, upon ſuch days as faſts and prayers were appointed, to deſire a bleſſing upon, and ſucceſs for, the arms of the kingdom, or commonwealth, under which we live; neither give thanks for the victories acquired by the effuſion of much blood. By which forcing of the conſcience they would have conſtrained our brethren, living in divers kingdoms at war together, to have implored our God for contrary and contradictory things, and conſequently impoſſible; for it is impoſſible that two
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:032729_0061_0FF4EEB13AB92C30"/>
parties fighting ſhould both obtain the victory. And becauſe we cannot concur with them, in this confuſion, therefore, we are ſubject to perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The laſt thing I ſhall mention under this <hi>head,</hi> is <hi>their maintaining all their own poor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the poor, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>at their own expence;</hi> or, without being chargeable to others, beſides contributing towards the ſupport of the poor of other ſocieties, equally with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in all common <hi>poor rates</hi> or <hi>taxes:</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that no ſuch thing as a common beggar was permitted, or known, to be among them, of that ſociety. For, as they ſuffered none of their ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety to be in ſo neceſſitous a condition, as others, ſo they were ſo careful in the education of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and youth, that there were none among them, brought up without a competency of uſeful and plain learning; theſe things being annually and methodically enquired into, and ſtrictly practiſed through the whole ſociety, in every place. Thus, while, in theſe important matters, they were no ways burthenſome to others, and while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to other ſocieties equally with themſelves, in paying all <hi>poor rates</hi> and <hi>taxes</hi> of every kind, they were moreover and beſides no leſs noted for moſt other acts of beneficence according to their ſtations in civil ſociety; being ever among the firſt, <hi>in works and inſtitutions of charity,</hi> where they lived, according to their abilities: ſo that in contributions of this nature, they were obſerved moſtly either to be among the introducers or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of them, or otherwiſe diſtinguiſhed for their liberal donations; and if any were in diſtreſs, they were generally known to be among the firſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them.</p>
               <p>As the practice of divers of theſe particulars, mentioned under the preceding heads, made them appear, at firſt, very ſingular to many in all ranks and ſocieties of people; from whom they ſuffered
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:032729_0062_0FF4EE4C992D82C8"/>
much redicule,<note place="margin">Theſe things made the Quakers appear ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ngular, &amp;c.</note> unmerited abuſe, and cruel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, chiefly on account of divers of theſe things; and as they ſtill appear to be ſubject to ſomething of the ſame nature, though in leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, in ſome places, where they are but little known, and labor under falſe repreſentations; and where ignorance and a blind zeal diſpoſe people to reject and deſpiſe moderate enquiry; or where a ſtrong attachment to old cuſtoms, however abſurd, too frequently ſlights and refuſes ſober rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, on religious ſubjects, for unprofitable and acrimonious diſputes, I ſhall, therefore, cloſe this part with the following ſhort concluſions, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, from <hi>R.

was then rare, that any one entertained an inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a perſon, on that account, till he, or ſhe, had communicated it ſecretly to ſome very weighty and eminent friends among them, that they might have a ſenſe of the matter; looking to the counſel and unity of their brethren, as of great moment to them.

oblige thoſe that are of them, to <hi>walk ſuitably,</hi> or they are denied by them: that is all the <hi>mark,</hi> they ſet upon them, and the power they exerciſe, or judge a Chriſtian ſociety can exerciſe upon thoſe that are members of it."</p>
               <p>"The way of their proceeding againſt ſuch as have lapſed or tranſgreſſed, is this: He is viſited by ſome of them, and the matter of fact laid home to him, be it any evil practice againſt known and general virtue, or any branch of their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular teſtimony, which he, in common, profeſſeth with them. They labour with him in much love and zeal, for the <hi>good of his ſoul,</hi> the <hi>honor of God,</hi> and <hi>reputation</hi> of their profeſſion, to own his fault, and condemn it, in as ample a manner, as the evil, or ſcandal was given by him; which, for the moſt part, is performed by ſome <hi>written teſtimony,</hi> under the party's hand; and if it ſo happen, that the party prove <hi>refractory</hi> and is not willing to clear the <hi>truth,</hi> they profeſs, from the reproach of his, or her, evil doing, or unfaithfulneſs, they, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated entreaties, and due waiting for a token of repentance, give forth a paper to diſown ſuch a fact, and the party offending: recording the ſame, as a teſtimony of their care for the honor of the truth, they profeſs."</p>
               <p>"And if he, or ſhe, ſhall clear the <hi>profeſſion,</hi> and <hi>themſelves,</hi> by ſincere acknowledgment of their fault, and godly ſorrow for ſo doing, they are <hi>received,</hi> and <hi>looked upon again as members of their communion.</hi> For, as <hi>God,</hi> ſo his true people <hi>upbraid no man</hi> after repentance."</p>
               <p>That the general conduct and practice of this people have been, in a remarkable manner,<note place="margin">Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency in conduct with their profeſſion, &amp;c.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their profeſſion, we are well aſſured, not only by the accounts given by themſelves, but alſo by thoſe of others, who appear to have been beſt acquainted with their manner of life, in early

time; and whoſe certain knowledge enabled them to ſpeak with that moderation, which is diveſted of paſſion and prejudice; beſides, it is manifeſt from the many acrimonious and abuſive writings of their enemies themſelves againſt them, yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, that their conformity to the principles and cuſtoms before mentioned, was the chief cauſe of the ſevere <hi>perſecution</hi> and <hi>ſuffering;</hi> which they ſo long endured:—for which, if any inſtances of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate zeal, in early time, appeared in any individuals among them, (from which, probably, the firſt riſe of no religious ſociety has been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely free) it ſeems to have been too much the delight of their adverſaries to exaggerate and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent them.—For, as they profeſſed no theory, but what they chiefly derived from practice or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; nor ſpeculation, but what they principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had from experiment, ſo it has been long ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, particularly in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> that, as any of the members of this ſociety failed in the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal part, they conſequently, for the moſt part, diſcontinued the profeſſion, in proportion; and either went over to ſuch other religious ſocieties, as place leſs ſtreſs on the practice of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> or of true religion; or elſe they made no formal profeſſion of it at all, with any particular ſet of people: ſome apparently from an irreligious, mean and indolent, or depraved turn of mind; and others, probably, from looking upon all forms of religion, as <hi>vain;</hi> and that the knowledge of truth, and the interior of religion, or the intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the creature and the Creator, depends not upon, nor is neceſſarily connected with, any fixed form; but is rather obſcured, or impeded, by that attention, which ſuch forms, in general require; or which ultimately have ſo much tendency to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs the minds of many people with that ſlaviſh formality, which is obſervable to terminate in mere, religious ſuperſtition.</p>

                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:032729_0077_0FF4EED1329ABE10"/>Nevertheleſs it is well known, that in later times, divers among them have been obſerved, under the covering of a plain garb, and a formal compliance to ſundry of theſe external cuſtoms, before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, to make this profeſſion an engine to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate wealth, and from an apparent zeal for their profeſſion, in divers of thoſe very things, without the poſſeſſion of the real life, or ſubſtance, of it, have notwithſtanding continued among them, and uſed that credit and reputation, which the ſociety, in general, had acquired by a better principle, ſo as to obtain low, terreſtrial enjoyments, and worldly advantages, even, beyond others of the ſame degree, or rank of people. For it cannot be reaſonably ſuppoſed that every perſon who is born and educated, or brought up, merely in the form, is therefore conſequently experienced in every practical truth of the profeſſion, ſo much as thoſe, who have embraced the ſame from real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and experience, in their own minds, unleſs they poſſeſs the ſame experience and enjoyment; which may, or may not be the caſe; for profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or implicit belief, alone, cannot give a lively experience, nor a bare aſſent, convince the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But the Chriſtian care of this ſociety, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their diſcipline, already mentioned, as well as by the many additions, ſince made by them, to this part of their religious oeconomy, has not been ſmall, to prevent and redreſs this evil, as well as to remedy all other deviations from the truth of their profeſſion, and the primitive practice among them; which, in ſome or other of their members, cannot but ſometimes happen, while in this frail and mortal ſtate of exiſtence:— Yet the reſult of this very care, ſo far, at leaſt, as it reſpects the external obligations, upon the members of this ſociety, and the many rules in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed from time to time, among them, for that purpoſe, it is thought by ſome, has had this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

Then great trading was a burden, and
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:032729_0081_0FF4EEDE03892E90"/>
great concerns a great trouble; all needleſs things, fine houſes, rich furniture, gaudy apparel, were an eye-ſore; our eye being ſingle to the Lord, and the inſhining of his light, in our hearts; which gave us the ſight of the knowledge of the glory of God; which ſo affected our minds, that it ſtained the glory of all earthly things; and they bore no maſtry with us, either in dwelling, eating, drinking, buying, ſelling, marrying, or giving in marriage. The Lord was the object of our eye; and we all humble and low before him, and ſelf of ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; miniſters and elders, in all ſuch caſes, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as good examples, that the flock might follow their foot-ſteps, as they followed Chriſt; in the dairy croſs of ſelf-denial, in their dwellings, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, eating, drinking, buying, ſelling, marrying, and giving in marriage; and this anſwered the <hi>Lord's</hi> witneſs in all conſciences, and gave us great credit among men."</p>
               <p>Such appear to have been the people called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> as to their firſt riſe, principles, doctrines, religious ſyſtem, and general practice, or manners, in early time; with whom <hi>W.

               <p>About this time (1668, and the twenty-fourth year of his age) <hi>William Penn</hi> publiſhed ſeveral of his firſt pieces, now extant in his printed works;
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:032729_0082_0FF4EE7A5B15EA08"/>
one of which,<note place="margin">1668. W. Penn's firſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, &amp;c.</note> entitled, <hi>"The ſandy foundation ſhaken,"</hi> was written in conſequence of a diſpute, which he had in <hi>London</hi> with one <hi>Vincent,</hi> a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter. In this he expoſed the vulgar notion of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and ſome other religious tenets; which gave ſo much offence to thoſe then at the helm of the church, that they immediately took the old method of reforming what they called er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, by their ſtrongeſt argument, <hi>viz. "An order for impriſoning him in the tower of London;"</hi>—there he was under cloſe confinement, and even denied the viſits of his friends:<note place="margin">His impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment in the tower of London.</note> but yet his enemies attained not their purpoſe; for when, after ſome time, his ſervant brought him word, that the biſhop of <hi>London</hi> was reſolved he ſhould either publicly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, or die a priſoner, he made this reply: "All is well: I wiſh they had told me ſo before; ſince the expecting a releaſe put a ſtop to ſome buſineſs: thou mayſt tell my father,<note place="margin">His reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> who, I know, will aſk thee theſe words; that my priſon ſhall be my grave, before I will budge a jot; for I owe my conſcience to no mortal man. I have no need to fear; God will make amends for all. They are miſtaken in me; I value not their threats and reſolutions: for they ſhall know I can weary out their malice and peeviſhneſs; and in me ſhall they all behold a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution above fear; conſcience above cruelty; and a baffle put upon all their deſigns, by the ſpirit of patience, the companion of all the tribulated flock of the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who is the author and finiſher of the faith, that overcomes the world, yea, death and hell too. Neither great nor good things were ever attained without loſs and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips. He that would reap and not labor muſt faint with the wind, and periſh in diſappointments: but an hair of my head ſhall not fall without the providence of my Father, that is over all."</p>
               <p>"A ſpirit warmed with the love of God" (ſays the writer of his life) "and devoted to his ſervice,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:032729_0083_0FF4EEDF92584230"/>
ever purſues its main purpoſe: he,<note place="margin">He writes ſeveral treatiſes in the tower.</note> being now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from preaching, applied himſelf to writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſeveral treatiſes were the fruits of his ſolitude, particularly, that excellent one, entitled, <hi>No croſs, no crown;</hi> a book, which, tending to promote the general deſign of religion, was well accepted, and ſoon paſt ſeveral impreſſions."</p>
               <p>He alſo, in the year 1669, writ, from the tower, a letter to the lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> then principal ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of ſtate, by whoſe warrant he was committed,<note place="margin">1669. He writes to the Lord Arlington, &amp;c.</note> in vindication of his innocence, and to remove ſome aſperſions caſt upon him; in this letter, with chriſtian boldneſs, and elegance of ſtile, he pleads the reaſonableneſs of toleration in religion, ſhews the ſingular injuſtice of his impriſonment, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his firm reſolution to ſuffer, rather than give up his cauſe; he likewiſe requeſts the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to lay his caſe before the king, and deſires he may be ordered a releaſe; but, if that ſhould be denied, he intreats the favour of acceſs to the royal preſence, or at leaſt, that the ſecretary him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would pleaſe to give him a full hearing, &amp;c. And in order to clear himſelf from the aſperſions, caſt on him, in relation to the <hi>doctrines of the Trinity,</hi> the <hi>incarnation,</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction of Chriſt,</hi> he publiſhed a little book called, <hi>"Innocency with her open face,"</hi> by way of apology for the aforeſaid, <hi>Sandy foundation ſhaken:</hi> in this apology he ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully vindicated himſelf, that ſoon after the publication thereof,<note place="margin">He is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</note> he was diſcharged from his impriſonment; which had been of about ſeven months continuance.</p>
               <p>In the latter part of the ſummer this year, he went again to <hi>Ireland.</hi> Being arrived at <hi>Cork,</hi> he there viſited his friends the <hi>Quakers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He goes to Ireland.</note> who were in priſon, for their religion, attended the meetings of his ſociety, and afterwards went from thence to <hi>Dublin;</hi> where an account of his friends ſufferings

being drawn up, by way of addreſs, it was by him preſented to the lord lieutenant.</p>
               <p>During his ſtay in <hi>Ireland,</hi> though his buſineſs, in the care of his father's eſtate,<note place="margin">His buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there.</note> took up a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of his time, yet he frequently attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and preached in the meetings of his friends, eſpecially at <hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>Cork;</hi> in one of which places he uſually reſided. He alſo wrote, during his reſidence there, ſeveral treatiſes, and took every opportunity in his power, to ſollicit thoſe in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in behalf of his friends in priſon: and, in the beginning of the fourth month, 1670, through his repeated applications to the chancellor, the lord <hi>Arran,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1670.</note> and the lord lieutenant, an order of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was obtained for their releaſe.

               </p>
               <p>In the year 1670 was paſſed the <hi>conventicle act,</hi> which prohibited the meetings of the diſſenters,<note place="margin">1670.</note> under ſevere penalties. The rigour of this law was immediately executed upon the <hi>Quakers;</hi> who not being uſed to give way, in the cauſe of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſtood moſt expoſed.

eſpecially when our very ſafety is eminently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in ſo doing, and that we cannot decline this diſcrimination of ourſelves from <hi>Papiſts,</hi> without being conſcious to ourſelves of the guilt of our own ſufferings; for that muſt every man needs be, that ſuffers mutely, under another character than that, which truly and properly belongeth to him, and his belief. That which giveth me a more than ordinary right to ſpeak, at this time, and in this place, is the great abuſe, that I have received, above any other of my profeſſion; for, of a long time, I have not only been ſuppoſed a Papiſt, but a <hi>ſeminary,</hi> a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> an <hi>emiſſary</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in pay from the <hi>Pope,</hi> a man dedicating my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to the intereſt and advancement of that party. Nor hath this been the report of the rabble, but the jealouſy and inſinuation of perſons otherwiſe ſober and diſcreet: Nay, ſome zealous for the Proteſtant religion, have been ſo far gone in this miſtake, as not only to think ill of us, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline our converſation, but to take courage to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to proſecute us for a ſort of concealed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; and the truth is, what with one thing, and what with another, we have been as the <hi>wool-ſacks,</hi> and common <hi>whipping-ſtock</hi> of the kingdom; all laws have been let looſe upon us, as if the deſign were not to reform, but to deſtroy us, and that not for what <hi>we are,</hi> but for what <hi>we are not:</hi> It is hard, that we muſt thus bear the ſtripes of another intereſt, and be their proxy, in puniſhment; but it is worſe, that ſome men can pleaſe themſelves in ſuch a ſort of adminiſtration."</p>
               <p>"I would not be miſtaken, I am far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it fit that <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhould be whipped for their conſciences, becauſe I exclaim againſt the injuſtice of whipping <hi>Quakers</hi> for <hi>Papiſts:</hi> No, for though the hand, pretended to be lifted up againſt them, hath (I know not by what direction) lit heavy upon us, and we complain; yet we do not mean, that

any ſhould take a freſh aim at them, or that they muſt come in our room; for we muſt give the liberty we aſk, and cannot be falſe to our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, though it were to relieve ourſelves; for we have <hi>good will</hi> to all men, and would have none ſuffer for a truly ſober and conſcientious diſſent, on any hand: and I humbly take leave to add, that thoſe methods, againſt perſons ſo qualified, do not ſeem to me to be convincing, or indeed adequate to the <hi>reaſon</hi> of mankind; but this I ſubmit to your conſideration."</p>
               <p>"To conclude, I hope we ſhall be held excuſed of the men of that profeſſion, in giving this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing declaration, ſince it is not with deſign to expoſe them; but, firſt, to pay that regard, we owe to the enquiry of this <hi>committee;</hi> and, in the next place, to relieve ourſelves from the daily ſpoil and ruin, which now attend and threaten many hundreds of families, by the execution of <hi>laws,</hi> that we humbly conceive were never made againſt us."</p>

I do tell you again, and here ſolemly declare, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Almighty God, and before you all, that the profeſſion I now make, and the ſociety I now adhere to, have been ſo far from altering that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> judgment I had, that I am not conſcious to myſelf of having receded from an <hi>iota</hi> of any one principle, maintained by thoſe firſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>reformers</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> and our own <hi>martyrs,</hi> at home, againſt the <hi>Pope, and See of Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"On the contrary, I do, with great truth,<note place="margin">1678. W.

And, therefore it is, we think it hard, that though we deny, in common with her, thoſe doctrines of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo zealouſly <hi>proteſted</hi> againſt, from whence the name <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> yet that we ſhould be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as to ſuffer, and that with extreme ſeverity, by thoſe very laws on purpoſe made againſt the maintainers of thoſe doctrines, we do ſo deny. We chuſe no ſuffering, for God knows what we have already ſuffered, and how many ſufficient and trading families are reduced to great poverty by it. We think ourſelves an uſeful people: we are ſure we are a peaceable people; but, if we ſtill ſuffer, let us not ſuffer as <hi>Popiſh recuſants,</hi> but as <hi>Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant diſſenters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"But I would obviate another objection, and that none of the leaſt, that hath been made againſt us, <hi>viz. That we are enemies to government, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,

and particularly diſaffected to this we live under:</hi> I think it not amiſs, but very ſeaſonable, yea, my duty, now to declare to you, (and that I do with good conſcience, in the ſight of the Almighty God) firſt, that we believe <hi>government</hi> to be <hi>God's ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;</hi> and next, that this <hi>preſent government</hi> is eſtabliſhed by the <hi>providence of God,</hi> and <hi>law of the land,</hi> and that it is our <hi>chriſtian duty</hi> readily to obey it, in all <hi>juſt laws;</hi> and wherein we cannot comply, through <hi>tenderneſs</hi> of <hi>conſcience,</hi> in all ſuch caſes, not to revile, or conſpire againſt the government, but, with chriſtian humility and patience tire out all miſtakes about us; and wait their better informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; who, we believe, do as undeſervedly as ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treat us; and I know not what greater ſecurity can be given by any people, or how any govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be eaſier from the ſubjects of it.</p>

And I ſhould very gladly, according to his deſire, have waited upon you into <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> to have informed your honor, in perſon, had I not, next week, been paſſing to <hi>Virginia.</hi> But nevertheleſs, to ſatisfy you of the truth, I thought good to write unto you my knowledge, and firſt, to deſcribe to you, from the north ſide of <hi>Delaware,</hi> unto <hi>Hudſon's</hi> river, in ſir <hi>Edmund's</hi> patent, called <hi>New-Albion;</hi> which lyeth juſt between <hi>New-England</hi> and <hi>Maryland,</hi> and that <hi>ocean-ſea;</hi> I take it to be about one hundred and ſixty miles; I find ſome broken land, iſles and inlets, and many ſmall iſles at <hi>Egg-bay.</hi> But, going to <hi>Delaware-bay,</hi> by cape <hi>May;</hi> which is twenty-four miles, at moſt, and is, as I underſtand, very well ſet out, and printed in captain <hi>Powell's</hi> map of <hi>New-England,</hi> done, as is told me, by a draught I gave to <hi>M. Daniel,</hi> the plot maker; which, ſir <hi>Edmund</hi> ſaith, you have at home;—on that north ſide, about five miles within, a port, or road, for any ſhips, called the <hi>Nook;</hi> and within lyeth the king of <hi>Kechemeches,</hi> having, as I ſuppoſe, about fifty men; and twelve leagues higher, a little above the bay and bar, is the river of <hi>Manteſes,</hi> which hath twenty miles on <hi>Charles's</hi> river, and thirty miles running up a fair navigable, deep river, all a flat level of rich and fat black marſh mould; which I think to be three hundred thouſand acres. In this ſir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> intends, as he ſaith, to ſettle; and there the king of <hi>Manteſes</hi> hath about one hundred bowmen. Next above, about ſix leagues higher, is a fair deep river, twelve miles navigable; where is <hi>Free-ſtone,</hi> and there, over againſt it, is the king of <hi>Sikoneſſes;</hi> and next is <hi>Aſomoches</hi> river and king, with an hundred men; and next is <hi>Eriwoneck,</hi> a king of forty men; where we ſat down; and five miles above is the king of <hi>Ramcock,</hi> with one hundred men; and four miles higher the king of <hi>Axion,</hi> with two-hundred men; and next to him, ten leagues over land, an inland king <hi>Calcefar,</hi> with one hundred and fifty men; and then there is, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>Charle's</hi> river, two fair woody iſlands, very pleaſant and fit for parks, one of one thouſand acres, the other of one thouſand four hundred, or thereabouts; and ſix leagues higher, near a creek, called <hi>Moſilian,</hi> the king having two hundred men; and then we come to the <hi>Falls,</hi> made by a rock of limeſtone; as I ſuppoſe, it is about ſixty-five leagues from the ſea:—near to which is an iſle, fit for a city; all materials there to build; and above, the river fair and navigable, as the <hi>Indians</hi> inform me; for I went but ten miles higher. I do account all the <hi>Indians</hi> to be about eight hundred; and are in ſeveral factions and war againſt the <hi>Suſquaban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocks;</hi> and are all extreme fearful of a gun, naked and unarmed againſt our ſhot, ſwords and pikes. I had ſome bickering with ſome of them; and they are of ſo little eſteem, as I durſt, with fifteen men, ſit down, or trade in deſpight of them; and ſince my return eighteen <hi>Swedes</hi> are ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled there; and ſo ſometimes ſixteen <hi>Dutchmen</hi> do, in a boat, trade with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of them.</p>
                        <p>I ſaw there an infinite quantity of buſtards, ſwans, geeſe and fowl, covering the ſhores; as within, the like multitude of pidgeons, and ſtore of turkies; of which I tried one to weigh forty-ſix pounds. There is much variety and plenty of delicate freſh ſea fiſh, and ſhell fiſh, and whales or grampus; elks, deer that bring three young at a time, and the woods beſtrewed many months with cheſnuts, walnuts and maſt of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts, to ſeed them and hogs, that would increaſe exceedingly. There the barren grounds have four kinds of grapes, and many mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with aſh, elms, and the talleſt and greateſt pines and pitch trees, that I have ſeen. There are cedars, cypreſs and ſaſſafras, with wild fruits, pears, wild-cherries, pine-apples, and the dainty <hi>Parſemenas;</hi> and there is no queſtion but <hi>Almonds,</hi> and other fruits of <hi>Spain,</hi> will proſper, as in <hi>Virginia.</hi> And (which is a good comfort) in four and twenty hours, you may ſend, or go by ſea, to <hi>New-England,</hi> or <hi>Virginia,</hi> with a fair wind; you may have cattle, and from the <hi>Indians</hi> two thouſand buſhels of corn, at twelve pence a buſhel, in truck; ſo as victuals are there cheaper and better than to be tranſported; neither do I conceive any great need of a fort, or charge, where there is no enemy.</p>
                        <p>If my lord <hi>Palatine</hi> will bring with him three hundred men, or more, there is no doubt, but he may do very well, and grow rich; for it is a moſt pure healthful air, and ſuch pure wholeſome ſprings, rivers and waters, as are delightful of a deſert, as can be ſeen; with ſo many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of ſeveral flowers, trees and foreſts, for ſwine; ſo many fair riſings and proſpects, all green and verdant: and <hi>Maryland,</hi> a good friend and neighbour, in four and twenty hours, ready to comfort and ſupply.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Other accounts affirm, That the original of the name aroſe from the winding and turning of the creek, much in the ſhape of a horn, whence the <hi>Dutch</hi> word, <hi>Hoarnkill:</hi>—This is the tradition of the inhabitants there, &amp;c. But ſoon after it came into the hands of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> it took the above name of <hi>Lewis-town:</hi>—and the creek appears to be much diminiſhed, &amp;c.</p>

                           <p>In the pure love and precious fellowſhip of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt we very dearly ſalute you;—Foraſmuch as there was a paper printed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral months ago, entitled, <hi>"The deſcription of New-Weſt-Jerſey,</hi> in which our names were mentioned, as Truſtees for one undivided moiety of the ſaid province, and becauſe it is alledged, that ſome, partly on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and others apprehending that the paper, by the manner of its expreſſion, came from the body of Friends, as a religious ſociety of people, and not from particulars, have, through theſe miſtakes, weakly concluded, that the ſaid deſcription, in matter and form, might be writ, printed and recommended on purpoſe to prompt and allure people to diſ-ſettle and tranſplant themſelves, as its alſo by ſome alledged; and becauſe we are informed that ſeveral have, on that account, taken encouragement and reſolution to tranſplant themſelves and families to that province; and left any of them (as is feared by ſome) ſhould go out of a curious and unſettled mind; and others to ſhun the teſtimony of the bleſſed <hi>Croſs</hi> of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> of which ſeveral weighty friends have a godly jealouſy upon their ſpirits, left an unwarrantable forwardneſs ſhould act or hurry, any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, or beyond, the wiſdom and counſel of the Lord, or the freedom of his light and ſpirit, in their own hearts, and not upon good and weighty grounds; it truly laid upon us to let Friends know how the matter ſtands; which we ſhall endeavour to do with all clearneſs and fidelity.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That there is ſuch a place as <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> is certain.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That it is reputed of thoſe, who have lived and travelled in that country to be wholeſome of air, and fruitful of ſoil, and capable of ſea trade, is alſo certain; and it is not right, in any, to deſpiſe it, or diſſwade thoſe, that find freedom from the <hi>Lord,</hi> and neceſſity put upon them, on going.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. That the Duke of <hi>York</hi> ſold it to thoſe called Lord <hi>Berkeley,</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of <hi>Stratton,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Carteret;</hi> equally to be divided between them, is alſo certain.</p>

Penn</hi> to accept of the truſt, for their ſakes and ſecurity, we did, all of us, comply with theſe, and the like requeſts, and accepted of the truſt.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Upon this we became truſtees for one moiety of the ſaid province, yet undivided; and after do little labour, trouble and coſt, a diviſion was obtained between the ſaid Sir <hi>George Carteret</hi> and us, as truſtees: the country is ſituated and bounded, as is expreſſed in the printed deſcription.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. This now divided moiety is to be caſt into one hundred parts, lots or proprieties; ten of which, upon the agreement, made betwixt <hi>E.

                           <p n="8">8. The ninety parts remaining are expoſed to ſale; on behalf of the creditors of the ſaid <hi>Edward Byllinge.</hi> And forasmuch ſeveral friends are concerned as creditors, as well as others, and the diſpoſal of ſo great a part of this country being in our hands; we did in real tenderneſs and regard to friends, and eſpecially to the poor and neceſſitous, make friends the firſt offer; that if any of them, though particularly thoſe, who being low in the world, and under trials about a comfortable livelihood for themſelves and families, ſhould be deſirous of dealing for any part or parcel thereof, that they might have the refuſal.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. This was the real and honeſt intent of our hearts, and not to prompt, or allure any out of their places, either by the credit our names might have with our people throughout the nation, or by repreſenting the thing otherwiſe than it is in itſelf.</p>
                           <p>As to the printed paper, ſome time ſince ſet forth by the creditors, as a deſcription of that province, we ſay, as to two paſſages in it, they are not ſo clearly and ſafely worded as ought to have been; particularly in ſeeming to hint, the <hi>Winter</hi> ſeaſon to be ſo ſhort a time; when, on fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther information, we hear it is ſometimes longer, and ſometimes ſhorter, than therein expreſſed; and the laſt clauſe, relating to liberty of conſcience, we would not have any to think, that it is promiſed or intended, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the liberty of the exerciſe of religion by force of arms; though we ſhall never conſent to any the leaſt violence on conſcience; yet it was never deſigned to encourage any to expect by force of arms, to have liberty of conſcience fenced againſt invaders thereof.</p>
                           <p>And be it known unto you all, in the name and fear of Almighty God, his Glory and Honor, Power and Wiſdom, Truth and Kingdom, is dearer to us, than all viſible things; and as our eye has been ſingle, and our hearts ſincere, in the living God, in this, as in other things, ſo we deſire all, whom it may concern, that all groundleſs jealouſies may be judged down, and watched againſt; and that all extremes may be avoided, on all hands, by the power of the Lord; that nothing which hurts or grieves the holy life of truth in any that goes or ſtays, may be adhered to, nor any provocation given to break precious unity.</p>
                           <p>This am I, <hi>William Penn,</hi> moved of the Lord to write unto you, left any bring a temptation upon themſelves, or others; and, in offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord, ſlay their own Peace. Bleſſed are they that can ſee and behold him their Leader, their Orderer, their Conductor and Preſerver in ſtaying and going; whoſe is the earth and the fulneſs thereof, and the cattle upon a thouſand hills. And, as we formerly writ, we cannot but repeat our requeſt unto you, that, in whomſoever a deſire is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this intended plantation, ſuch would weigh the thing before the Lord, and not headily, or raſhly, conclude on any ſuch remove; and that they do not offer violence to the tender love of their near kindred and relations, but ſoberly and conſcientiouſly endeavour to obtain their <hi>good wills;</hi> the unity of friends, where they live; that, whether they go, or ſtay, it may be of good favour before the Lord, and good people; from whom only can all heavenly and earthly bleſſings come;—This we thought good to write, for the preventing all miſunderſtandings, and to declare the real truth of the matter; and ſo we recommend you all to the Lord, who is the watchman of his Iſrael.

Seven ſcore of our people have been killed by reaſon of the drinking it, ſince the time it was firſt ſold us. Thoſe people that ſell it are blind; they have no eyes:—But now there is a people come to live amongſt us, that have eyes; they ſee it to be for our hurt, and we know it to be for our hurt; they are willing to deny themſelves the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it, for our good: Thoſe people have eyes; we are glad ſuch a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are come among us: we muſt put it down by mutual conſent; the caſk muſt be ſealed up: it muſt be made faſt; it muſt not leak by day nor by night, in light nor in the dark; and we give you theſe four belts of <hi>Wampum;</hi> which we would have you lay up ſafe, and keep by you, to be witneſſes of this agreement, that we make with you; and we would have you tell your children, that theſe four belts of <hi>Wampum</hi> are given you, to be witneſſes betwixt us and you, of this agreement."</p>

But, as yet I have not had time to let the people, in general, know it: and now ſeeing the ports are made legally free, and the government ſettled, I would not have any thing to remain as a diſcouragement to planters; here are ſeveral good and convenient ſettlements already, and here is land enough, and good enough, for many more.</p>

I have travelled through moſt of the places that are ſettled, and ſome that are not; and in every place I find the country very apt to anſwer the expectation of the diligent.

I have ſeen an apple-tree, from a pippin-kernel, yield a barrel of curious cyder; and peaches in ſuch plenty, that ſome people took their carts a peach-gathering; I could not but ſmile at the conceit of it; they are very delicate fruit, and hang almoſt like our oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are tied on ropes. I have ſeen and known, this ſummer, forty buſhels of bold wheat of one buſhel ſown; and many more ſuch inſtances I could bring, which would be too tedious here to mention. We have, from the time called May until Michaelmas, great ſtore of very good wild fruits; as, ſtrawberries, cranberries and hurtle-berries, which are like our bilberries in <hi>England,</hi> but far ſweeter; they are very wholeſome fruits. The cranberries, much like cherries, for color and bigneſs; which may be kept till fruit come again; an excellent ſauce is made of them for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon, turkeys, and other great fowl; and they are better to make tarts than either gooſberries or cherries; we have them brought to our houſes by the <hi>Indians,</hi> in great plenty. My brother Robert had as many cherries, this year, as would have loaded ſeveral carts. It is my judgment, by what I have obſerved, that fruit trees, in this country, deſtroy themſelves by the very weight of their fruit.</p>
                     <p>As for veniſon and fowls, we have great plenty; we have brought home to our houſes,<note place="margin">Plenty in New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, in 1680.</note> by the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſeven or eight fat bucks in a day; and ſometimes put by as many, having no occaſion for them, and fiſh, in their ſeaſon very plenteous. my couſin <hi>Revell</hi> and I, with ſome of my men, went laſt third month into the river to catch her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings;
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:032729_0154_0FF4EF825A9F2B98"/>
for, at that time, they came in great ſholes into the ſhallows; we had neither rod nor net; but, after the <hi>Indian</hi> faſhion, made a round pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, about two yards over, and a foot high, but left a gap for the fiſh to go in at, and made a buſh to lay in the gap, to keep the fiſh in; and when that was done, we took two long birches, and tied their tops together, and went about a ſtones-caſt above our ſaid pinfold; then hawling theſe birch boughs down the ſtream, where we drove thouſands before us; but ſo many got into our trap as it would hold; and then we began to hawl them on ſhore, as faſt as three or four of us could, by two or three at a time; and, after this manner, in half an hour, we could have filled a three buſhel ſack of as good large herrings as ever I ſaw. And as to beef and pork, here is great plenty of it, and cheap; and alſo good ſheep. The common graſs of this country feeds beef very fat. I have killed two this year; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have reaſon to know it: beſides, I have ſeen, this fall, in <hi>Burlington,</hi> killed eight or nine fat oxen and cows on a market day, and all very fat. And though I ſpeak of herrings only, left any ſhould think we have little other ſorts, we have great plenty of moſt ſorts of fiſh, that ever I ſaw in <hi>England:</hi> beſides ſeveral other ſorts that are not known there; as, rocks, cat-fiſh, ſhads, ſheeps-heads, ſturgeons; and fowls plenty; as, ducks, geeſe, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys, pheaſants, partridges; and many other ſorts, that I cannot remember, and would be too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to mention.</p>
                     <p>Indeed the country, take it as a wilderneſs, is a brave country, though no place will pleaſe all. But ſome will be ready to ſay,—He writes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, but not of inconveniences.—In anſwer to theſe, I honeſtly declare there is ſome barren land, as, I ſuppoſe, there is in moſt places of the world; and more wood than ſome would have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their lands; neither will the country produce

corn without labour, nor cattle be got without ſomething to buy them, nor bread with idleneſs; elſe it would be a brave country indeed; and I queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not, but all then would give it a good word; For my part, I like it ſo well, I never had the leaſt thought of returning to <hi>England,</hi> except on account of trade.</p>

their religious and civil capacity; inſomuch that his name is revered in a double reſpect, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered dear to poſterity. The fruits of his labours have placed his conduct above the power of envy and detraction; which would pervert every good and laudable deſign to the vileſt purpoſes, and repreſent the moſt generous actions, as ariſing from ſordid and ſiniſter views: evils, which always indicate their oppoſite virtues and true merit, and have their reſidence in baſe and low minds.</p>

                     <p>Governor <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> in his hiſtory of <hi>Maſſachuſet's-bay,</hi> ſays, "Our anceſtors valued themſelves upon being a colony for <hi>religion. Penn</hi> had no other motive to found his colony, than <hi>human policy."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, By <hi>religion</hi> here, it ſeems not unreaſonable to ſuppoſe, the author meant, that partial advancement of a particular ſect, or of the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of one particular form of religion only, both in civil and eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal power and advantages, to the excluſion of all others; which appears, by his hiſtory, to have been the real caſe, in that colony:—and that, by <hi>human policy only,</hi> is to be underſtood, in this place, the conferring of no excluſive favour, nor partial advantages, on the votaries of any one particular form of religion alone, according to the political ſtate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> eſtabliſhed by <hi>William Penn;</hi>—for as menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the beginning, it is moſt certain, that <hi>William Penn,</hi> both in a religious and civil reſpect,—"As an univerſal father, opened his arms to all mankind, without diſtinction of ſect, or party. In his republic, it was not the religious creed, but perſonal merit, that entitled every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſociety to the protection and emolument of the ſtate."</p>
                     <p>It is not my buſineſs here to compare this kind of <hi>religion,</hi> with what is here called <hi>human policy alone,</hi> nor to ſhew how far the latter excels, or tranſcends, the unreaſonable limitation of the former, both in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and political ſenſe, notwithſtanding the names here given them; becauſe the perverſion, or miſapplication of names and words is eaſy and common;—but to call the beſt religion, <hi>human policy only,</hi> cannot alter the nature of it, though it may ſometimes have an effect on igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and inconſiderate minds, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Second, Beſides, I think I have known ſome others, ſo differently minded in their conceptions of things, and ſo ſtrongly ſwayed by the opinion, though under pretence of religion, or from declared religious views, as to endeavour to make men believe, <hi>"That true Chriſtians ought not to be concerned, as agents, in the affairs of civil government at all:"</hi>— becauſe, ſay they, <hi>"Chriſt's kingdom is not of this world,"</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall not meddle here with ſuch opinions further than, in this hiſtory to oppoſe the invariable ſentiments, and uniform conduct of <hi>William Penn</hi> to the extravagancy of all ſuch notions.</p>
                     <p>When preparing for his ſettlement and government of <hi>Pennſylvania William Penn,</hi> in divers of his letters and writings, on the occaſion, &amp;c. beſides what is publiſhed, of that nature, in his printed works, expreſſed his <hi>religious ſenſe and views,</hi> in a manner ſufficiently clear, on this affair; of which the following ſhort extracts may ſerve, as a ſpecimen, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, To his friends, in a more general capacity:—</p>
                     <p>"And now give me leave to ſay, I have ſerved the Lord, his truth and people, in my day, to my ability, and not ſought myſelf, though much ſpent my ſelf; ſo has he firmly made me to believe, that I ſhall not, even, <hi>outwardly,</hi> go without my reward; I ſee his bleſſed hand <hi>therein,</hi> that has bleſſed my faith and patience, and long attendance with ſucceſs. And becauſe I have been ſomewhat exerciſed, at times, about the nature and end of government, among men, it is reaſonable to expect, that I ſhould endeavour to eſtabliſh a juſt and righteous one, in <hi>this province; that others may take example by it;</hi>—truly this my heart deſires. For the nations want a <hi>precedent:</hi> and till vice, and corrupt manners, be impartially rebuked and puniſhed, and till virtue and ſobriety be cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the wrath of God will hang over nations. I do, therefore, deſire the Lord's wiſdom to guide me, and thoſe that may be concerned with me; that we may do the thing, that is truly wiſe and juſt," &amp;c. M.S.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, To a particular friend in <hi>England,</hi> who afterwards removed to <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> taken from his own hand writing, dated, in 1681, <hi>viz.</hi>—</p>
                     <p>"For my country, I eyed the Lord, in obtaining it; and more was I drawn inward to look to him, and to owe it to his hand and power, <hi>than to any other way; I have ſo obtained it, and deſire to keep it;</hi> that I may not be unworthy of his love; but do that, which may anſwer his kind Providence, and ſerve his truth and people: <hi>that an example may be ſet up to the nations:</hi> there may be room there, though not here, for ſuch an <hi>holy experiment."</hi> &amp;c.</p>

This, in part, he effected; and, by thoſe means, which Providence, in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,<note place="margin">His ſucceſs in this his deſign.</note> put into his hands, he ſo far brought to paſs, as both to excite the admiration of ſtrangers, and to fix in poſterity, that love and honor for his memory, which the length of future time will ſcarcely ever be able to efface.</p>
               <p>It has already been obſerved,<note place="margin">W.

There was a large ſum of money due, from the government, to the Admiral, at the time of his death; much of

In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this debt, <hi>William Penn,</hi> in the ſummer of the year 1680, petitioned King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that <hi>letters patent</hi> might be granted him, for a tract of land, in <hi>America,</hi> lying north of <hi>Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> on the eaſt, bounded by <hi>Delaware</hi> river; on the weſt limited as <hi>Maryland;</hi> and northward to extend as far as plantable.</p>

               <p>In the preface to this <hi>frame</hi> is exhibited a ſketch of the author's ſentiments on the nature of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in general, his reflections on the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent modes of it, and his inducement for forming his. It may ſerve to give ſome idea of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in general, on this ſubject,
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:032729_0197_0FF4F0ADA02AD148"/>
reſpecting which they have frequently been miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented; I ſhall, therefore, here give the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extract from it.—The author, after having quoted ſeveral parts of the ſacred ſcriptures, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to government, proceeds, in the following words:</p>
               <p>—"This ſettles the divine right of government beyond exception,<note place="margin">Part of the preface to his frame of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and that for two ends; firſt, to terrify evil doers; ſecondly, to cheriſh thoſe, that do well; which gives government a life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond corruption; and makes it as durable, in the world, as good men ſhall be. So that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſeems to me a part of religion itſelf; a thing ſacred, in its inſtitution and end. For, if it does not directly remove the cauſe, it cruſhes the effects of evil; and is, as ſuch, a lower, yet an <hi>emanation of the ſame divine power,</hi> that is both author and object of pure religion; the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference lying here; that the one is more free and mental, the other more corporal and compulſive, in its operation: but that is only to evil-doers; govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment itſelf being otherwiſe as capable of kindneſs, goodneſs and charity, as a more private ſociety.</p>
               <p>"They weakly err, that think there is no other uſe of government, than <hi>correction;</hi> which is the coarſeſt part of it: daily experience tells us, that the care and regulation of many other affairs, more ſoft, and daily neceſſary, make up much the greater part of government; and which muſt have followed the peopling of the world, had <hi>Adam</hi> never fallen; and will continue among men, on earth, under the higheſt attainments, they may arrive at, by the coming of the bleſſed ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> from Heaven."—</p>
               <p>As to the modes, he further obſerves,—"I do not find a model in the world, that time, place,<note place="margin">Of modes of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</note> and ſome ſingular emergencies, have not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily altered; nor is it eaſy to frame a civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſhall ſerve all places alike;".—"Any
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:032729_0198_0FF4F04359E07F18"/>
government is free to the people under it (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the frame) where the laws rule, and the people are a party to thoſe laws; and more than this is tyranny, olygarchy, or confuſion."—</p>
               <p>"There is hardly one <hi>frame</hi> of government, in the world, ſo ill deſigned by its firſt founders, that, in good hands, would not do well enough; and hiſtory tells us, the beſt, in ill ones, can do nothing, that is great and good; Witneſs, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> ſtates. Governments, like clocks, go from the motion, men give them; and as governments are made and moved by men, ſo by them are they ruined too. Wherefore, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments rather depend upon men, than men upon governments. Let men be good, and the government cannot be bad; if it be ill, they will cure it. But, if men be bad, let government be never ſo good,<note place="margin">Part of the preface to William Penn's frame Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> they will endeavour to warp and ſpoil it to their turn."—"That, therefore, which makes a good government, muſt keep it, <hi>viz.</hi> Men of wiſdom and virtue; qualities, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deſcend not with worldy inheritances, muſt be carefully propagated by a <hi>virtuous educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of youth;</hi> for which after ages will owe more to the care and prudence of <hi>founders,</hi> and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> than to their parents, for their private patrimonies."</p>
               <p>"Theſe conſiderations," (ſeveral of which, for brevity, are here omitted) of the weight of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the nice and various opinions about it, made it uneaſy to me to think of publiſhing the enſuing <hi>frame,</hi> and <hi>conditional laws,</hi> foreſeeing both the cenſures, they will meet with, from men of differing humours and engagements, and the occaſion they may give of diſcourſe beyond my deſign."</p>
               <p>"But, next to the power of neceſſity (which is a ſollicitor, that will take no denial) this induced me to a compliance, that we have, (with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:032729_0199_0FF4F0BA6107A0A0"/>
to <hi>God,</hi> and good conſcience to <hi>men</hi>) to the beſt of our ſkill, contrived and compoſed the <hi>frame</hi> and <hi>laws</hi> of this government,<note place="margin">Reaſon for publiſhing his frame and laws.</note> to the great end of government, <hi>viz. To ſupport power in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the people, and to ſecure the people from the abuſe of power;</hi> that they may be free by their juſt obedience, and the Magiſtrates honourable, for their juſt adminiſtration; for liberty without obedience is confuſion; and obedience without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is ſlavery. To carry this evenneſs, is partly owing to the conſtitution, and partly to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy: where either of theſe fail, government will be ſubject to convulſions; but where both are wanting, it muſt be totally ſubverted: then, where both meet, the government is like to endure; which I humbly pray, and hope, <hi>God</hi> will pleaſe to make the lot of this of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> Amen."</p>
               <p>The <hi>frame</hi> itſelf conſiſted of twenty-four arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; and the laws were forty.<note place="margin">Purport of the frame of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> By the former the government was placed in the Governor and Freemen of the province, in the form of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial council, and General Aſſembly. By them conjunctively all laws were to be made, all officers appointed, and all public affairs tranſacted. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty-two was the number of the Council, to be choſen by the freemen; and though the Governor, or his deputy, was to be perpetual Preſident, he had but a treble vote. One-third part of them was, at firſt, to be choſen for three years, one-third for two years, and one-third for one year; in ſuch manner, that there might be an annual ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of twenty-four new members, each to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue three years, and no longer.—The General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly was, the firſt year, to conſiſt of all the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, afterwards of two hundred, and never to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed five hundred. And this charter, or form of government, was not to be altered, changed, or diminiſhed, in any part, or clauſe of it, without the conſent of the Governor, his heirs, or aſſigns,
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:032729_0200_0FF4F04F7651E628"/>
and ſix parts of ſeven of the freemen, in Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Council and Aſſembly. And to the ſame power only was the alteration of the laws made ſubject: theſe laws were of the nature of an ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal compact between the proprietary and the freemen; and, as ſuch, were reciprocally received and executed: one of them was,</p>

                        <hi>"Brethren,</hi>

                     <p>"We called at our old friend <hi>James Logan's,</hi> in our way to this city, and, to our grief, we found him <hi>hid in the buſhes,</hi> and retired through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, from public buſineſs. We preſſed him to leave his retirement, and prevailed with him to aſſiſt once more, on our account, at your councils. We hope, notwithſtanding his age, and the effects of a fit of ſickneſs, which we underſtand has hurt his conſtitution, that he may yet continue a long time, to aſſiſt this province with his counſels. He is a wiſe man, and a faſt friend to the <hi>Indians.</hi> And we deſire, when his ſoul goes to <hi>God,</hi> you may chuſe in his room, juſt ſuch another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of the ſame prudence and ability, in counſelling; and of the ſame tender diſpoſition and affection for the <hi>Indians."</hi>—"In teſtimony of our gratitude for all his ſervices, and becauſe he was ſo good, as to leave his country houſe, and follow us to town, and be at the trouble, in this his advanced age, to attend the council, <hi>We preſent him with this bundle of Skins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the Governor had concluded, <hi>James Logan</hi> replied to that part of <hi>Canaſſatego's</hi> ſpeech which related to him, and ſaid—</p>
                     <p>"That, not only upon the account of his lameneſs, (of which the <hi>Indians</hi> themſelves were witneſſes) but on account of another indiſpoſition, which, about three years ſince, had laid him under an incapacity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing himſelf with his former uſual freedom, he had been obliged to live retired, in the country."</p>
                     <p>"But that our firſt proprietor, the honorable <hi>William Penn,</hi> who had ever been a father, and true friend to all the <hi>Indians,</hi> having above forty years ſince recommended them to his particular care, he had always, from his own inclination, as well as from that ſtrict charge, endeavoured to convince all the <hi>Indians,</hi> that he was their true friend; and was now well pleaſed, that after a tract of ſo many years, they were not inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it. He thanked them kindly for their preſent and heartily joined with them in their deſires, that the government may always be furniſhed with perſons of equally good inclinations, and not only with ſuch, but alſo with better abilities, to ſerve them.</p>
                     <p>At a council, held with the <hi>Seneca</hi> and other <hi>Indians,</hi> in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> to July 1749, in the adminiſtation of <hi>James Hamilton,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>At a treaty held at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> with the <hi>Indians,</hi> in 1756, in Governor <hi>Morris's</hi> adminiſtration, <hi>Tcedyuſcung,</hi> the <hi>Delaware</hi> chief, ſpoke as follows:</p>

                        <hi>Rowland Ellis</hi> was a man of note among the <hi>Welſh</hi> ſettlers; from a place called <hi>Brin-Maur,</hi> near Dolgelly in the county of <hi>Merconeth.</hi> In 1682, he ſent over <hi>Thomas Owen</hi> and his family to make a ſettlement. This was the cuſtom of divers others of the <hi>Welſh,</hi> at firſt, to ſend perſons over to take up land for them, and to prepare it, againſt their coming afterwards.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Rowland Ellis,</hi> chuſing to ſee the country, before he removed his family, ſailed in a Briſtol ſhip from <hi>Milford Haven,</hi> for <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> on the ſixteenth of the eighth month, 1686; taking along with him his eldeſt ſon, <hi>Rowland,</hi> then a boy, and they had a very long and tedious paſſage, in which they touched at <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> not arriving at the province, till about twenty-four weeks after their firſt ſailing. The Welſh paſſengers were about one hundred, all from the ſame place with him. Many of them died through want of neceſſary proviſions; and others afterwards, from the remaining effects of their ſufferings; and ſome that ſurvived, never recovered their former ſtrength; though at <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> where they ſtayed about ſix weeks, and were kindly and friendly treated, many were much recruited from their languiſhing condition, and the death of divers others prevented, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>After having been about nine months in the province, and making the neceſſary preparations for the reception of his family, which he intended to bring over, he returned in the next ſpring, to his native land, leaving his young ſon with his uncle <hi>John Humphrey.</hi> But he did not return to <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> till the year 1697; when he ſailed in a <hi>Liverpool</hi> veſſel, with many other families, conſiſting of about one hundred paſſengers, all from <hi>North Wales;</hi> and in about ſix weeks they arrived at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> in the fourth month.</p>

                     <p>He had ſuffered much for his religion, in his native country, prior to his removal to <hi>America.</hi> He is ſaid to have been of a tender and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate diſpoſition of mind, and a very valuable and worthy perſon.

                     <p>—On his return from a religious viſit to his native country, in the ſervice of preaching the goſpel, in the year 1698, a number of the Inhabitants of <hi>North Wales</hi> removed to <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> in company with him; where he arrived on the 7th. of the Fifth month, many of the paſſengers having died at ſea of the <hi>Bloody Flux,</hi> during the paſſage.</p>
                     <p>In the latter end of this year, (1698) William Jones, Thomas Evans, Robert Evans, Owen Evans, Cadwallader Evans, Hugh Griffith, John Hugh, Edward Foulke, John Humphrey, Robert Jones, and others, having purchaſed of Robert Turner, ten thouſand acres of land, began in the following year, to improve and ſettle the ſame, and called the townſhip <hi>Guinedd,</hi> in Engliſh <hi>North Wales.</hi> Some of the laſt mentioned paſſengers ſettled here; who, in general did not, at firſt, profeſs with the <hi>Quakers;</hi> but afterwards they, with many others, as the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood increaſed, joined in religious ſociety with them, and were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and worthy people—</p>

                     <p>Among other particular accounts, of this kind, I find the following; which may give a further idea of thoſe early times in the province, &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>John Scarborough,</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> coach-ſmith, arrived in the country, in 1682, with his ſon <hi>John,</hi> then a youth, and ſettled in <hi>Middletown,</hi> in <hi>Bucks</hi> county, among the firſt, in thoſe parts; where he remained about two years; and then embarked for his native country, with intention to bring over his wife and family;—having ſuffered much, by perſecution, for his religion, in <hi>England,</hi> being a <hi>Quaker.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>During his reſidence in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> proviſions being ſometimes ſcarce, in that part, where he reſided, eſpecially in the firſt year, he is ſaid to have had occaſion to remark the providence of God to him, and thoſe near him, when they were under greater difficulty, on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, than at other times.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>wild pidgeons</hi> came in ſuch great numbers, that the air was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times darkened by their flight; and, flying low, they were frequently knocked down, as they flew; in great quantities, by thoſe who had no other means to take them: whereby they ſupplied themſelves; and having ſalted thoſe, which they could not immediately uſe, they preſerved them, both for bread and meat.</p>
                     <p>Thus they were ſupplied ſeveral times, during the firſt two or three years, till they had raiſed, by their induſtry, food ſufficient out of the ground:—for the tilling of which, at that time, they uſed <hi>Hoes,</hi> having neither horſes nor plows.—The <hi>Indians</hi> were remarkably kind, and very aſſiſtant to them, in divers reſpects, frequently ſupplying them with ſuch proviſions, as they could ſpare, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>John Scarborough,</hi> having placed his ſon under the care of a friend, ſailed for <hi>England;</hi> but he never returned.—His wife, who was not a <hi>Quaker,</hi> being unwilling to leave her native country, and perſecution beginning to ceaſe, he afterwards gave his poſſeſſions, in <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> to his ſon, whom he had left in the province; with a ſtrict charge, when it ſhould be in his power, to be kind to the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> for the favours he had received from them: which his ſon faithfully obſerved, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with; and is ſaid to have been a worthy man, and of good cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.

                        <hi>John Chapman</hi> came from <hi>England</hi> in 1684. The ſhip, in which he came, by reaſon of bad weather, put into <hi>Maryland;</hi> where he met with <hi>Phineas Pemberton,</hi> whoſe father-in-law, <hi>James Harriſon,</hi> had purchaſed, in <hi>Bucks</hi> county, <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> five thouſand acres of land; part of it in <hi>Wright's</hi> town;—hence <hi>Chapman</hi> getting intelligence of that part of the country, afterwards ſettled there.

                        <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Joſeph Chapman,</hi> the twins before mentioned, when boys, about nine or ten years old, going out one evening, to ſeek their cattle, met an <hi>Indian,</hi> in the woods; who told them to go back; elſe they would be loſt.

                  <p>Whereas King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, in the year 1681, was pleaſed to grant this province to <hi>William Penn,</hi> and his heirs, for ever; which act ſeemed to be an act of <hi>Providence</hi> to many reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, good, people; and the Proprietor, <hi>William Penn,</hi> being one of the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and in good eſteem, among them and others, many were inclined to embark along with him, for the ſettlement of this place.</p>
                  <p>To that end, in the year 1682 ſeveral ſhips being provided, I found a concern on my mind to embark with them, with my wife and child; and about the latter end of the Sixth-month, having ſettled my affairs in <hi>London,</hi> where I dwelt, I went, on board the ſhip <hi>Welcome, Robert Greenaway,</hi> commander, in company with my worthy friend, <hi>William Penn;</hi> whoſe good converſation was very advantageous to all the company. His ſingular care was manifeſted, in contributing to the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of many, who were ſick of the <hi>Small-pox,</hi> then on board; out of which company about thirty died.—After a proſperous paſſage of about two months, having had, in that time, many good meetings, on board, we arrived here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="229" facs="unknown:032729_0229_0FF4F16EFA0E1F20"/>At our arrival, we found it a wilderneſs; the chief inhabitants were <hi>Indians,</hi> and ſome <hi>Swedes;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Richard Townſends account, &amp;c.</note> who received us in a friendly manner: and though there was a great number of us, the good hand of <hi>Providence</hi> was ſeen in a particular manner; in that proviſions were found for us, by the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> at very reaſonable rates, as well as brought from divers other parts, that were inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited before.</p>
                  <p>Our firſt concern was to keep up and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our <hi>religious worſhip;</hi> and, in order thereunto, we had ſeveral <hi>meetings,</hi> in the houſes of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; and one boarded meeting-houſe was ſet up, where the city was to be, near <hi>Delaware;</hi> and, as we had nothing but love and good-will, in our hearts, one to another, we had very comfortable meetings, from time to time; and after our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was over, we aſſiſted each other, in building little houſes, for our ſhelter.</p>
                  <p>After ſome time I ſet up a <hi>mill,</hi> on <hi>Cheſter</hi> creek; which I brought ready framed from <hi>London;</hi> which ſerved for grinding of corn, and ſawing of boards; and was of great uſe to us. Beſides, I with <hi>Joſhua Tittery,</hi> made a net, and caught great quantities of fiſh; which ſupplied ourſelves and many others; ſo that, notwithſtanding it was thought near three thouſand perſons came in the firſt year, we were ſo providentially provided for, that we could buy a deer for about two ſhillings, and a large turkey, for about one ſhilling, and <hi>Indian</hi> corn for about two ſhillings and ſix pence per buſhel.</p>
                  <p>And, as our worthy Proprietor treated the <hi>Indians</hi> with extraordinary humanity, they became very civil and loving to us, and brought in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of veniſon. As, in other countries, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> were exaſperated by hard treatment, which hath been the foundation of much bloodſhed, ſo the contrary treatment here hath produced their love and affection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="230" facs="unknown:032729_0230_0FF4F10438FF2BD8"/>About a year after our arrival, there came in about twenty families from high and low <hi>Germany,</hi> of religious,<note place="margin">Richard Townſends account, &amp;c.</note> good people; who ſettled about ſix miles from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and called the place <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantown.</hi>—The country continually increaſing, people began to ſpread themſelves further back.— "Alſo a place called <hi>North Wales,</hi> was ſettled by many of the <hi>ancient Britons,</hi> an honeſt inclined people, although they had not then made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the truth, as held by us, yet, in a little time, a large convincement was among them; and divers meeting-houſes were built.</p>
                  <p>About the time, in which <hi>Germantown</hi> was laid out, I ſettled upon my tract of land, which I had purchaſed of the Proprietor, in <hi>England,</hi> about a mile from thence; where I ſet up a houſe and a corn mill;—which was very uſeful to the country, for ſeveral miles round:—But there not being plenty of horſes, people generally brought their corn on their backs many miles;—I remember one man had a bull ſo gentle, that he uſed to bring his corn on him, inſtead of a horſe.</p>
                  <p>Being now ſettled about ſix or ſeven miles from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> where leaving the principal body of friends, together with the chief place of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, as before mentioned, fleſh meat was very ſcarce with me, for ſome time; of which I found the want. I remember I was once ſupplied by a particular inſtance of Providence, in the following manner:—</p>
                  <p>As I was in my meadow, mowing graſs, a young deer came and looked on me; I continued mowing, and the deer in the ſame attention to me; upon which I laid down my ſcythe, and went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; upon which he ran off a ſmall diſtance; I went to my work again, and the Deer continued looking on me; ſo that ſeveral times I left my work, to go towards him; but he ſtill kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at a diſtance; at laſt, as I was going towards

him, and he, looking on me, did not mind his ſteps, but ran forceably againſt the trunk of a tree, and ſtunned himſelf ſo much, that he fell;<note place="margin">Richard Townſends account, &amp;c.</note> upon which I ran forward, and, getting upon him, held by the legs:—After a great ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, in which I had almoſt tired him out, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him lifeleſs, I threw him on my ſhoulders, holding him faſt by the legs, and, with ſome difficulty, from his freſh ſtruggling, carried him home, about a quarter of a mile, to my houſe; where, by the aſſiſtance of a neighbour, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be there, and killed him for me; he proved very ſerviceable to my family. I could relate ſeveral other acts of Providence, of this kind, but omit them for brevity.</p>
                  <p>As people began to ſpread, and improve their lands, the country became more fruitful; ſo that thoſe, who came after us, were plentifully ſupplied; and with what we abounded we began a ſmall trade abroad. And as <hi>Philadelphia</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, veſſels were built, and many employed. Both country and trade have been wonderfully increaſing to this day; ſo that, from a <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> the Lord, by his good hand of providence, hath made it a fruitful field:—On which to look back, and obſerve all the ſteps, would exceed my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe; yet, being now in the eighty-fourth year of my age, and having been in this country near forty-ſix years, and my memory pretty clear, concerning the riſe and progreſs of the province, I can do no leſs than return praiſes to the <hi>Almighty,</hi> when I look back and conſider his bountiful hand, not only in temporals, but in the great increaſe of our meetings; wherein he hath many times manifeſted his great loving kindneſs, in reaching to, and convincing many perſons of the principles of truth; and thoſe, that were already convinced and continued faithful, were not only bleſſed with plenty of the fruits of the earth, but alſo with the

He had the Proprietor's confidence and eſteem, till his death, in the year—.</p>

                           <hi>Chriſtopher Taylor</hi> is ſaid to have been a perſon of excellent character and ability, he was born in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> had a good education, wrote well in the Latin language.—He was an eminent preacher among the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and writ ſeveral pieces in defence of their religious principles, in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as well as his brother, Thomas Taylor, &amp;c. He was one of the firſt and principal ſettlers in the province, under William Penn; and is ſaid to have been of great ſervice in it, in different reſpects. He died in 1696.</p>

He had a good education, was one of the Proprietor's firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of property, and one of his moſt truſty friends, in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Sometimes he was Speaker of the Aſſembly; and is ſaid to have been a very worthy and ſerviceable perſon, in the province, till his death, both in a religious and civil capacity. He lived in <hi>Cheſter</hi> county; and died on the 27th. of January, 1702.</p>
                        <p>

weſt from <hi>London,</hi> on the weſt ſide of the river <hi>Delaware;</hi> which river, at this place, is near one mile broad, at the diſtance of about forty leagues from the ſea, along the courſe of the river and bay. The river <hi>Sculkil,</hi> which is a branch of the <hi>Delaware,</hi> and here runs nearly parallel to it, at the diſtance of two miles weſtward, is broad and deep enough for large ſhips, at this place; but, by reaſon of a <hi>ſand-bar,</hi> at its mouth, where it enters the <hi>Delaware,</hi> about four miles below the city, its navigation, for large veſſels, is obſtructed: And it has <hi>falls</hi> about five miles above the city, to which the tide runs, and no further. Over which <hi>falls,</hi> or rocks, at certain times, in floods and freſhes, boats and ſmall craft paſs down to the city, with country produce, as, iron, wheat, floor, &amp;c. from the interior parts of the province. The tide riſes, in the <hi>Delaware,</hi> generally about ſix feet, at the city, and flows near thirty miles above it, to the falls at <hi>Trenton,</hi> on the <hi>Jerſey</hi> ſhore, and is navigable all the way for large ſhipping, as far as that place. But the extent of this river, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all its curves and windings, above theſe <hi>falls,</hi> (much of which may eaſily be made navigable) is not yet preciſely known.</p>
               <p>The original plan of this city, as confirmed by charter, dated October 25th. 1701, extends, in length, between the river <hi>Delaware,</hi> on the eaſt,<note place="margin">Deſcription of the plan and ſtreets of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, &amp;c.</note> and <hi>Sculkil,</hi> on the weſt of it, about two miles; and is, in breadth, one mile nearly, on each river. The ſtreets, which run right, and exactly parallel to each other, nearly eaſt and weſt, from river to river, are nine in number, and they are interſected, at right angles, by twenty-three others, running nearly parallel with the rivers, north and ſouth; none being leſs than fifty, nor more than one hundred feet broad.</p>
               <p>The Proprietor likewiſe aſſigned five ſquares, within this plan, for the public uſe of the city,

with other beneficial regulations; whoſe future great importance to the city, having ſince not been ſufficiently conſidered and attended to, ſome of them have either been neglected, or violated.</p>
               <p>The largeſt public ſquare, at the center, it is ſaid, was intended to contain ten acres of land; the other four, eight acres each.

                  <p>But, if I have been unkindly uſed, by ſome I left behind me, I found love and reſpect enough, where I came; an univerſal kind welcome, every ſort in their way.

                  <p>For the <hi>province,</hi> the general condition of it, take as followeth:—</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The country itſelf, its ſoil, air, water, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and produce, both natural and artificial,<note place="margin">Of the country, ſoil and produce, &amp;c.</note> is not to be deſpiſed. The land containeth divers ſorts of earth, as, ſand, yellow and black, poor and rich: alſo gravel, both loamy and duſty; and, in ſome places, a faſt fat earth; like our beſt vales, in <hi>England;</hi> eſpecially by inland brooks and rivers. God, in his wiſdom, having ordered it ſo, that the advantages of the country are divided; the back lands being generally three to one richer, than thoſe that lie by navigable rivers. We have much of another ſoil; and that is a black <hi>hazel-mould,</hi> upon a ſtony, or rocky, bottom.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The air is ſweet and clear, the Heavens ſerene, like the ſouth parts of <hi>France,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of the air.</note> rarely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt; and, as the woods come, by numbers of people, to be more cleared, that itſelf will refine.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The waters are generally good;<note place="margin">Waters.</note> for the rivers and brooks have moſtly gravel and ſtony bottoms; and in number, hardly credible. We have alſo mineral waters, that operate in the ſame manner with <hi>Barnet</hi> and <hi>North Hall,</hi> not two miles from <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>

For the ſeaſons of the year, having, by God's goodneſs, now lived over the coldeſt and hotteſt, that the oldeſt liver in the province can remember, I can ſay ſomething to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Fall.</note>Firſt, Of the <hi>fall;</hi> for then I came in: I found it, from the 24th. of October, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of December, as we have it uſually, in <hi>England,</hi> in September, or rather like an <hi>Engliſh</hi> mild ſpring.<note place="margin">Winter.</note> From December to the beginning of the month called March, we had ſharp froſty weather; not foul, thick, black weather, as our north eaſt winds bring with them, in <hi>England;</hi> but a ſky as clear as in ſummer, and the air dry, cold, piercing and hungry; yet I remember not that I wore more cloaths, than in <hi>England.</hi> The reaſon of this cold is given, from the great lakes, that are fed by the fountains of <hi>Canada.</hi> The Winter before was as mild, ſcarce any ice at all; while this, for a few days, froze up our great river <hi>Delaware.</hi> From that month, to the month cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led June,<note place="margin">Spring.</note> we enjoyed a ſweet Spring; no guſts, but gentle ſhowers, and a fine ſky. Yet, this I obſerve, that the winds here, as there, are more inconſtant, Spring and Fall, upon that turn of nature, than in Summer, or Winter. From thence to this preſent month,<note place="margin">Of the Summer.</note> (Auguſt) which endeth the Summer, (commonly ſpeaking) we have had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary heats, yet mitigated ſometimes by cool breezes. The wind, that ruleth the Summer ſeaſon, is the ſouth weſt; but ſpring, fall and winter, it is rare to want the north-weſtern ſeven days together. And whatever miſts, fogs, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, foul the Heavens by eaſterly, or ſoutherly winds, in two hours time, are blown away; the one is followed by the other: A remedy, that ſeems to have a peculiar providence in it, to the inhabitants; the multitude of trees, yet ſtanding, being liable to retain miſts and vapours; and yet not one quarter ſo thick as I expected.</p>

                     <pb n="249" facs="unknown:032729_0249_0FF4F190B4AD7940"/>V. The natural produce of the country, of vegetables, is trees, fruits, plants, flowers. The trees of moſt note, are the black walnut, cedar,<note place="margin">Natural produce, &amp;c.</note> cypreſs, cheſnut, poplar, gum-wood, hickory, ſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafras, aſh, beech, and oak of divers ſorts, as,<note place="margin">Trees.</note> red, white and black; Spaniſh, cheſnut, and ſwamp, the moſt durable of all. Of all which there is plenty, for the uſe of man.</p>
                  <p>The fruits, that I find in the woods, are the white and black mulberry, cheſnut, walnut, plums,<note place="margin">Fruits.</note> ſtrawberries, cranberries, hurtleberries, and grapes of divers ſorts. The great red grape (now ripe) called by ignorance, the <hi>fox grape,</hi> becauſe of the reliſh it hath with unſkilful palates,<note place="margin">Grapes.</note> is in itſelf an extraordinary grape; and by art, doubtleſs, may be cultivated to an excellent wine, if not ſo ſweet, yet little inferior to the <hi>Frontiniac,</hi> as it is not much unlike in taſte, ruddineſs ſet aſide; which, in ſuch things, as well as mankind, differs the caſe much. There is a white kind of <hi>Muſkadel,</hi> and a little black grape, like the cluſter grape of <hi>England,</hi> not yet ſo ripe as the other; but they tell me, when ripe, ſweeter, and that they only want ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Vinerons,</hi> to make good uſe of them. I intend to venture on it with my <hi>Frenchman,</hi> this ſeaſon, who ſhews ſome knowledge in thoſe things. Here are alſo peaches very good, and in great quantities;<note place="margin">Peaches.</note> not an Indian plantation without them; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naturally here at firſt, I know not. However one may have them, by buſhels, for little: they make a pleaſant drink; and I think, not inferior to any peach you have in <hi>England,</hi> except the true <hi>Newington.</hi> It is diſputable with me, whether it be beſt to fall to fining the fruits of the country, eſpecially the grape, by the care and ſkill of art, or ſend for foreign ſtems and ſets, already good and approved. It ſeems moſt reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that not only a thing groweth beſt, where it naturally grows, but will hardly be equalled by
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:032729_0250_0FF4F12A6A957958"/>
another ſpecies of the ſame kind, that doth not naturally grow there But, to ſolve the doubt, I intend, if God give me life, to try both, and hope the conſequence will be, as good wine, as any <hi>European</hi> countries, of the ſame latitude, do yield.</p>

The girls ſtay with their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and help to hoe the ground, plant corn, and carry burdens; and they do well to uſe them to that young, which they muſt do when they are old; for the wives are the true ſervants of the huſbands; otherwiſe the men are very affectionate to them.</p>

Some kings have ſold, others preſented me with ſeveral parcels of land: the pay, or preſents I made them, were not hoarded by the particular owners; but the neighbouring kings, and their clans being preſent, when the goods were brought out, the parties, chiefly concerned, conſulted what, and to whom, they ſhould give them. To every king then, by the hands of a perſon for that work ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, is a proportion ſent, ſo ſorted and folded, and with that gravity, that is admirable. Then that king ſubdivideth it, in like manner, among his dependants, they hardly leaving themſelves an equal ſhare with one of their ſubjects: and be it on ſuch occaſions as feſtivals, or at their common meals, the kings diſtribute, and to themſelves laſt. They care for little; becauſe they want but little; and the reaſon is, a little contents them. In this they are ſufficiently revenged on us: if they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of our pleaſures,<note place="margin">Their free manner of life, cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, &amp;c.</note> they are alſo free from our pains.

It is admirable to conſider how powerful the Kings are, and yet how they move by the breath of their people. I have had occaſion to be in council with them, upon treaties for land, and to adjuſt the terms of trade. Their order is thus: The King ſits in the middle of an half moon, and hath his council, the old and wiſe, on each hand; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, or at a little diſtance, ſit the younger fry, in the ſame figure.

there might be ſome fault in the Interpreter, being neither <hi>Indian</hi> nor <hi>Engliſh:</hi> beſides, it was the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> cuſtom, to deliberate, and take up much time, in council, before they reſolve; and that, if the young people, and owners of the land had been as ready as he, I had not met with ſo much delay."—Having thus introduced his matter, he fell to the bounds of the land, they had agreed to diſpoſe of, and the price; which now is little and dear; that which would have bought twenty miles, not buying now two. During the time, that this perſon ſpoke, not a man of them was obſerved to whiſper or ſmile; the old, grave; the young, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent, in their deportment.

                     <p>And, laſtly, upon when notice was given of this uſage, I complained to him, he promiſed, upon his word and honor, it ſhould go not far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that it was for his own ſatisfaction he did it; I told him that mitigated the thing a little; but if he ſhould divulge it before I ſaw and agreed to the copy, he muſt pardon me, if I looked upon it as a moſt unfair practice.—What that Lord has done, and what to call it, I leave to my betters; but the ſurprize and indigeſtion of the whole will, I hope excuſe me of neglect, or diſreſpect: for though I am unceremonious, I would, by no means, act the rude, or undutiful.</p>
                     <p>This ſaid, I humbly beg that I may give a brief narrative of the matter, as it then paſſed, ſince has been, and now ſtands, without the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and tautology his relation makes me guilty of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Time of W. Penn's arrival, &amp;c.</note>So ſoon as I arrived, which was on the 24th. of October laſt, I immediately diſpatched two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the Lord <hi>Baltimore,</hi> to aſk of his health, offer kind neighbourhood, and agree a time of meeting the better to eſtabliſh it: While they were gone of this errand, I went to <hi>New-York,</hi> that I might pay my duty to the Duke, in the viſit of his government and colony. At my return, which was towards the end of November, I found the meſſengers, whom I had ſent to <hi>Maryland,</hi> newly arrived, and the time fixed, being the 19th. of December. I prepared myſelf in a few days for that province. The 11th. of the month I came to weſt river; where I met the Proprietor, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſuitable to his character; who took the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by his civilities, to ſhew me the greatneſs of his power: The next day we had conference about our buſineſs of the bounds, both at the ſame table, with our reſpective members of council.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="269" facs="unknown:032729_0269_0FF4F20B6CBB9190"/>The firſt thing I did was to preſent the King's letter; which conſiſted of two parts:—One, that the Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> had but two degrees; and the other,<note place="margin">W. Penn's letter to the Lords of plantations, &amp;c.</note> that, beginning at <hi>Watkins's</hi> point, he ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſure his ſaid degrees, at 60 miles to a degree. This being read by him, firſt privately, then publicly, he told me, the King was greatly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and that he would not leave his patent, to follow the King's letter, nor could a letter void his patent; and by that he would ſtand.</p>
                     <p>This was the ſubſtance of what he ſaid from firſt to laſt, during the whole conference. To this I anſwered, the King might be miſinformed rather than miſtaken, and that I was afraid the miſtake would fall on his ſide; for though his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent begins at <hi>Watkins's</hi> point and goes to the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth degree of north latitude, yet it preſumed that to lye in the 38th. elſe <hi>Virginia</hi> would be wronged, which ſhould extend to that degree; however this I aſſured him, that when I petitioned the King for five degrees north latitude and that petition was referred to the Lords of the committee of planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; at that time, it was urged by ſome preſent, that the Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> had but two degrees; upon which the Lord Preſident, turning his head to me, at whoſe chair I ſtood, ſaid, Mr. <hi>Penn, will not three degrees ſerve your turn?</hi> I anſwered, <hi>"I ſubmit both the what, and how, to the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able board."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this his uncle, and chancellor, returned, that to convince me his father's grant was not by degrees, he had more of <hi>Virginia</hi> given him, but being planted, and the grant intending only land not planted, or poſſeſſed, but of ſavage na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, he left it out, that it might not forfeit the reſt: Of which the Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> takes no notice, in his narrative, that I remember.—But, by that anſwer, he can pretend nothing to <hi>Delaware;</hi> which was at, and before, the paſſing of that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:032729_0270_0FF4F1B1CA618FF0"/>
bought and planted by the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and ſo could not be given:—But, if it were, it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited,<note place="margin">W. Penn's letter to the Lords of plantations, &amp;c.</note> for not reducing it, during twenty years, under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſovereignty; of which he held it; but was at laſt reduced by the King, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his, to give as he pleaſeth.</p>
                     <p>Perceiving that my preſſing the King's letter was uneaſy, and that I had determined myſelf to diſpoſe him with utmoſt ſoftneſs to a good compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, I waved that of the two degrees, and preſſed the admeaſurement only, the next part of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:—For though it were two degrees, and a half from <hi>Watkins's</hi> point to forty degrees, yet let it be meaſured at ſixty miles to a degree, and I would begin at forty degrees, fall as it would:—My de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was, that every degree being ſeventy miles, I ſhould get all that was over ſixty, the proportion intended the Lord <hi>Baltimore,</hi> by the grant, and computation of a degree, at that time of the day:—Thus he had enjoyed the full favour intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and I had gained a door of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the peopling and improving of his majeſty's province.</p>
                     <p>But he this alſo rejected;—I told him, it was not the love, or need, of the land, but the water; that he abounded in what I wanted, and acceſs and harbouring, even, to exceſs; that I would not be thus importunate, but for the importance of the thing, to ſave a province; and becauſe there was no proportion in the concern; if I were an hundred times more urgent and tenacious, the caſe would excuſe it; becauſe the thing inſiſted on was more than ninety-nine times more valuable to me than to him; to me the head, to him, the tail.—I added, that, if it were his, and he gave it me, planting it would recompence the favours, not only by laying his country between two thriving provinces, but the ſhips, that come yearly to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryland</hi> for <hi>tobacco,</hi> would have the bringing of
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:032729_0271_0FF4F20D0770CCE8"/>
both our people and merchandize; becauſe they can afford it cheaper; whereby <hi>Maryland</hi> would, for one age or two be the mart of trade.<note place="margin">W. Penns's letter to the Lords of plantations, &amp;c.</note> But this alſo had no other entertainment, but hopes that I would not inſiſt on theſe things at our next meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; after three days time we parted; and I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this province.</p>
                     <p>When the ſpring came I ſent an expreſs to pray the time and place, when and where I ſhould meet him, to effect the buſineſs, we adjourned to, at that time. I followed cloſe upon the meſſenger, that no time might be loſt. But the expectation, he twice had, of the Lord <hi>Culpepper's</hi> viſit, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed any meeting on our affairs, till the month called May; he then ſent three gentlemen to let me know, he would meet me at the head of the bay of <hi>Cheſapeak;</hi> I was then in treaty with the kings of the natives for land; but three days after we met ten miles from <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> which is thirty from the bay. I invited him to the town, where having entertained him, as well as the town could afford, on ſo little notice, and finding him only deſirous of ſpeaking with me privately, I preſſed that we might, at our diſtinct lodgings, ſit ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally with our councils, and treat by way of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten memorials; which would prevent the miſtakes, or abuſes, that may follow from ill deſigns, or ill memory; but he avoided it, ſaying, "He was not well, and the weather ſultry, and would return with what ſpeed he could, reſerving any other treaty to another ſeaſon."—Thus we parted, at that time. I had been before told by divers, that the ſaid <hi>Baltimore</hi> had iſſued forth a proclamation,<note n="*" place="margin">See the note in page 265, &amp;c.</note> to invite people, by lower prices, and greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of land, to plant in the lower counties; in which the Duke's goodneſs had intereſted me, as an inſeparable benefit to this whole province. I was not willing to believe it; and the being in haſte, I omitted to aſk him: But I had not been
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:032729_0272_0FF4F1B359EC1BC0"/>
long returned before two letters came from two judges of two of the country courts, that ſuch a proclamation was abroad,<note place="margin">W. Penn's letter to the Lords of plantations, &amp;c.</note> that the people too hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to it, but yet prayed my directions. I bade them keep their ground, and not fear, for the King would be judge. Upon this I diſpatched to the Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> three of my council, with the clerk of it: As they went they got an authentic copy, under the hand of one of his ſheriffs, to whom an original had been directed: But, as the laſt civility, I would yield him, I forbad them to ſeem to believe any thing, but what they had from his own mouth.—Thus they delivered my letter.</p>
                     <p>At firſt, he denied any ſuch proclamation, turning to two gentlemen of his council, who ſtood by, he aſked them, if they remembered any ſuch thing? They alſo denied it. Upon which the perſons, I ſent, produced the atteſted copy; which, refreſhing their memories, they confeſſed there was ſuch a proclamation.</p>
                     <p>But the Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> told them, that it was his ancient form, and he only did it to renew his claim, not that he would encourage any to plant there. They then prayed him to call it in, leſt any trouble ſhould enſue: but he refuſed it.—This was during a civil treaty, without any demand made, and after the place had been many years in the quiet poſſeſſion of the Duke.—What to call this I ſtill humbly refer to my ſuperiors. For his pretenſions to thoſe parts I have thoroughly inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my agent; who, I hope, will be able to detect them of weakneſs and inconſiſtency. This is a true, though brief, narrative of the entertainment, I have had from that Lord, in the buſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe I have, as in duty joined, ſent an agent extraordinary, to wait upon the King, and his miniſters, in the affairs of this province (ſo ſoon as I could make any ſettlement in it) I ſhall only
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:032729_0273_0FF4F20E98B26340"/>
humbly pray leave to hint at two or three things, relating to the buſineſs depending between this lord and myſelf,<note place="margin">W. Penn's letter to the Lords of plantations, &amp;c.</note> about finding the fortieth degree of north latitude.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. That I have common fame on my ſide, grounded upon ancient and conſtant judges, that the fortieth degree of north latitude lyeth about <hi>Boles's-iſle.</hi> This the Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> himſelf, hath not denied; and the country confeſſeth; and I ſhall, when required, prove by ſome able maſters of ſhips.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. If this were an error, it is grounded upon ſuch ſkill and inſtruments, as gave meaſure to the time, in which his patent was granted:—and if he hath got upon <hi>Virginia</hi> by that error, he ſhould not get upon me by an exacter knowledge, conſidering that <hi>Carolina,</hi> which endeth by degrees, would as much advance upon <hi>Virginia,</hi> if the reputed latitude of unprejudiced times ſhould take no place;—for by advancing her bounds twenty miles, by a new inſtrument, beyond the place; which hath been generally taken for thirty-ſix and an half degrees; and <hi>Virginia</hi> not being equally able to advance upon <hi>Maryland,</hi> becauſe of its being at a place certain, ſhe will be greatly narrowed between both.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. I, therefore, moſt humbly pray, that the judgment of ancient times, by which perſons at the diſtance of <hi>England</hi> from <hi>America,</hi> have governed themſelves, may conclude that the lord's bounds, or, that he may meaſure his two degrees according to the ſcale and computations of thoſe times, which was ſixty miles to a degree; or, if it be allowed, that he had not his grant by degrees, that, at laſt, I might not loſe the benefit of admeaſurement, as before mentioned, from <hi>Watkins's-point,</hi> in whatever degree of latitude that ſhall be found, to the fortieth degree of north latitude, which I humbly take the more courage to preſs, becauſe a province lyeth at ſtake, in the ſucceſs of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="274" facs="unknown:032729_0274_0FF4F1C03B23ADD0"/>I have only humbly to add, that the province hath a proſpect of an extraordinary improvement, as well by divers ſorts of ſtrangers,<note place="margin">W. Penn's letter to the Lords of plantations, &amp;c.</note> as <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; that, in all acts of juſtice, we name and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate the King's authority; that I have followed the Biſhop of <hi>London's</hi> counſel, by buying, and not taking away the natives' land; with whom I have ſettled a very kind correſpondence. I return my moſt humble thanks for your former favors, in the paſſing of my patent, and pray God reward you. I am moſt ready to obey all your commands, according to the obligations of them, and beſeech you to take this province into your protection, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Majeſty, and him, whom his goodneſs hath made Governor of it, into your favours, for that I am, with moſt ſincere devotion,</p>

                     <p>The Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> doth commiſſionate Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Talbot</hi> to go to the weſt ſide of the <hi>Skulkil</hi> to demand of <hi>William Penn,</hi> Eſquire, or his deputy, all that part of land on the weſt ſide of that river, that lyeth to the ſouth of the fortieth degree of northerly latitude.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. I anſwer, it ſeems very ſlight, abrupt and unprecedented for any perſon, that is in the quality of a Proprietary of a country, to ſend to another in the ſame circumſtance, any extraordinary meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, agent, or commiſſioner, without ſome let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or memorial, to ſtate the <hi>demand,</hi> with the reaſons of it; the practice of the greateſt princes, and might therefore (I conceive) be the condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of leſſer ſeigniories.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. In the next place, <hi>William Penn,</hi> Eſquire, and the ſaid <hi>Penn,</hi> (the language of the commiſſion) is not my <hi>American</hi> ſtyle, nor that which belongs to me, in the matter in queſtion; for, as ſuch, I keep no deputies.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. I live not on the weſt ſide of <hi>Skulkil,</hi> nor any deputy of mine; and I conceive Colonel <hi>Talbot</hi> could not, by that commiſſion, come to the eaſt ſide, to make his demand; which yet he did.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. I was abſent, and at <hi>New-York,</hi> when this commiſſioner came; and I never did, nor never will, commiſſion any deputy to treat and conclude away my inheritance, without my particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection

                     <p n="5">V. Colonel <hi>Talbot</hi> is directed, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to make the demand, according to a line, ſaid to be run, in obedience to his majeſty's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, in his letter of the 2d. of April, 1681; but I ſay, that no line is yet run, in obedience to his majeſty's command;—for the letter expreſsly ſaith, that the Lord <hi>Baltimore,</hi> or his agent, ſhall, together with my agent, agree to the latitude, and then run the line, and bound the provinces accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; which is not yet done: For thoſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the line run by them, are performed by the Lord <hi>Baltimore,</hi> and his agents only, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not according to his majeſty's command, in his letter of the 2d. of April, 1681, nor, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, common equity; for I knew nothing of them.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. To ſay (as his commiſſion doth) that my commiſſioners refuſed to comply with the ſaid let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is hard for me to do; ſince the chiefeſt of them brought it in my favour. But the truth is, (if they ſay true, and circumſtances favour them) the thing is improbable; for the Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> would have had them agreed to have taken an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation upon the river <hi>Delaware,</hi> when as the King's letter (ſtating my bounds, as they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in my patent) begins twelve miles above <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> upon the weſt ſide of <hi>Delaware</hi> river, and ſo to run to the 43d. degree of north lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, upon the ſaid river; which makes it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> could come within thoſe limits to take an obſervation, or run a line, in purſuance of his majeſty's commands, in the ſaid letter; ſince taking an obſervation on <hi>Delaware</hi> river (which, ſay they, he preſſed) is a plain viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. They further ſay, that they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, but preſſed the taking of an obſervation,
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:032729_0278_0FF4F1C370F449A0"/>
according to his majeſty's letter; which is grounded on the bounds of my patent;<note place="margin">W. Penn's anſwer to the Lord Baltimore's demand.</note> and when the Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> and my agent had agreed to meet at <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> and to proceed according to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's letter, 'tis true that my agent came not, and as true, ſaith he, that the reaſon was the Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> called immediately at <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> alias, <hi>Marcus Hooks,</hi> as he went to <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the inhabitants to pay me <hi>Quit-rent,</hi> and named the place by a new name, before any line was run, or any obſervation agreed; which being a declared breach of the King's commands, and their treaty, in the opinion of my agent, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to meet the next day about a matter, the Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> had, in ſuch a manner, already determined.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. But what fault ſoever they were in, ſure I am, that, before an obſervation was agree, or any line was run, I came in, and ſuddenly after waited upon the Lord <hi>Baltimore.</hi> I preſented him with another letter from his majeſty; which he was ſo far from complying with, that he looked upon the King, as miſtaken, and ſet his patent in direct oppoſition; and to this day would never hear of complying with it, in either of the two points it related to; that is to ſay, his having but two degrees, and that beginning them at <hi>Watkins's</hi> point, he ſhould admeaſure them, at ſixty miles to a degree, to terminate the north bounds of his province. Now, in my opinion, it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ground his proceedings upon a former let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in neglect of a later advice and command from his majeſty: Nor doth it look very juſt to make the caution, or neglect of an agent, in the abſence of his principal, a reaſon to proceed againſt his principal, when preſent with other inſtructions, without due regard had to him, or his allegations. And I muſt ſay, that, at <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> when I preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> to ſit in one houſe with his

This I writ, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his deſire, and ſent after him, to ſell he refuſed, but ſtarted an exchange of part of that bay for the lower counties, on the bay of <hi>Delaware.</hi> This, I preſume, he knew I could not do; for his <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> had the one half; and I did not prize the thing, I deſired, at ſuch a rate. Soon after this meeting, I underſtood that he had iſſued forth a proclamation ſome time before, to invite people to plant thoſe parts in my poſſeſſion, under his <hi>Royal Highneſs;</hi> and that alſo before any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand had been made, or our friendly treaty ended; which I took ſo ill, in right of his <hi>Royal Highneſs,</hi> and that which his goodneſs had made mine, that I ſent commiſſioners (firſt to know the truth of it from his own mouth, before I would credit the intelligence, I had received, and, if true) to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the breach of our friendly treaty, and that it might be repaired; which he hath taken ſo ill (how deſervedly let the whole world judge) that he hath ſent me letters of a very coarſe ſtyle; ſuch, as indeed, could not be anſwered without thoſe terms, which unbecome men in our public ſtations; who, in the midſt of all diſagreements, ought to manage themſelves with coolneſs and exact civility; and, if, in this, I have, at any time, been ſhort, let me but know it, and I, that think it a meanneſs of ſpirit to juſtify an error,

when committed, am not too ſtiff to aſk him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.<note place="margin">W. Penn's anſwer to the Lord Baltimore's demand.</note> Here I left him, expecting his news when he came to the head of the bay, in September, as I thought he promiſed me; but inſtead of that, an obſervation is taken, a line run, and trees marked, without my notice, and a demand made thereupon, and all grounded on his majeſty's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the 2d. of April 1681: in which I muſt again ſay, I find no ſuch direction, which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me to the demand itſelf.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. To the <hi>demand, viz.</hi> Of all that land on <hi>Delaware</hi> river to the ſouth of the fortieth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of north latitude, I have this to ſay, that 'tis very odd the demand ſhould be made ſeveral months after the proclamation was put forth, to encourage people to plant moſt of the parts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; but much more ſtrange, that, after the Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> had declared under his hand, that he did not by that intend to break our amicable treaty, he ſhould, without further provocation given, proceed to demand thoſe parts! Certainly, this was not intended to continue our friendſhip; nor did it look with common decency, that Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Talbot</hi> ſhould not think me worth leaving a letter at my houſe, where he lodged, when he went away, as well as the land worth ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. But, indeed, his carriage all along ſhews, he came to defie me, not treat me, like either a neighbour, or gentleman. A ſudden change amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the King's people, under my charge, by threats, or drawing them off their obedience, by degrading mine; and invitations to the Lord <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timore's</hi> government. This I found at my return, in his conduct (though not in his commiſſion) as ſome of the people do aver.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. But, in the next place, the Lord <hi>Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> hath no warrant to run his line to the river of <hi>Delaware,</hi> neither by the King's letter, nor his own patent, if he peruſeth them well, where he will find the <hi>bay,</hi> but not the <hi>river,</hi> of <hi>Delaware.</hi>

                        <pb n="281" facs="unknown:032729_0281_0FF4F2215FBECCF0"/>X. The land demanded is not a part of the province of <hi>Maryland,</hi> as is expreſſed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; for it is in the juriſdiction of <hi>Delaware,</hi>

                     <p n="11">XI. The Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> hath no land given him by patent, but what was unplanted of any but ſavage nations; and this weſt ſide of the river <hi>Delaware,</hi> before, and at, the paſſing of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, was actually bought and poſſeſſed by a civil and chriſtian people, in amity with the crown of <hi>England;</hi> and by the treaty of peace in 1653, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> it was part of one article of the treaty, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould enjoy thoſe territories, in <hi>America,</hi> of which this was a member; and we do know, foreign actions of that time and kind continued firm after his majeſty's reſtoration; for <hi>Jamaica</hi> ſtill remains to us; and <hi>Dunkirk</hi> itſelf was not rendered, but ſold.—To be ſhort, I conceive, it is more for the Lord <hi>Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more's</hi> honour and ſafety, that it ſhould be ſo, as I ſay, than otherwiſe:—For, if he claimeth what was poſſeſſed of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> on <hi>Delaware</hi> river, ſouth of the fortieth degree of north-latitude, as what was lawfully under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſovereignty, how cometh he to ſuffer part of his province to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main under a ſtrange and foreign ſovereignty to that, under which he held his claim?</p>

                        <p>TRUSTY and well-beloved friends, I ſalute you all with ſincere affection, deſiring your temporal and eternal proſperity.</p>
                        <p>I have conſtituted you, or any three of you, Governor, and ſo are properly <hi>the Commiſſioners</hi> of the government; to act, as if I were preſent: And I hope is will conduce to your honor, and the peace and happineſs of the people, under your care. I found my former deputation clogged with a long and ſlow tale of perſons, rarely got together, and then with unwillingneſs, and ſometimes reflections, even, upon me; for their pains of hearing one letter read;—That time may ſhew them they were out, in their cenſure, having then contracted their deputation into your hands.—Be diligent, faithful, loving, and communicate with one another, in things that concern the public; and I no ways doubt, but your breaches will heal, and your example have that effect, that nothing will be left for me to do, but thank and love you, and take pleaſure in your comely order and thoſe under you.</p>
                        <p>I beſeech you draw not ſeveral ways, have no cabals apart, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves from one another; treat, with a mutual ſimplicity, an entire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in one another; and if, at any time, you miſtake, or miſapprehend, or diſſent from one another; let not that appear to the people; ſhew your virtues but conceal your infirmities; this will wake you awful and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent with the people. Juſtice, mercy, temperance of ſpirit, are high qualities, and neceſſary ones in government; I beſeech God to ſit you for his work more and more; by whom all Governors and people in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ought to be influenced, in their adminiſtration of temporal things, committed to their care.</p>
                        <p>Three things occur to me eminently;—Firſt, that you be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that none abuſe the King, in reference to his dues, &amp;c —Secondly, That you get the cuſtom act revived, with the firſt; for I think that the equalleſt, and leaſt offenſive way, to ſupport the government; for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt be done, in that affair, &amp;c. Thirdly, That you retrieve the dignity of courts and ſeſſions; and remove all perſons unqualified in morals or incapacity. Oh, that I could but have that, by your union, gravity, conſtant weekly meetings once or twice, as Second-days, and Fifth-days, in the morning or afternoon, to hear, advice, or do what is fit for the public good; that you had recovered the reputation which becomes that province to have;—For, what with that, which is real, and that malice in your neighbours of ſome governments invent, we have much ado to keep our heads above water here.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall add no more, but my love to the people, in general; and that ſo ſoon as my affairs will let me, I ſhall be with them: for no poor ſlave in Turkey, longs more for his freedom. I commit you to God's protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and bid you heartily farewell.</p>

The importance of it doth primarily and directly reſpect yourſelf, and your own private concernments; but it alſo conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially and effectually regards the King, his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and, even, the peace and ſettlement of this
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:032729_0315_0FF4F29A8C75B280"/>
whole nation. I intreat you, therefore,<note place="margin">1688.</note> to bear with me, if I endeavour, in this manner, to give ſomewhat more weight unto my words,<note place="margin">W. Popple to W. Penn.</note> than would be in a tranſient diſcourſe, and leave them with you, as a ſubject, that requires your retired con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
                     <p>You are not ignorant, that the part you have been ſuppoſed to have had, of late years, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic affairs, though without either the title, or honor, or profit, of any public office, and that eſpecially your avowed endeavours to introduce amongſt us a general and inviolable <hi>liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> in matters of mere religion, have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the miſtakes of ſome men, provoked the malice of others, and, in the end, have raiſed againſt you a multitude of enemies; who have unworthily defamed you with ſuch imputations, as, I am ſure, you abhor. This I know you have been ſufficiently informed of, though I doubt you have not made ſufficient reflection upon it: The conſciouſneſs of your own innocence ſeems to me to have given you too great a contempt of ſuch unjuſt and ill-grounded ſlanders. For however glorious it is, and reaſonable, for a truly virtuous mind, whoſe inward peace is founded upon that rock of innocence, to deſpiſe the empty noiſe of popular reproach, yet, even, that ſublimity of ſpirit may ſometimes ſwell to a reprovable exceſs. To be ſteady and immovable, in the proſecution of wiſe and honeſt reſolutions, by all honeſt and prudent means, is, indeed, a duty, that admits of no exception: But, nevertheleſs, it ought not to hinder that, at the ſame time, there be alſo due care taken of preſerving a fair reputation. <hi>"A good name,</hi> ſays the wiſe man, <hi>is better than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ointment."</hi> It is a perfume, that recommends the perſon, whom it accompanies, that procures him every where an eaſy acceptance; and that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitates the ſucceſs of all his enterpriſes: And for
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:032729_0316_0FF4F29C1A47C880"/>
that reaſon, though there were no other, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, obſerve, that the care of a man's repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is an eſſential part of that very ſame duty,<note place="margin">W. Popple to W. Penn.</note> that engages him in the purſuit of any worthy deſign.</p>
                     <p>But I muſt not entertain you with a declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon this general theme: my buſineſs is to repreſent to you, more particularly, thoſe very imputations, which are caſt upon yourſelf, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſome of their evident conſequences; that, if poſſible, I may thereby move you to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after a remedy. The ſource of all ariſes from the ordinary acceſs, you have unto the King, the credit you are ſuppoſed to have with him, and the deep jealouſy, that ſome people have conceived of his intentions, in reference to religion. Their jealouſy is, that his aim has been to ſettle <hi>Popery</hi> in this nation, not only in a fair and ſecure liberty, but, even, in a predominating ſuperiority over all other profeſſions: And from thence the inference follows, that whoſoever has any part in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of this reign, muſt needs be popiſhly affected: But that, to have ſo great a part in them, as you are ſaid to have had, can happen to none, but an <hi>abſolute Papiſt.</hi> That is the direct charge; but that is not enough; your part is too conſiderable for a Papiſt of an ordinary form; and, therefore, you muſt be a <hi>Jeſuit:</hi> Nay, to confirm that ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, it muſt be accompanied with all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that may beſt give it an air of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; as, that you have been bred at <hi>St. Omer's,</hi> in the <hi>Jeſuit's college;</hi> that you have taken <hi>orders</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and there obtained a diſpenſation to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and that you have ſince then frequently offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, as a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> in the celebration of the <hi>maſs,</hi> at <hi>White-Hall, St. James's,</hi> and other places. And this being admitted, nothing can be too black to be caſt upon you. Whatſoever is thought amiſs, either in church or ſtate, though never ſo contrary to your advice, is boldly attributed to it; and, if
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:032729_0317_0FF4F29DAE70FE08"/>
other proofs fail, the Scripture itſelf muſt be brought in to confirm, "That whoſoever offends, in one point,<note place="margin">W. Popple to W. Penn.</note> (in a point eſpecially ſo eſſential as that of our too much affected uniformity) is guilty of the breach of all our laws." Thus the charge of <hi>Popery</hi> draws after it a tail like the <hi>et caetera oath,</hi> and by endleſs innuendos prejudicates you, as guilty of whatſoever malice can invent, or folly believe: But that charge, therefore, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the inferences, that are drawn from it, will vaniſh, and your reputation will eaſily return to its former brightneſs.</p>
                     <p>Now, that I might the more effectually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to apply ſome remedy to this diſeaſe, I beſeech you, Sir, ſuffer me to lay before you ſome of its pernicious conſequences. It is not a trifling matter, for a perſon, raiſed as you are, above the common level, to lie under the prejudice of ſo general a miſtake, in ſo important a matter. The general, and the long prevalency of any opinion gives it a ſtrength, eſpecially among the vulgar, that is not eaſily ſhaken. And, as it happens that you have alſo enemies of an higher rank, who will be ready to improve ſuch popular miſtakes, by all arts of malicious artifices, it muſt be taken for granted that thoſe errors will be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſtill more confirmed, and the inconveniences, that may ariſe from thence, no leſs increaſed. This, Sir, I aſſure you, is a melancholy proſpect to your friends; for we know you have ſuch enemies. The deſign of ſo univerſal a liberty of conſcience, as your principles have led you to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, has offended many of thoſe, whoſe intereſt is to croſs it. I need not tell you how many, and how powerful they are; nor can I tell you either how far, or by what ways and means they may endeavour to execute their revenge. But this, however, I muſt needs tell you, that, in your preſent circumſtances, there is ſufficient ground
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:032729_0318_0FF4F29F41E32780"/>
for ſo much jealouſy, at leaſt, as ought to excite you to uſe the precaution of ſome public vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">W. Popple to W. Penn.</note> This the tenderneſs of friendſhip prompts your friends to deſire of you; and this the juſt ſenſe of your honor, which true religion does not extinguiſh, requires you to execute.</p>
                     <p>Pardon, I entreat you, Sir, the earneſtneſs of theſe expreſſions; nay, ſuffer me, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, to expoſtulate with you yet a little farther. I am fearful leſt theſe perſonal conſiderations ſhould not have their due weight with you, and therefore, I cannot omit to reflect alſo upon ſome more general conſequences of your particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. I have ſaid it already, that the King, his honour, his government, and, even, the peace and ſettlement of this whole nation, either are, or have been, concerned in this matter: Your reputation, as you are ſaid to have meddled in public affairs, have been of public concernment. The promoting a general liberty of conſcience having been your particular province; the aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Jeſuitiſm,</hi> that has been caſt upon <hi>you,</hi> has reflected upon his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> for having made uſe, in that affair, of ſo diſguiſed a perſonage as you are ſuppoſed to have been. It has weakened the force of all your endeavours, obſtructed their effect, and contributed greatly to diſappoint this poor nation of that ineſtimable hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and ſecure eſtabliſhment, which, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, you deſigned, and which all good and wiſe men agree, that a juſt and inviolable liberty of conſcience would infallibly produce. I heartily wiſh this conſideration had been ſooner laid to heart, and that ſome demonſtrative evidence of your ſincerity, in the profeſſion you make, had accompanied all your endeavours for liberty.</p>
                     <p>But, what do I ſay, or what do I wiſh for? I confeſs that I am now ſtruck with aſtoniſhment at that abundant evidence, which I know you have
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:032729_0319_0FF4F2ABDC1B4448"/>
conſtantly given, of the oppoſition of your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> church, and at the little regard, there has been had to it.<note place="margin">W. Popple to W. Penn.</note> If an open profeſſion of the directeſt oppoſition againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> that has ever appeared in the world, ſince <hi>Popery</hi> was firſt diſtinguiſhed from <hi>common Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> would ſerve the turn, this cannot be denied to all thoſe of that <hi>ſociety,</hi> with which you are joined in the duties of religious worſhip. If to have maintained the principles of that ſociety, by frequent and fervent diſcourſes, by many elaborate writings, by ſuffering ignominy, impriſonment, and other manyfold diſadvantages, in defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, can be admitted as any proof of your ſincere adherence thereunto; this, it is evident to the world, you have done already: Nay, farther, if to have enquired as far as was poſſible for you, into the particular ſtories, that have been framed againſt you, and to have ſought all means of recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the miſtakes, upon which they were ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could, in any meaſure avail to the ſettling a true character of you, in men's judgments; this alſo I know you have done. For I have ſeen, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hand of a reverend Dean<note n="*" place="margin">Tillotſon.</note> of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> church, a full acknowledgment of ſatisfaction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from you, in a ſuſpicion he had entertained, upon one of thoſe ſtories, and to which his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port had procured too great credit. And though I know you are averſe to the publiſhing of his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without his expreſs leave, and, perhaps, may not now think fit to aſk it; yet I am ſo thoroughly aſſured of his ſincerity and candour, that I cannot doubt, but he has already vindicated you, in that matter, and will, (according to his promiſe) be ſtill ready to do it, upon all occaſions. Nay, I have ſeen alſo your juſtification from another ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny of common fame, about your having kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napped one, who had been formerly a <hi>Monk,</hi> out of your <hi>American</hi> province, to deliver him here into the hands of his enemies; I ſay I have ſeen
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:032729_0320_0FF4F2AD6B7198E8"/>
your juſtification from that ſtory, under that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's own hand: and his return to <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> where he now reſides,<note place="margin">W. Popple to W. Penn.</note> may be an irrefragable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of it, to any that will take the pains to enquire thereinto.</p>
                     <p>Really, it afflicts me very much, to conſider that all this does not ſuffice. If I had not that particular reſpect for you, which I ſincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, yet I could not but be much affected, that any man, who had deſervedly acquired ſo fair a reputation, as you have formerly had, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and veracity had always been reputed ſpotleſs, and whoſe charity had been continually exerciſed in ſerving others, at the dear expence of his time, his ſtrength and his eſtate, without any other recompence than what reſults from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of doing good; I ſay, I could not but be much affected, to ſee any ſuch perſon fall inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and undeſervedly under ſuch unjuſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, as you have done. It is an hard caſe; and I think, no man, that has any bowels of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, can reflect upon it, without great relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                     <p>Since, therefore, it is ſo, and that ſomething remains yet to be done, ſomething more expreſs, and eſpecially more public, than has yet been done, for your vindication, I beg of you, dear Sir, by all the tender efficacy, that friendſhip, either mine, or that of your friends and relations together can have upon you, by the due regard, which huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and, even, Chriſtianity, obliges you to have to your reputation; by the duty, you owe unto the King, by your love to the land of your nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; and by the cauſe of univerſal religion and eternal truth, let not the ſcandal of inſincerity, that I have hinted at, lie any longer upon you; but let the ſenſe of all theſe obligations perſwade you to gratify your friends and relations, and to ſerve your King, your country and your religion,

                     <p>IT is now above twenty years, I thank God,<note place="margin">W. Penn's anſwer to W. Popple.</note> that I have not been very ſolicitous what the world thought of me. For ſince I have had the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of religion, from a <hi>principle</hi> in <hi>myſelf,</hi> the firſt and main point with me has been, to approve myſelf in the ſight of God, through patience and well-doing: So that the world has not had weight enough with me, to ſuffer its good opinion to raiſe me, or its ill opinion to deject me. And, if that had been the only motive, or conſideration, and not the deſire of a good friend, in the name of many others, I had been as ſilent to thy letter, as I uſe to be to the idle and malicious ſhams of the times: But, as the laws of friendſhip are ſacred, with thoſe that value that relation, ſo I confeſs this to be a principal one with me, not to deny a friend the ſatisfaction he deſires, when it may be done without offence to a good conſcience.</p>
                     <p>The buſineſs chiefly inſiſted upon is my <hi>Popery,</hi> and endeavours to promote it. I do ſay, then, and that with all ſincerity, that I am not only no <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> but no <hi>Papiſt.</hi> And, which is more, I never had any temptation upon me to be it, either from doubts, in my own mind, about the way I
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:032729_0322_0FF4F31997258D68"/>
profeſs, or from the diſcourſes, or writings of any of that religion. And, in the preſence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God,<note place="margin">W. Penn's anſwer to W. Popple.</note> I do declare, that the King did never once, directly or indirectly attack me, or tempt me, upon that ſubject, the many years, that I have had the advantage of a free acceſs to him; ſo unjuſt, as well as ſordidly falſe, are all thoſe ſtories of the town.</p>
                     <p>The only reaſon, that I can apprehend, they have to repute me a <hi>Roman Catholic,</hi> is my frequent going to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> a place no more forbid to me, than to the reſt of the world, who yet, it ſeems, find much fairer quarter. I have almoſt continually had one buſineſs or other there for our Friends, whom I ever ſerved with a ſteady ſolicitation, through all times, ſince I was of their communion. I had alſo a great many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal good offices to do, upon a principle of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for people of all perſwaſions; thinking it a duty to improve the little intereſt I had, for the good of thoſe, that needed it, eſpecially the poor. I might add ſomething of my own affairs too; though I muſt own (if I may without vanity) that they have ever had the leaſt ſhare of my thoughts, or pains, or elſe they would not have ſtill depended as they yet do.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe ſome people are ſo unjuſt, as to render inſtances for my <hi>Popery</hi> (or, rather hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, for ſo it would be in me) it is fit I contradict them as particularly as they accuſe me. I ſay, then, ſolemnly, that I am ſo far from having been bred at <hi>St. Omer's,</hi> and having received orders at <hi>Rome,</hi> that I never was at either place, nor do I know any body there; nor had I ever a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with any body, in thoſe places; which is another ſtory invented againſt me. And, as for my officiating in the King's chapel, or any other, it is ſo ridiculous, as well as untrue, that beſides that no body can do it, but a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and that I
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:032729_0323_0FF4F2B09414F9D8"/>
have been married to a woman of ſome condition, above ſixteen years, which no Prieſt can be,<note place="margin">W. Penn's anſwer to W. Popple.</note> by any diſpenſation whatever; I have not ſo much as looked into <hi>any</hi> chapel of the <hi>Roman</hi> religion, and conſequently not the King's, though common cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity warrants it daily to people of all perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                     <p>And, once for all, I do ſay, that I am a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant diſſenter,</hi> and to that degree ſuch, that I challenge the moſt celebrated Proteſtant of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> church, or any other, on that head, be he Layman, or Clergyman, in public, or in private. For I would have ſuch people know, it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a <hi>true Proteſtant diſſenter</hi> to be dutiful, thankful and ſerviceable to the <hi>King,</hi> though he be of the <hi>Roman catholic communion.</hi> We hold not our property, or protection, from him, by our perſwaſion; and, therefore, his perſwaſion ſhould not be the meaſure of our allegiance. I am ſorry to ſee ſo many, that ſeem fond of the reformed religion, by their diſaffection to him, recommend it ſo ill. Whatever practices of <hi>Roman catholics</hi> we might reaſonably object againſt (and no doubt but ſuch there are) yet he has diſclaimed and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended thoſe ill things, by his declared opinion againſt <hi>perſecution,</hi> by the eaſe, in which he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally indulges all diſſenters; and by the confirmation, he offers in Parliament, for the ſecurity of the Proteſtant religion, and liberty of conſcience. And, in his honour, as well as in my own defence, I am obliged, in conſcience, to ſay, that he has ever declared to me, <hi>it was his opinion;</hi> and on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, when Duke, he never refuſed me the repeated proofs of it, as often as I had any poor ſufferers for conſcience ſake to ſolicit his help for.</p>
                     <p>But ſome may be apt to ſay, "Why not any body elſe as well as I? Why muſt I have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable acceſs to other diſſenters, if not a <hi>Papiſt?"</hi> I anſwer, I know not that it is ſo. But this I know,
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:032729_0324_0FF4F2BD90CD1DF0"/>
that I have made it my province and buſineſs; I have followed and preſſed it; I took it for my cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſtation,<note place="margin">W. Penn's anſwer to W. Popple.</note> and have kept it above theſe ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years; and, which is more (if I may ſay it without vanity or reproach) wholly at my own charges too. To this let me add the relation, that my father had to this King's ſervice; his particular favour, in getting me releaſed out of the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> in 1669; my father's humble requeſt to him, upon his death bed, to protect me from the inconveniencies and troubles, my perſwaſion might expoſe me to, and his friendly promiſe to do it, and exact performance of it, from the moment, I addreſſed myſelf to him:—I ſay, when all this is conſidered, any body, that has the leaſt pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Perhaps, ſome will be ready to ſay, "This is not all, nor is this yet a fault, but, that I have been an adviſer in other matters, diſguſtful to the kingdom, and which tend to the overthrow of the Proteſtant religion, and the liberties of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple."—A likely thing, indeed, that a Proteſtant diſſenter, who, from fifteen years old, has been, at times, a ſufferer, in his father's family, in the univerſity, and by the government, for being ſo, ſhould deſign the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the Proteſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion!

                        <note n="*" place="margin">See page 246.</note> Will men ſtill ſuffer ſuch ſtuff to paſs upon them? Is any thing more fooliſh, as well as falſe, than that, becauſe I am often at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> therefore I muſt be the author of all, that is done there, which does not pleaſe abroad? But, ſuppoſing ſome ſuch things to have been done, pray tell me, if I am bound to oppoſe any thing, that I am not called to do? I never was a member of council, cabinet, or committee, where the affairs of the kingdom
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:032729_0325_0FF4F2BF1F2C6860"/>
are tranſacted. I have had no office, or truſt, and conſequently nothing can be ſaid to be done by me; nor, for that reaſon,<note place="margin">W. Penn's anſwer to W. Popple.</note> could I lie under any teſt, or obligation to diſcover my opinion of public acts of ſtate; and therefore neither can any ſuch acts, nor my ſilence about them, in juſtice, be made my crime. Volunteers are blanks and cyphers, in all governments. And unleſs calling at <hi>White-Hall</hi> once a day, upon many occaſions, or my not being turned out of nothing (for that no office is) be the evidence of my compliance in diſagreeable things, I know not what elſe can, with any truth, be alledged againſt me.

                        </gap>y obſerved, and endeavoured, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, with perſons of all ranks and opinions, to allay heats, and moderate extremes, even, in the politics. It is below me to be more particular; but, I am ſure, it has been my endeavour, that, if we could not all meet upon a religious bottom, at leaſt, we might upon a civil one, the good of <hi>England;</hi> which is the common intereſt of King and people: That he might be great by juſtice, and we free by obedience, diſtinguiſhing rightly, on the one hand, between duty and ſlavery; and on the other, between liberty and licentiouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>But, alas, I am not without my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the cauſe of this behaviour towards me, and in this, I perceive, we agree; I mean my conſtant zeal for an <hi>impartial</hi> liberty of conſcience. But, if that be it, the cauſe is too good to be in pain about. I ever underſtood that to be the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural right of all men; and that he that had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion without it, his religion was none of his own. For what is not the religion of a man's <hi>choice,</hi> is the religion of him that impoſes it: So that liberty of conſcience is the firſt ſtep to have a religion. This is no new opinion with me. I have writ many apologies, within the laſt twenty years, to
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:032729_0326_0FF4F2C0B26E7238"/>
defend it, and that impartially. Yet I have as conſtantly declared, that bounds ought to be ſet to this freedom,<note place="margin">W. Penn's anſwer to W. Popple.</note> and that morality was the <hi>beſt;</hi> and that as often as that was violated, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of conſcience, it was fit the civil power ſhould take place. Nor did I ever once think of promoting any ſort of liberty of conſcience, for any body which did not preſerve the <hi>common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy</hi> of the kingdom, and the <hi>ancient rights</hi> of the government. For, to ſay truth, the one cannot be maintained without the other.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole matter, I muſt ſay, <hi>I love England;</hi> I ever did ſo; and that I am not in her debt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I never valued time, money, or kindred, to ſerve her and do her good. No party could ever biaſs me to her prejudice, nor any perſonal intereſt oblige me in her wrong. For I always abhorred diſcounting <hi>private favours</hi> at the <hi>public coſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Would I have made my market of the fears and jealouſies of the people, when this King came to the crown, I had put twenty thouſand pounds into my pocket, and an hundred thouſand into my province; for mighty numbers of people were then upon the wing: But I waved it all; hoped for better times; expected the effects of the King's word, for liberty of conſcience, and happineſs by it: And till I ſaw my friends, with the kingdom, delivered from the legal bondage, which penal laws, for religion, had ſubjected them to, I could, with no ſatisfaction, think of leaving <hi>England;</hi> though much to my prejudice beyond ſea; and at my great expence here; having, in all this time never had either office or penſion, and always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing the rewards, or gratuities, of thoſe, I have been able to oblige.</p>
                     <p>If, therefore, an <hi>univerſal charity,</hi> if the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting an <hi>impartial liberty of conſcience,</hi> if <hi>doing to others as one would be done by,</hi> and an <hi>open avowing,</hi>

and ſteady <hi>practiſing of theſe things,</hi> in all times, to all parties, will juſtly lay a man under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of being a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> or a <hi>Papiſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">W. Penn's anſwer to W. Popple.</note> of any rank, I muſt not only ſubmit to the character, but embrace it too; and I care not who knows that I can wear it with more pleaſure, than it is poſſible for them, with any juſtice, to give it me. For theſe are corner-ſtones and principles with me; and I am ſcandalized at all buildings, that have them not for their foundations. For religion itſelf is an empty name without them, a whited wall, a painted ſepulchre, no <hi>life</hi> or <hi>virtue</hi> to the ſoul; no good, or example, to one's neighbour. Let us not flatter ourſelves, "We can never be the better for our religion, if our neighbour be the worſe for it." Our fault is, we are apt to be mighty hot upon ſpeculative errors, and break all bounds, in our reſentments; but we let practical ones paſs without remark, if not without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: As if a miſtake about an <hi>obſcure propoſition of faith,</hi> were a greater evil, than the breach of an undoubted precept. Such a religion the devils themſelves are not without; for they have both faith and knowledge; but their faith doth not work by love, nor their knowledge by obedience. And, if this be their judgment, can it be our bleſſing? Let us not think religion a litigious thing; nor that Chriſt came only to make us good diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; but, that he came alſo to make us good livers. Sincerity goes farther than capacity. It is <hi>charity,</hi> that deſervedly excels, in the Chriſtian religion; and happy would it be, if, where unity ends, charity did begin, inſtead of envy and rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that almoſt ever follow. It appears to me to be the way, that God has found out and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to moderate our differences, and make them, at leaſt, harmleſs to ſociety; and, therefore, I confeſs, I dare not aggravate them to wrath and blood. Our diſagreement lies in our <hi>apprehenſion,</hi>
                        <pb n="328" facs="unknown:032729_0328_0FF4F31B273D4DA8"/>
or <hi>belief</hi> of things; and if the common enemy of mankind had not the governing of our affections and paſſions,<note place="margin">W. Penn's anſwer to W. Popple.</note> that diſagreement would not prove ſuch a canker, as it is, to love and peace, in civil ſocieties.</p>
                     <p>He that ſuffers his difference with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, about the other world, to carry him beyond the line of moderation, in this, is the worſe for his <hi>opinion,</hi> even, though it be true. It is too little conſidered by <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that men may hold the <hi>truth</hi> in <hi>unrighteouſneſs;</hi> that they may be <hi>ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,</hi> and not know what <hi>ſpirit they are of:</hi> So were the Apoſtles of our Lord; they believed in him, yet let a falſe <hi>zeal</hi> do violence to their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their unwarrantable <hi>heat</hi> contradict the great end of their Saviour's coming, <hi>love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Men may be angry for God's ſake, and kill people too. Chriſt ſaid it, and too many have practiſed it. But what ſort of Chriſtians muſt they be, I pray, that can <hi>hate</hi> in his name, who bids us <hi>love;</hi> and <hi>kill</hi> for his ſake, that forbids <hi>killing,</hi> and commands <hi>love,</hi> even, to enemies.</p>
                     <p>Let not men, or parties, think to ſhift it off from themſelves. It is not this <hi>principle,</hi> or that <hi>form,</hi> to which ſo great a defection is owing, but a degeneracy of mind from God. Chriſtianity is not at <hi>heart.</hi> No fear of God in the inward parts: No awe of his divine omnipreſence. <hi>Self</hi> prevails, and breaks out, more or leſs, through all forms, but too plainly; (pride, wrath, luſt, avarice) ſo that though people ſay to God, <hi>Thy will be done;</hi> which ſhews them to be true heathens, under a maſk of Chriſtianity, that believe without works, and repent without forſaking; buſy for <hi>forms,</hi> and the temporal benefits of them, while <hi>true religion,</hi> which is, <hi>To viſit the fatherleſs and the widow, and to keep ourſelves unſpotted from the world,</hi> goes bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, and, like <hi>Lazarus,</hi> is deſpiſed. Yet this was the definition the Holy Ghoſt gave of religion,
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:032729_0329_0FF4F2CEE06F1DA8"/>
before <hi>Synods</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> had the meddling with it, and modelling of it. In thoſe days,<note place="margin">W. Penn's anſwer to W. Popple.</note> bowels were a good part of religion, and that to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs and widow, at <hi>large.</hi> We can hardly now extend them to thoſe of our own way. It was ſaid by him, that could not ſay amiſs, <hi>Becauſe iniquity abounds, the love of many waxeth cold.</hi> Whatſoever divides man's heart from <hi>God,</hi> ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates it from his <hi>neighbour;</hi> and he, that loves <hi>ſelf</hi> more than <hi>God,</hi> can never love his <hi>neighbour</hi> as himſelf. For, as the Apoſtle ſaid, "If we do not love him, whom we have ſeen, how can we love God, whom we have not ſeen?"</p>
                     <p>O, that we could ſee ſome men as eager to turn people to <hi>God,</hi> as they are to blow them up, and ſet them one againſt another. But, indeed, thoſe only can have that pure and pious zeal, who are themſelves turned to God, and have taſted the ſweetneſs of that converſion, which is to <hi>power,</hi> not <hi>form;</hi> to <hi>godlineſs,</hi> not <hi>gain.</hi> Such as thoſe do bend their thoughts and pains to appeaſe, not increaſe, heats and animoſities; to exhort people to look at home, ſweep their own houſes, and weed their own gardens. And, in no age, or time, was there more need to ſet men at work, in their own hearts, than this we live in, when ſo buſy, wandering, licentious a ſpirit prevails. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſome men may think, "The diſeaſe of this kingdom is <hi>ſin;</hi> impiety againſt <hi>God,</hi> and want of <hi>charity</hi> to men." And while this guilt is at our door, judgment cannot be far off.</p>
                     <p>Now, this being the diſeaſe, I will briefly offer two things, for the cure of it.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is <hi>David's clean heart,</hi> and <hi>right ſpirit,</hi> which he aſked and had of God: without this we muſt be a <hi>chaos</hi> ſtill. For the diſtemper is <hi>within;</hi> and our Lord ſaid, <hi>All evil</hi> comes from thence. Set the <hi>inward man right,</hi> and the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:032729_0330_0FF4F31CBAD5C098"/>
man cannot be wrong:</hi> That is the helm, that governs the human veſſel: And this nothing can do,<note place="margin">W. Penn's anſwer to W. People.</note> but an <hi>inward principle,</hi> the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> that came by Chriſt; which the ſcripture tells us, <hi>enlightens every one, and hath appeared to all men."</hi> It is prepoſterous to think, that <hi>He,</hi> who made the world, ſhould ſhew leaſt care of the beſt part of it, our <hi>ſouls.</hi> No, he, that gave us an outward luminary, for our bodies, hath given us an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward one, for our minds, to act by. We have it; and it is our condemnation, that we do not love it, and bring our deeds to it. It is by this we ſee our ſins, are made ſenſible of them, ſorry for them, and finally forſake them. And he, that thinks to go to Heaven a nearer way, will, I fear, belate his ſoul, and be irreparably miſtaken. There are but <hi>goats</hi> and <hi>ſheep,</hi> at laſt, whatever ſhapes we wear here. Let us not, therefore, dear friend, deceive ourſelves. Our ſouls are at ſtake: "God will not be mocked; what we ſow we muſt expect to reap. There is no repentance in the grave;" which ſhews, that, if none there, then no where elſe. To ſum up this divinity of mine; it is the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in our ſouls, that gives us a true ſight of ourſelves, and that ſight that leads us to repentance; which repentance begets humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and humility, that true <hi>charity,</hi> that covers a multitude of faults; which I call God's <hi>expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> againſt man's <hi>infirmity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond remedy to our preſent diſtemper, is this; ſince all, of all parties, profeſs to believe in God, Chriſt, the Spirit, and Scripture; that the ſoul is immortal, that there are eternal rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments; and that the virtuous ſhall receive the one, and the wicked ſuffer the other; I ſay, ſince this is the common faith of Chriſtendom, let us all reſolve, in the ſtrength of God, to live up to what we agree in, before we fall out ſo miſerably, about the reſt, in which we differ. I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:032729_0331_0FF4F2D06F407F20"/>
the change and comfort, which that pious courſe would bring us to,<note place="margin">W. Penn's anſwer to W. Popple.</note> would go very far to diſpoſe our natures to compound eaſily for all the reſt; and we might hope yet to ſee happy days, in poor <hi>England;</hi> for there I would have ſo good a work begun. And how it is poſſible for the eminent men of every religious perſwaſion (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the preſent <hi>miniſters</hi> of the <hi>pariſhes</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland)</hi> to think of giving an account to God, at the laſt day, without uſing the utmoſt of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to <hi>moderate</hi> the members of their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive communions towards thoſe, that differ from them, is a myſtery to me! But this I know, and muſt lay it at their doors, I charge alſo my own ſoul with it, "God requires <hi>moderation</hi> and <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> from us;" for he is at hand, who will not ſpare to judge our <hi>impatience,</hi> if we have no pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for one another. The eternal God rebuke, I beſeech him, the wrath of man, and humble all under the ſenſe of the evil of this day; and yet, unworthy as we are, give us <hi>peace,</hi> for his holy Name's ſake!</p>
                     <p>It is now time to end this letter; and I will do it without ſaying any more than this: Thou ſeeſt my defence againſt popular calumny; thou ſeeſt what my thoughts are, of our condition, and the way to better it; and thou ſeeſt my hearty and humble prayer to Almighty God, to incline us to be wiſe, if it were but for our own ſakes. I ſhall only add, that I am extremely ſenſible of the kindneſs and juſtice, intended me by my friends, on this occaſion, and that I am, for that, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more reaſons,</p>

                           <head type="sub">To my truly and well-beloved friends, Thomas Lloyd, Robert Turner, John Eckle, John Simcock and Arthur Cook, commiſſioners of ſtate, for the province of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> or any three of them:—</head>
                           <p>I ſalute you all with unfeigned love, and, in Chriſt Jeſus, wiſh you health and happineſs.—</p>
                           <p>My laſt is by the ſame hand, this being ſent to the <hi>Downs</hi> after him, upon the receipt of Thomas Lloyd's and William Markham's letter: But I am heartily ſorry that I had no letter from the government: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I have hardly had one at all: and for private letters though from public perſons, I regard them but little; I mean as to taking my public meaſures by: for I find ſuch contradictions, as well as diverſity, that I believe, I may ſay, I am one of the unhappieſt Proprietaries, with one of the beſt people. If this had not been complained of in mine by Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Blackſan, I ſhould have been leſs moved at this viſible incompla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and neglect.—Had the government ſigned, I mean thoſe, who are the moſt eminent in authority, by conſent of the reſt, it had given me ſome caſe and ſatisfaction; but, as it is, 'tis controverſy rather than government, which ſtands and lives and proſpers in unity, at leaſt of the governing part, whatever be their affections; for men may agree in duty, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like one another's natural tempers.—I ſhall henceforth, therefore, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect letters from the government, recounting the affairs of it, that they may be authoritative to me; and as many private ones as you pleaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; for that I alſo, rejoice in, and any particular advice, that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me, as to the public, or remedy what may be amiſs, or meliorate what is, in itſelf, well, will alſo be very acceptable to me.</p>
                           <p>Now I have ſaid this, I cannot but condole the loſs of ſome ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, in the province, honeſt men, and of good underſtandings, in their kind. The Lord avert his judgments, and conſtrain all, by his viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to amend, be it in converſation, or be it in peace, concord and charity; they that live near to God, will live far from themſelves; and from the ſenſe they have of his nearneſs and majeſty, have a low opinion of themſelves; and out of that low and humble frame of ſpirit it is, that true charity grows; the moſt excellent way;—Ah! what ſhall I ſay, there can be no union, no comfortable ſociety without it: Oh, that the people of my province, and parts annexed; felt this gracious quality abounding in them, my work would be done, and their praiſe and my joy unſpeakably abound to us; wherefore, in the name and fear of God, let all old ſores be forgotten, as well as forgiven: ſhut out the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them, and preach this doctrine to the people, in my name, yea, in the king's name, and his that is greater above all, <hi>viz.</hi> God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's name.</p>
                           <p>I am ſorry that <hi>Thomas Lloyd,</hi> my eſteemed friend, covets a <hi>Quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> that is young, active and ingenious; for from ſuch it is, that I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect help; and ſuch will not low, I hope, in vain; but ſince 'tis his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, I do hereby ſignify his <hi>diſmiſs</hi> from the trouble he has borne, (for ſome time of reſt and eaſe, at leaſt) and do nominate, to be commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onated in my name, under the great ſeal, till further order, <hi>Samuel Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter,</hi> who, I hope will accept, and induſtriouſly ſerve that ſtation, elſe <hi>Thomas Ellis;</hi> who has an office, that requires his attendance, having one in my eye, that may ſee you ſhortly, as a man richly qualified for that ſtation: <hi>Robert Turner,</hi> of courſe has the Chair, for the firſt month after the receipt of this, and the reſt alternately, monthly, if you find that convenient, as, I believe, it will be moſt eaſy, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>I have only to recommend to you, the due execution of the divers good laws, among you, impartially and diligently, not neglecting the order, from hence ſent, eſpecially for peace and concord.—Government is not to make, but to do and diſpatch buſineſs; in which few words, and a quiet, but a briſk execution does beſt; wherefore conſider well what is juſt and fit, the one in law, the other in prudence (where you have room to uſe it) purſue in all caſes; and no matter what any ſay, or object.</p>
                           <p>I writ to you about my <hi>Quit-rents:</hi> I am forced to pay bills here, to ſupport my family there, while I have 4 or 500 pounds per annum in <hi>Quit-rents</hi> there; you may remember the votes of Council, to pay my charges in this expedition: I could draw a large bill upon the provincial council, in that reſpect; I am ſure I need it, but have forebore; though it is none of the endearingeſt conſiderations, that I have not had the preſent of a ſkin, or a pound of tobacco ſince I came over: though they are like to have the moſt advantage by it, and promiſed me ſo much!—</p>
                           <p>Pray, prevent people's withdrawing from us, what you can; they cannot mend themſelves; and they that go will find it ſo, in a while; for I believe, <hi>God has bleſſed that poor place;</hi> and the reaſon of my ſtay here, and the ſervice I am, and have been of, to the conſcientious, ſhall be rewarded on my ſolitary province.—Remember me to the people, and let them know, my heart's deſire towards them; and ſhall embrace the firſt opportunity to make my abode with them.</p>
                           <p>Once more, let me hear from you, and have a copy of the laws, as my other letter directs, and you ſhall ſoon hear from me to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; ſo I bid you heartily farewell.</p>

               <p>"Now, though I have, to pleaſe thee, given thee a <hi>quietus</hi> from all public buſineſs, my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to conſtitute thee Deputy Governour, and two, in the character of aſſiſtants; either of whom and thyſelf, to be able to do all as fully as I my ſelf can do; only I wait thy conſent to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;

               <p>Notwithſtanding the ſtrict friendſhip, and good diſpoſition, which, from the beginning, had been wiſely cultivated and eſtabliſhed by the Proprietary and inhabitants, or firſt ſettlers, of the province, with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and, afterwards purſued in ſuch manner, as to leave no reaſonable cauſe for fears and ſuſpicions between them; yet, as in all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries wickedly diſpoſed perſons are found, whoſe delight is, if poſſible, to diſturb the public tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity; ſo we find, in the infancy of this colony, when juſtice, peace and harmony ſo univerſally predominated, it was poſſible, nevertheleſs, for idle reports, and vain rumours to take place, and gain ſo far on unguarded minds, as to create very alarming apprehenſions, reſpecting the <hi>Indians;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian alarm.</note>— the conſideration of their large numbers, at that time, in proportion to the fewneſs of the <hi>European</hi> ſettlers, rather favouring ſuch apprehenſions; of which we have the following inſtance.</p>
               <p>In, or about, the year 1688, the inhabitants of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and places adjacent, were alarmed
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:032729_0336_0FF4F32F1C7C34B0"/>
with the report of an intended inſurrection of the <hi>Indians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An Indian alarm, &amp;c.</note> to cut off all the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> on a certain appointed day. This was communicated by two <hi>Indian</hi> women of <hi>Weſt-Jerſey,</hi> to an old <hi>Dutch</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant, near <hi>Cheſter,</hi> to be on the next fourth day of the week. Several <hi>Friends</hi> or <hi>Quakers,</hi> upon hearing this report, being conſcious of their juſt conduct towards the <hi>Indians,</hi> and ſenſible of nothing that could reaſonably diſguſt them, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to appeaſe the people's fears. The ſaid fourth day being come, about ten o'clock, in the night, a meſſenger arrived at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> out of the woods, and told the people, that three families, about nine miles diſtant, which he named, were all cut off by the <hi>Indians.</hi>—This report coming to a <hi>Friend,</hi> then at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> about midnight he took with him two young men, on horſeback, to the place, in order to examine into the truth of the affair.—They found the three houſes, but no body in them, and yet no ſigns of murder;—their inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, alarmed in a ſimilar manner, had fled to the houſes of their parents, at <hi>Ridley</hi> creek, about a mile from thence. The maſter of one of theſe families, being from home, had been informed five hundred <hi>Indians</hi> were actually collected at <hi>Naaman's</hi> creek, in purſuit of their deſign, to kill the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and as he was haſtening to his houſe, he thought he heard his boy crying out, and ſaying, <hi>"What ſhall I do, my Dame is killed!</hi> Upon which, inſtead of going home, to know the certainty of the affair, he ran off, to acquaint the government, at <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> but being met by a perſon of more prudence than himſelf, before he got to the city, he was perſwaded by him to return.—</p>
               <p>The report notwithſtanding ſoon arrived at the city; and was told with ſuch alarming circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that a meſſenger was immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to <hi>Marcus Hook,</hi> near the ſaid <hi>Naaman's</hi> creek to enquire the truth of it. He quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:032729_0337_0FF4F2E276B474A0"/>
and confirmed the report, but with this variation; that it was at <hi>Brandywine</hi> creek,<note place="margin">An Indian alarm, &amp;c.</note> at an <hi>Indian</hi> town, where the five hundred <hi>Indians</hi> were aſſembled; and, that they, having a lame king, had carried him away, with all their women and children. Theſe circumſtances rendered the affair ſtill more alarming, and, with many, amounted to a certainty.</p>
               <p>The Council were, at that time, ſitting at <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia</hi> on other affairs, when one of them, a <hi>Friend,</hi> ſuppoſed to be <hi>Caleb Puſey,</hi>

He lived in <hi>Cheſter</hi> county; and died in the Twelfth month, 1725, in the 76th. year of his age.</note> who lived in <hi>Cheſter</hi> county, voluntarily offered himſelf to go to the place, provided they would name five others to accompany him, without weapons; which being ſoon agreed on, they rode to the place; but, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of meeting with five hundred warriors, they found the <hi>old king</hi> quietly lying, with his lame foot along on the ground, and his head, at eaſe, on a kind of pillow, the women at work, in the field, and the children playing together.—</p>
               <p>When they had entered the <hi>wigwam,</hi> the king preſently aſked them very mildly, <hi>"What they all came for?"</hi> They told him the report, which the <hi>Indian</hi> women had raiſed; and aſked him, whether the <hi>Indians</hi> had any thing againſt the <hi>Engliſh?</hi> He appeared much diſpleaſed at the report and ſaid, "The women ought to be burnt to death; and that they had nothing againſt the <hi>Engliſh;"</hi>—ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, "'Tis true there are about fifteen pounds yet

               <p>One of the company further expreſſed himſelf to the <hi>Indian</hi> king, in the following manner; "That the great God, who made the world, and all things therein, conſequently made all mankind, both Indians and Engliſh; and as he made all, ſo his love was extended to all; which, was plainly ſhewn, by his cauſing the <hi>rain</hi> and <hi>dews</hi> to fall on the ground of both <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> alike; that it might equally produce what the <hi>Indians,</hi> as well as what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſowed or planted in it, for the ſuſtenance of life; and alſo by his making the ſun to ſhine equally on all, both <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to nouriſh them; and that ſeeing the great <hi>Being,</hi> which made them all, extended his love thus to all, ſo they were mutually bound to love one another."—</p>

I do earneſtly preſs your conſtant attendance upon the government, and the diligent purſuit of peace and virtue; and God Almighty ſtrengthen your hands, in ſo good a work. I alſo recommend to you the particular diſcipline of that town you meet in: that ſobriety and gravity be maintained, and authority kept in reſpect.—As it comes in your way, countenance my officers in collecting my ſmall revenue.— Let the laws, you paſs, hold ſo long only as I ſhall not declare my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; that ſo my ſhare may not lye excluded, or finally concluded, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my notice; in ſine, let them be confirmable by me, as you will ſee by the commiſſion I left, when I left the province.—And if you deſire a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty Governor, rather name three, or five, and I ſhall name one of them;— ſo as you conſider of a comfortable ſubſiſtence; that the government may not go a begging.—I do not do this, to lye a binding precedent, but to give you, and the people you repreſent. the fulleſt pledges I am able, at this diſtance, of my regard to them. Whatever you do, I deſire, beſeech and charge you all to avoid factions and parties, whiſperings and report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and all animoſities; that, putting your common ſhoulders to the public work, you may have the reward of good men and patriots; and ſo I bid you heartily farewell.</p>

What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the morals of the lower counties are, it was embraced as a mercy, that we got and united them to the province; and a great charter ties them; and this particular ambition has broken it; for the ſtriving can ariſe from nothing elſe; and what is that ſpirit that would ſooner divide the child, than let things run in their own channel, but that which ſacrifices all bowels to wilfulneſs! Had they learned what this means, <hi>I will have mercy, and not ſacrifice,</hi> there had been no breaches nor animoſities there till I had come, at leaſt.

               </argument>
               <p>IN the year 1691, an affair happened among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in this part of the world,<note place="margin">The ſchiſm of George Keith, &amp;c.</note> which gave them much uneaſineſs and trouble, in their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous capacity, more eſpecially in this Province, and the neighbouring places. This was the difference and ſeparation between them and <hi>George Keith,</hi> before mentioned. He had been an eminent preacher and writer among them, for many years; and had publiſhed ſeveral well-written treatiſes, in defence of their religious principles, yet extant. He was a man of quick natural parts, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable literary abilities; acute in argument, and very ready and able in logical diſputations, and nice diſtinctions, on theological ſubjects; but, ſaid to be, of a brittle temper, and over-bearing diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of mind; not ſufficiently tempered and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified with that Chriſtian moderation and charity, which give command over the human paſſions; the diſtinguiſhing characteriſtic of true Chriſtianity: of which he himſelf had not only made high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but alſo, in his younger years, as appears
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:032729_0364_0FF4F3BAEC6E38C8"/>
by his writings, had a good underſtanding. His great confidence in his own ſuperior abilities ſeems to have been one,<note place="margin">G. Keith's ſchiſm, &amp;c.</note> if not the chief, introductory cauſe of this unhappy diſpute;—When men ſet too high a value on themſelves, and others will not come up to their price, then they are diſcontented. He is ſaid to have had too much life in argument and diſputation, on religious points of controverſy, and ſometimes to have exhibited an unbecoming vanity on victory thereby obtained over his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, even, prior to the ſchiſm between him and his friends: for having, ſome time before, been on a viſit to <hi>New England,</hi> he is repreſented as having indulged his natural propenſity this way, among the preachers and inhabitants there, in a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant manner: Which diſpoſition of mind, from that time forward, appeared to have ſo far got the aſcendancy over him, that, on his return, he began to exhibit the ſame, even, among his friends, beginning with finding fault, propoſing and urging new regulations, in the ſociety, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the diſcipline of it, and complaining, <hi>"There was too great a ſlackneſs therein."</hi>—Upon his friends not readily joining with him and his propoſals, in the manner he expected, he became ſtill more captious, and more diſpoſed to ſeek mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of reproach and offence againſt divers in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and to make the worſt of them; charging ſome of his friends,<note place="margin">His allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Quakers</note> who were generally well eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed and approved miniſters, with preaching falſe doctrine; and, it is ſaid, even, in points con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what himſelf had formerly held and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, in his writings, in defence of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and their principles. He found fault with his friends being in the magiſtracy, and their execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the penal laws againſt malefactors, as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with their religious profeſſion; and, in ſhort, contended that he and ſuch as joined with him, were the true <hi>Quakers,</hi> and all the reſt, who oppoſed him, were apoſtates.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="unknown:032729_0365_0FF4F4FC6642EC00"/>Theſe were the principal allegations, which, in beginning of the diſpute, he appears to have made againſt the <hi>Quakers.</hi> The principal things,<note place="margin">Their charges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</note> if not the whole, with which I find him charged by them, at that time, appear to be his over-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing temper, and unchriſtian diſpoſition of mind, in groſsly vilifying and diſparaging divers members of the ſociety, who were univerſally and highly approved among them, and entirely rejecting their advice and judgment, in the affair; the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of an overheated and intemperate zeal: which, at laſt, proceeded ſo far as to occaſion ſuch a breach, that,<note place="margin">He is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned, &amp;c. in 1692.</note> on the 20th. day of the Fourth-month, 1692, <hi>a declaration, or teſtimony of denial,</hi> was drawn up againſt him, at a meeting of the miniſters of the ſociety at <hi>Philadelphia:</hi> wherein both he and his conduct were publicly diſowned by them.</p>
               <p>This <hi>declaration,</hi> which was confirmed at the next following <hi>General Yearly Meeting,</hi> held at <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington,</hi> the ſeventh of the Seventh-month, exhibits more fully the charges againſt him, and may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther elucidate the caſe to the more inquiſitive: Which <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> as it may, probably, be curious to ſome, if not inſtructive, is, therefore, placed in the notes.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                           <p>IN tender love, and with ſpirits bowed down before the Lord, is this our ſalutation unto you; earneſtly deſiring your growth, and daily preſervation, in the ancient truth, and in the ſimplicity of the goſpel of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and our hope and breathings are, that no inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, or wiles, of the enemy ſhall prevail, to turn you aſide from your ſteadfaſtneſs, or cauſe you to eſteem lightly of the rock and way of God's ſalvation unto you, but that you may be kept in the light and life, which was, and is, the juſt man's path, to the end of our days, Amen!</p>
                           <p>Now, dear Friends, it is with ſorrow of ſpirits and grief of ſouls, that we ſignify unto you the tedious exerciſe, and vexatious perplexity, we have met with, in our late friend, <hi>George Keith,</hi> for ſeveral months paſt. With mourning and lamentation do we ſay, How is this mighty man fallen! How is his ſhield caſt away, as though he had not known the oil of the holy Ointment! How ſhall it be told in <hi>Gath,</hi> and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſtreets of <hi>Aſkalon!</hi> Will not the daughters of the uncircumciſed triumph, when they hear that he is fallen upon the ſoaring mountains, and from the high places of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> While thou walkedſt in the counſel of God, and wert little in thy own eyes, thy bow did abide in ſtrength; thy ſword returned not empty from the fat of the enemies of God—thy bow returned not back. His enemies were then vile unto thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his followers honourable in thy eſteem. Oh, how lovely wert thou, in that day, when his beauty was upon thee; and when his comelineſs covered thee! Why ſhould his ornaments exalt thee, which were given to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee before him? And how art thou fallen from thy <hi>firſt love,</hi> and art become <hi>treacherous to the ſpouſe of thy youth.</hi> Conſider where thou art fallen, and repent, and do thy <hi>firſt works</hi>

And when ſome in Chriſtian duty, have laid before him his unſavory words, and abuſive language, as a perſon of common civility would loath, it hath been too frequent with him, and that, in a tranſport of heat and paſſion, to call ſome of his brethren, in the miniſtry, and other elders, and that upon ſmall provocations, (if any) <hi>Fools, ignorant Heathens, Infidels, ſilly Souls, Lyers, Heretics, rotten Ran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And further, his anger and envy being cruel againſt us, and not content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with his harſhneſs againſt perſons, he proceeded, in bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, to charge our meetings with being come together to cloak hereſy and deceit; and publiſhing openly ſeveral times, that there were more doctrines of devils, and damnable hereſies, among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> than in any profeſſion among the Proteſtants. He hath long objected againſt our <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> even, ſoon after his coming among us, and having prepared a draught of his own, and the ſame not finding the expected reception, he ſeemed diſguſted. Since he hath often quarrelled with us about <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> declaring, <hi>"That he knew none given forth by the body of Friends, to his ſatisfaction;"</hi> and often charged moſt of us with being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound in the faith. We have offered, in ſeveral meetings, for his ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and to prevent ſtrife among us, and for preſerving the peace of the church, to deliver a <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of our Chriſtian faith, in the words of our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Author of our Chriſtian faith, and in the words of the Apoſtles and Diſciples, his faithful followers; or we would concur, and agree upon a <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> and have it tranſmitted for approbation of the Yearly Meeting here, or the Yearly Meeting in <hi>London;</hi> yet, it was offered unto him, at the ſame time, that a <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> concerning the main matters of controverſy, ſhould be given out of a book of his own; but all was ſlighted, as inſufficient. The Lord knows the trouble, which we have had with this unruly member; and the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our hearts, and well-wiſhes towards him, notwithſtanding his rage and violence againſt us; and of the endeavours of many in this place, to have gained upon him by a friendly converſe, and by other means, not inconſiderable to a brotherly freedom; but our labour hitherto ſeems to be as water ſpilt upon a rock. And this meeting, having orderly and tenderly dealt with him, for his abuſive language, and diſorderly behaviour, he hath not only ſlighted all applications of gaining him to a ſenſe of his ill-treatment and miſcarriages, but, in an inſulting manner, ſaid to the friends appointed by the meeting, to admoniſh him, <hi>"That be trampled the judgment of the Meeting under his feet, as dirt."</hi> And hath, of late, ſet up a ſeparate meeting here; where he hath, like an open oppoſer, not only reviled ſeveral friends, by expoſing their religious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, in mixt auditories of ſome hundreds, endeavouring to render them and friends here, by the preſs and otherwiſe, a ſcorn to the profane, and the ſong of the drunkard; but he hath traduced and vilified our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy travelling friends, <hi>James Dickinſon</hi> and <hi>Thomas Wilſon,</hi> in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and ſavory <hi>miniſtry,</hi> whoſe ſervice is not only here, but, in moſt meetings in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> well known to have a ſeal in the hearts of many thouſands of the <hi>Iſrael of God.</hi> He hath alſo within a few weeks, appeared in oppoſition, as it were, to the body of Friends, by putting on his hat, when our well-received and recommended friend, <hi>James Dickinſon,</hi> was at prayer; and that, in a meeting of near a thouſand Friends and others; and ſo going out of the meeting, to the great diſquiet thereof, and to the drawing ſome ſcores into the ſame oppoſition with him, by his ill example. And he thus perſiſting in his repeated oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hard ſpeeches, and continued ſeparation, and labouring like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearyed adverſary, to widen the breach, made by him, and ſo, abuſing ſome of the neighbouring meetings, by being, as yet, under that cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of being owned by us; we are hereby brought under a religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, and to prevent other meetings from being further injured by him, to give forth this <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> ſtrained, as it were, from us, by his many and violent provocations, <hi>viz.</hi> That we cannot own him, in ſuch ungodly ſpeeches, and diſorderly behaviour, or, in his ſeparate meetings; and that we diſown the ſame, as proceeding from a wrong ſpirit, which brings into diſorder inwardly, and leads into diſtraction and confuſion outwardly. And, until he condemn and decline the ſame, we cannot receive him, in his public miniſtry, and would have him ceaſe to offer his gift, as ſuch, among us, or elſewhere among Friends, till he be reconciled to his offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed brethren. And as thoſe few of our brethren, in the gift of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, who are gone out with <hi>George Keith,</hi> into his uncharitable and divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit, (the miſerable effects whereof many of us have ſufficiently known, in <hi>Old England,</hi> and other parts) our judgment is, that, while they continue ſuch, they become unqualified to the work of the Goſpel, as degenerating from the guidance of God's bleſſed and peaceable ſpirit; in their hearts, (from whence proceeds the effectual New Teſtament mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry) and being turned from the peaceable fruits thereof, are gone to un-charity and contention.</p>
                           <p>And now, all you, who have walked in fellowſhip and communion with us, and are drawn aſide, through inconſideration, or otherwiſe, into the ſpirit of ſeparation and prejudice againſt our meetings, orderly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; and wherein we have often been mutually refreſhed together; we cannot but, in the fear of God, and in love to your ſouls, admoniſh you alſo of the inſecurity of your preſent ſtate, and that, therein we cannot have unity with you; and unleſs you return from under that ſpirit, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and barrenneſs from the Lord, will be your reward.</p>
                           <p>And ſo, dear Friends, we exhort you all to behave your ſelves, in the ſpirit of meekneſs, and pea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It doth not appear that either the Proprietary,<note place="margin">The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment &amp; privileges of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania not forfeited.</note> or the people of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> had forfeited thoſe rights and privileges, whoſe enjoyment had been the compact of their ſettlement of the province; of which privileges, thoſe which reſpected their religious, or conſcientious ſcruples were the chief; but the contrary rather is manifeſt: For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what was alledged for depriving the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary of the government, it was well known that the ſuſpicion of his adhering too much to King <hi>James</hi> was the principal, if not the only, cauſe for rendering him incapable of attending ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to it, as it ſeemed at that time to require: But nothing was ever proved, to confirm what was alledged againſt him, in that reſpect; though it injured him ſo far, as to oblige him, for a time, to be in ſecret, and to be abſent too long from his province; whereby ſome diſorders happened in it, that in all probability, would otherwiſe have been prevented; but none of ſuch magnitude, as to violate, or prevent, the regular adminiſtration of juſtice, as ſeems to have been alledged by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the proſperity of the province; much leſs to give juſt occaſion for depriving the coloniſts of

their dearly bought rights and privileges, granted by charter, confirmed by laws, and familiarized by cuſtom; though it might be called a favour, to enjoy them, where power alone has the rule, without having any regard to juſtice: For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Governor was changed, yet it was preſumed the government, or conſtitution, was not, in conſequence thereof, to be violated, or altered, and that the inhabitants of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> had as juſt a right to be governed <hi>according to the uſage of Pennſylvania,</hi> and their own laws, then in force,<note place="margin">Vide Flet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, &amp;c. page 378.</note> as thoſe of <hi>New-York had to be governed according to the uſage of that province,</hi> though their uſages were different, ſo long as juſtice was equally well adminiſtered by the former, as by the latter, and in a manner more agreeable to them.</p>
               <p>The Aſſembly, however, in conſideration of the preſent circumſtances of affairs, thought it moſt prudent to ſubmit, though not conſiſtent with a privilege, to which, in their apprehenſion, they had a right, and below the juſtice of their claim; and, for the preſent, acknowledged the ſame, as <hi>an act of grace and ſavour,</hi> proceeding from the <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>kindneſs</hi> of the Governor.</p>

                           <p>WE, the ſaid people, do ſolemnly and ſincerely declare, That it hath been our judgment and principle, from the firſt day we were called to profeſs the light of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> manifeſted in our conſciences, unto this day, that the ſetting up and putting down kings and governments is God's peculiar prerogative, for cauſes beſt known to himſelf; and that it is not our work, or buſineſs, to have any hand, or contrivance therein, nor to be buſy-bodies, in matters above our ſtation; much leſs to plot, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive the ruin, or overturn, of any of them: But to pray for the king, and for the ſafety of our nation, and good of all men, that we may live a peaceable and quiet life, in all godlineſs and honeſty, under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he is pleaſed to ſet over us.</p>
                           <p>And, according to this our <hi>ancient and innocent principle,</hi> we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten given forth our teſtimony, and now do, againſt all plotting, conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, and contriving inſurrections againſt the King, or the government, and againſt all treacherous, barbarous and murderous deſigns whatſoever, as works of the devil and darkneſs; and we ſincerely bleſs God, and are heartily thankful to the king and government, for the liberty and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges we enjoy under them, by law, eſteeming it our duty to be true and faithful to them.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>And whereas,</hi> we, the ſaid people, are required to ſign the ſaid aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation, we ſincerely declare, that our refuſing ſo to do, is not out of any diſaffection to the King, or Government, nor in oppoſition to his being declared rightful and lawful King of theſe realms, but purely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot, for conſcience' ſake, ſight, kill, or revenge, either for ourſelves, or any man elſe.</p>

<pb n="410" facs="unknown:032729_0410_0FF4F46B4E74AF00"/>
wherefore, the ſaid King, favouring the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and good purpoſe of the ſaid <hi>William Penn,</hi> did,<note place="margin">The Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance.</note> in and by the ſaid charter, for him, his heirs and ſucceſſors, give and grant unto the ſaid <hi>William Penn,</hi> his heirs and aſſigns, all this ſaid country, and tract of land, called <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted him, the ſaid <hi>William Penn,</hi> abſolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor thereof, veſting him, and ſuch as were to be adventurers with him, the ſettlers and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of ſaid province, with divers powers, privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and immunities, under the reſervations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſos and reſtrictions, in the ſaid charter ſpecified; charging all officers, &amp;c. to be, at all times aiding and aſſiſting to the ſaid <hi>William Penn,</hi> and unto the ſaid inhabitants and merchants of the ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, in the full uſe and fruition of the benefits of the ſaid charter.</p>

                  <p>As to the former, it is evident, that they are the effects of the envy and emulation of thoſe, who, by ſuch unfair and indirect means, would accompliſh their deſigns againſt this government: For that we are ſatisfied the generality of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, merchants and traders of this province and territories, are innocent and clear of thoſe impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
<pb n="418" facs="unknown:032729_0418_0FF4F38D92A740D8"/>
And this country ſo poſited, <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi> is become the road,<note place="margin">A Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> where ſailors and others do frequently paſs and repaſs between <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>New England,</hi> ſo that it cannot be avoided, but the bad, as well as the good, will be entertained, in ſuch an intercourſe; and ſince common charity obliges us not to preſume any perſons guilty (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of ſuch great enormities) till by ſome legal probability, they appear ſo to be; and though we find that the Magiſtrates and people, in general, are, and have been, ready and, perhaps, more active and conſcientious to ſerve the King and his officers, againſt all unlawful trade and piracy, when any ſuch offences have, by any means, come to their knowledge, than any of thoſe neighbouring colonies, who have been ſo querimonious againſt us, in that behalf; yet, we can do no leſs than, purſuant to our Proprietary's commands, put all in mind of their reſpective duties; that there be no juſt cauſe for ſuch complaints.</p>
                  <p>And, as concerning vice, we alſo find, that the Magiſtrates have been careful and diligent to ſuppreſs it; but their endeavours have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ineffectual therein; by reaſon, that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, or drinking houſes, eſpecially in <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> grow too numerous, and the keepers thereof diſorderly, and regardleſs of the tenor and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of their licenſes, whereby they prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to the Governor, and a reproach to the government.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore,</hi> theſe are ſtrictly to charge and command all Magiſtrates and officers whatſoever, within the province and territories, as they regard the honour of God, and their allegiance to the King, faithfully to put in execution all the acts, or laws of trade and navigation, and alſo the laws and ſtatutes extant againſt piracy, whenever there is any ſuch occaſion; and to uſe their utmoſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and care in preventing, ſuppreſſing and

                  <p>And we further ſtrictly charge and command all perſons, within this government, as they will anſwer the contrary at their peril, that they give due aſſiſtance to the Magiſtrates and officers afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, in putting the ſaid laws in execution, and ſuppreſſing vice, that the wrath of God, and the King's diſpleaſure may not be drawn upon this poor country.</p>

               <p>At the ſame time he likewiſe informed them, "That now,<note place="margin">Extract from the Minutes of Council.</note> this was like to be his laſt interview with them, at leaſt before his return;—That he had always loved and been kind to them; and ever ſhould continue ſo to be, not through any politic deſign, or, on account of ſelf intereſt, but from a moſt real affection:"—"And he deſired them, in his abſence, to cultivate friendſhip with thoſe, whom he ſhould leave behind in authority; as they would always, in ſome degree, continue to be ſo to them, as himſelf had ever been;—Laſtly, That he had charged the members of Council, and then alſo renewed the ſame charge, that they ſhould, in all reſpects, be kind to them, and entertain them with all courteſy and demonſtrations of good-will, as himſelf had ever done: which the ſaid members promiſed faithfully to obſerve;—then, after mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſome preſents, they withdrew."</p>

The territory men were ſaid to have been for obtaining ſome excluſive powers, or rights, particular to themſelves, which, being
<pb n="441" facs="unknown:032729_0441_0FF4F4F94793A6C8"/>
thought unreaſonable, could not, therefore, be granted them; and not being able to carry their point, on the 10th. inſtant,<note place="margin">Diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Province &amp; Territories.</note> the members for the territories abruptly left the Houſe; declaring their intention of returning to their reſpective homes. But, on the 14th. moſt of them appeared before the Proprietary, in Council, remonſtrating againſt ſome proceedings of the Aſſembly, on the 10th. inſtant, which, they declared, were, in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, highly injurious and deſtructive to the privileges of the <hi>lower counties,</hi> and which, conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with their duty to their conſtituents, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, they could not ſit there, to ſee carried on; and, therefore, they informed the Governor, they thought it beſt for them to depart to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective habitations:—</p>
               <p>The Proprietary further enquired into the affair and both heard and anſwered all their reaſons and objections; and then told them, "That he took this their conduct very unkind, even to himſelf in particular."</p>
               <p>Upon which <hi>Jaſper Yeates,</hi> in behalf of the reſt, endeavoured to excuſe, or further explain, their behaviour, in this action, by declaring their great affection and regard for the Proprietary, but, that they muſt be true to thoſe, whom they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.—</p>
               <p>At another meeting of the Proprietary and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Council, on the ſame day, the Aſſembly being ſent for, both thoſe for the province, and the ſecluding members appeared;</p>
               <p>The Proprietary told them, "That his time being ſhort, he muſt come briefly to the point; that it was no ſmall wound to him, to think, that at the <hi>earneſt deſire</hi> of the <hi>lower counties,</hi> as well as the <hi>good-will</hi> of the <hi>upper,</hi> he had engaged in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, which coſt him, at leaſt, two or three thouſand pounds, to unite them, and yet, that they ſhould now endanger that union, and divide, after

               </p>
               <p>The territory members objected, that they were great ſufferers by that act of union, however it was, at firſt, intended; and could not ſupport the burden of the charge.</p>
               <p>The Proprietary replied, "They were free to break off, and might act diſtinctly by themſelves;" at which they ſeemed pleaſed, and expreſſed their ſatisfaction; "But then," continued the Proprietary, "it muſt be upon amicable terms, and a good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;—That they muſt firſt <hi>reſolve</hi> to ſettle the laws;—and that, as the intereſt of the <hi>province,</hi> and that of thoſe <hi>lower counties</hi> would be inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the ſame, they ſhould both uſe a conduct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with that relation," &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>Thomas Chalkley,</hi> with his wife and family, removed from <hi>England,</hi> in the year 1701, into <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> where he ſettled and reſided, during the remainder of his life; which was upwards of forty years; excepting that part of it, in which the neceſſary affairs of trade and buſineſs took him abroad, in a ſea-faring way, &amp;c. but more eſpecially in the diſcharge of what he believed to be his duty, as a miniſter of the goſpel; which, it is left on record, was his principal and moſt delightful employment: This he is ſaid to have performed through many deep trials and exerciſes, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ways, in different parts of the world, with good ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>He was a perſon much beloved and highly eſteemed by a very numerous acquaintance; in that he had many virtues, and theſe of the more amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kind: he is ſaid to have been of a meek and quiet ſpirit, and to have had an engaging ſweetneſs, both in his miniſtry and converſation. He died in the iſland of <hi>Tortola,</hi> in America, in the year 1741, when on a religious viſit there, in the ſervice of preaching the goſpel.—Though he had not the advantage of what is called a literary education, or of much learning, yet he leſt behind him ſome printed works on religious ſubjects, and a journal of his life, (from which the above account is extracted) written in a plain and ſimple, yet very eaſy and engaging ſtile; which were an acceptable legacy to many lovers of his memory.</p>
                  </note> The <hi>Indians,</hi> who conſiſted chiefly of <hi>Senecas</hi> and <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> received them with great kindneſs: they were much affected by their viſit,<note place="margin">Queen Ojuncho.</note> more eſpecially a certain woman of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence among them, who appeared to have autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſpoke much in their Councils; the reaſon for which was, when the <hi>Indians</hi> were aſked, one of them replied, "Becauſe ſome women are wiſer

than ſome men, and that ſhe was an Empreſs among them;"—She told <hi>Thomas Chalkley,</hi> and the other friends,<note place="margin">Queen Ojuncho.</note> that ſhe looked upon their coming to be more than natural; becauſe they did not come to buy nor ſell, nor yet gain, but in love and reſpect to them, and deſired their welfare both here and hereafter.—She related to them a dream, which ſhe had three days before; which, being interpreted was, "That ſhe was in <hi>London,</hi> and that <hi>London</hi> was the fineſt place ſhe ever ſaw, (it was like <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia,</hi> but much larger) and ſhe went acroſs ſix ſtreets, and in the ſeventh ſhe ſaw <hi>William Penn</hi> preaching to the people; which was a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and both ſhe and <hi>William Penn</hi> rejoiced to ſee each other, after the meeting ſhe went to him, and he told her, that in a little time, he would come over and preach to them alſo; of which ſhe was very glad: and now, ſhe ſaid, her dream was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled; for one of his friends was come to preach to them." And ſhe adviſed the <hi>Indians</hi> to hear and treat the friends kindly; which they accordingly did.—</p>
               <p>This one inſtance, among many, which might he given, is here mentioned, to ſhew the love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, theſe people had for the memory of <hi>William Penn;</hi> as the conſequence of his juſt and kind treatment of them; and the ſenſe which they had of his regard for their real good, and true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>

               <p>GOVERNOR EVANS appears to have been an active young man,<note place="margin">1705.</note> of a temper ſcarcely indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to any thing,<note place="margin">Gov.

His warm zeal to puſh his own views, in ſome things, contrary to thoſe of the Aſſembly, tended to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch extreme oppoſition and diſlike between them, as were ſcarcely warrantable, and might have had fatal effects; the natural conſequence of men's tempers being too much agitated and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; beſides the liberties of his private life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct are repreſented to have been ſuch as rendered him offenſive to a ſober and religious people. He
<pb n="468" facs="unknown:032729_0468_0FF4F5531908D810"/>
was moreover ſaid to want neither ingenuity nor abilities, ſo much as a proper application of them; for which years and experience are ſo generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite. But his diſappointment, on his firſt arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, in not being able to prevail on the Aſſembly of the province to admit of a re-union with that of the territories, which he had ſo much ſet his mind upon, with the nature of certain following pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the former, appear to have occaſioned his imprudently joining with the Aſſembly of the latter,<note place="margin">He joins with the Aſſembly of the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</note> in ſome acts, which ſeemed more calculated to incommode the province, than for any real uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to either; from which kind of conduct it could not be reaſonably ſuppoſed any good underſtanding could ariſe, or be long cheriſhed, between them.</p>
               <p>The Governor had endeavoured to form a militia through the government, but ſo far as appears, and which could not be reaſonably expected other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, not with much ſucceſs. He knew the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers'</hi> principles were againſt bearing arms and war, yet, as the inexperience and aſſuming of youth, as well as the prejudice of more advanced years, is ſometimes ready to regard a contrariety of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in others, more eſpecially if it differ much from the common opinion, in the higheſt point of abſurdity, without duly examining into the merits of it;<note place="margin">He treats the Quakers principles againſt war, as abſurd.</note> ſo Governor <hi>Evans,</hi> by part of his conduct, appears to have regarded and treated the principles of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in reſpect to <hi>ſelf defence,</hi> as a mere notion, which would never endure a ſerious trial; and by the following imprudent ſcheme and experiment, inſtead of anſwering any uſeful inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the public, he is ſaid not only to have alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the <hi>Quakers</hi> further from him, but alſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſguſted ſuch of the people in general, as were not concerned in the contrivance, or execution of it.</p>
               <p>Governor <hi>Evans,</hi> in conjunction with <hi>Robert French</hi> of <hi>Newcaſtle, Thomas Clark,</hi> an attorney at

               <p>It was at the time of the fair in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> on the 16th. day of the Third-month, O. S. 1706, when this plot was put in execution; <hi>French</hi> acted at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> by ſending up a meſſenger to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> in the greateſt haſte, and apparent conſternation, to acquaint him, that a number of veſſels were then actually in the river, and as high up as a place, which he named. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this news immediately the Governor acted his part; and, by his emiſſaries, made it fly through the city; while himſelf with a drawn ſword in his hand, on horſeback, rode through the ſtreets, in ſeeming great commotion, and a behaviour adapted to the nature of the occaſion, commanded and entreated people of all ranks to be properly aſſiſting on the emergency, &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>There were two noted <hi>falſe alarms</hi> formerly, in the province. The former was that of the <hi>Indians,</hi> in 1688.

               <p>
                  <hi>James Logan,</hi> the Secretary, though he was one of the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> was accuſed or ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of being privy to the affair. He denied the
<pb n="471" facs="unknown:032729_0471_0FF4F520474C0AC0"/>
charge; but endeavoured to palliate the action, and excuſe the Governor; which rendered him the more ſuſpected. The deſign,<note place="margin">Account of the falſe alarm, &amp;c.</note> though it had ſuch a conſiderable effect, turned out entirely contrary to the expectation of the authors and promoters of it; for the people were ſoon undeceived; and when they ſaw how groſsly they had been impoſed upon, many of them ſo highly reſented the uſage, that the authors and promoters thereof were now obliged to conſult their own ſafety from the fury of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged populace.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> it is ſaid the principal part of them were attending their religious meeting as uſual, on that day of the week, even in the midſt of the confuſion; and, as if they were aware of the deſign, in general, behaved themſelves ſo far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently, that only four perſons, who had any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to be accounted of that ſociety, appeared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der arms, at the place of rendezvous, appointed on the occaſion.</p>
               <p>With this action, whereby the Governor render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf odious to the generality of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> may be mentioned the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; by which he incurred, in a particular manner, the diſpleaſure of the trading part of the province.</p>
               <p>Soon after the Aſſembly of the territories had met in legiſlation, independent of the province,<note place="margin">Of the fort and exac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at Newcaſtle, &amp;c.</note> Governor <hi>Evans</hi> propoſed to them the building a fort at <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> upon which a law was paſſed there, entitled, <hi>"An act for erecting and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fort, for her Majeſty's ſervice, at the town of Newcaſtle upon Delaware."</hi> This law impoſed a duty of half a pound of <hi>Gun-powder,</hi> for every ton, that all veſſels whatever, coming from the ſea up the river, ſhould meaſure by the carpenters rule, whoſe major part was not owned by perſons reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the river and bay of <hi>Delaware;</hi> (except ſhips of war) and by it all veſſels, both inward and outward, were obliged to ſtop, drop anchor, and
<pb n="472" facs="unknown:032729_0472_0FF4F5614EA19B00"/>
the commander to go on ſhore, make report, and have leave to paſs; from the commanding officer of the ſaid fort,<note place="margin">Of the fort and exac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at Newcaſtle, &amp;c.</note> under penalty of paying five pounds, beſides twenty ſhillings for the firſt gun, thirty for the ſecond, and forty for every gun afterwards, that ſhould be fired on the occaſion, in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, beſides the forfeiture of five pounds, for contempt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This law was conſidered as a manifeſt infraction of the privileges granted by the royal charter to the ſettlers and inhabitants of <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> and ſtill more ſo, from the manner in which it was put in execution; for they had legally an undoubted right to the free uſe of the river and bay, without any interruption, obſtruction or impoſition from any quarter whatever; and the violent means which conſequently became neceſſary to enforce a law upon ſuch a defective foundation, and not even counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by the law itſelf, ſoon became a great nui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, and an intolerable grievance to the trading part of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and others concerned in its commerce.—Beſides, it was alledged, that the fort itſelf, as it was ſituated and circumſtanced, had it been under better management and more warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able direction, could not poſſibly be much ſecurity to the river, nor protection to the veſſels that might happen to be chaſed, or aſſaulted in it.</p>
               <p>The city of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> was much concerned at theſe proceedings, and the trading part thereof were highly incenſed at this invaſion of their juſt liberties; accordingly endeavours were uſed to have the affair properly redreſſed, but without ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>At length <hi>Richard Hill,</hi> one of the Governor's Council, a bold man, and of conſiderable abilities and influence in the province, together with <hi>Iſaac Norris</hi> and <hi>Samuel Preſton,</hi> all <hi>Quakers,</hi> and men of the firſt rank and eſteem, was determined to try

                     <p>His ſervices, in the religious ſociety of his friends, the <hi>Quakers,</hi> of which he was, for many years, an active member, are ſaid likewiſe to have been very conſiderable He had by nature and acquiſition ſuch a conſtant firmneſs, as furniſhed him with undaunted reſolution, to execute what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he undertook. His ſound judgment, his great eſteem for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> conſtitution and laws, his tenderneſs for the liberty of the ſubject, and his zeal for preſerving the reputable order eſtabliſhed in his own religious community, with his great generoſity to proper objects, qualified him for the greateſt ſervices, in every ſtation in which he was engaged, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him of very great and uncommon value, in the place where he lived. He died in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> on the 9th. of September, 1729.</p>

                        <hi>Iſaac Norris,</hi> of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> held many public offices, with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pution and honour; and his ſervices, in the affairs of his own religious community, entitled him to very high and uncommon eſteem among his friends the <hi>Quakers;</hi> in which he was a principal perſon in good offices. He is ſaid to have been endowed with good natural abilities; which he improved and applied to the benefit of mankind, as a man truly ſenſible that one of the chief ends of man's exiſtence is to be uſeful and beneficent to the human race; which he ſhewed by his uniform conduct; and that to anſwer this end men are to be taken as they are, and their leſſer fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to be endured, where they cannot be amended; the utility of his great talents was manifeſted by a prudent and conſiſtent conduct, in which he ſo much the more effectually ſucceeded and excelled, and that agreeable to duty and a good conſcience, by conſtantly cheriſhing a temper and diſpoſition of mind, which overlooks or paſſes by the many diſlikes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencies and ungrateful things, in others, which are ſo commonly incident to mankind; ſo that, by preſerving through life, a chriſtian moderation, and an even hand, he was, on all occaſions, qualified to uſe and exert his abilities to more advantage: His example in this was noble and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, and his character, in moſt reſpects, ſo honourable among men, in general, and his conduct ſo univerſally beneficial, eſpecially to thoſe of his own religious community, that he was an ornament to his country and profeſſion, and his death a great loſs to both; which was in the year 1735, when he was Chief Juſtice of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>

                        <hi>Samuel Preſton,</hi> likewiſe of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> was, for a long time, one of the Governor's Council, and Treaſurer of the province of <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> which offices he diſcharged with much honor and fidelity. He was a man of great integrity to what he believed was his duty; his conduct in life, very inſtructive, and his practice a continual ſeries of good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. He was a perſon of ſuch remarkable benevolence, and open diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of mind, as rendered advice and reproof, from him, the more acceptable and ſerviceable; and being of a fair and clean character, good judgment, and ſuitable preſence of mind, his uſefulneſs, in that capacity, was the more extenſive and ſucceſsful. He was a very valuable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſociety, among his friends, the <hi>Quakers,</hi> undertaking and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming many difficult offices, and ſocial duties therein, with great chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, alacrity and utility; and was highly eſteemed by them, as an elder, who ruled well in his ſocial capacity, and was worthy of double honor.—He died in September, 1743 aged about eighty years.</p>

                           <p>THAT a petition of above two hundred and twenty of the merchants and other inhabitants of the ſaid province, but moſtly of the city of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> having been preſented to this Houſe, complaining of very great abuſes and oppreſſions, which ſome of the inhabitants of the county of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> have committed upon ſeveral of theſe petitioners, by colour of a certain ordinance, or act of Aſſembly, lately paſſed there by the ſaid Lieutenant Governor, and Repreſentatives of the freemen of the ſaid three lower counties, entitled <hi>"An act for erecting and maintaining a fort for her Majeſty's ſervice, at the town of Newcaſtle upon Delaware;"</hi> which act, as alſo the ſeveral affidavits, relating to the matter complained of, being read, we thought proper, in the firſt place, to conſider the royal charter of the late King Charles the ſecond, to the Proprietary, bearing date the fourth day of March, in the three and thirtieth year of his reign, whereby the free and undiſturbed uſe and continuance in, and paſſage unto, and out of, all the ports, harbours, bays, waters, rivers, iſles and inlents, belonging unto, or leading to, or from this country, with the other powers and liberties, mentioned in the ſaid petition, are granted to the Proprietary and inhabitants of this province, as the petitioners ſet forth; and we further obſerve, that by the ſaid charter, the Queen's liege people of this province are to be ſubject to no laws, but ſuch as are conſonant to reaſon, and as near as may be, agreeable to the laws, ſtatutes and rights of the kingdom of England.</p>
                           <p>In the next place we have inſpected the late Duke of <hi>York's</hi> deeds of feoffment to the Proprietary, for the ſaid three lower counties, as alſo the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond's grant to the Duke, for the ſame lands; and when we call to mind how the Repreſentatives of the lower counties broke off, and refuſed to proceed legiſlatively, in conjunction with the Repreſentatives of the province, under the Proprietary's adminiſtration; but how far they can be juſtified in making laws to raiſe money on the Queen's ſubjects in this government, we intend ſhall be further conſidered hereafter; in the mean time we ſhall inſiſt that the liberty of the free uſe, and paſſage to, and out of, the ports of this province, granted us by the above recited royal charter, is well warranted by the laws of <hi>England;</hi> and that no impoſition can, by any act, or ordinance, made at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> be laid upon any veſſel, bound to, or from, any port in this province, which doth not unload at ſome key, or place, within the ſaid lower counties; and we conceive, that upon a ſtrict examination of their ſaid act of Aſſembly, it will moſt evidently appear, that the veſſels not bound to, or out of, ſome port or place there, cannot legally be obliged to comply with the impoſitions of the ſaid act.</p>
                           <p>Therefore this houſe, having fully and maturely weighed the nature of the ſaid act, and the uſe that is, and has been made of it, found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged, in duty to the Queen, and juſtice to the people they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, to come to the following reſolutions, N.

                           <p>
                              <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it is the opinion of this Houſe, that, in caſe the maſter of the ſaid ſloop had been liable to pay either <hi>Powder-money,</hi> or other <hi>mulets,</hi> impoſed by the ſaid act, yet the forcing him out of the veſſel, and impriſoning him, when ſecurity was offered, for anſwering the ſuppoſed offence, is not warranted by the ſaid act, but is moſt illegal and arbitrary.</p>
                           <p>We, having thus preſented our opinion of the ſaid act, entreat, that thou wouldſt uſe the moſt effectual methods to put a ſpeedy ſtop to the ſaid exorbitant practices, great abuſes and oppreſſions, mentioned in the ſaid petition (a copy whereof we humbly lay before thee;) and that the authors of theſe arbitrary actions and oppreſſions complained of, may be proſecuted according to law, and be no longer permitted to abuſe the Queen's authority, and ſtand in open defiance of her royal <hi>Uncle's</hi> grant, obſtruct our lawful commerce, and invade our liberties, rights and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and under the pretence of fortifying the river, for the ſervice of the Queen, commit hoſtilities and depredations upon her liege people.</p>
