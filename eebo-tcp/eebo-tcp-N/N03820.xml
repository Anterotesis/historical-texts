            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I Send theſe Truths from the Eternal GOD to you in Love &amp; Faithfulneſs; unfeignedly deſiring that you may be convinced of your Unbelief, and of all your Sins, and of your preſent accurſed and condemned State, and that you may be taught of God to rely upon Chriſt, who died for the ungodly. If you continue unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, you will certainly ere long be the moſt miſerable of the whole Creation, and Monuments of divine Juſtice, altho' you now enjoy the World in its Glory. Since divers of you are awakened, I hope that God may have Thoughts of everlaſting Love to ſome of your Souls: therefore as I have warned you to flee for Refuge from the Wrath of God
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004702_0003_100DBC16125803B0"/>which is coming upon you &amp; without delay, preſently to come out of this dreadful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to Chriſt, who will embrace you; ſo I write to you, and to all others to whom theſe Truths may be communicated, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their miſcarrying in Converſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Seek to know and be convinced by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit thro' the Scriptures, that you are born dead in Sins and Children of Wrath, without Chriſt, and without Hope:</hi> Eph 2 3, 12. And that you lie every Moment under God's Curſe and Wrath; in danger of eternal Condemnation; <hi>Gal</hi> 3 10 <hi>The Wicked ſhall be turned into Hell,</hi> Pſal 9.17 <hi>The Soul thas ſinneth it ſhall die,</hi> Ezek 18 4. Unbelievers ſhall not ſee Life, but the Wrath of God abideth on them, though they are inſenſible of it. The Lord ſaith <hi>Except a Man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God:</hi> And <hi>he that believeth not is condemned already,</hi> Joh. 3.3, 18, 36. Conſider ſeriouſly then, each of you, I beſeech you, <q>What will become of me, who am not born again, nor ever had the Experience of a Work of Grace?</q> O that your Eyes were open to behold all the Sins of your Hearts &amp; Lives, in order before you, which may cry aloud continually for Vengeance againſt your guilty Souls! 'Twere enough to make you tremble, who are now moſt ſenſeleſs. Retire alone quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and reflect upon your Ways as in the Sight of God. Put theſe Queſtions to your ſelves,—<q>Have not I ſometimes Lyed, or
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004702_0003_100DBC16125803B0"/>Stole, or ſwore an Oath? Have I not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned the Lord's Day? Was I never Proud, nor Wanton, nor Malicious? Have I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taken the Lord's Name in vain? Have I not been diſobedient to my Parents? Have I not a carnal, unclean, hard and unbelieving Heart? Did I never break God's Laws? Am not I dead in Sins to this Day? Yea ſurely I muſt cry out, Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, guilty: My Conſcience condemns me. What will become of me if I die in this dreadful Condition? For the righteous God hath ſaid, <hi>Curſed is every one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth not in all Things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them</hi> He that ſpared not the Angels when they ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but caſt them down to Hell: He that ſpared not the old World, nor the Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi> &amp; <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> but condemned them with an overthrow, making them an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample unto thoſe which after ſhould live ungodly, will not ſpare me long. Does not Hell gape for me? Is there any hopes that ſuch a Sinner as I have been, may be waſhed in the Blood of Chriſt? God may righteouſly damn me for theſe Sins, or for the leaſt Sin; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3 23. It is of the Lord's Mercy that I am not conſumed, and now in Hell, howling among the damned, crying out for a Drop of Water to cool my Tongue; <hi>Lam.</hi> 3 22 <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.24.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Seek the Lord in ſecret for his Spirit while he may be found;</hi> Iſai. 55.6. Cry out each
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004702_0004_100DBC17ABFE5828"/>of you for the Blood of Chriſt, as condemned Malefactors do for Mercy: As they did, <hi>Act.</hi> 2 37. Or as the Keeper of the Priſon ſaid trembling, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> Act. 16 30 Reſt not one Day nor one Hour lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger quietly or ſecurely, till you have ſome Hopes that Faith is wro't in you by the Spirit, and that Jeſus Chriſt will plead your Cauſe at the Day of Judgment; for without the imputation of his Righteouſneſs there is no Remiſſion. Follow Chriſt, crying after him as the blind Man did, <hi>Lord, that our Eyes may be opened,</hi> Mat. 20 30. Pray as the Leper did, Mat. 8.2. <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean.</hi> Plead importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately for the Spirit which is promiſed in theſe laſt Days to be poured out upon all Fleſh, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.3. If the Lord by his Word and Spirit makes you ſenſible of your fearful undone Condition; beware of reſting ſhort of a thorow Work of Grace; leſt you fall ſhort of union with Chriſt, thro' the teachings and drawings of the Father; leſt you reſt in a falſe Peace, <hi>Luk</hi> 11.21. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing yourſelves about with Sparks of your own kindling, thro' ſlight wounding, or ſlight healing, <hi>Iſai</hi> 50.11 Take heed of building fooliſhly upon the Sand, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.26, 27. And leſt thou prove at beſt but a fooliſh Virgin walking with the wiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. Fear leſt you make a Chriſt of Duties, of Praying, Weeping, Purpoſing or Reforming; for the <hi>Sacrifice of the Wicked is an Abomination to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004702_0004_100DBC17ABFE5828"/>the Lord,</hi> Prov. 15.18. <hi>There is a Way that ſeemeth right to a Man. but the End thereof are the Ways of Death,</hi> Prov. 14.12. <hi>There is a Generation that are pure in their own Eyes, and yet are not waſhed from their filthineſs,</hi> Prov 30.12. A Perſon may go very far under the awakenings of Conſcience, and have a Zeal of God, &amp; yet being ignorant of God's Righteouſneſs, go about all his Life time to eſtabliſh his own Righteouſneſs, and get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at laſt but the Hypocrites Hope, which ſhall periſh. Thou that ſpinneſt a covering for thy Nakedneſs out of thine own Bowels, thy Truſt ſhall be like a Spider's Web in the Day of thy Calamity: This thou ſhalt have at the Hand of God, thou ſhalt lie down in Sorrow: For Chriſt is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.13, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2, 3, 4. By the Deeds of the Law there ſhall no Fleſh be juſtified in the Sight of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3 20. If ever thou find Mercy, thou muſt be juſtified freely by the Grace of God, thro' the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption which is in Chriſt Jeſus by Faith without the Deeds of the Law, <hi>ver.</hi> 24, 28. 'Tis true, Faith comes by hearing, and 'tis our Duty to attend on God's Appointments, where the Spirit works; but if Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs come by any Work of the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vain, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21. To him that worketh not in the Point of Juſtification, but believeth on him that juſtifyeth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, his Faith is counted for Righteouſneſs:
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004702_0005_100DBC1A8A1C7870"/>Bleſſed is that Man to whom God imputeth Righteouſneſs without Works, <hi>Rom</hi> 4.5, 6</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Lock to the Lord to convince you of Sin, becauſe you believe not in Jeſus Chriſt, which is promiſed,</hi> John 16 7.8, 9. In your At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on the Means of Grace, be willing to be convinced by the Comforter, that your Hearts are ſo deſperately wicked that you will not come to Chriſt; and to ſeel your Impotency, that you cannot believe in him, unleſs the Lord put forth the exceeding Greatneſs of his Power, <hi>Bph.</hi> 1.19.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Know aſſuredly, and welcome theſe glad Tidings, that Chriſt is come of a Truth into the World on purpoſe to ſave Sinners, and the chiefeſt of them,</hi> 1 Tim 1.15. <hi>God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but have everlaſting Life.</hi> John 3.19. <hi>Chriſt havh once ſuffered sins, the Juſt for the Unjuſt, that he might bring us to God,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18 Fice to this Refuge when thou ſeeſt thyſelf ungodly, and accurſed by the Law of God, and ſeareſt thou ſhalt be condemned. Conſider with thy ſelf, tho' I am ungodly, yet Chriſt died for the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5 6. Though I am an Enemy, yet Chriſt hath reconciled Enemies to God by his Death. <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. Though I am rebellious, and ſo abominable, that I fear leſt the Earth ſhould open and ſwallow up ſuch a Wretch, and God ſhould righteouſly ſink me to Hell, living, and in his Wrath; yet
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004702_0005_100DBC1A8A1C7870"/>here's good News and Encouragement for me, that Jeſus Chriſt when he aſcended on high received Giſts for Men, yea, for the rebellious alſo, that the Lord might dwell among the Rebellious, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. Tho' I am accurſed, and I fee evidently God threatens to damn me in many Scriptures, yet is there Hopes for ſuch a condemned ſinner, ſince Chriſt hath redeemed accurſed ſinners from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for them, that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Spirit, <hi>Gal</hi> 3.13, 14.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Believe in Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe 'tis the Command of God and pleaſing in his Sight, and thy Duty, though thou canſt ſee no other Warrant or Ground of Encouragement.</hi> It is not only thy Privilege, but thy Duty to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. <hi>This is his Commandment, that we ſhould-believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 John 3 22, 23. <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Act. 16.31. Chriſt tells Hypocrites that ſought him for their Bellies, <hi>This is the Work of God, that ye believe on him whom God hath ſent,</hi> Joh. 6 28, 29. Apply the Word thus for thy ſelf; the righteous God that knows all my hainous Sins, inſtead of condemning me for them, commands me to believe on his Son, and aſſures me that I ſhall be ſaved. The Lord give thee the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation in the Knowledge of Chriſt, and the Obedience of Faith. The Voice of the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004702_0006_100DBC1C961194F8"/>Lord Jeſus is powerful, and his Sheep hear it; pray earneſtly that his Commands may come with Power to thy Soul.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Rejoyce to hear that Jeſus Chriſt is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an earneſt Suitor for thy Love.</hi> The Lord that was crucified for the chiefeſt Sinners, now ſaith to thee, <hi>Behold I ſtand at the Door and knock, if any Man hear my Voice and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Door, I will come in to him,</hi> Rev 3.20. <hi>I am not come to call the Righteous, but Sinners,</hi> ſaith the Lord, Mat. 9.13. <hi>Come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me all ye who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you Reſt,</hi> Mat. 11.28. <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>How dreadful ſoever thy Condition may be in thy own Thoughts, yet Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Him that cometh to me I will in no wiſe caſt out,</hi> Joh. 6.37. Though you therefore feel hard and dead Hearts, yet come as Sinners
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004702_0006_100DBC1C961194F8"/>unto Chriſt, who came to ſeek and ſave ſuch. The Lord calls ſtout-hearted Sinners who are far from Righteouſneſs to hearken unto him <hi>Iſai.</hi> 46.12, 13</p>
            <p n="8">8 <hi>When your Hearts are ſinking under the Senſe of God's Wrath, then reſolve in the Strength of Chriſt to rely upon him, to caſt and rowl your ſelves upon him, whatever be the Iſſue.</hi> If I periſh, I will periſh at the Feet of Chriſt, for otherwiſe I am ſure to periſh: If he condemn me, he is righteous; if he ſave me, 'twill be Riches of free Grace for ever to be admired. Venture thus upon Chriſt againſt a thouſand Diſcouragements, as the <hi>Lepers</hi> ventured into the Tents of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> 2 Kings 7.4, 5, 6.

Thus let the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffer Violence; preſs thou into it, and take it by Force.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Never attempt to believe or repent in thy own Strength, but look unto Feſus in whom it hath pleaſed the Father all Fullneſs ſhould dwell,</hi> Col. 1.19 As thou would'ſt not prove a rotten Hypocrite, beware of a dead Faith of thy own forming, which is not the Faith of the Operation of God, <hi>Col</hi> 2 12.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004702_0007_100DBC1E7B317140"/>Look not for that in thy ſelf which is to be found in Chriſt, nor for that in the Law which is to be found in the Goſpel: This hath been the Cauſe of the long Troubles of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny precious Souls. When thou feareſt thou ſhalt die eternally becauſe thou canit not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, look out of thy ſelf onto Chriſt, who is full of Grace, and behold his Glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Look unto me and be ye ſaved all the Ends of the Earth,</hi> Iſai. 45.22. Look unto Jeſus the beginner and finiſher of Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. Chriſt never comes expecting to find Faith or Repentance, but looks upon a filthy Soul polluted in his own Blood, and ſaith unto him, <hi>Live;</hi> and this Time is the Time is the Time of Love, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16 6.8. The Grace of the Lord is exceeding abundant to the chiefeſt of Sinners; with Faith and Love which is in Chriſt Jeſus, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. When thou turneſt thine Eyes inward, and feareſt that the Hardneſs and Impenitency of thy Heart will ſurely be thy ruin; flee to that reviving Word, Acts 5.30, 31. <hi>God hath raiſed up Jeſus, and exalted him with his right Hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance to Iſrael, and Remiſſion of Sins.</hi> The Lord hath promiſed in the latter Days to deſtroy the Veil of Unblief which is ſpread over all Nations, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 25.7. Doſt thou find by Experience that Word true, <hi>No Man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him;</hi> behold in the next Verſe what a full Promiſe of Help

If God turn thine Eyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and ſhew thee what an open Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre full of deadly Poyſon thou art, thou wilt then juſtify God though he ſhould ſpurn thee into Hell immediately, and wilt wonder what hath held the Hand of revengeful Juſtice from comſuming thee long ſince. The Lord will not cruſh under his Feet ſuch a Priſoner of the Earth, <hi>Lam</hi> 3 34. Nor will he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thee that doſt thus juſtify him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thy ſelf, and lieſt at his Feet longing to be found in Chriſt. Wait therefore for the Spirit's Conviction of <hi>Sin,</hi> becauſe thou believeſt not on Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16 8, 9. When the <hi>Comforter</hi> is come, he will reprove the World of <hi>Sin,</hi> becauſe they <hi>believe not</hi> on me, <hi>(i e.)</hi> ſhall convince them of this Sin chiefly: The Spirit doth aggravate this Sin of <hi>Unbelief,</hi> where he cometh to work with Power ſavingly. This is promiſed in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Days, that the chiefeſt of Sinners ſhall look upon Chriſt whom they have pierced, and mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only Son, <hi>Zech,</hi> 12 10.</p>

And there it leaves thee in a helpleſs and periſhing Condition; it only works Wrath, and curſeth thee, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and condemneth thee. It is very uſual with troubled Souls to run to their Duties, or Tears, or Purpoſes to Sin no more; in their own Strength; inſtead of looking to Chriſt who was made Sin for them who knew no Sin, that they may be made the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. They ſhould come without Money, as unworthy and empty Sinners to Chriſt, whom it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Father to bruiſe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53. Chriſt hath finiſhed Tranſgreſſion and made an End of Sins, and made Reconciliation for Iniquity, and brought in everlaſting Righteouſneſs, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24 Herein Chriſt's Ambaſſadors need to be faithfully warned, when they preſs Duties upon awakened Sinners, to teach them to look for Juſtification by Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Deeds of the Law, leſt they make a Generation of Self-righteous Hypocrites, inſtead of ſound Believers. <hi>Maledicta ſit omnis doctrine, vita, religio, quae conatur lege aut operibus parare juſtitiam coram 'Deo.

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Therefore if thou would'ſt be accepted of Chriſt, come as ungodly, as unrighteous unto him, who died for Sinners as ſuch, and findeth them dead in Sins when be comes to call them.</hi> The Work of the Law is only to convince us that we are ungodly, dead in Sins, having no Righteouſneſs, not Strength If thou wouldſt not be rejected and prove a Phariſee, come as a Sinner helpleſs, and hopeleſs.

            <p n="3">3. The Spirit's End in convincing thee of thine Impotency, is chiefly to teach thee to look unto Chriſt, who is full of Grace, and in all God's Appointments to wait for the Drawings of the Father, who hath promiſed his Teachings, <hi>John</hi> 6 44 45.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the Spirit, the Comforter, to convince the World of Unbelief, and to beget Faith, <hi>John</hi> 16.8, 9, 10, 14. Therefore inſtead of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004702_0013_100DBC2BFA23E170"/>unbelieving Deſpondencies, look for the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Spirit, under the Means of Grace, to enable thee to believe.</p>
            <p>Object <hi>What have I to do to come to Chriſt, who am ungodly, aſleep, unprepar'd, the chiefeſt of Sinners? Alas, I am condemned, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect nothing but Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is the Lord who hath begun to open thine Eyes, &amp; to ſhew thee thy preſent Condition, according to his Promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thou only art the Perſon that art called, and ſhalt be welcome to Jeſus Chriſt, notwithſtanding all thy Guilt, and want of Preparations, and Qualifications in thy own Senſe and Apprehenſion. God doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee not to Work <hi>(i.e.)</hi> for thy Peace, but to believe in God, who juſtifies the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and thy Faith ſhall be accounted for Righteouſneſs; thou art to believe in God, who quickeneth the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. 17. God who is rich in Mercy, for the great Love wherewith he loved dead Sinners quickneth them together with Chriſt, that he might ſhew forth the exceeding riches of his Grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.7. Chriſt commands and invites Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and no other to come to him; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth plainly that he will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice, and that he came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.11.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>This rejoyceth my Heart that ſuch a Wretch as I may come to Chriſt: But may I now come to Chriſt ſo ſoon after I am awakned?</hi>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Come and welcome now to Chriſt. Chriſt gave great Encouragement to <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nael</hi> becauſe he embraced the firſt Offer. Jeſus ſaid to him, <hi>Becauſe I ſaid to thee, I ſaw thee under the Fig Tree, believeſt thou? Thou ſbalt ſee greater Things than theſe,</hi> John 1.50</p>
            <p>Object <hi>The Lord is withdrawn from me, ſaith a diſtreſſed Soul, and I fear my Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are a Deluſion of the Devil, and Sparks of my own kindling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. After thou haſt ſung the Praiſes of God, do not thus ſoon forget his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Works, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.12, 13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Caſt not away thy Confidence. Chriſt's Love-Tokens are Pledges of his Faithfulneſs in his Abſence. When <hi>Aſaph</hi> was at a loſs, he ſaid, I will remember the Years of the Right Hand of the moſt High: ſure I will remember thy Wonders of Old, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.10, 11. Hath not the Lamb that was ſlain rent the Vail of Unbelief, and open'd the ſealed Book, and ſhewed thee plainly of the Father? Did he never Seal his Love in one Promiſe? Did'ſt never triumph over one Luſt? Haſt thou not met with the Smiles of Goa's Countenance then, when thou expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedſt to be conſumed in a Moment, being caught as it were out of the Belly of Hell, and laid in Chriſt's Boſom? Why doſt thou thus unworthily and ingratefully forget the Day, when thy Lord delivered thee not from
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004702_0014_100D86BB31F0CA40"/>one, but from all thy Fears? Then thou fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt under Chriſt's Shadow with great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and his Fruit was pleaſant to thy Taſte, <hi>Cant,</hi> 2.3. Then his Banner over thee was Love; then thy couldſt Sing, <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his:</hi> O the heighth and depth, the length and breadth of the Love of Chriſt to my Soul, that paſſeth Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? Canſt thou not remember the Day, when Chriſt came leaping over the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and skipping over the Hills to thy faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul; then thy Beloved ſpake, and ſaid to thee, <hi>Riſe up my Love, my fair One, and come away; for to the Winter is paſt, the Rain is over and gone.</hi> Let not the Conſolations of God be ſmall with thee. Reflect upon the Time of thy firſt Eſpouſals, when Chriſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered himſelf and opened the everlaſting Love of his Heart to thee; when thou waſt in a doleful and forlorn Condition, and then raviſh'd away thy Heart. Thy Love then was as ſtrong as Death, and many Waters could not quench it; then thy Language was, Stay me with Flaggons, Comfort me with Apples, for I am Sick with Love; then perfect Love did caſt out Fear, and by his Light thou walkedſt through Darknefs. Call to mind the Days of Old, when thou reſted thy weary Soul in everlaſting Arms, rejoycing as more than a Conquerour over Sin and Law, Death, Hell and the Devil, through Chriſt who loved thee. Look to a full Chriſt, thou empty nothing Creature;
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004702_0015_100DBC31A7AEEF80"/>thy Lord will turn again, he will not caſt thee off for ever, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.31. Reſolve with <hi>Joh, Though be ſlay me I will Truſt in him, be alſo ſhall be my Salvation,</hi> Joh. 13.15, 16. The Lord hath appeared unto me of Old ſaying, <hi>Yea, I have loved thee with an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love, therefore with loving Kindneſs have I drawn thee,</hi> Jer. 31 3 What though I am now in Darkneſs in the Deeps, in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Pit, like the ſlain in the Grave, whom God remembreth no more, yet doth he not ſhew Wonders to the dead? The Lord will command his loving Kindneſs in the Day Time; he will bring me forth to the Light, and I ſhall behold his Righteouſneſs, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.9. Though thou now goeſt Mourning without the Sun, yet abida in Chriſt by the Power of God, that raiſed him from the dead; the Day will dawn, and the Shadows flee away; thou ſhalt ſhine forth, thou ſhalt be as the Morning, thy Light ſhall riſe in Obſcurity, and thy Darkneſs be as the Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Day, the Lord ſhall be thine everlaſting Light, and the Days of thy Mourning ſhall be ended, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.20. Pray for new Bottles to hold the new Wine upon thy Lord's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. The Lord hath had a long Controverſy with many of his dear Children in theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the ſpilling of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider God's gracious Ends in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing. It is chiefly in Love to teach thee to live by Faith in Chriſt, and not upon thy Enjoyments, to lean upon thy Beloved
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004702_0015_100DBC31A7AEEF80"/>in the Wilderneſs. If one ſhould have asked <hi>Paul,</hi> how it was with his Soul; ſee the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2 20. <hi>The Life I now live is the Fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God.</hi> Though thou walkeſt in Darkneſs, and haſt no Light, yet thou art commanded to truſt and ſtay on thy God, <hi>Iſai</hi> 50.10. Bleſſed is he that hath not ſeen, and yet hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, <hi>Joh</hi> 20 29.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But I am a Backſlider, and the Lord hath righteouſly hid his Face</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is very ſupporting to conſider, the Heart of God and Chriſt towards his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren under Backſlidings, which appears in the many Goſpel-Calls, and Promiſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and Healing, made to tempted Souls, when gone aſtray, and caſt out of God's Sight: read <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54 <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.30, 31. <hi>Hoſea,</hi> 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Surely it were better for me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy my ſelf,</hi> (ſaith another) <hi>under Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than to live only to aggravate my Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. I am condemned already, God hath ſet me up as a Monument of his Wrath; why ſhould I live any longer in this Torment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Take heed of Soul wounding Sins, and leaſt you run away from Chriſt by Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, after falls into them. Some fin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Light, and then inſtead of flying to the Blood of ſprinkling, they depart away farther by their Unbelief, than they did by their backſliding into Sin; and entertaining hard Thoughts of God and Chriſt in the Pride
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004702_0016_100DBC3355537900"/>of their Hearts, they will rather attempt to take a deſperate Courſe, than ſubmit to the Righteouſneſs of God, and fall down at the Feet of Chriſt, whoſe Arms are open to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seive the chiefeſt of Sinners.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If thou hadſt lain ſcorching in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Burnings, thou would think it a rich Mercy to be on this ſide Hell again: There are done to ſympathize with thee, or to pray for thee or to give thee a Drop of Water to cool thy Tongue.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Although thy preſent Condition be deplorable, yet be not thine own Executioner, if God will give thee a Reprieve in the World. When thou are tempted to it, I ſolemnly Charge thee to remember that God hath forbidden it, ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. In the Hour of Temptation go not out in thine own Strength; look to Chriſt, and keep thine hold of him, who is able to keep thee from falling. The Lord hath laid Help upon one that is Mighty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Give no Place to the Devil. Be not affrighted from continuing in thy Calling: the Lord hath promiſed to keep thee in all thy Ways, and his Angels ſhall have Charge over thee, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 91.11, 12.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Thou art groſly miſtaken in thinking no Caſe like thine, for no Temptation hath taken you, but ſuch as is common to Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 13. Many of God's dear Children have been as vehemently aſſaulted with ſuch helliſh Temptations, tho' thou thinkeſt
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004702_0016_100DBC3355537900"/>thy Caſe cannot be parallel'd, and have been recovered, and their Unbelief, and all their ſad Concluſions confuted.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When thou art tempted to Sin, flee to that Promiſe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54.17. No Weapon that is formed againſt thee ſhall proſper. The God of Peace ſhall bruiſe Satan under thy Feet ſhortly, <hi>Rom</hi> 16 20. God is faithful, who will not ſuffer thee to be tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that thou art able, but will with the Temptation, alſo make a way to eſcape, that thou mayeſt be able to bear it.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>I fear I ſhall faint in an Hour of Tryal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This godly Fear is a ſpecial Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative promiſed in the New-Covenant againſt all Temptations to Sin, and Apoſtaſy, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Watch and Pray always that thou mayſt be accounted worthy to eſcape all Things, that ſhall come to paſs, and to ſtand before the Son of Man, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.36.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Go not out in thine own Strength; for the eternal God is thy Refuge, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath are everlaſting Arms. Be thou Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the Afflictions of the Goſpel accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Power of God. Be ſtrong in the all-ſufficient Grace, which is in Chriſt Jeſus. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2 1. Look to Chriſt to ſtrengthen thee with all Might according to God's glorious Power unto all Patience and Long-Suffering with joyfulneſs. The Archers ſorely grieved <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and ſhot at him, but his Bow abode
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004702_0017_100DBC363764E880"/>in Strength, and the Arms of his Hands were ſtrong by the Hands of the mighty God of <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 49, 23, 24.</p>
            <p n="4">4 God's Word is a tried Word. Behold the great Cloud of Witneſſes from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World to this Day, all ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Seals of the Faithfulneſs of God to his exceeding great and precious Promiſes.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Behold Chriſt's wonderful Love in leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Throne of Glory and his Father's Boſom, and hanging upon the Croſs in thy Nature, bearing the Wrath of God for all thy monſtrous Sins. This will conſtrain thee to follow God fully, to follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth, and to continue with him in his Temptations. Look to Chriſt to ſhed abroad his Lovs in thy Heart by his Spirit. Love is ſtrong as Death; many Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cannot quench Love, nor Floods drown it.</p>
            <p>Object. Saith another, <hi>I have been long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fearful Temptations to foul and damnable Sins, ſurely I am an Hypocrite, I live an Hell upon Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caution.</hi> I would not have any ſelf deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hypocrite, who allows himſelf delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in a Courſe of ſecret Sinning to cheat himſelf with this, that his reigning Sins are but Infirmities, becauſe his Conſcience ſtings him after the commiſſion of Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Flee to the Blood of Chriſt, to waſh away the Guilt of thy ſcarlet Sins; and the Senſe of God's pardoning Love ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in thy Heart, will be one of the moſt
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004702_0017_100DBC363764E880"/>effectual Means in the World to keep thee from returning again to Folly. It is moſt evident from <hi>Paul</hi>'s Experience, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2 20. that looking to Chriſt crucified for thy Sins and Backſlidings, is the moſt expedite help to be crucified together with him, that the Body of Sin may be deſtroyed. The <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> experienced, that by beholding as in a Glaſs the Glory of the Lord <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the Riches of God's Grace and Forgiveneſs through the Blood of Chriſt they were changed into the ſame Image, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14. The Manifeſtations of God's pardoning Love to thee, will conſtrain thee; This will be thy practical Judgment; if Chriſt died for thee, when thou waſt an Enemy, therefore thou that liveſt ſhould'ſt not henceforth live unto thy ſelf, but unto him that died for thee and roſe again, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. If the Grace of God which brings Salvation appear to thee, 'twill teach thee to deny ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts; it will work evangelical Repentance in thee; it will diſſolve thy frozen Heart that thou ſhalt remember thy Ways and be confounded and never open thy Mouth becauſe of thy Shame, when thou be holdeſt that God is pacified towards thee, for all that thou haſt done, <hi>Ezek,</hi> 16.61.</p>
            <p>Therefore after thy Falls, tho' thy Heart be dead and ſtupid, yet run quickly to Chriſt with confuſion of Face, who is exalted to give Repentance, and Remiſſion of Sins, <hi>Act,</hi> 5.31. Believe ſtedfaſtly, though thou
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004702_0018_100DBC37DE59FD30"/>haſt Sinned, yet thou haſt an Advocate with the Father, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Righteous, who ever liveth to make Interceſſion for Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. Do not Work at all for Peace, or Healing, thereby fruſtrating the Death of Chriſt, but believe in Chriſt who was delivered for our Offences, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When thou haſt Sinned, run not farther from God by Unbelief, than thou haſt done by thy Backſlidings. Pluck not up the Foundation preſently. This is one of Satan's Subtilties, by enticing thee to Sin, to break thy Peace, to torment and bewilder thee, and to take thee off thy Work, and Uſefulneſs for God. Many Sins may cauſe matter of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, but not of queſtioning our Eſtates.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Go out in the Strength of Chriſt, and thou ſhalt overcome at laſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6 9, 10. &amp;c. One Cauſe of our Falls in the Hour of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, is our going forth in the Confidence of received Grace. Therefore live continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally under the actual Conviction, and Senſe of thine inability to reſiſt the leaſt Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and abide in Chriſt, in whom all Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dwells</p>
            <p n="4">4. It will be diſtinguiſhing Love from God; if thou through the Injection of fiery Darts and other Temptations, thou art kept awake from Luke-warmneſs and from a Spirit of Slumber and Security, the epidemical Sin of this Hour of Temptation which prevails ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly upon Saints, &amp; the World, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:004702_0018_100DBC37DE59FD30"/>all awakening Diſpenſations, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſt's Prediction, <hi>Mat.</hi> 34.25.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It may be thy Temptations may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue all thy Life: Long not ſo much for Deliverance as for Strength to reſiſt. Out of a ſlothful Principle, we often cry earneſtly for Victory; therefore Temptations ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. Obſerve Chriſt's Anſwer to <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. There was no Deliverance from the Thorn in the Fleſh; but my Grace is ſufficient for thee, for my Strength is made perfect through Weakneſs. Be confident of this; Sin ſhall not have Dominion over thee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. Becauſe thou art not under the Law, but under the Reign of Grace; and that God will give thee Power when thou art faint, and will increaſe thy Strength when thou baſt no might, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40. And in the Faith of the ſull Promiſes, purchaſed by Chriſt's Blood, take Courage: Glory in thine Infirmities, becauſe of the Power of Chriſt, which ſhall reſt upon thee. Rejoyce not againſt me, O mine Enemy; when I fall I ſhall ariſe, when I ſit in Darkneſs the Lord ſhall be a Light unto me. Rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, by, and in whom thou haſt already overcome the World, and art more than a Conqueror, and art raiſed up together, and made to ſit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heavenly Places in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Fight againſt Sin, the World, the Law, Death, and the Powers of Darkneſs, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt conquered Enemies. Pray believing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that Purchaſe of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. that
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004702_0019_100DBC3B45F8E670"/>as Sin hath reigned unto Death in thee, Grace may now reign through Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to eternal Life. Rejoyce in Hope of everlaſting Reſt; where thou will more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Power and Wiſdom of God in lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and unholding a poor weak Worm through ſuch ſad Deſertions, and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and inextricable Labyrinths, than if thou hadſt a calm Way to Glory. To him that overcometh, ſaith Chriſt, will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne, even as I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, and am ſet down with my Father in his Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21.</p>
            <p>Now unto Him, who is able to keep us from falling, and to preſent us faultleſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Preſence of his Glory, with exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Joy, be Honour and Dominion for ever.</p>
