            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>To heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of ſight to the blind, to ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed.</p>

            <p>TO underſtand the nature of the objects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round us, juſtly to eſtimate their value is a high attainment of knowledge.</p>
            <p>HAVING informed our minds and obtained right opinions, then to direct our deſires, our purſuits, and our zeal, according to the nature of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is the ſummit of human goodneſs.</p>
            <p>THE huſbandman, therefore, may highly value his farm, the mechanic his ſhop, the mariner his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, the man of ſcience his books; becauſe theſe things are neceſſary to their mode of living.</p>
            <p>THE man of moral reflection, enquiring whence his origin, what his deſtination, what his preſent du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, what his future proſpects, finds the goſpel eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to his peace here, to his happineſs hereafter. To him the goſpel is precious. He is "blind." He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores the reſources of his own mind; he learns the philoſophy of the wiſe; he finds light, only, in the volume of revelation. His conduct is wrong; his paſſions lead him 'captive.' To reſtrain himſelf he thinks of his intereſt, of his reputation; he finds commanding motives of goodneſs, only in the book of God. Here he reads the ſinner's end; he trembles; he obeys. To bind our luſts, reputation and intereſt are no better than Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's burſting cords.</p>
            <p>IMPERFECT man feels remorſe, his ſpirit is 'bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;' he concludes himſelf under condemnation; the revelation of chriſtians furniſhes a balm to 'heal'
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034306_0005_0FFC3912F4950B58"/>
his bleeding heart. With terrors he is enſlaved; the goſpel gives 'liberty' and joy. The text aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes to the goſpel all theſe excellencies. The goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel <hi>heals the broken hearted,</hi> conſoles the anguiſh of a guilty conſcience: it gives freedom to the ſlaves of ſin: It gives <hi>ſight to the blind,</hi> knowledge to thoſe ignorant of moral truth.</p>
            <p>TO ILLUSTRATE THE VALUE OR EXCELLENCE OF THE GOSPEL IS OUR PRESENT OBJECT.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE chriſtian revelation is excellent; it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es men what to BELIEVE reſpecting God, themſelves and a future ſtate: It directs the FAITH of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. This is a circumſtance of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; for the faith of men will ever, more or leſs, influence their conduct.</p>
            <p>TRUTHS, the moſt intereſting to the heart of man are no where diſcovered but in the oracles of God.</p>
            <p>THE religious opinions of thoſe deſtitute of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation are, in general, ſo many groſs abſurdities.—That we may ſee the value of <hi>our</hi> privileges, let us for a moment recollect the articles of faith among the moſt enlightened nations of the heathen world.</p>
            <p>PRIESTS and Philoſophers taught, and the people believed, there was a plurality of gods.</p>
            <p>THE Romans had three hundred Jupiters. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo many names they worſhiped this deity.</p>
            <p>THE Greeks reckoned thirty thouſand gods, there were finally in the heathen catalogue two hundred and eighty thouſand gods.</p>
            <p>CATTLE, Cats, and Crocodiles, were among the divinities of Egypt.</p>
            <p>PHILOSOPHERS taught that creation from nothing was impoſſible; that matter was eternal; that there was no ſuch thing as a firſt bird, nor a firſt man; that the gods had not power to make a good man unhappy; that pain was no evil; that a wiſe man was happy in the midſt of tortures; that the gods were in ſhape like men, but of a larger ſize.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:034306_0006_0FFC390FE1A1DD00"/>THESE are a few articles of a philoſophic creed.</p>
            <p>PEOPLE and Philoſophers believed the reſponſes of oracles, the pretenſions of fortune-tellers, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of divination, the power of witchcraft, the piety of obſerving dreams, ſigns and omens, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate and unfortunate days. Some of theſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſms, remain in chriſtian countries.—Theſe chriſtians are like thoſe 'Children, who ſpoke half in the ſpeech of Aſhdod, and could not ſpeak the Jews language' in purity.</p>
            <p>AT Athens it was believed that deformed chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren might be murdered or expoſed to periſh alone. Hipaſus and Heraclitus taught that god was fire: Parmenides, that he was compoſed of earth and fire.</p>
            <p>ZENO maintained that all crimes were equal; that injuries are never to be forgiven. Cleanthes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed ſons and daughters to roaſt and eat the fleſh of their parents.</p>
            <p>EPICURUS denyed the providence of God: He allowed men to co-habit with their daughters and mothers. That parents might ſacrifice and eat their own children was a doctrine of the Cynic philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. Ideas of immortality the heathen have; but how low, how ſenſual!</p>
            <p>THE paradiſe of the Alcoran forbids deſcription. In the other world the ſavage expects the pleaſures of the chaſe, and the indulgence of eaſe. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in heathen countries to bury with the dead, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit near their graves the firſt articles of enjoyment.</p>
            <p>IN the Caroline Iſles they place near the graves of their friends, fruits and other eatables.</p>
            <p>THE Savage of America buries with the deceaſed what he poſſeſſed, the moſt valuable.</p>
            <p>IN India, with their kings, they bury a number of animals, and ſuch veſſels of ſilver and gold, as they think will be moſt uſeful in a future life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:034306_0007_0FFC390E58878A80"/>IN the ſtates of Barbary they carry veſſels of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and proviſions to the graves of their friends. This office is repeated every friday, as long as friends or relatives ſurvive, who retain kindneſs, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſuch an act of ſuppoſed friendſhip. They have no belief, no conception of joys ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to thoſe experienced here.</p>
            <p>HOW different, how much more excellent is the FAITH of chriſtians in all theſe particulars!</p>
            <p>THE chriſtian revelation teaches us there is ONE GOD the creator and governor of the univerſe, that he poſſeſſes all divine perfections. The goſpel teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es us what MAN is, a fallen creature, "being in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he abode not." The goſpel teaches us, there is a MEDIATOR; that there is ſalvation for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, through Jeſus Chriſt; that there will be a general reſurrection; that the righteous will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded according to their works, the wicked pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
            <p>A LIGHT ſhines; the curtain is drawn; we have a glance beyond the grave. We may learn where our ſpirits may be while our bodies are conveyed to "the narrow houſe of death;" where they may dwell while ages of ages in ſucceſſion paſs.</p>
            <p>THE faith of the chriſtian is the ſubſtance of things for which he hopes. But to thoſe intimate with the doctrines of chriſtianity we need not be particular.</p>
            <p>HAD not the Lawgiver of Iſrael, nor the Prophet of Bethlehem inſtructed us, inſtead of the truths of revelation, we might have embraced the creed of pagans. Does not the goſpel open blind eyes? Does it not direct the FAITH of mankind? Has it not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable excellence?</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE chriſtian ſyſtem is excellent, it mends the morals of mankind: It regulates their practice.</p>
            <p>To determine what chriſtianity has done towards the regulation of morals, we muſt again recur to the pagan world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:034306_0008_0FFC390C24309660"/>IT is neceſſary to examine heathen, and compare it with chriſtian morality.</p>
            <p>IF we obſerve the morals of a Paul, a Stephen, and innumerable other ſaints; how great is the contraſt between them, and a Nero, a Mahomet, and an Attila?</p>
            <p>HOW divine the chriſtian appears! If we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with Pagans, thoſe who have only a theoretic knowledge of the goſpel; the advantage, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, is vaſtly on the ſide of chriſtianity</p>
            <p>WITH all their guilt the believers in revelation appear almoſt like Angels, when contraſted with the profeſſors of any other religion.</p>
            <p>THE Heathen did not think themſelves obliged to be better than their Gods. Many of theſe they ſuppoſed immoral and cruel: their conduct was approved and imitated. Accordingly, in ſome part of Africa and Terrafirma the chief ſervants of a prince, at his death, were murdered to ſerve him in the other world. The heathen temples have commonly been aſylums for the worſt criminals. In Algiers a Turk may with impunity murder three Moors, or five Arabs, if he flee to a moſque where a marabout hermit, or ſaint has been buried.</p>
            <p>HE may murder eleven Jews, and find ſecurity in any moſque. Where ſomewhat like this prevails in countries <hi>called</hi> chriſtian, they have really retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to paganiſm.</p>
            <p>THE author of chriſtianity allows not one immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. The African and Indian ſhores receive the aſhes of the living widow in the ſame blaze, which conſumes her deceaſed huſband. They had ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles for ſelling human fleſh to be eaten in Jago, Hiſpaniola and Brazil. The Tartars ſuck the blood of wounded, dying perſons. The Indians of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da feaſted on the bodies of their captives. At the preſent time ſeveral nations of Africa expoſe thoſe children they do not like, to be eaten of wild bee it
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034306_0009_0FFC3909EC060500"/>
On the banks of the Danube it was the cuſtom to caſt their new born infants into the river; thoſe who could ſwim were taken up and preſerved; the others ſlept in their watry grave. Others killed their parents at a certain age, and feaſted on their fleſh. The Mingrelians bury their own children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. In moſt heathen countries, and lately in France, <hi>ſince they have rejected chriſtianity,</hi> they at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure diſſolve the marriage relation. Nothing is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for a divorce in that "TERRIBLE REPUBLIC" but a month's warning from the huſband or wife. In the city of Paris alone, five hundred and ſixty-two divorces took place in three months.</p>
            <p>THE Perſians married their daughters, their ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and their mothers. The connection is for life, or any particular time. In Tartary the father mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries his own daughter, or ſells her to the Turks, or Perſians. When people become infirm thro' great age, or ſome diſeaſe thought incurable, they are left to periſh alone.</p>
            <p>THE religion of Zoroaſter allows inceſt. A rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of his followers remain in Perſia and India. The licentiouſneſs of the Spartans in the conjugal relation, their cuſtoms at ſome of their feſtivals—I may not deſcribe. In Peru it was cuſtomary to fat and eat their own children born of captives, whom as concubines they kept for that purpoſe. When they became too old for this, they were kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eaten. Such is the morality of nations ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taught by the Redeemer of Iſrael. The world by their wiſdom do not know God; but give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to vile affections.</p>
            <p>THE heathen Philoſophers taught that bloody wars, merely for conqueſt, were juſt; that revenge was no crime. Their precepts armed one man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another.</p>
            <p>NOT ſo does the philanthropiſt of Nazareth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his diſciples. From his precepts we learn that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034306_0010_0FFC39079C6FBD48"/>
humility is a virtue, that forgiveneſs is a duty, that we ſhould love our neighbour as ourſelves, that we ſhould treat others as we deſire to be treated.</p>
            <p>IT is one grand deſign of the goſpel to unite man with man, and nation with nation; to form the world into one family of perfect morals.</p>
            <p>SUCH will be the effect when the influence of the goſpel ſhall be complete. No impiety, no wars, no criminal deſigns, will pain the heart of goodneſs.</p>
            <p>THE good Samaritan, bearing the wounded ſtranger to the Inn; the poor widow giving away her whole living, exemplifies the excellence of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>WHEN religious truth is powerfully impreſſed on the minds of a family, a neighborhood, a church; we ſee, we feel how happy are the effects of the chriſtian religion. In the me<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

            <p>MIGHTY is the goſpel to attract man to man; to harmonize their minds; to unite them in diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted love; to regulate their moral conduct. Were it not for the benign precepts of chriſtianity, is it not probable we ſhould ſacrifice our children, feaſt on our parents, be guilty of the groſſeſt immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</p>
            <p>THE humane, the benevolent, the divine precepts of Chriſt teach us better; preſerve us from theſe kinds of wickedneſs; inſtruct us in a perfect moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; require us to viſit the fatherleſs and the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in their affliction; to do juſtly, to love mercy and walk humbly with our God.</p>

            <p>IN Mexico as an atonement for their ſins, or a preparation for a ſolemn feſtival, they mangled their fleſh till the blood profuſely flowed. At the faſt of the Tlaſcalans, which laſted one hundred and ſixty days, the chief prieſt with about two hundred perſons aſcended a high mountain: When they came down they had a great number of little knives and ſmall rods given them. The firſt day they bored their tongues, through which they drew the rods, and notwithſtanding, their exceſſive pain, and loſs of blood, they were obliged to ſing aloud hymns to their gods. This operation was repeated every twenty days. At the end of eighty days, a general faſt of the people began which continued an equal time.</p>

            <p>WHEN Antiochus Epiphanes converted the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at Jeruſalem into a temple for Jupiter. "It was filled with riot and revelling by the gentiles, who dallied with harlots—within the circuit of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly places." 2d Macc. 6.4.</p>
            <p>JUVENAL ſays, "In what Temple are not women defiled?" Among the eaſtern nations after the mourning with which their feſtivals began, the reſt of the time was ſpent in mirth and jollity, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, adultery, and inceſt. Theſe were their religious aſſemblies. A conſiderable revenue is now collected for the temples of Indoſtan from the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titution, there encouraged. Refering to this cuſtom as ancient as the old Teſtament, God ſays, "Thou ſhalt not bring the hire of a harlot into the houſe of the Lord thy God." Deut. 23.18.</p>

region of the Indians human ſacrifices were common. The altars of Moloch, in the land of Canaan were ſtained with human blood. In Gaul they incloſed a man in a kind of wicker work, and burnt him in honor of the Gods.</p>
            <p>THE banks of the Nile drank the blood of human victims.</p>
            <p>UPON extraordinary occaſions, the Romans offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their children on their country's altars. Marius ſacrificed his own daughter. The ſame practice prevailed in Greece. Themiſtocles ſacrificed three women to Bacchus. A daughter was offered on the altar by a king of Athens.</p>
            <p>THE Carthagenians, not only immolated their own children in hundreds, but themſelves alſo in times of calamity.</p>
            <p>ON the iſlands lately diſcovered in the ſouth ſea, their ſacred places are cumbered with ſkulls of men offered to evil ſpirits.</p>
            <p>IN Peru they tied a living man to a ſtake, pulled his fleſh from his bones in ſmall pieces; broiled and eat it before his eyes.</p>
            <p>IN Terrafirma the natives honoured their divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with offerings of human blood.</p>

            <p>THESE are the people from whom we are deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And why are not we, their children, this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening employed in ſacrificing a kind friend, a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful parent, or a weeping babe?</p>
            <p>WHAT has made us to differ? What has taught us to worſhip Jehovah in a more wiſe manner? Is it not revelation alone which has opened our blind eyes, taught us rational piety, brought us into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God.</p>
            <p>It is the chriſtian revelation, which inſtructs us to worſhip ONE GOD "to worſhip him in ſpirit and truth, to call upon him out of a pure heart, to lift up holy hands without wrath or doubting:" Chriſtianity inſtructs us to addreſs God in the name of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; to pray in ſecret, in public; to intercede for all mankind. So rational, ſo benevolent is the worſhip of chriſtians. All round the globe cruelties, ſelf-murder, lewdneſs, human ſacrifices, have conſtituted their religious ſervices, but where the goſpel is known there is a worſhip, adapted to the nature of man, the purity and goodneſs of God.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. THE chriſtian doctrines are valuable; they unite men to God. The chriſtian loves God. He contemplates God as his guardian, his friend, his father. The religion of pagans did not attach them
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034306_0016_0FFC38F8E0691A98"/>
to their divinities. Their affection to the objects of their worſhip, we may ſee in Suetonius, one of their own hiſtorians.</p>
            <p>HE ſays, "they were ſo angry with their Gods at the death of Germanicus, that they battered their temples with ſtones, overthrew their altars and flung their houſehold divinities into the ſtreets." Theſe were the enlightened Romans.</p>
            <p>DU HALDE aſſures us "That the Chineſe, after offering largely to their Gods, and being diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their aſſiſtance, ſometimes <hi>ſue</hi> them, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain decrees againſt, them from the Mandarines."</p>
            <p>Do ſuch facts need any comment? It is the chriſtian alone, who loves God. The perfections, the honor, the family of God, are all dear to the chriſtian.</p>
            <p>THE chriſtian loves the cauſe of God, more than his own intereſt. The chriſtian lives to do good, to promote his makers cauſe. Joyful are thoſe days, devoted to his God, nor is life dear when the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of others, the glory of God, demands the ſacrifice. So benevolent, ſo ſelf denying is the chriſtian temper. Then, is not the goſpel precious?</p>
            <p n="5">V. THE excellence of the goſpel is viſible in its preparing Believers for death.</p>
            <p>WHAT are the ſupports of the Pagan in that ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hour, which awaits the ſons of men? What was the hope of the renowned Brutus, when he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Virtue an empty name, and ſheathed his ſword in his own vitals?</p>
            <p>WHAT are all the heathen rites; what all the philoſophy of the wiſe; what all the energetic rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings of our own minds, as we approach the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful darkneſs of another world?</p>
            <p>THE goſpel alone brings conſolation in that dreary-dreadful moment. The ſanctifying influence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation prepares the chriſtian to die in peace with himſelf, his connections and his God. A divine hope animates his departing ſpirit. He depends on the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034306_0017_0FFC38F4EA6DB5A8"/>
Mediator, who has made propitiation for his ſins and the ſins of the whole world. Jeſus has made an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement. He has died, the juſt for the unjuſt. He is exalted to give repentance and remiſſion of ſins, The penitent ſinner is pardoned, his name is written in the volume of life. An interceſſor is at the fathers right hand. See the holy chriſtian in his laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Would he exchange his bed of death, for the thrones of unbelievers?</p>
            <p>HE is pale, helpleſs, dying. His phyſician has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired. No hope of life remains; his friends weep; their hearts are wrung with grief. He ſees their tears he hears their ſighs, their deſpair is viſible. Sympathiſing in their diſtreſs; inſpired with humble triumph; he ſays: "weep not for me"—"See how a chriſtian can die." His voice fails. The parent who would die in his ſtead, cannot procure him an hours reprieve. The brother, whoſe ſoul is tenderneſs, endures not the ſcene; his agonizing cries to God cannot be heard. The wife, frantic with anguiſh, is bidding adieu to hope, and every earthful bliſs; ſhe leans o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the cold pillow.—The departing ſaint caſts a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gaze on the friend of his heart: he looks with undeſcribable tenderneſs. Still he enjoys divine peace, his countenance is ſerene. Faith bears him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the terrors of death, by faith he fees beyond the borders of life; the grave clouds not his proſpect. Viſions of approaching bliſs cheer his ſpirit. He ſees a divine inheritance, a heaven of joy, a throne of glory, a golden crown, a ſpotleſs robe, adoring ſaints, waiting angels, a ſmiling God.</p>
            <p>ABSORBED in theſe ravaſhing views, he whiſpers: "Tell me, my ſoul, can this be death?—where is thy ſting? When ſhall I die; when ſhall I live forever!" Often in ſuch a frame the chriſtian leaves the world.</p>
            <p>WHERE can the pagan find ſuch conſolations in his laſt hour, where diſcover ſuch enrapturing views?</p>
            <p>WILL not all bleſs God for the glorious goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:034306_0018_0FFC38F24112EED0"/>HAVING endeavoured to ſhew the value of the chriſtian revelation; we proceed to make ſome general reflections, which the ſubject may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p n="1">1. DOES not the divine excellence of the chriſtian ſyſtem call Miniſter and people, cordially, to unite in promoting its ſucceſs?</p>
            <p>UPON our cordial union, upon our affording com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and encouragement to one another the ſucceſs of the goſpel very much depends.</p>
            <p>FROM divine ordinances very little can be hoped where there is ſtrife or alienation.</p>
            <p>SHALL the golden talent be loſt, becauſe we have not mutual kindneſs?</p>
            <p>THE blood of ſouls will then crimſon our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If we exerciſe not a friendly, mutual regard, we refuſe to imbibe a chriſtian temper; the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent tendency of revelation encreaſes our guilt. For thoſe, who receive ſuch valued bleſſings from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for thoſe united for ſuch glorious purpoſes, not to be cordially attached is ungrateful, is unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
            <p>I PRAY God, we may hope better things of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>ON his part your Paſtor has no complaint; but many favors to acknowledge. He has, ever experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced much of your affectionate regard, your ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, your candor, your kindneſs. May HE, who records the ſmalleſt act of goodneſs, and the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret wiſh of love, repay you ten thouſand fold, and give you a diſciples reward.</p>
            <p n="2">2. FROM the excellence of the goſpel, we infer, thoſe have a bad taſte and erroneous judgment, who prefer worldly pleaſures to religious privileges.</p>
            <p>THE precepts of Jeſus form you aſſociates for the ſons and daughters of glory; they make the world, the univerſe thy own: "all things are yours."—Thoſe, who chooſe earthly things, prefer atoms to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034306_0019_0FFC38F09AD94698"/>
worlds; had rather grope in darkneſs, than ſhine as ſtars, and walk with ſaints in light. They deſire not to join in the ſongs of the redeemed, nor liſten to the harps of angels; but to grovel with "ſerpents and vipers." Have ſuch perſons a ſound judgment? Have they a taſte for the ſublime or beautiful? what objects ever ſtruck the heart of man or angels more grand or noble, than thoſe preſented in the adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the goſpel?</p>
            <p>LET the children of earth prefer the world; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to no ſelf-denial for the goſpel; live as you wiſh; preſs to thy heart the faſcinating objects of ſenſe! But will they cheer your mind in the agonies of death?</p>
            <p>WILL they calm your horrors in the tremendous ſcenes of the great day?</p>
            <p>IF it be more neceſſary, than earthly bliſs, for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, trembling man to emerge from clouds of moral darkneſs to enjoy the light of truth; to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach near and nearer ſtill to the temper of ſpirits glorified; to learn ſo to worſhip God, that he may ſay: "Command ye me;" if it be more neceſſary than ſinful pleaſure to a candidate for glory, to attain immortal union with him whoſe ſmile is heaven; with triumphant hope to enter the dreary vale of death; then compared with the goſpel, what are all the objects, that enchant the ſinners heart?</p>
            <p>THE privileges of a chriſtian are the only means of effecting theſe glorious purpoſes.</p>
            <p>REVELATION is abſolutely NECESSARY to the religious improvement of mankind.</p>
            <p>WITHOUT revelation a rational piety would not be practiſed in the world. There is no good evidence that in any quarter of the globe a ſingle kingdom, ſtate, province, city, or village, ignorant of revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has juſt notions of providence, or a becoming worſhip of the true God, or well founded comforts in death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:034306_0020_0FFC38EEE025F718"/>SEVERAL thouſand years they have had to make improvements in religion: they are wrapt in the black-ſhades of paganiſm.</p>
            <p>WHERE is one country or town to be excepted? I aſk the Deiſt of univerſal ſcience: where can I find one hamlet thus bleſt?—He is ſilent. No ſuch ſpot has an exiſtence. Muſt not 'the baptiſed infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del' bluſh for his brethren? Bluſh for himſelf? What ſhall we ſay then to the nominal <hi>believer,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the world to religious priviledges? Has he not a bad taſte, a perverted judgement? Is a not 'mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his heart?'</p>
            <p n="3">3. IF the goſpel is ſo veluable; we ought to pray for its extenſion and ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>'PRAY for the peace of Jeruſalem; they ſhall proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, who love her.' What requeſt can be more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, more benevolent, more acceptable to God?</p>
            <p n="4">4. IF the goſpel is ſo precious, then is it a bleſſing to be a Miniſter of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>INSTANTLY it may be objected, that "His life is retired—few are attached to his perſon—many grudge him their ſervices—he is dependent—abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed."</p>
            <p>ALL this may be true, yet who would not be a Miniſter of Jeſus, the prince of peace? Is it no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for difficulties to adminiſter the WORD of eternal life? Is it no privilege to teach thoſe, we love as our own ſouls, what faith will ſave the ſoul, what is pure morality, what the true worſhip of GOD? Is it no privilege to be an Agent in preparing our friends for death, for heaven, for immortal glory? One, who had been in perils much, in deaths oft, could ſay: "I thank Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, who hath enabled <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the miniſtry."</p>
            <p>THIS was no enthuſiaſt; but a man of ſcience and genius. Great is the privilege; pleaſant the work to adminiſter comfort to the broken hearted; to ſolve
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034306_0021_0FFC38EC5EA82118"/>
the doubts of the enquiring; to exhibit to all the knowledge of ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. FROM the excellence of the chriſtian revelation, we ſee how very wicked are mankind.</p>
            <p>A GREAT part of thoſe, who read and hear the goſpel, neglect, deſpiſe, hate and oppoſe its doctrines and ſpirit. They had rather periſh forever, than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny themſelves to obey its laws. With ſuch light, with ſuch convictions, to abuſe redeeming mercy; what amazing guilt! How much more aggravated are their ſins than pagans? More dreadful will their eternity be. The man of tears, who complains: 'They hated me without a cauſe.' 'Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life,' will ſoon be their wrathful Judge.</p>
            <p n="6">6. IF the goſpel is ſo excellent, ſo ſuperior to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſyſtems of morality and theology; is not this good evidence, that it came from God?</p>
            <p>How came the wanderers of the Arabian defert to fabricate a ſyſtem of religion more excellent than any other nation? Is it a common event, or is it a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy unparalleled in the hiſtory of man for a company of ſlaves, marching from their maſters to frame wiſe ſyſtems of divinity? If the Iſraelites did not invent their theology, it was from the God of heaven. They could not borrow it from their tyrants, who were worſhiping beaſts and vegetables; nor from their neighbors, who from their own boſoms tore their weeping babes to feaſt the devouring flames.</p>
            <p>WAS it ever known that a carpenter's ſon, born in a manger, educated in a cottage, employed as a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic, with a few illiterate fiſhermen, ever invented a ſyſtem of Truth, infinitely ſurpaſſing all previous, and ſubſequent productions of the human mind? Theſe perſons "bring immortality to light;" teach the unity of God; teach that God is LOVE; that repentance of ſin and faith in Chriſt will ſave the ſoul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:034306_0022_0FFA6B765C7C9A40"/>THEY are the firſt to tell us, our bodies for ages ſlumbering, ſhall riſe, cloathed with glory or made veſſels of wrath.</p>
            <p>THEY preſent the awful grandeur of the laſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſcene. The world ſhall blaze, the ſun expire, the Heavens vaniſh.</p>
            <p>THE Greeks and Romans were charmed with the eloquence of philoſophy. In other regions was ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erated the auſterity of the Druids. Who can num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the followers of Confucius? Mahomet boaſts of viſions and revelations; nations adopt his faith. Capac ſhines like a beam of the fun.</p>
            <p>BUT, as directions to future happineſs, what are all their doctrines collected, more than the jargon of Babel, if compared with the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. Is not the plan of redemption 'the wiſdom of God?' Is not every precept of chriſtianity cloathed with the authority of Jehovah?</p>
            <p n="7">7. IF the goſpel is ſo excellent, then it is a rich compenſation for all the ſacrifices we make for it.</p>
            <p>THE ordinances of chriſtianity cannot be enjoyed without ſome ſacrifices. Should your chriſtian pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges coſt all your poſſeſſions, coſt, your life, as they did the martyrs; this would be leſs than their value. If you enjoy the glad tidings of redemption for leſs than your precious ſoul; they are profitable.</p>
            <p>CHRISTIAN wiſdom is better than rubies or gold, better than fine gold, better than a revenue of choice ſilver.</p>
            <p>JUSTLY prize the conſolations of religion, eſtimate the joys of heaven; realize the torments of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; number the days of eternity; calculate the worth of ſouls redeemed by Jeſus Chriſt; then tell us what is too great a ſacrifice for the goſpel of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p n="8">8. IF the goſpel is ſo valuable, how intereſting is that day or hour, which unites a Miniſter and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:034306_0023_0FFC38E8EA2F6488"/>THE grand object of their union is to accompliſh the glorious deſigns of the chriſtian revelation. To enlighten, to reform, to ſanctify, to ſave ſouls, is the great motive to continue the ſacred relation. "Be thou faithful to this flock, and I will give thee a crown of life," is the voice of Heaven to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
            <p>TO the people the voice is "forſake not the aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of yourſelves—where two or three are met in my name, there am I—hear and your ſouls ſhall live."</p>
            <p>THE unfaithful have nothing to hope.</p>
            <p>"OH ſon of man, if thou doſt not ſpeak to warn the wicked from his way, that man ſhall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thine hand.'</p>
            <p>PEOPLE, careleſs, are ſolemnly warned. "If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart to give glory unto my name, I will even ſend a curſe upon you, and I will curſe your bleſſings; yea I have cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them." The ſalvation of Miniſter and people is apparently, ſuſpended on their mutual faithfulneſs. Deeply intereſting, therefore, was the hour, which united us in this relation. With joy or woe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be recollected in eternity. Let us be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then to perform the duties, we reciprocally owe each other. For an endleſs duration this may fix our character and our happineſs. Oh my people, may we be faithful; the reward is immortal glory.</p>
            <p n="9">9. IF the chriſtian ſyſtem is ſo valuable, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy are thoſe, who do not receive its benefits!</p>
            <p>ALAS for the poor pagans! Whoſe heart bleeds not for them? They are ſtumbling on the dark moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of death; the light of redemption ſhines not on their habitations. And muſt I not ſay: Alas, for ſome of you aſſembled this evening? Are there not <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, who enjoy not the ſaving effects of the goſpel? And is it poſſible that hereafter any preſent ſhould be on a level with pagans? Poſſible it is. More tolerable will it be for Sodom at the great day than
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:034306_0024_0FFC38E6AA804F60"/>
for ſuch. "It had been better for you not to have known the way of righteouſneſs, than after having known it to turn from the holy commandment."—The excellence of the goſpel demands your immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate acceptance. Another year is ended, little is there intereſting in our religious affairs.</p>
            <p>WE have, for which God be praiſed, enjoyed entire peace. No diſcord, no unkindneſs, no difficulties, have occurred. But to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? Who has believed to the ſaving of his ſoul? Has the goſpel been affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionately urged? Has the heart of goodneſs been comforted? Has the wicked been warned from his way? Before a higher tribunal theſe enquiries muſt be anſwered. Now is our time to prepare for the iſſue.</p>
            <p>THE year paſt only one perſon has united with this church.<note n="‡" place="bottom">

               </note> Deſpiſe not the day of ſmall things. The cloud, which filled the land of Iſrael with rain, was like a man's hand.</p>
            <p>SEVEN children have received the chriſtian name in the ordinance of baptiſm. The grave has twelve times opened its cold manſion. The hoary head and the infant have bowed to the king of terrors.</p>
            <p>TWO of the deceaſed were profeſſors of religion.—One had long been an officer in this church.</p>
            <p>HAVE we reaſon to hope the Lord has not forſaken us? Is there a general diſpoſition to converſe on things ſerious, and to attend religious inſtruction?</p>
            <p>OF thoſe, who have long been in the ſchool of Chriſt, may it be enquired whether by the goſpel, you are edified, comforted, and ſtrengthened? The hope of this is pleaſing, The great ſhepherd of Iſrael has commanded to feed his ſheep as well as his lambs, to give ſtrong meat to men as well as milk to babes. Be ſtrong in God; your redemption draweth nigh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:034306_0025_0FFC38E50C51DAB8"/>ARE any alarmed and almoſt perſuaded to become chriſtans? Thy time for conſideration is ſhort.</p>
            <p>CARELESS do any remain? I would perſuade you to be reconciled to God. While in the midſt of your pleaſures death is near: Providence may ſay: "This year thou ſhalt die."</p>
            <p>IN the grave is no knowledge, nor work nor change.</p>
            <p>THIS may prove the laſt opportunity of the kind, we may enjoy together. Happy is the Preacher that his beſt years have been cordially devoted to you: may remaining moments not be loſt. Beyond all conception important is it now to live in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that in our laſt hour, we may have a ſure hope of uniting again where death, nor ſeparation ſhall ever come. The pious ſhall unitedly enjoy God. Pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the thought, animating the hope, raviſhing the aſſurance of ſuch joy. What are your public pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions; what, your ſecret vows; what, your reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions; what, your real preparations? Are you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to make your calling and election ſure? Is it your great concern to enjoy peace of conſcience?—Is the law of God the only rule of your conduct?—By our mutual advantages are we daily improving? Muſt we recur to years paſt to find benefits from the goſpel, or are ſome gentle dews of grace, conſtantly, falling to reſtrain the wicked, to conſole the ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to encourage the feeble, to ſanctify the penitent? And have any felt a penitent heart under the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of your own chooſing? Do you ſtill know the conſolations of religion? God be thanked; God be praiſed. Oh, that all preſent were in this ſituation! By men of obſervation it is aſſerted, a moſt tender, indiſſoluble friendſhip exiſts between the Miniſter, and thoſe awakened and ſanctified by his inſtructions. Hence Paul ſtiles himſelf the father of his converts, and them, his children.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:034306_0026_0FFC38E2C78A5BE0"/>IT is ſaid, they partake each others joys ſhare each others griefs; have a mutual tenderneſs; are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with one ſpirit.</p>
            <p>WERE I to uſe the freedom of ſpeaking as I feel, I ſhould adopt theſe ſentiments as my own. Happy the Miniſter, who has many ſuch children; he may ſpeak with the enemy in the gate, nor be afraid.</p>
            <p>REMEMBER, my Friends, the ſolemn vows you have made to God; remember the reputation of the church, the ſalvation of your own ſouls depends on the real ſincerity of your religion. Finally: Ought we not all devoutly, to notice the good hand of our God in bringing us to another anniverſary eve; to bleſs God that he has not denied us the precious goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of ſalvation?</p>
            <p>WE know not what another year may bring forth. A night of affliction, the hour of final ſeparation may be near,</p>
            <p>LET us ſtrive to do good, to make each other hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to meet our God in peace.</p>
            <p>THE goſpel is the only mean of ſalvation; it is balm to the wounded; it is freedom to the captive; it is ſight to the blind. Bleſſed are the people, who know the joyful ſound.</p>
