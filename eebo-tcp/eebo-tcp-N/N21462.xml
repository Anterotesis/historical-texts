            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>TO tell thee that Ariſtotle, the learned Author of this book, was generally reported to be the moſt knowing philoſopher in the world, is no more than what every intelligent perſon already knows: nor can any think otherwiſe, who will give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the leiſure to conſider that he was the ſcholar of Plato (who was in his time the only reputed phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher for wiſdom) and under him Ariſtotle prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited ſo much that he was choſen by King Philip of Macedon as the moſt worthy and proper perſon in his dominions, to be tutor to his ſon Alexander, by whoſe wiſe precepts and inſtructions, Alexander became maſter of ſo great wiſdom, judgment, prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs and magnanimity, that he juſtly obtained the title of the great. And Alexander himſelf was ſo ſenſible of the advantage he received by the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſo great a Stagyrite, (for ſo Ariſtotle was called from the country of Stagy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> where he was born) that he affirmed that he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore beholden to his tutor Ariſtotle, for the cultivation of his mind, than to Philip his father, for the kingdom of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
            <p>Now though Ariſtotle applied himſelf univerſally to the inveſtigation of all the ſecrets of nature, and for that obtained an univerſal fame, yet that with which he was pleaſed in a more eſpecial and pecul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iar manner, to bring into a fuller and more true light, was the unfolding of the ſecrets of nature with reſpect to the generation of man: This is called his Maſter Piece; and in this he has made ſo thorough a ſearch, that he has, as it were, turned nature inſide outwards.</p>
            <p>Nor let any think theſe things to be below the ſtudy of ſo great a philoſopher, ſince the divine rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ords <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ure us, that it has been the ſtudy of divers
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028209_0004_0FD720418CAD1E00"/>
illuſtrious perſons equally renowned for wiſdom and goodneſs among whom I may well reckon Job the greateſt man in all ſecrets of nature, who has made it ſufficiently evident, by that excellent philoſophic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al account he gives of the generation of man, in the tenth chapter of that book which bears his name where he ſays, "Thine hands have made me, and faſhioned me together round about: Thou haſt pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me out as milk and curdled me like cheeſe; thou haſt clothed me with ſkin and fleſh, and haſt fenced me with bones and ſinews." Another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of illuſtrious perſons that have ſtudied the ſecrets of nature in the generation of man, is that of one of the greateſt, as well as the beſt kings of Iſrael, I mean king David, ſo great a prince, that he may be ſaid to have not only laid the foundation, but alſo to have ſettled the Hebrew monarchy; and his piety was ſuperiour to his power, being peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtyled, "A man after God's own heart." Let us hear what this man ſaith of the ſecrets of nature in his divine ſoliloquies to his Creator, "<bibl>Pſalm cxxxix.13, 14, &amp;c,</bibl> Thou haſt covered me in my mother's womb; I will praiſe thee, for I am fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and wonderfully made; marvellous are thy works, and that my ſoul knoweth right well. My ſubſtance was not hid from thee, when I was made in ſecret and curiouſly wrought in the loweſt parts of the earth. Thine eyes did ſee my ſubſtance, yet being imperfect, and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were faſhioned, when as yet there was none of them."</p>
            <p>Now let the forequoted words of holy Job, and theſe laſt of king David, be put together, and I will make no ſcruple to affirm, that they make up the moſt accurate ſyſtem of philoſophy reſpecting the generation of man, that has ever yet been written.</p>
            <p>And why ſhould not the myſteries of nature, in the generation of man, be without blame enquired into; ſince ſo great a tribute of praiſe redounds from hence unto the God of nature? The more we
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028209_0005_0FD7204C20F19030"/>
know of thoſe works the more our hearts will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to praiſe him, as we ſee in the inſtance of David before us: "I will praiſe thee (ſays he) for I am fearfully and wonderfully made." And then he breaks out into this exclamation, "Marvellous are thy works, and that my ſoul knoweth right well."</p>
            <p>If any ſhould object, that this knowledge is too often abuſed by vain and light perſons, who inſtead of admiring the wiſdom of God in the ſecrets of generation, do only make it their buſineſs to ridicule and ſet them at naught. I readily grant it, and think it a very great unhappineſs that there ſhould be a generation of ſuch profligate perſons in the world; but at the ſame time do aver, that this is no objection to this book; for ſhall the ſun be taken out of the firmament, becauſe its generating and lifegiving virtue, makes noxious weeds and poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous plants grow and flouriſh as well as the more ſanative and medical herbs, and odoriferous and refreſhing flowers? It is not from the nature of the things themſelves, but from the vicious nature of corrupted men that theſe things come to be abuſed. A harmleſs bee will fly into a garden, and there ſuck honey from a flower, when a ſpider, from the venomous malignity of its nature, ſhall extract poiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from thence: So that it is not to be attributed to the book, that it is abuſed by vain and lewd perſons, but to the vicious nature of thoſe vain and lewd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that do abuſe it.</p>
            <p>But perhaps ſince Ariſtotle's Maſter Piece has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obtained repute, why, at this time of day, we come to obtrude it as a new book upon the world, will be the moſt material objection.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, Firſt, that tranſlations are alike free for every one to make. But, Secondly, having peruſed thoſe ſeveral books that go by that name, I have ſeen none hitherto extant, exactly agreeing with the original, neither for matter nor method, which was a principal motive for me to attempt this
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028209_0006_0FD720515D7DDDA0"/>
work in which, if thoſe who have had the peruſing of it, be not very partial in what they have ſaid, I may venture to affirm, that the accuracy and care that there has been taken of the tranſlation, and the method in which it is now preſented to the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> has not only made it wholly new, but calculated i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> more for the reader's advantage, than any thing that has hitherto been publiſhed of this nature to the world. So that in this book alone, the reader may ſatisfy himſelf, that he has the great Ariſtotle's complete Maſter Piece.</p>
            <p>I have one thing more to acquaint the reader with before I have done, which is that having met with a choice piece of that prince of phyſicians, Hippoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, I could not forbear adding it by way of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to Ariſtotle's Maſter Piece, as being both men highly eminent in their generation: For, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Ariſtotle was highly eſteemed by Alexander the Great; ſo that great prince Artaxerxes had ſo high a value for Hippocrates, upon the account of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſkill in phyſick, that he proffered to honour him with the greateſt dignities of the Perſian Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it he would have vouchſafed to have lived there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hippocrates choſe rather to confine himſelf to a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary life, where he might purſue the various ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathies and antipathies of nature, than to enjoy all the honours of the Perſian Court.</p>
            <p>I have been civil to the reader in acquainting him with what he ſhould find in this treatiſe; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> have no need nor no inclination to court him any farther; for if men will not know when they are well offered, let their own neceſſities inſtruct them better.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IT is ſtrange to ſee how things that are common are ſlighted for that very reaſon, though in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves worthy of the moſt ſerious conſideration; and this is the very caſe, as to the ſubject we are now to treat of. What is the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e more common than the begetting of children? And yet what is there more wonderful and myſterious than the plaſtick power of nature, by which they are formed? For though there be radicated in the very nature of all creatures a propenſion which leads them to produce the image of themſelves, yet how theſe images are produced, after theſe propenſions are ſatisfied, is only known to thoſe who trace the ſecret meanders of nature in their private chambers, thoſe dark receſſes of the womb, where the embryo receives formation. The original of all which proceeds from the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the great Lord of the creation, "Increaſe and multiply." The natural inclination and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of both ſexes to each other, with the plaſtick power of nature, is not only the energy of the firſt bleſſing, which to this day upholds the ſpecies of mankind in the world.</p>
               <p>Now ſince philoſophy informs us that, "Noſce te ipſum," is one of the firſt leſſons a man ought to learn; it cannot ſurely be accounted an uſeleſs piece of knowledge for a man to be acquainted with the cauſe of his own being, or by what ſecret power of nature it was, that coagulated milk (as a divine
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028209_0008_0FD72057CAF8DE50"/>
author calls it) came to be tranſubſtantiated into a human body. The explanation of this myſtery, and the unfolding the plaſtick power of nature in the ſecret workings of generation, and the formation of the ſeed in the womb, is the ſubject of the following treatiſe; a ſubject ſo neceſſary to be known by all the female ſex (the conception and bearing of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, being what nature has ordained their province) that many, for the want of this knowledge, have periſhed with the fruit of their womb alſo; who had they but underſtood the ſecrets of generation, which are diſplayed in this book, might have been ſtill in the land of the living; for the ſake of ſuch therefore, I have compiled this treatiſe, which I ſhall divide into two parts; in each of which I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this method: In the firſt part I ſhall,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Shew that nature has no need to be aſhamed of any of her works; give a particular deſcription of the parts or organs of generation in men, and afterwards in women; and then ſhow the uſe of theſe parts in the act of coition; and how appoſite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nature has adapted them to the end which ſhe has ordained them.</p>
               <p>Secondy, I ſhall ſhew the prohibition or reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Creator of all things, and the Lord of nature has put upon man, by the inſtitution of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; with the advantage it brings to mankind.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſhall ſhew when either ſex may enter into a married ſtate, and be fit to anſwer the ends of their creation, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I ſhall diſcourſe of virginity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhew what it is, how it is known, by what means it may be loſt, and how a perſon may know that it is ſo, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond part, which chiefly relates to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried women and the preſervation of the fruit of their womb, for the propagation of mankind to the world I ſhall ſhew,</p>

                     <head>§. <hi>1.</hi> Of the Inſtruments of Generation in Man, with a particular Deſcription thereof.</head>
                     <p>THOUGH the inſtruments, or parts of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all creatures, with reſpect to their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form, are not, perhaps, the more comely, yet, in compenſation of that, nature has put upon them a more abundant and far greater honour than on other parts, in that it has ordained them to be the means by which every ſpecies of being is continued from one generation to another; and therefore, though a man or woman were through the bounty of nature, endowed with the moſt angelick counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and the moſt exact ſymmetry and proportion of parts, that concurred together to the making up of a moſt perfect beauty; yet, if they were defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the inſtruments of generation, they would not, for all their beauty, be acceptable, either to the other ſex; becauſe they would be thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028209_0010_0FD7205E38969280"/>
incapable of ſatisfying the natural propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which every one finds in themſelves; and this methinks ſhould be ſufficient to ſhew the great hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our nature has put upon them. And therefore ſince it is our duty to be acquainted with ourſelves, and to ſearch out the wonders of God in nature, I need not make any apology for anatomizing the ſecret parts of generation.</p>
                     <p>The organ of generation in man, nature has placed obvious to the ſight, and is called the Yard, and becauſe hanging without the belly is called Penis a Pendendo: It is in form long, round, and on the upper ſide flattiſh, and conſiſts of ſkin, tendons, veins, arteries and ſinews, being ſeated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Oſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>a Pubis, and ordained by nature for a two fold work, viz. For the evacuating of urine, and conveying the ſeed into the matrix. The urine which it evacuates, is brought to it through the neck of the Veſica Urinaria, and the ſeed which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys into the matrix, is brought into it from the Veſiculae Seminales. But to be more particular.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the common parts, as the cuticle, the ſkin, and the membrana Carnoſa, it hath ſeveral internal parts proper to it, of which there are ſeven, viz.</p>
                     <p>The two nervous bodies: The ſeptum; the ureth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra; the glands; the muſcles; and the veſſels. Of theſe diſtinctly in the order I have placed them, and firſt, of</p>
                     <p>The two nervous bodies: Theſe are called ſo from their being ſurrounded with a thick, white, nervous membrane, though their inward ſubſtance is ſpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, as conſiſting principally of veins, arteries, and nervous fibres, interwoven together like a net. And nature has ſo ordered it, that when the nerves are filled with animal ſpirits, and the arteries with hot and ſpirituous blood then the yard is diſtended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and becomes erect; but when the flux of the ſpirits <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſe, then the blood, and the remaining ſpirits are
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028209_0011_0FD720656E6862E8"/>
abſorbed or ſucked up by the veins and ſo the penis becomes limber and flaggy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond internal part is the ſeptum lucid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, and this is in ſubſtance white and nervous, or ſinewy, and its office is to uphold the two lateral or ſide ligaments, and the Urethra.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third is the Urethra, which is only the channel by which both the ſeed and the urine are conveyed out; it is in ſubſtance ſoft and looſe, thick and ſinewy, like that of the ſide ligaments. It begins at the neck of the bladder, but ſprings not from thence, only is joined to it, and ſo proceeds to the glands: It has three holes in the beginning, the largeſt whereof is in the midſt, for that receives the urine into it; the other two are ſmaller, receiving the ſeed from each ſeminal veſſel.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The fourth is the glands, which are at the end of the penis covered with a very thin membrane, by reaſon of which it is of a moſt exquiſite feeling. It is covered with a preputium or foreſkin, which in ſome covers the top of the yard quite cloſe, in oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers not; and by its moving up and down in the act of copulation brings pleaſure both to the man and woman. The extreme part of this cover, which I call preputium, and which is ſo Called <hi>a preputanla</hi> from cutting off, is that the Jews were commanded to cut oſt it on the eighth day. The ligament by which it is faſtened to the glands is called fraenum or the bridle.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The fifth thing is the muſcles, and theſe are four in number, two being placed on each ſide. Theſe muſcles (which are inſtruments of voluntary motions, and without which no part of the body can move itſelf) conſiſt of fibrous fleſh to make up their body; of nerves for the ſenſes; of veins for the vital heat; and of a membrane or ſkin to kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and to diſtinguiſh one muſcle from another, and all of them from the fleſh. I have already ſaid, that there are two of them on each ſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="14" facs="unknown:028209_0012_0FD7206894C21E10"/>
and I will now add, that one on each ſide is ſhorter and thicker; and that their uſe is to erect the yard from whence they have obtained the name of erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. And having told you, two of them are thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſhorter than the other, I need not tell you that the other two are longer and thinner, only I take notice, that the office of the two laſt is to dilate, or if you will, open the lower part of the Ureth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, both for making water and voiding the ſeed, and therefore are called accelerators.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The ſixth and laſt things are the veſſels which conſiſt of veins, nerves, and arteries; of which, ſome paſs by the ſkin, and are viſible to the eye, and others paſs more inwardly; for indeed the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries are diſperſed through the body of the yard, much more than the veins, and this diſperſion is contrarywiſe, the right artery being diſperſed to the left ſide, and the left to the right; as for the two nerves, the greater is beſtowed upon the two muſcles and the body of the yard, and the leſſer upon the ſkin.</p>
                     <p>What I have hitherto ſaid, relates to the yard, properly ſo called; but becauſe there are ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendices belonging thereto, which when wanting, render the yard of no uſe in the act of generation, it will alſo be neceſſary, before I conclude this ſection to ſay ſomething of them; I mean the ſtones or teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles ſo called, becauſe they teſtify the perſon to be a man: Their number and place are obvious; as to their uſe, in them the blood brought thither by the ſpermatick arteries, is elaborated into the ſeed. They have coats or coverings of two ſorts, proper and common; the common are two and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt both the Teſticles; the outermoſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon coats conſiſts of the Cuticula, or true ſkin, called Scorum, hanging out of the Abdomen like a purſe; the Membrana Carnoſa is the innermoſt. The proper coats are likewiſe two; the outer called Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

ſide of the teſticles are fixed the Epidymaides, or Paraſtata, from whence ariſe the Vaſa Deferentiae, or Ejaculatoria; which when they approach near the neck of the bladder, depoſit the ſeed into the Veſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae Seminales, which are each (for there are two of them) like a bunch of grapes, and emit the ſeed into the Urethra, in the act of copulation. Near theſe are the Paraſtatae, which are about the bigneſs of a walnut, and join to the neck of the bladder; theſe afford an oily, ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels by which the blood is conveyed to the Teſtes, out of which the ſeed is made, are the Arteriae Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticae, and theſe are alſo two; and ſo likewiſe are the veins, which carry on the remaining blood which are called Venae Spermaticae.</p>

with as much modeſty and ſobriety as will conſiſt with our ſpeaking intelligibly; for it is better to ſay nothing than to ſpeak ſo as not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
                     <p>The external parts, commonly called Pudenda (from the ſhamefacedneſs that is in women to have them ſeen) are the lips of the great orifice, which are viſible to the eye, and in thoſe that are grown, are covered with hair, and have pretty ſtore of ſpungy fat; their uſe being to keep the internal parts from all annoyance by outward accidents.</p>
                     <p>Within theſe are the Nymphae, or wings, which preſent themſelves to the eye when the lips are ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, and conſiſt of ſoft and ſpungy fleſh, and the doubling of the ſkin placed at the ſides of the neck; they compaſs the Clytoris, and both in form and colour reſemble the comb of a cock, looking freſh and red, and in act of coition receive the Penis or Yard between them; beſides which, they g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſometimes out of the body two inches, but that happens not but upon ſome extraordinary accident. It conſiſts, as I have ſaid, of two ſpungy and ſkinny bodies, which being a diſtinct original from the Os Pubis; the head of it being covered with a tender ſkin, having a hole like the yard of a man, but not through, in which, and the bigneſs of it, it only differs from it.</p>
                     <p>The next thing is the paſſage of the urine which is under the Clytoris, and above the neck of the womb, ſo that the urine of a woman comes not through the neck of the womb, neither is the paſſage com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as in men, but particular and by itſelf. This paſſage opens itſelf into the fiſſares to evacuate the urine; for the ſecuring of which from cold or any other inconveniency, there is one of the four car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles, or fleſhy knobs placed before it, which ſhut up the paſſage; for theſe knobs which are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber four, and in reſemblance like myrtle berries, and placed behind the wings before ſpoken of, quad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangularly one againſt the other. Theſe are round in virgins, but hang flagging when virginity is loſt; it is the uppermoſt of thoſe that nature has placed for the ſecuring of the urinary paſſage from cold, and which is therefore largeſt, and for that end.</p>

virgins, but in thoſe that have often uſed copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it comes by degrees to be extinguiſhed; ſo that the inner ſide of the neck of the womb appears ſmooth and in old women it becomes hard and griſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But though this channel be ſinking down, writh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and crooked, yet it is otherwiſe in the time of copulation, as alſo when women are under their monthly purgation, or in labour, being then very much extended, which is a great cauſe of their pains.</p>
                     <p>The Clauſtrum Virginale, commonly called the hymen, is that which cloſes the neck of the womb; for between the duplicity of the two tunicles, which conſtitutes the neck of the womb, there are many veins and arteries running along, that ariſe from the veſſels of both ſides of the thighs, and paſs into the neck of the womb, being very large; and the reaſon thereof is, becauſe the neck of the womb re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to be filled with abundance of ſpirits, to be dilated thereby that it may better take hold of the Penis, ſuch motions requiring great heat, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made more intenſe by the act of frication, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes a great deal of moiſture; in the ſupplying whereof large veſſels are very neceſſary. Hence it is, that the neck of the womb in women of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtature, in eight inches in lenghth. But there is alſo another cauſe for the largeneſs of theſe veſſels, (i. e.) becauſe their monthly purgations make their way through them, and for this reaſon women, though with child, often continue them; for though the womb be ſhut up, yet the paſſage in the neck of the womb, through which theſe veſſels paſs, is open. And therefore as ſoon as you penetrate the Puden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, there may be ſeen two little pits or holes, and in which are contained a humour, and which being preſt out in the time of coition, does greatly delight the fair ſex.</p>
                     <p>Though theſe we have already mentioned, are prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly the parts appropriated for the work of gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, yet there are other parts, without which gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration work cannot be accompliſhed, of which
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028209_0017_0FD720734B324D70"/>
we muſt alſo give a deſcription, and the principal of theſe is the womb, which is the field of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without which nothing can be done. The parts we have been already ſpeaking of, being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by nature only, as it were ſo many vehicles to convey the ſeed into the womb, which being preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated therewith, by virtue of the plaſtick power of nature, produceth its own likeneſs.</p>
                     <p>The womb is ſituated in the lower parts of the Hypogaſtrion, being joined to its neck, and placed between the bladder and the ſtraight gut, ſo that it is kept from ſwaying or rolling, yet hath it liberty to ſtretch and dilate itſelf, and alſo to contract itſelf, according as nature in that caſe diſcloſes it. It is of a round figure, ſomething like a gourd; leſſening and growing more acute towards one end, being knit together by its proper ligaments, and its neck joined by its own ſubſtance, and certain membranes that faſten it to the Os Sacrum and the mare bone. It is very different with reſpect to its largeneſs in women, eſpecially between ſuch as have had chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and thoſe that have had none. It is ſo thick in ſubſtance, that it exceeds a thumb's breadth, and after conception augments to a greater proportion, and to ſtrengthen it yet more, it is interwoven with fibres, overthwart, but ſtraight and winding; and its proper veſſels are veins, arteries and nerves; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which there are two little veins, which paſs from the ſpermatic veſſels to the bottom of the womb; and two bigger than the hypogaſtricks, touching both the bottom and the neck, the mouth of theſe veins piercing as far as the inward concavity.</p>
                     <p>The womb, beſides what I have already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, has two arteries on both ſides the ſpermatic veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and the hypogaſtricks, which ſtill accompany the veins with ſundry little nerves, knit and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven in the form of a net, which are alſo extended throughout, even from the bottom to the pudenda themſelves, being ſo placed chiefly for the ſenſe of

pleaſure, ſympathetically moving from the head of the womb.</p>
                     <p>Here the reader ought to obſerve, that the two lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments hanging on either ſide of the womb from the ſhare bone, piercing through the Peritonoeum, and joined to the bone itſelf, cauſes the womb to be moveable, which upon ſundry occaſions, either fall low or riſe high. The neck of the womb is of a moſt exquiſite ſenſe, ſo that if it be at any time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, either with a ſchirroſity, too much flat moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or relaxation, the womb is much ſubject to barrenneſs. In thoſe that are near their delivery, there uſually ſtays a moſt glutinous matter in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, to facilitate the birth, for at that time the mouth of the womb is opened to ſuch a wideneſs, a is in proportion to the largeneſs of the child, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an equal dilation from the bottom to the top.</p>
                     <p>Under the parts belonging to generation in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are alſo comprehended the preparatory or ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick veſſels. The preparatory veſſels differ no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neither are they united as they are in men, before they come to the ſtones, but are divided into two branches, whereof the greater only paſſeth to the ſtones, the leſſer to the fecundated egg, and this is properly called conception.

Thirdly, it ſtrongly operates in ſending forth the birth when its appointed time is accompliſhed; there dilating it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in an extraordinary manner, and ſo aptly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the ſenſes, that no injury can accrue to it from thence retaining in itſelf a ſtrength and power to operate, and caſt forth the birth.</p>
                     <p>The uſe of the preparing veſſels is to convey the blood to the teſticles, of which a part is ſpent to the nouriſhment of them, and the production of thoſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bladders which in all things reſemble eggs, through which the Vaſa Preparantia run, and are obliterated in them. This conveyance of blood is by arteries, but as for the veins, their office is to bring back what blood remains from the aforementioned uſe.</p>
                     <p>The veſſels of this kind are much ſhorter in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men than men, by reaſon of their nearneſs to the teſticles; and yet that defect is more than made good by the many intricate windings to which they are ſubject; for in the middle way they divide themſelves into two branches of different magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: for one of them being bigger than the other, paſſes to the teſticles.</p>
                     <p>The teſticles in women are very uſeful; for where they are defective, generation work is quite ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for though theſe little bladders, which are on their outward ſuperficies, contain nothing of ſeed, as the followers of Galen, &amp;c. erroneouſly imagine, yet they contain ſeveral eggs, (about the number of twenty in each teſticle) one of which being impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the moſt ſpirituous part of the man's ſeed in the act of coition, deſcends through the oviducts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the womb where it is cheriſhed, till it becomes a living child.

                     <p>And therefore thoſe who do complain of marriage if they would but examine their own carriage and behaviour in it better, would find it is themſelves who make marriage ſo uneaſy; for as once Cicero ſaid of old age, it was not old age, but the folly of old men, that made it ſo burdenſome; ſo I may ſay of marriage, it is not marriage, but the folly of perſons married that makes it ſo uneaſy. If married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would but each take care to do their ſeveral and reſpective duties, there would be no complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor would they find any condition more pleaſant or more profitable than a married life; there being more ſatisfaction to be taken in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of a loving and chaſte wife, than in the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton dalliances of all the ſtrumpets in the world; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the bleſſings that attend the one, and that ruin, miſery, and heavy curſe that always waits on the other.

                     <head>§ <hi>3.</hi> At what age young men and virgins are capable of carnal copulation, and why they ſo much deſire it.</head>
                     <p>Having ſhewn the reſtriction laid upon men and women, with reſpect to promiſcuous coition, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the pleaſure and advantage of a married life, I now proceed to ſhew at what age young men and virgins are capable of the marriage bed; which becauſe ſo many deſire before they attain to it, it will be neceſſary to ſhew the cauſe of thoſe impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſires.</p>
                     <p>The inclinations of virgins to marriage, are to be known by divers ſymptoms; for when they arrive to ripe age, which is about fourteen or fifteen, then natural purgations begin to flow, and then the blood which no longer ſerves for the increaſe of their bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies, does, by its abundance, ſtir up their minds to venery, to which alſo external cauſes may excite them; for their ſpirits are briſk and inflamed when they arrive at this age, and their bodies are often more heated by their eating ſharp and ſalt things, and by ſpices, by which their deſire of venereal em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces become very great, at ſome critical junctures almoſt inſuperable. And the uſe of thoſe ſo much deſired enjoyments being denied to virgins, is often followed by very dangerous, and ſometimes diſmal conſequences, precipitating them into thoſe follies that may bring an indelible ſtain upon their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, or elſe it brings upon them the green ſickneſs or other diſeaſes. But when they are married, and thoſe deſires ſatisfied by their huſbands, thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers vaniſh, and their beauty returns more gay and lively than before. And this ſtrong inclination of theirs may be known by their eager gazing at men, and affecting their company, which ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrates that nature prompts them to deſire coition. Nor is this the caſe of virgins only, but the ſame may be obſerved in young briſk widows, who cannot be ſatisfied without that due benevolence
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028209_0025_0FD720AD70E37508"/>
paid them which they were wont to have from their huſbands.</p>
                     <p>At fourteen years of age, commonly the menſes begin to flow in virgins; at which time they are capable of conceiving, and therefore fit for marriage though it would be much better, both for themſelves and their children if they married not till eighteen or twenty; and if they be very healthy and ſtrong of body, and always addict themſelves to temperance they may continue bearing till upwards of fifty, though generally they leave off about forty five: For the menſes flow a longer time in ſome than in others; but when they ceaſe, they ceaſe bearing. And therefore the bearing of Iſaac unto Sarah at that age, may well be termed miraculous, becauſe it had ceaſed to be with her according to the cuſtom of women.</p>
                     <p>As for male youth, when they arrive at 16, or between that and 17, having much vital ſtrength, they may be capable of getting children; which ability, by the force and heat of procreating matter, conſtantly increaſe till 45, 59, 65, and then begins to flag, the ſeed by degrees becoming unfruitful, the natural ſpirits being extinguiſhed, and the heat dried up. Thus it is with them for the moſt part. But many times it falls out otherwiſe in particular inſtances; as once in Sweedland, a man who was married at a hundred years old to a bride of 30, had many children by her; but he was a man of ſo hale a conſtitution, and carried his age ſo well, that ſtrangers would not have gueſſed him above ſixty. And in Champania, where the air is clear and temperate, it is uſual for men of eighty years old to marry young virgins, and have children by them; which ſhews, that age in men hinders not procreation, unleſs they be exhauſted in their youth and their yard ſhrivelled up.</p>

                     <p>IN the laſt chapter I treated of the deſire that young men and virgins have to mutual embraces, and at what age they are fit for them, have alſo ſhewed that thoſe pleaſures are only to be enjoyed in a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſtate, and have alſo acquainted my reader with the advantage of ſuch a condition, but ſince the deſires of many, after mutual embraces, are ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous, that not having an opportunity to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a married ſtate, they have anticipated the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures of matrimony, and loſt their virginity before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and yet perhaps, have afterwards pretended to bring their virginity to a marriage bed, by which means many an honeſt man has been deceived, and meretricious women eſcaped with impunity; and, on the other hand, ſome virtuous young virgins, that have indeed come ſuch into their huſband's beds, have been accuſed by the ignorance and incredulity of their huſbands to have loſt their virginity before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand when there has been no ſuch matter. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to do right in this caſe, to both parties, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n in this chapter is to ſhew, what virginity is,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028209_0027_0FD720B4C6A318C0"/>
and wherein it conſiſts: How many ways it may be loſt; and how a man may know whether it be loſt or not, that ſo women may not be wrongfully cenſured, or men impoſed upon.</p>
                     <p>Virginity untouched and taintleſs, is the boaſt and pride of the fair ſex, but they generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to put it off: For as good as it is, they care not how ſoon they are honeſtly rid of it. And I think they are in the right, for if they keep it too long it grows uſeleſs, or at leaſt loſes much of its value, a ſtale virgin (if ſuch a thing there be) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing looked upon like an old almanack out of date. But to ſpeak to the purpoſe; virginity is the chief, the beſt, the firſt, the prime of any thing, and is properly the integrity of a woman's privities, not violated by man, or not known by him; it being the diſtinguiſhing characteriſtick of a virgin, that ſhe has not known man.</p>
                     <p>To make this more plain, I muſt here obſerve, that there is in maids, in the neck of the womb, a membranous production called the Hymen, which is like the bud of a roſe half blown, and this is broken in the firſt act of copulation with man; and hence came the word Defloro, to deſlower; whence the taking away of virginity is called the deflowering of a virgin; for when the roſe bud is expanded, virginity is wholly loſt. Certain it is, there is in the firſt act of copulation ſomething which cauſes pain and bleeding, which is an evident ſign of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity. But what this is, authors agree not. Some ſay it is a nervous membrane, or thin ſkin, with ſmall veins, which bleed at the firſt penetration of the yard. Others ſay, it is the four carbuncles, knobs, or little buds, like myrtle berries, which are plump and full in virgins, but hang looſe and flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in thoſe that have uſed copulation, being preſſed by the yard. Some have obſerved a fleſhy circle about the nymphae or neck of the womb, with little obſcure veins which make the membrane not to be nervous, but fleſhy. But ſetting aſide conjecture,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028209_0028_0FD720B754E8BCC8"/>
the hymen or clauſtrum virginale, is a thin mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane interwoven with fleſhy fibres and endowed with many little arteries and veins, ſpread acroſs the paſſage of the bladder, with a hole in the midſt for the menſes to flow, ſo big that it will admit of the top of one's little finger; this is that which is called the zone or girdle of chaſtity; and where it is found in this form deſcribed it is a certain note of virginity; but in the firſt act of copulation, it is neceſſarily violated; and then it is uſually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with an effuſion of blood; which blood is called the flower of virginity; and when once it is broken, it never cloſes again.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>In the former ſection I have ſhewn (I hope to the ſatisfaction of all modeſt enquirers) in what vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity conſiſts, and that it is loſt by the firſt pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the yard; which may be eaſily known by its being attended with an effuſion of blood upon the rupture of the hymeneal membrane, or Clauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum Virginale. But I muſt do the fair ſex this piece of juſtice, to let the world know that although, wherever this is found, it be an undoubted token of virginity, yet it will not follow, that where this is wanting, virginity is deflowered and loſt; for the hymen may be corroded by acrimonious and fretting humours, flowing through it with the menſes; or it may be violated by the inverſion, or falling out of the uterus, or of the vagina, or ſheath, which ſometimes happens even to virgins; or (which I would have all virgins beware of, for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their credit, and preventing all cauſes of ſuſpicion) perhaps the indiſcreet or unwary bride had her menſes but a day or two before: In which caſe both the hymen and the inner wrinkled mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the vagina are flaggy and relaxed, ſo that no ſuch rupture, and by conſequence, no ſuch effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may happen. It were better therefore upon this account, that when virgins are about to marry,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028209_0029_0FD720C4115C5DD0"/>
they would fix the wedding day, at leaſt ſix or ſeven days after their menſes have done flowing.</p>
                     <p>But farther, to ſome nature hath given greater deſires after enjoyment, than others; and to ſuch, though they abſtain from enjoyment, yet ſo great is their luſt and deſire after it, that it may break the hymen and Clauſtrum Virginale, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it itcheth to that degree that they put in their finger, and ſo break it. Sometimes the midwives break it in the birth; and ſometimes it is done by ſtopping the urine, coughing, violent ſtraining, or ſneezing: So though there be no bleeding at the firſt penetration of the huſband, it is not always a ſign of unchaſtity, or that another has been there before him, ſeeing that the hymeneal membrane may be broken ſo many ways; but where bleeding does follow, it is an evident and undeniable token that the perſon was a virgin, and had never known man before. And indeed though the hymen (or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane ſo called) may be broken all thoſe ways I have mentioned, yet it ſo rarely happens to be broken any other way, that Leo Africanus makes mention of it as a general cuſtom of the Africans at their wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that after the marriage ceremonies are over, the bride and bridegroom are ſhut up in a chamber, while the wedding dinner is preparing, and an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient woman ſtands at the door to receive from the bridegroom a ſheet having the bloody tokens of his wife's virginity, which ſhe ſhews in triumph to all the gueſts; and then they may feaſt with joy: But if there is no blood ſeen, the bride is to be ſent home again to her friends with diſgrace, and the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed gueſts go ſadly home without their dinner.</p>
                     <p>There are others that make the ſtraitneſs of their privities a ſign of virginity; but this is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain: For this depends much upon the age, hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it of body, and other circumſtances. But though it muſt indeed be granted, that women who have uſed carnal copulation are not ſo ſtrait as virgins yet this cannot be a certain argument of virginity;
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028209_0030_0FD720C41530E570"/>
becauſe after often repeated acts of venery, the priv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities may be made ſo ſtrait by the uſe of aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent medicines, that thoſe who truſt to this ſign, may ſometimes take a whore inſtead of a virgin. And I have heard of a courtezan, who, though ſhe had been married, gave herſelf out to be a virgin, and by the help of a bath of comfrey roots, deceived thoſe with whom ſhe had to do.</p>
                     <p>Others take upon them to be judges of loſt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity, by milk in their breaſts; but ſuch perhaps are ignorant that there is a twofold milk, the one of virgins, the other of ſuch as have conceived or brought forth children; that of virgins, is a mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy contrary to nature, but the other is natural The firſt is made of blood that cannot get out of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We muſt therefore in this ſecond part proceed on, and ſhew

what conception is, and the ſigns and tokens there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and what are the prerequiſites thereunto; for when once a woman has conceived, the work of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration is begun, and time, with nature's help, will perfect the work.

The next thing is the paſſive principle of the foetus (for there muſt be both in order to conception) and there is an ovum or egg impregnated by the man's ſeed, endowed with a plaſtic or vegetative virtue; and upon the ovum being thus impregnated by the man's ſeed, or being conveyed to it, the womb cloſes up, that no air may enter therein, but that the impregnated ovum may ſwell into a foetus.

                     <p>I have ſhewn in the former ſection, that there are two things to be regarded chiefly in conception, to wit, the active and paſſive principle. This in part ſhews, that difference of ſexes is a prerequiſite to conception. So nature has ordained there muſt be a proper vehicle for the active principle to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected thereunto, and there muſt alſo be a paſſive principle to be impregnated thereby: Therefore as the man has no paſſive principle to be impregnated ſo the woman has no active principle to impregnate, and therefore, without different ſexes, there can be no conception.</p>
                     <p>But this is not all; for it is not enough that there
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028209_0033_0FD720CADA13DF70"/>
be different ſexes, but theſe different ſexes muſt unite, and there muſt be coition, in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; and it is coition, or the natural embraces of both ſexes, which nature hath made ſo deſirable to each other; which, when authoriſed in the way that heaven has ordained, there is no need of raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for the fair bride will quickly meet her bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom with equal vigour. But ſince in that there may be overdoing, and ſuch errors committed, by their giving way to the impetuoſity of their deſires, as may be prejudicial to conception, it will not be amiſs to give ſome directions to make this operation the more effectual.</p>

She ought alſo to have a care of ſneezing, and if poſſible, to avoid both that and coughing, or any thing that cauſes too violent a motion of the body: Neither ſhould they too often reiterate thoſe amorous engagements, till the conception be confirmed; and even then the bridegroom ſhould remember, that it is a market that laſts all the year, and to be careful that he does not ſpend his ſtore too laviſhly; nor will his wife like him at all the worſe for it; for generally wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en rather chooſe to have a thing done well, than have it often: And in this caſe to do it well and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is inconſiſtent.

but becauſe the ſucceſs of all our actions depends upon the divine bleſſing, and other things do not always ſucceed according to our deſires, therefore conception does not always follow upon coition; for which reaſon it is that many women, eſpecially thoſe that are but newly married, know not whether they have conceived or not, after coition; which if they were aſſured of, they might and would avoid ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al inconveniences, which they run upon through ignorance thereof, for when after conception a wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an finds an alteration in herſelf, and yet knows not from whence it proceeds, ſhe is apt to run to a doctor, and enquireth of him what the matter is, who not knowing that ſhe is with child, perhaps gives her a ſtrong cathartical potion, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly deſtroys the conception. There are others, that out of a fooliſh baſhful coyneſs, though they do not know that they have conceived, yet will not confeſs, that they may be inſtructed how to order themſelves accordingly. Thoſe that are coy may in time learn to be wiſer, and for the ſake of thoſe that are ignorant, I ſhall ſet them down the ſigns of conception, that women may thereby know whether they have conceived or not.</p>

an alſo, when ſhe riſes up from her chair, doth ſooner ſtay herſelf upon the right hand than on her left; alſo the belly lies rounder and higher than when it is a female. The colour of the woman is not ſo ſwarthy, but more clear than when it is a girl. The right ſide is likewiſe more plump and harder than the left; the right nipple redder. She like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe breeds a boy eaſier and with leſs pain than a girl, and carries her burden not ſo heavily, but is more nimble and ſtirring.</p>
                     <p>I will only, as to this, add the following experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which I never knew to fail: If the circle of the woman's eyes, which is of a wan, blue colour, be more apparent under the right eye, and that moſt diſcoloured, ſhe is with child of a boy; if the mark be moſt apparent in her left eye, ſhe is with child of a girl. The other is, let her drop a drop of her milk in a baſon of fair water, if it ſinks to the bottom as it drops in, round in a drop, it is a girl ſhe is with child of; for, if it be a boy, it will ſhred and ſwim a top; this I have often tried, and it never failed. This is enough to ſatisfy the curious; for others let them ſtay till the birth decide it.</p>

                     <p>I AM very well ſatisfied that many women deſire copulation, not from any delight or ſatisfaction they take therein, more than as it is the means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him that bids us increaſe and multiply, for the obtaining of children, and the propagation
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028209_0039_0FD720EBA1CA19C8"/>
of mankind: And though ſeveral make uſe of coition to obtain this end, yet we find by experience, that in many it does not ſucceed, becauſe they order not themſelves as they ought to do: For though it muſt be granted, that all our endeavours depend upon the divine bleſſing; yet if we are wanting in any thing to ourſelves, how can we expect that bleſſing to ſucceed our endeavours? My buſineſs therefore in this ſection, ſhall be to ſhow how women, that deſire to have children ſhould order themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, women that are deſirous to have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, muſt in order thereunto, give themſelves to moderate exerciſe? for want of exerciſe and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are very great enemies to the work of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration; and indeed are enemies both to the ſoul and to the body. And thoſe that ſhall give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the trouble to obſerve it, will find thoſe city dames that live high, and do nothing, ſeldom have children, or if they have, they ſeldom live; whereas the poor women that accuſtom themſelves to labour, have many children and thoſe ſtrong and luſty. Nor need we wonder at it, if we conſider the benefit that comes by moderate exerciſe and labour; for it opens the pores, quickens the ſpirits, ſtirs up the nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural heat, ſtrengthens the body, ſenſes and ſpirits, comforts the limbs, and helps nature in all her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, of which procreation of children is none of the leaſt.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond thing to be obſerved by women in order to conception is that they avoid all manner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and the occaſion of it; for diſcontent is a great enemy to conception, and it ſo diſpirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> either man or woman that it hinders them from putting forth their vigour, which ought to be exerted in the act of coition, when, on the contrary, content and ſatisfaction of mind dilate the heart and arteries, whereby the vital blood and ſpirits are freely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed through the body; and thence ariſe ſuch affections as pleaſe, recreate and refreſh the nature of man, as hope, joy, love, gladneſs and mirth. Nor

do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> it only comfort and ſtrengthen the body, but alſo the operation and imagination of the mind which is ſo much the more neceſſary, inſomuch as the imagination of the mother works forcibly upon the conception of the child; women therefore ought to take great care that their imagination be pure and clear, that their children may be well formed.</p>
                     <p>A third thing that women ought to take care of, to further conception, is to keep the womb in good order; and to that end, to ſee that the menſes come down as they ought to do; for if they are diſcol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured they are out of order: But if the blood come down pure, then the woman will be very prone to conceive with child, eſpecially if they uſe copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in two or three days after the monthly terms are ſtayed.</p>
                     <p>A fourth thing a woman that would conceive ſhould obſerve, is, that ſhe uſe not the act of coition too often, for fatiety gluts the womb, and renders it unfit for its office. There are two things demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates this; that is, that common whores (who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten uſe copulation) have never, or very rarely, any children; for the graſs ſeldom grows in a path that is commonly trodden in. The other is, that thoſe women, whoſe huſbands have been long abſent, do, after copulation with them again, conceive very quickly.</p>
                     <p>A fifth rule is, that they take care the time of copulation be convenient, that there be no fear of ſurpriſe, for fear hinders conception. And then it were beſt alſo that the deſire of copulation be natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and not ſtirred up by provocation: And if it be natural, ſhe greater the womans's deſire after copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, is, the more likely ſhe is to conceive.</p>
                     <p>I will add no more; but what ſome authors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that a loadſtone carried about with the wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, not only cauſeth conception, but concord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and wife, which if it be true, I would have no married woman go without one, both for her own and huſband's quiet.</p>

For in the firſt two months after conception, women are very ſubject to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages; becauſe then the ligaments are weck and ſoon broken. To prevent this, let the woman every morning take a draught of ſage ale, and it will do her abundance of good; but if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſigns of abortion or miſcarriage appear, let her lay a toaſt dipped in tent (in caſe muſkadel can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be gotten) to the navel, for this is very good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>As to the formation of the child, it is to be noted that after the act of coition, the ſeed lies warm in the womb for ſix days without any viſible alteration, only the womb cloſes up itſelf to prevent its iſſuing forth again, and for ſecuring it from any cold; and all this time it looks like butter, or coagulated milk; and it would be very neceſſary for her, who has reaſon to believe ſhe has conceived, to forbear the embraces of her huſband all that time, leſt the conception ſhould be ſpoiled; but in three days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is altered from the quality of thick milk or but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and it becomes blood, or at leaſt reſembles it

in colour, nature having now begun to work upon it, ſo they may begin to renew their mutual endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but with a great deal of caution. In the next ſix days following, that blood begins now to be united into one body, and to grow hard, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a little quantity, and to appeal a round lump and as the firſt creation of the earth was void and without form, ſo is the creating work of divine power in the womb, this ſhameleſs embryo lies like the firſt maſs. But in two days after, the principal members are formed by the plaſtick power of nature and theſe principal members, viz. the heart, the brain, the liver, and the teſticles or ſtones. Three days after the other members are formed, and are diſtinguiſhed from the ſhoulders by the forming fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulty, the knees, and the heart, liver, and ſtones, with their appurtenances, do grow bigger and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Four days after that, the ſeveral members of the whole body do appear, and, as nature requires they conjunctly and ſeparately do receive their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And ſo in the appointed time, the whole creation hath that eſſence, which it ought to have to the perfection of it receiving from God a living ſoul, therewith putting into his noſtrils the breath of life. Thus I have ſhewed the whole operation of nature in the formation of the child in the womb according to the energy given it by the divine Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Maker and Upholder of all things both in heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and in earth.</p>
                     <p>By ſome others, more briefly, but to the ſame purpoſe, the forming of the child in the womb of its mother is thus deſcribed. Three days in the milk, three in the blood, twelve days from the fleſh, and eighteen the members, and forty days after, the child is inſpired with life, being endued with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal living ſoul.</p>

In this poſture it uſually keeps to the ſeventh or eighth month, and then by a natural propenſity and diſpoſition of the upper part of the body, the head is turned down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the inward orifice of the womb, tumbling as

                  <p>WE have already inquired into many ſecrets belonging to the generation of man; and have treated largely about conception, which is one of the chief myſteries of nature. But before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any farther, it is highly neceſſary that I treat of the neceſſary obſtructions of conception; which naturally leads me to treat of barrenneſs, which is the grand obſtruction of conception; and herein, for the ſake of all thoſe that deſire children, I ſhall ſhew how it is cauſed, and then how to be cured.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="section">
                     <head>§ <hi>1.</hi> Of Barrenneſs.</head>
                     <p>Seeing all grant, that the having of children is a bleſſing, it will be eaſily granted that bartenneſs is a curſe. And ſince it is manifeſted that it occaſions diſcontent between man and wife, and every woman looks upon it as a reproach to be barren, it will need no apology to enquire into the cauſe of it.</p>
                     <p>In ſome countries, before women were admitted to the marriage bed, they were ſearched by the midwife; and thoſe only which ſhe allowed of as
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:028209_0048_0FD72118723C90B0"/>
fruitful, were permitted to marry. It muſt needs therefore be a grateful piece of ſervice to the fair ſex, to ſhew them how to turn the ſtony ground un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fruitful ſoil, that inſtead of being reproached with a barren womb, they may become the joyful mother of many children.</p>
                     <p>Barrenneſs is a natural and accidental defect which hinders conception; for that which hinders conception cauſes barrenneſs. Now, there may be ſeveral cauſes why conception may be hindered; as over much heat or cold drying up the ſeed, and making it to corrupt; this extinguiſhing the life of the ſeed, and that making it wateriſh and unfit for generation. It may be cauſed alſo by the not flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or by the overflowing of the courſes, and by ſwelling ulcers, or inflammations of the womb, or by an excreſcence of fleſh growing about the mouth of the matrix, whereby the ſeed is hindered from being injected into the womb; and want of love in the perſons copulating, may alſo hinder conception, as is apparent from thoſe women that are deflowered againſt their will: No conception following any forced copulation.</p>
                     <p>And here let me caution parents againſt one thing that often cauſes barrenneſs, which might be eaſily prevented; and that is, againſt letting virgins blood in the arm before their courſes come down; theſe come down in virgins uſually in the fourteenth year of their age, ſeldom before the thirteenth, but never before the twelfth. Now becauſe uſually young virgins are out of order before they firſt break down the mother goes with her to the doctor, who finding that fullneſs of blood is the occaſion of her illneſs, orders her to let blood in the arm; upon which ſhe becomes well for a time, the ſuperfluous blood being taken away; and this remedy, which is ſtill worſe than the diſeaſe, being repeated four or five times, the blood comes not down at all to the womb, as it does in other women, but the womb dries up, and is forever barren: Whereas, had ſhe been let blood
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028209_0049_0FD7211A0DFEA828"/>
in the foot, it would have brought the blood down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and ſo have provoked the terms, and have prevented miſchief.</p>
                     <p>Another cauſe of barrenneſs is for want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient moderate quality, which the woman ought to have with the man; as if he be hot, ſhe muſt be cold; if he be dry, ſhe muſt be moiſt; but if they both be of a dry or both of a moiſt conſtitution, they cannot propagate; though in this caſe neither of them be barren, ſingly conſidered; for he or ſhe, though now as barren as the barren fig tree, yet joined to an apt conſtitution, may become as fruitful as the vine.</p>
                     <p>Another caſe in barrenneſs may be the diſuſe of copulation; for ſome there are of that frigid conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that they either uſe not the means at all, or elſe, perform it with ſo much languor and coldneſs, that it is not likely it ſhould prove efficacious; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as as I have already ſaid, the act of coition ſhould be performed with the greateſt ardour and intenſeneſs of deſire imaginable, or elſe they may as well let it alone, for as good never a whit, as never the better. But ſince nature teaches to do what they do in this kind vigorouſly, this frigid diſpoſition is the effect of a cold diſtemper, and muſt be cured by ſuch things as heat and nouriſh; and therefore ſuch ought to eat and drink of the beſt, ſince the latin proverb tells us, Sine Cerere et Lib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Such therefore ought to feed on cock ſtones and lamb ſtones, ſparrows, partridges, quails, and pheaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant eggs; for it is an infallible aphoriſm in phyſic, that whatſoever any creature is extremely addicted to, they operate to the ſame end by their ſeminal virtue in the man that eats them. Therefore part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridges, quails and ſparrows, &amp;c. being extemely addicted to venery, they work the ſame effect in thoſe that eat them. And this likewiſe is worthy to be noted, that in what part of the body the faculty

that you would ſtrengthen lies, take the ſame part of another creature, in whom that faculty is ſtrong, for a medicine; as for inſtance, the virtus procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva lies in the teſticles, therefore cock ſtones &amp;c, are medical in this diſtemper. Let ſuch perſons alſo eat ſuch food as is very nouriſhing, as parſnips, diſanders, ſkirrits, and pine nuts: and let them take a dram of diaſatyron in an electuary every morning. The ſtones of a ſox dried to powder, and a dram of it taken every morning in tent is alſo very good in this caſe and ſo alſo is a dram of ſaty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion roots, taken in like manner.</p>

                     <p>After married perſons have lived long together, and both ſeem likely, and yet neither of them have had children, there often ariſes diſcontent between them; and both are troubled becauſe they know not on whoſe ſide the fault is; and though authors have left ſeveral ways to know whether the man or the woman be defective, yet becauſe I cannot confide in their judgments, I ſhall paſs them by in ſilence, and rather lay down a few rules that may be depended on, than many that are uncertain. But I muſt firſt premiſe that the women are ſubject to ſo many infirmities more than men, that the cauſe of barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is oftener on their ſide than the men's; for if the man has the inſtrument of generation perfect, being in health, and keeping a regular and temperate diet and exerciſe, I know no accidental cauſe of barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in him; whereas the chief cauſe of barrenneſs in a woman lies in her womb, and the infirmities incident thereunto, ſome of which are the ſtopping of the menſtrua, or their overflowing: As alſo the flux in the womb with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>alling out thereof, and the inflammation, windineſs, heat and dryneſs thereof; for each of which we preſcribe proper cures. But to be a little more particular.</p>
                     <p>If a man or a woman, in whom the inſtruments of
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:028209_0051_0FD7211E4BEE42A0"/>
generation appear no way defective, would know whether the cauſe of barrenneſs be in themſelves, or their bedfellows, let them take a handful of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, or any other corn that will grow quickly and ſteep half of it in the urine of a man, and the other half in the urine of the woman, the ſpace of 24 hours, then take it out and ſet it, the man's by itſelf, and the woman's by itſelf, in a flower pot, or ſomething elſe, then water the man's every morning with his own urine, and the woman's with hers; and that which grows not at all, denotes the perſon to be nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally barren. Nor let any deſpiſe this trial; for if ſeeing phyſicians will by urine undertake to tell a perſon of his or her diſeaſes, why ſhould not urine alſo ſhow whether a perſon be fruitful or not? But if in a man the inſtrument of generation is not perfect it will be obvious to the fight; and if the yard be ſo feeble that it will not admit of erect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>on, it can nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er convey the ſeed into the womb; nor can there be in ſuch caſe any conception. But this is plain and ſo eaſily diſcerned, that it muſt needs be obvious to both parties; and that man that finds himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitated, ought not to marry; or if he does, he muſt be contented if he finds his wife ſeeking for that ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction which he is incapable of giving. It is true, that for a woman to ſupply her huſband's defects is contrary both to honour and virtue; but where a woman doth break thoſe bounds, on ſuch occaſions, the fault will lie in a great meaſure, at the huſband's door, though the wife cannot be held innocent.</p>
                     <p>The caſe cannot be ſo bad with the woman, though ſhe be barren, but that her huſband may make uſe of her unleſs ſhe be impenetrable, which, though it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times does, yet but very rarely happens: Therefore the man is more inexcuſable if he tranſgreſs.</p>
                     <p>Beſides what I have already mentioned, ſigns of barrenneſs in women are. If ſhe be of an over hot conſtitution, of a dry body, ſubject to anger, hath black hair, a quick pulſe, her purgations flow but little, and that with pain, and yet has a violent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

                     <p>In the cure of Barrenneſs, reſpect muſt be had to the cauſe; for the cauſe muſt be firſt removed, and then the womb ſtrengthened, and the ſpirits of the ſeed enlivened by corroborating applications.</p>
                     <p>If barrenneſs proceeds from over much heat, let her uſe inwardly, ſuccory, endive, violets, water lilies, ſorrel and lettuce, with ſyrup, and conſerves made thereof; thus,</p>
                     <p>Take conſerve of borage, violets, ſuccory water-lilies, of each one ounce; half an ounce of conſerve of roſes, diamargariton frigid, diatrion, ſantulon, of each half a dram; with ſyrup of violets, or juice of citron, make an electuary.</p>
                     <p>Let her alſo take of endive, water lilies, borrage flowers of each, a handful: Rheubarb, mirolalans, of each 3 drams; with water make a decoction; add to the ſtraining the ſyrup of laxative violets, an ounce, ſyrup of caſſia, half an ounce; manna, three drams, make all in a potion. Take of the ſyrup of mugwort one ounce, ſyrup of maiden hair two ounces pulv. elect. trionſant. make all up into a julep. Apply to the reins and privities fomentations of the juice of lettuce, violets, roſes, mallows, vine leaves and night ſhade; let her alſo anoint her ſecret parts with the cooling ointment of galls. Baths are good for her to ſit in. Let the air be clear, her garments thin, her food lettuce, endive, ſuccory, and barley; but let her have no hot meats, nor ſtrong wine, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be wateriſh and thin. Reſt is good for her both in body and mind; ſhe muſt uſe little copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but may ſleep as much as ſhe will.</p>
                     <p>If barrenneſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

thick and ſlimy, and flowing not rightly. In this caſe let her take ſyrup of calamint, mugwort, betony, of each an ounce; water of pennyroyal, fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verfew, hyſop, ſage, of each two ounces, and make a julep. Alſo, let her take every morning two ſpoonfuls of cinnamon water, with one ſcruple of mithridate. Alſo let her take oil of anniſeed, one ſcruple and a half; jaſmini, diaclam, both diaſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, diagalang, of each one dram; ſugar four ounces, with water of cinnamon make lozenges; and take of them a dram and a half twice a day, two hours before meals. Let her alſo faſten cupping glaſſes to her lips and belly: And let her take ſtorax calamintis one ounce; maſtich, cloves, cinnamon nutmeg, lignom, aloes, frankincenſe, of each half an ounce: Muſk ten grains, ambergreaſe half a ſcruple with roſe water, make a confection; divide it into four parts; of one part make a pomum odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum to ſmell to if ſhe be not hyſterical; of the ſecond make a maſs of pills, and let her take three every night, of the third make a peſſary, and put it up; and of a fourth make a ſuffumigation for the womb.</p>
                     <p>If barrenneſs ariſes from the faculties of the womb being weakened, and the life of the ſeed ſuffocated by over much humidity flowing on thoſe parts, let her take of betony, marjorum, mugwort, pennyroyal, balm, of each one handful; root of aſarum fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, elechampane, of each two drams, anniſeed and cumminſeed, of each a dram, with ſugar and water a ſufficient quantity, of each make a ſyrup and take three ounces every other morning.

her take of the decoction of ſarſaparilla and virga anted. with a good quantity of ſage, which is an herb of that virtue, that Cornelius Agrippa honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with the title of Sacra Herba a holy herb; and Ladenacus, in his hiſtory of the plants, reports, That after a great plague had happened in Egypt which had almoſt depopulated the country, the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving women were commanded to drink the juice of ſage, that they might multiply the faſter. Let her alſo anoint her genitals with the oil of anniſeed, and ſpikenard. Trochiſes to ſmother the womb are alſo very good. To make which, let her take mace, nutmeg, cinnamon, ſtorax, amber, of each one dram, cloves, labdani, of each half a dram; turpentine a ſufficient quantity. Laſtly, take the roots of vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian and elechampane, of each one pound; of galin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal three ounces; origan, lavender, marjoram, betony, mugwort, bay leaves, calamint, of each three handfuls; with water make an infuſion, in which let her ſet after ſhe hath had her courſes. But to proceed.</p>
                     <p>If barrenneſs be cauſed by the dryneſs of the womb conſuming the matter of the feed; let her take every day almonds and goat's milk, extracted with honey. Eat often of the root of ſatyrion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, and of the electuary of diaſatyrion. Let her alſo take three weather's heads, and boil them till the fleſh comes from the bones; then take of meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, violets, camomile, mercury, with the roots of each a handful; or this, ſenugreek, linſeed, vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian roots, of each one pound, let all theſe be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted in the aforeſaid broth, and let the woman ſit in the decoction up to the navel. Alſo take of deer's ſuet half an ounce, cow's marrow, ſtyracis, liqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didae, of each a dram, oil of ſweet almonds, two ounces with ſilk or cotton make a peſſary, and make injections of freſh butter and oil of ſweet almonds.</p>
                     <p>It ſometimes happens that barrenneſs is cauſed by remiſſneſs in the manner of the act of coition, and though there be no impediment on either ſide, yet
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028209_0055_0FD7213467D203F8"/>
if both ſexes meet not in that act with equal vigour, no conception follows; for many times the man is too quick for the woman, or rather the woman too ſlow for the man: And thoſe that follow the opinion of the ancients, that the woman contributes ſeed to the formation of the child as well as the man, are of opinion that there ought to be a joint emiſſion both of the man and woman at the ſame inſtant; which adminiſtering to both a very great delight, perfects the work of conception. But if in this caſe the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be ſlack the man ſhould follow the advice given in chap. iii. § 2. where both ſexes are ſhewed how to manage themſelves in the act of coition; that ſo by ſtirring up in the woman a deſire of venery, ſhe may meet his embraces with the greateſt ardour. But if this ſhould prove ineffectual, let her, before the act of coition, foment the privities with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of betony, ſage, hyſſop and calamint, and anoint the mouth of the neck of the womb with muſk and civet; and the cauſe of barrenneſs removed, let the womb be corroborated by the following appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
                     <p>Take of the bay berries, maſtich, nutmeg, frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe, cypreſs nuts, labdani, galbani, of each one dram; ſtyracis liquidae, two ſcruples; cloves, half a ſcruple; ambergreaſe, two grains; muſk, ſix grains; then with oil of ſpikenard make a peſſary. Alſo, take red roſes, with frankincenſe, lapidis hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matis, of each half an ounce; ſanguis draconis, ſine bole, maſtich, of each two drams; nutmeg, cloves, of each one dram, ſpikenard, half a ſcruple, and with oil of wormwood make a plaiſter for the lower part of the belly. And let her eat of the eringo roots con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ited, and make an injection of the juice of the roots of ſatyrion. And then let her uſe cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation ſoon after the menſes are ceaſed, concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then being moſt apt to follow; for then the womb is thirſty and dry, and apteſt both to draw the ſeed, and to retain it, by the roughneſs of the inward ſuperficies, and let her take great care to

                     <p>Firſt then, let a woman, that is with child (if ſhe can) chooſe a temperate air, not infected with frogs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and for that reaſon, not near any marſhy grounds, rivers, lakes, or ponds; but this in ſome cannot be avoided, their habitation falling out to be in ſuch places; but thoſe that can live where they pleaſe, ought to avoid ſuch places, and ſo they ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the going abroad in too hot or too cold weather; as alſo when the ſouth wind blows hard for that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten proves hurtful to a woman with child; and ſometimes cauſes abortion. Nor is the north wind much leſs hurtful, or leſs to be avoided, as cauſing rheums, coughs, and catarrhs, which opening the body, often cauſe miſcarriages.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, She ought to be very cautious in the matter of her diet, chooſing only thoſe meats that create wholeſome nouriſhment, and ſuch as are mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erately dry; and let her take care to prevent and avoid immoderate faſting, for that will weaken the infant, and render it of a ſickly conſtitution, and ſometimes cauſes abortion. And as all theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes are to be avoided, ſo ſhe muſt take care not only of avoiding immoderate faſting but immoderate eating too, which will not only be apt to ſtuff up the child, but to ſwell it up to that degree, that it will endanger the life of itſelf and the mother in its birth. Let it ſuffice that in general, ſhe avoids all meats which are too hot or too cold and moiſt; ſuch as ſallads, ſpices and hot meats, which often cauſe the child to be born before its time, and ſometimes without nails which foreſhews a ſhort life. And therefore in this caſe the moſt wholeſome meats are pigeons, partridges, pheaſants, larks, veal, mutton, or any meat that yields a good juice, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes kindly nouriſhment: as alſo ſuch fruits as are ſweet, and of eaſy digeſtion, as cherries, pears, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and the like. But let her avoid, as pernicious, all ſuch things as cauſe and create wind.</p>
                     <p>Care alſo ought to be taken with reſpect to her exerciſe, which ought to be moderate; for violent motion, either in walking or working, is hurtful and diſturbing to the womb: eſpecially riding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

ſtones in a coach, or any other uneven place and in like manner ſhould all extraordinary ſounds and noiſes be avoided, eſpecially the ringing of bells, and the diſcharging of great guns; neither ought ſhe to give way to immoderate laughing or weeping, or to anger, or any other paſſion; for that may be prejudicial to her.</p>

                     <p>Though the act of coition is that without which conception cannot be, yet the immoderate uſe of it hinders the chief end for which it was deſigned: In the firſt four months after conception ſhe ought not to lie with her huſband, or at leaſt ſparingly, leſt by ſhaking the womb in that action, the courſe would again be forced down.

I do confeſs it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what difficult to know the time of ſome women's la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, they being troubled with pains ſo long before their true labour comes, by reaſon of heat in the reins, is known by the ſwelling of the legs. My advice to ſuch women is to cool their reins before the time of their labour; which may be effectually done, by anointing the reins of their back with the oil of poppies, and violets, or water lilies, and thus they may avoid hard labour.</p>

                     <p>When women draw near the time of their reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eſpecially with the firſt child, and perceive any extraordinary pain in their belly, they immediately ſend for their midwife, taking it their labour, which is only cauſed by the cholick, and proceed from wind; which pains, though they come and go, griping the whole belly, are without any forcing downward into the womb, as it is done by thoſe who go before labour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="63" facs="unknown:028209_0061_0FD721547818CF30"/>The ſigns of labour ſome days before, are, that the woman's belly which before lay high, ſinks down and hinders her from walking ſo eaſily as ſhe uſed to do; alſo there flows from the womb ſlimy humours, which nature hath appointed to moiſten and make ſmooth the paſſage.</p>
                     <p>But when ſhe is preſently fallen into labour, the ſigns are great pains about the region of the reins and loins, which coming and retreating by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, anſwer in the bottom of the belly by congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous throws; and ſometimes the face is red and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, the blood being much heated by the endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours ſhe makes to bring forth the child. She is likewiſe much ſubject to vomiting, which is a ſign of good labour, and ſpeedy delivery, though by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant women thought otherwiſe.</p>

                     <head>§ <hi>4.</hi> What is to be done at the time of Labour.</head>
                     <p>When by the foregoing ſigns concurring, the midwife is ſatisfied that it is the true time of her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; ſhe muſt take care to get all things ready that are neceſſary to comfort the travailling woman in that time; and the better to do that, let her ſee that ſhe be not ſtrait laced. She may alſo give her a pretty ſtrong clyſter, if ſhe finds there be occaſion for it; but with this proviſo, that it be done at the beginning, and before the child be too forward, for otherwiſe it would be difficult for her to receive it; the advantage of which clyſter is, that the guts thereby will be excited to diſcharge itſelf of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and the rectum being emptied, there will be more ſpace for the dilating of the paſſage; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to cauſe the pains to bear more downwards, through the endeavours ſhe makes; other neceſſary things for her labour will be put in order, both for mother and the child.</p>
                     <p>As to the manner of the delivery, various mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives uſe different ways; ſome are delivered ſitting on a midwife's ſtool; but, for my part, I think that a pallet bed, girded, and placed near the fire, that
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:028209_0062_0FD721558BBC12F8"/>
the good women may come on each ſide, that ſhe may more readily be aſſiſted, is much the better way.</p>
                     <p>And if the labouring woman abounds with blood, it may not be improper to let her bleed a little, for by that means ſhe will both breathe the better, and have her breath more at liberty: And likewiſe more ſtrength to bear down her pain. And this may be done without danger, becauſe the child being now ready to be born, needs not the mother's blood for its nouriſhment any longer. And not only ſo, but this evacuation does many times prevent her having a fever after delivery. Likewiſe if her ſtrength will permit, let her walk up and down her chamber; and the better to enable her thereto, let her take ſome good ſtrengthening things ſuch as new laid eggs, jelly broth, or ſome ſpoonfuls of burnt wine; and encourage her to hold off her pains, bearing them down when they take her all that ſhe can. And let the midwife often touch the inward orifice with her finger, that ſhe may the better know whether the waters are ready to break, and whether the birth will follow ſoon after, for generally the birth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in two hours after the afflux of the water; and to help it after, let her anoint the woman's privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with emollient oil, hog greaſe and freſh butter; eſpecially if ſhe find them too hard to be dilated.</p>
                     <p>Let the midwife alſo be near the labouring all the while, and diligently obſerve her geſtures, pains, and complaints, for by this ſhe may gueſs pretty well how her labour goes forward: For when ſhe changes her groans into loud cries it is a great ſign the birth is near; at which time her pains are greater and more frequent. Let her alſo ſometimes reſt herſelf on her bed to renew her ſtrength, but not too long at a time, for to lie too long at a time will retard her labour, and therefore it is better for her to walk about the chamber as much as ſhe can. If ſhe finds any ſick qualms, let her not be diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and if ſhe finds any motions to vomit, let
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:028209_0063_0FD7215B73FA1B48"/>
her not repreſs them, but rather give way to them; for it will, (however uneaſy and irkſome they be for the preſent) be much for her benefit; becauſe they further the pains and provoke downwards.</p>

Take a dram of cinnamon in powder, inwardly, or tanſy bruiſed and applied to the privities. The ſtone etites held to the privities doth in a very little time draw forth the child and after burthen; but care muſt be taken to remove it preſently, or elſe it will draw forth the womb and all, ſo great is its magnetic virtue. The juice of parſley being of great virtue, eſpecially the ſtone parſley, being drank by a woman with child, it clears not only the womb, but alſo the child in the womb of all groſs humours. Take piony ſeeds, beat them to powder and mix it with oil, with which oil anoint the loins and privities of the woman with child, it gives deliverance very ſpeedily.</p>

Then let her lay the woman upon her back having her head raiſed by the help of
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:028209_0064_0FD72162808E3640"/>
a pillow, having the like help to ſupport her reins and buttocks, that her rump may be high, for if ſhe lie low ſhe cannot well be delivered. Then let her keep her knees and thighs as far aſunder as ſhe can her legs being bowed towards her buttocks, and let her feet be ſtaid upon a log, or ſome other firm thing. And let two women hold her ſhoulders, that ſhe may ſtrain out the birth with the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage holding in her breath, and forcing herſelf as much as poſſible, in like manner as when ſhe goes to ſtool. In the mean time, let the midwife encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age her all ſhe can, and take care that ſhe have no rings on her hands when ſhe anoints the parts; then with her finger let her gently dilate the inward orifice of the womb, and putting her fingers into the entry thereof, ſtretch them one from another when it pains her, by this means endeavouring to help forward the child, and thruſting by little and little the ſides of the orifice towards the hinder part of the child's head, anointing thoſe parts alſo with freſh butter, in caſe it be neceſſary. And when the head of the infant is ſomewhat advanced in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward orifice, it is uſual among midwives to ſay, it is crowned; becauſe it both girds and ſurrounds it like a crown: But when it is gone ſo far, and the extremity begins to appear without the privy parts then they ſay, the child is in the paſſage: And at this time the woman feels herſelf as if ſhe were ſcratched or pricked with pins, and is ready to think that the midwife hurts her; whereas in truth it is only occaſioned by the violent diſtention of thoſe parts, which ſometimes even ſuffers alucration through the bigneſs of the child's head. When things are come to this poſture let the wife ſeat herſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently to receive the child, which will now come very quickly, and with her finger ends, which ſhe ought alſo to be ſure to keep pared, let her endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to thruſt the crowning of the womb back over the head of the child. And as ſoon as it is advanced a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the two ſides with her two hands, and wait till the good pain come, and then quickly draw forth the child taking care that the navel ſtring be not then entangled about the child's neck, or any other part as ſometimes it is, leſt thereby the afterbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den be pulled with violence, and perhaps the womb alſo to which it is faſtened, and ſo either cauſe her to flood or elſe break the ſtring, both which are of bad conſequence to the woman, and render her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery the more difficult. Great care muſt be taken that the head be not drawn forth ſtraight, but ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a little from one ſide to the other that the ſhoulders may the ſooner and eaſier take its place immediately after it is paſt; which muſt be done without loſing any time, leſt the head being paſt, the child be ſtopt thereby the largeneſs of the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſo be in danger of being ſuffocated in the paſſage, as it has ſometimes happened for want of care therein. But as ſoon as the head is born, ſhe may ſlide in her fingers under the arm pits, and the reſt of the body follows with eaſe. As ſoon as the midwife hath in this manner drawn forth the child, let her lay it on one ſide, leſt the blood and water which follow immediately, ſhould do it an injury, by running into its mouth and noſe, as it would do if it lay on its back, and ſo endanger the choaking of it. The child being thus drawn forth, the next thing required is, to bring away the after burden, but before that, let the midwife be very careful to examine whether there be any more children in the womb: For ſometimes a woman may have twins; of which the midwife may ſatisfy herſelf, both by the woman's throws and the bigneſs of her belly.</p>

about the left, near the privities, drawing likewiſe with that very gently, reſting awhile, with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger of the ſame hand, extending and ſtretching along the ſtrings towards the entry of the Vagina always obſerving for the more facility, to draw it from the ſide to which the burden leaſt inclines, for in ſo doing the reſt will ſeparate the better. And extraordinary care muſt be taken that it be not drawn forth with too much violence, leſt by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtring near the burden, the midwife be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to put up the whole hand in the womb to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the woman, and ſhe had need take great care in this matter, that ſo the womb itſelf, to which ſometimes this burden is faſtened very ſtrongly, be not drawn away with it, which has ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. Sneezing being very conducive to bring away the afterbirth; let her take a little white hellibore in powder to cauſe her to ſneeze. Tanſy, and ſtone etites applied as before directed, are very efficacious in this caſe. The ſmoke of marygold flowers received up by the woman's privities, by a funnel, will bring away the after birth, though the midwife has loſt her hold. Or you will boil mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort in water till it be very ſoft, and then take it out, and apply it like a poultice to the navel of the woman in travail, it inſtantly brings away both the birth and the afterbirth; but as ſoon as they come forth, it muſt be inſtantly taken away, leſt it ſhould bring away the womb alſo.</p>

                     <p>As ſoon as the child is come into the world, let the midwife conſider whether it be weak or ſtrong, and if it be weak, let her gently put back part of the vital and natural blood, in the body of the child by the navel, for that recruits a weak child, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and natural ſpirit being communicated by the mother to the child by its navel ſtring. But if the child be ſtrong, there is no need of it. Only it will not be amiſs to let the midwife know that many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028209_0067_0FD7216D099D2A98"/>
that are born ſeeming dead, may be brought to life again, if ſhe ſqueezes ſix or ſeven drops of blood out of that part of the navelſtring which is cut off, and give it the child inwardly.</p>
                     <p>As to the cutting it ſhort or long, authors can ſcarce agree about it nor midwives neither; ſome preſcribing it to be cut at four finger's breadth, which is at the beſt but an uncertain rule, unleſs all fingers were of one ſize. Let the midwife take a brown thread, three or four times double, of an ell long, or thereabout, tied with a ſingle knot at each of the ends, to prevent their entangling; and with this thread ſo accommodated let her tie the ſtring within an inch of the belly, with a double knot, and turning about the ends of the thread, let her tie two more on the other ſide of the ſtring, reiterating it again, if it be neceſſary; then let her cut off the navel ſtring another inch below the ligature, towards the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, ſo that there only remains but two inches of the ſtring, in the midſt of which will be the knot we ſpeak of. Care muſt be taken not to knit it ſo ſtrait as to cut it in two; therefore the thread muſt be pretty thick, and pretty ſtrait knit, it being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too ſtrait than too looſe. Some children have miſerably loſt their lives, before it hath been diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered that the navel ſtring was not well tied. Great care muſt be taken that no blood ſqueeze through, for if there do, new knots muſt be made with the reſt of the ſtring.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the navelſtring is cut off, apply a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cotton or lint to the place, to keep it warm, leſt the cold enter into the body of the child, which it will unavoidably do in caſe it be not hard enough; and if you grate nutmeg over it, it will be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; then put another ſmall rag three or four times double upon the belly of the child.</p>

                     <p>Unnatural Labour is, when any unhappy acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent attends the birth, and when the child comes into the world in a contrary poſition to that which nature hath ordained.

                     <head>§ <hi>2.</hi> Whence hard, difficult and unnatural labour proceeds.</head>
                     <p>The firſt anſwer to the queſtion that ſome put, why women bring forth their children with ſo much pain? is, that it is the effect of the curſe pronounced againſt woman, for her tranſgreſſing the law of the Creator; for upon her ſinning, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced as a curſe againſt her, that in ſorrow ſhould ſhe bring forth her children.</p>
                     <p>But the natural and phyſical reaſon hereof are that the ſenſe of feeling being diſtributed to the whole body by the nerves; and the mouth of the womb being ſo ſtrait, that it muſt of neceſſity be dilated at the time of her delivery; the dilating thereof ſtretcheth the nerves, and from thence comes the pain: And therefore the reaſon why ſome women have more pain in labour than others proceeds from their having the mouth of the matrix more full of nerves than others.</p>
                     <p>Hard and difficult labour may proceed either from the mother or child, or from both; it may proceed from the mother by reaſon of a general indiſpoſition of her body; or from the indiſpoſition of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular part only, and that principally of the womb, which may be effected with ſuch weakneſs, as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders her unable to expel her burden.

When hard labour is cauſed by a woman's being too young and too ſtrait, the paſſage muſt be anointed with oil, hog's lard or freſh but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to relax and dilate them the eaſier. But if a woman be in years, and has hard labour from her firſt child, let her lower parts be anointed to mollify the inward orifice, which in ſuch a caſe (being more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hard and callous) does not eaſily yield to the deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of labour. And indeed this is the true cauſe why ſuch women are longer in labour, and why their children in their birth are more ſubject to bruiſes than others. Thoſe that are very lean, and have hard labour from that cauſe, let them moiſten their private parts with oil and ointments, to make them more ſmooth and ſlippery, ſo that the head of the infant in the womb may not be compreſſed and bruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the hardneſs of its mother's bones in its paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.

                     <p>In delivering a woman of a dead child, before any thing be attempted, the operator ought firſt to be very certain that the child is dead indeed; which may be known by the falling of the mother's breaſts, the coldneſs of her belly, the thickneſs of her urine, which is attended with a ſtriking ſediment at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and no motion to be perceived in the child; alſo, when ſhe turns herſelf in her bed, the child ſways that way like a lump of lead, and her breath ſtinks, though not uſed to do ſo. When by theſe and the like ſigns, the operator is come to a ſettled judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the child is dead, let him apply himſelf to the ſaving of the mother, by giving her thoſe things that are the moſt powerful in the ſaving na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in her operations; and which he has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directed to. But if through weakneſs the woman be not able to operate with nature, ſo that a manual operation is abſolutely neceſſary, let the operator carefully obſerve the following directions, viz. If the child be found dead, with its head foremoſt, he muſt take notice that the delivery will be the more difficult becauſe in this caſe it is not only impoſſible that the child ſhould any way aſſiſt in its delivery,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:028209_0071_0FD7217FA9A26E98"/>
but the ſtrength of the mother doth alſo very much fail her; and thereupon the moſt ſure and ſafe way for him, is to put up his left hand, ſliding it as hollow in the palm as he can, into the neck of the womb, into the lower part thereof towards the feet, and that between the infant and the neck of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix; and then having a hook in the right hand, couch it cloſe, and ſlip it above the left hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the head of the child and the flat of the hand, fixing it in the bone of the temple, towards the eye, or for want of convenient coming at theſe, in the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal bone, obſerving ſtill to keep the left hand in its place, and with it gently moving or ſtirring the head, and ſo with the right hand draw the child for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, encouraging the woman to put her utmoſt ſtrength, and always drawing when the woman's pangs are upon her. The head being thus drawn forth, the operator muſt, with all ſpeed ſlip his hand under the arm holes of the child, and take it quite forth, giving preſently to the woman a toaſt of fine wheaten bread, in a quarter of a pint of tent, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and cheriſh her ſpirits.</p>

the after pain, cauſes ſwelling in the womb, and hurts the nerves; therefore if a woman has had very hard labour, it is convenient after delivery, to wrap her in the ſkin of a ſheep, taken off whilſt it is warm and putting the fleſh ſide to her reins and belly: Or if this cannot be ſo well had, the ſkin of a hare or rabbit, taken off as ſoon as it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>After ſhe has been delivered a while, you may make a reſtrictive of the yolk of two eggs; a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a pint of white wine, oil of St. John's wort, oil of roſes, plantain and roſe water, of each an ounce, mix them together, fold a linen cloth and dip it therein, warm it before a gentle fire, and then apply it to the breaſts, and the pains of thoſe parts will be gently eaſed.</p>
                     <p>But be ſure let her not ſleep ſoon after her deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, but let her take ſome broth, cordial, or any other liquid matter that is nouriſhing, about four hours after delivery, and then ſhe may ſafely be permitted to ſleep if ſhe be ſo diſpoſed, as it is prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſhe will be, being tired with the fatigue of her labour. But before this, as ſoon as ſhe is laid in her bed, let her drink a draught of burnt white wine, in which you have melted a dram of ſpermaceti. Let her alſo avoid the light for the firſt three days; for her labour weakens her eye ſight exceedingly, there being a ſympathy between them and the womb. If the womb be foul, which may be known by the impurity of the blood, and its ſtinking and coming away in clotted lumps; or if you ſuſpect any of the after birth to be left behind, (which may ſometimes happen, though the midwife be never ſo careful and ſkilled) then make her drink of feverfew, pennyroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, mother of thyme, boiled in white wine, and ſweetened with ſugar.

little at a time. And let her uſe cinnamon in all her meats and drinks, for it mightily ſtrengthens the womb. Let her ſtir as little as may be for ſix or ſeven days after delivery, and let her talk as little as may be, for that weakens her. If ſhe goes not well to ſtool, give her a clyſter of the decoction of mallows and a little brown ſugar.</p>
                     <p>Let the woman be ſure to keep a temperate diet; and take care ſhe does by no means overcharge herſelf, after ſuch an exceſſive evacuation; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruled by, or giving credit to unſkilful nurſes who are apt to admoniſh them to feed heartily, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to repair the loſs of blood, for the blood is not for the moſt part pure, but ſuch as has been retained in the veſſels or membranes, and is better voided, for the health of the woman, than kept, unleſs there happen an extraordinary flux of blood; for if her nouriſhment be too much, it may make her liable to a fever, and increaſe the milk to ſuperfluity, which may be of dangerous conſequence. In this caſe let her have coriander or fennel ſeed, boiled in her barley broth; and by that mean for the time before mentioned, let her abſtain from meat; if no fever trouble her, ſhe may drink now and then a ſmall quantity of white wine or claret, as alſo ſyrup of maidenhair, or any other ſyrup that is of an aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent quality, taking it in a little water and boiled.</p>

<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028209_0074_0FD7218C4F71E738"/>
both Formata and Articulate. And then it is ſaid to be a conception, but a falſe one; which puts a difference between a true conception and a mole, and the difference holds good three ways. Firſt, in the Genus; becauſe the mole cannot be an animal. Secondly, it differs in ſpecies; becauſe it hath no human figure, and bears not the character of a man, And thirdly, it differs in the Dividuum; for it hath no affinity with any of the parts, either in the whole body, or any particles of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>This imperfect conception may be known to be ſuch, it is diſcerned by theſe ſigns. The monthly courſes are ſuppreſſed, the belly is puffed up, and alſo waxed hard, the breaſts ſwell, and the appetite is depraved.</p>
                     <p>A mole may be felt to move in the womb before the third month, which an infant cannot; nor is this motion of the mole the effect of ſenſitive power therein, but only cauſed by the faculties of the womb and of the ſeminal ſpirits, diffuſed through the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the mole; for though it is no animal, yet it has a vegetative life. But then the belly is ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſwelled where there is a mole; but in a true conception the belly is firſt contracted, and then riſeth gradually.</p>
                     <p>The cure of the diſtemper conſiſts chiefly in expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it as ſoon as may be; for the longer it is kept the worſe it is; and this many times cannot be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected without manual operation, but that being the laſt remedy, all other means ought to be firſt uſed. Amongſt which phlebotomy ought not to be omitted; for ſeeing letting of blood cauſeth abortion, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its taking away that nouriſhment which ſhould ſuſtain the life of the child, why may not this vicious coption be by the ſame means deprived of that vegetative ſap, by which it lives? To which end, upon the liver vein, and then the ſaphaena in both feet, faſten cupping glaſſes to the loins of the belly, which done, let the urinary parts be much mollified, and the expulſive faculty be provoked to
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:028209_0075_0FD7218E602C2908"/>
the burden. And to looſen the ligaments of the mole, take mallows with the roots, three handfuls; pelitory, camomile, violet leaves, meliiot, roots of fennel, parſley, mercury, of each two handfuls; fenugreek and linſeed, of each one pound; boil them in water and make a bath thereof, and let her ſit therein up to the navel; and at her going out of the bath, let her reins and privities be anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this ungent. Take ammoniac, labdani, freſh butter, of each an ounce, and with oil of lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed make an ointment.</p>

                     <p>Monſters are properly depraved Conceptions and are deemed by the ancients to be excurſions of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and are alway vicious, either by figure, ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, magnitude, or number.</p>
                     <p>They are vicious in figure, when a man bears the character of a beaſt. They are vicious in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, when the parts are not equal; or that one part is too big for the other. And this is a thing very common, by reaſon of ſome excreſcence. They are vicious in ſituation, the eyes on the breaſts, or on the legs, as was ſeen in a monſter born at Ravenna in Italy, in the year 1570. And laſtly, they are vicious in numbers, as when a human perſon hath two heads, or four hands, and two bodies joined, which was the caſe of the monſter that was born at Zarzan, in the year 1750.</p>
                     <p>Monſters are ſometimes produced by the undue coition of a man and his wife when her monthly flowings are upon her; which being a thing againſt nature, no wonder that it would produce an unnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural iſſue. If therefore a man's deſire be never ſo great for coition, as it ſometimes is after long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, yet if the woman knows that the cuſtom of women are upon her, ſhe ought not to admit of any embraces, which at that time are both unclean and unnatural.</p>
                     <p>There has been ſomething to do among authors, to know whether thoſe that are born monſters have
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:028209_0076_0FD7218F49ED7160"/>
reaſonable ſouls; ſome affirming, and others deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; the reſult of both ſides at laſt, coming to this, that thoſe who according to the order of nature are deſcended from our firſt parents, by the coition of man and woman, though their outward ſhape be deformed and monſtrous, have notwithſtanding reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable ſouls.

                     <p>Some are of opinion that monſters may be engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by ſome infernal ſpirits; but notwithſtanding Egidius Facius pretended to believe it with reſpect to a deformed monſter born at Cracovia; and Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronymus Cardanus writeth of a maid that was got with child by the devil: Being a wicked ſpirit, and not capable of having human ſeed, how is it poſſible he could beget a human creature? If they ſay, that the devil may aſſume to himſelf, a dead body, and enliven the faculties of it, and thereby make it able to generate; I anſwer, that though we ſuppoſe this could be done, which I believe not, yet that body muſt bear the image of the devil: And it borders upon blaſphemy to think the all wiſe and good Being would ſo far give way to the worſt ſpirits, as to ſuffer him to raiſe up his diabolical offspring.</p>

He whoſe hair grows thick on his temples and his brow, is ſimple, vain, luxurious and luſtful.

                     <p>HE whoſe eyes are ſmall and conveniently round is baſhful and weak, very credulous, liberal to others, and civil in his converſation. He whoſe eyes look aſquint, is thereby denoted to be a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſon, unjuſt, envious, furious, a great liar, and as the effect of all this, miſerable.

                  <p>A long neck, ſhews one to have long and ſlender feet, and that the perſon is ſtiff and inflexible either to good or evil.

                  <p>A lean ſhoulder bone, ſignifies a man to be weak, timorous, peaceful, not laborious, and yet fit for any employment.

He whoſe ſhoulder bone bends, and is crooked inwardly, is commonly a dull perſon, and withal deceitful.</p>
                  <p>Long arms hanging down, and touching the knees though ſuch arms are rarely ſeen, denotes a man liberal but withal vain glorious, proud and confident.

He whoſe arms are heavy and full of bones, ſinews and fleſh, is a man of reaſonable ſtrength, a great deſirer of novelties, and beauteous, and one that is very credulous, and very apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every thing.

                  <p>By this figure the reader will ſee that one of the lines, and which indeed is reckoned the principal is called the line of Life; this line incloſes the thumb ſeparating it from the hollow of the hand.

The Table line com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the line of Fortune, begins under the little finger, and ends near the middle finger.

                  <p>The back of the chin bone, if the fleſh be any thing hairy and lean, and higher than the other part that is behind, ſignifies a man ſhameleſs, beaſtly, and withal malicious.

He whoſe belly is but little, is for the moſt part, a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious man, conſtant in his undertaking, ſagacious, of a good underſtanding and ſound judgment. He whoſe belly is very hairy, that is to ſay, from the navel downwards, is denoted thereby to be very talkative, bold, apprehenſive, witty, a lover of learning and eloquence, and ſpeaks himſelf noble in his reſolutions, but not very fortunate.</p>
                  <p>He or ſhe whoſe fleſh is ſoft all over the body, is weak, luſtful, and fearful upon little or no occaſion, of a good underſtanding, and an excellent inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but a little eater, faithful, but of various for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and meets with more adverſity than proſperity.</p>
                  <p>A thigh full of hair, and the hair inclined to curl, ſignifies one luſtful, licentious, fit for copulation.

                  <p>Hips that are fleſhy, denote the perſon to be bold, ſtrong and prodigal; but on the contrary, hips thin and lean, ſignify the perſon to be weak, timorous, and unfit for labour.</p>
                  <p>Knees that are full and fat, do ſignify a man to be liberal, but very fearful, vain, and not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any great labour; but he whoſe feet are lean, and the bones thereof do not eaſily appear, is ſtrong, bold, induſtrious, and not apt to be tired, a good footman and one that delights to travel.</p>

Little legs,

                  <p>The joints of the feet, if they be broad and thick, and ſtand out withal, ſignify the perſon to be ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, fearful, weak, and not able to endure hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or much labour, but withal very faithful, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of any thing, and kind to his friend.

                  <p>The feet of either man or woman, if broad and thick with fleſh, and long in figure, eſpecially if the ſkin feels hard, they are by nature of a ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and a groſs nutriment, but of a weak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, which renders their underſtanding vain; but feet that are thin and lean, and of a ſoft ſkin, ſhews the perſon to be but weak of body but of a ſtrong underſtanding, and an excellent wit.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe whoſe nails on the feet are white, and ſome mixture of redneſs, are healthy perſons; and thoſe whoſe nails are groſs and of another colour, are for the moſt part ſickly and weak.</p>

                  <p>The ſoles of the feet do adminiſter plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſigns whereby the diſpoſitions and conſtitutions of men and women may be known, as do the palms of their hands; being as full of lines, by which lines all the fortunes and misfortunes of men and women may be known, and their manners and inclinations made plainly to appear.

motion, and in which they have their reſidence and are ſituate. And theſe houſes are divided by thirty degrees; and theſe ſigns or houſes are called the houſes of ſuch and ſuch planets as make their reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence therein, and are ſaid to delight in them, and as they are depoſited in ſuch and ſuch houſes, are ſaid to be either dignified or debilitated.
