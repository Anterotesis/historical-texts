            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEREAS HIS MAJESTY hath been graciously pleased, by His Royal Letter, bearing Date the sixteenth day of October last past, to signifie That He hath received undoubted Advice that a great and sudden Invasion from <hi>Holland,</hi> with an armed Force of Forreigners and Strangers, will speedily be made <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Liberty, Property,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> (contrived or worded with Art and Subtilty) may be given out, (as shall be thought useful upon such an Attempt;) It is manifest however, (considering the great Preparations that are making) That no less matter by this <hi>Invasion</hi> is proposed and purposed, than an absolute Conquest of His Majesty's Kingdoms, and the utter Subduing and Subjecting His Majesty and all His People to a Forreign Power, which is promoted (as His Majesty understands) altho' it may seem almost incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible) by some of His Majesty's <hi>Subjects,</hi> being persons of wicked and restless Spirits, implacable Malice, and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Designs, who having no sence of former intestine Distractions, (the Memory and Misery whereof should endear and put a Value upon that Peace and Happiness with hath long been enjoyed) nor being moved by His Majesty's reiterated Acts of Grace and Mercy, (wherein His Majesty hath studied and delighted to abound towards all His Subjects, and even towards <hi>those</hi> who were once His Majesty's avowed and open <hi>Enemies</hi>) do again endeavour to embroil His Majesty's Kingdom in Blood and Ruin, to gratifie their own Ambition and Malice, proposing to themselves a Prey and Booty in such a publick Confusion:</p>
            <p>And that although His Majesty had Notice that a forreign Force was preparing against Him, yet His Majesty hath alwaies declined any forreign Succour, but rather hath chosen (next under GOD) to rely upon the true and ancient Courage, Faith and Allegiance of His own People, with whom His Majesty hath often ventured His Life for the Honour of His Nation, and in whose Defence against all Enemies His Majesty is firmly resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to live and dye; and therefore does solemnly <hi>Conjure</hi> His Subjects to lay aside all manner of Animosities, Jealousies, &amp; Prejudices, and heartily &amp; Chearfully to <hi>Unite together</hi> in the Defence of His <hi>MAJESTY</hi> and their native Countrey, which thing alone, will (under GOD) defeat and frustrate the principal Hope and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of His Majesty's Enemies, who expect to find His People divided; and by publishing (perhaps) some plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Reasons of their Coming, as the specious (tho' <hi>false</hi>) Presences of Maintaining the Protestant Religion, or Asserting the Liberties and Properties of His Majesty's People, do hope thereby to conquer that great and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Kingdom.</p>
            <p>That albeit the Design hath been carried on with all imaginable Secresie &amp; Endeavours to surprise and deceive His <hi>MAJESTY,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> hath not been wanting on His part to make such provision as did become Him, and, by GOD's great Blessing, His Majesty makes no doubt of being found in so good a Posture that His Enemies may have cause to repent such their rash and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Attempt. ALL WHICH, it is His Majesty's pleasure, should be made known in the most publick manner to his loving Subjects within this His Territory and Dominion of <hi>NEW-ENGLAND,</hi> that they may be the better prepared to resist any Attempts that may be made by His Majesties Enemies in those parts, and secured in their trade and Commerce with His Majesty's Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Do therefore, in pursuance of His <hi>MAJESTY</hi> s Commands, by these Presents <hi>make known</hi> and <hi>Publish</hi> the same accordingly: And hereby Charge and Command all Officers Civil &amp; Military, and all other His Majesty's loving Subjects within this His Territory and Dominion aforesaid, to be <hi>Vigilant</hi> and <hi>Careful</hi> in their respective places and stations, and that, upon the Approach of any Fleet or Forreign Force, they be in Readiness, and use their utmost Endeavour to hinder any Landing or Invasion that may be intended to be made within the same.</p>
