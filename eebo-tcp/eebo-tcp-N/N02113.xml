            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE read the <hi>Sober Remarks</hi> on the <hi>Modeſt Proof,</hi> &amp;c. whereon you ask my Opinion: And ſince all your Deſires have with me the force of Commands, I now tranſmit to you my Thoughts and Obſervations on that Performance.</p>
            <p>IF that Author took the Title for his Text, I find him following a Method too common, in leaving it as ſoon as mentioned, and all along keeping at a Diſtance from it far and wide; and that therefore the Adjective is by no means applicable to the Animadverſions.</p>
            <p>HE was doubtleſs in this miſled by a vulgar Error, which often runs through the Conduct of Humane Life, the not obſerving the Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction founded in Religion, [2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Sins of the Fleſh, and Sins of the Spirit; in ſuch as do not conſider, that Envy and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002510_0004_0FDB642050BC6898"/>
Heretical Opinions and Inclinations, for <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Sedition,</hi> are as heinous Provocations in the ſight of Heaven, as the fruition of the forbidden Pleaſures of the Animal Life. Hence ſome with a ſeeming Solemnity worſhip God at <hi>Meeting,</hi> but Mammon in the Heart and Cloſet; abhor Idols, yet love Sacrilege; forbear Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ſtrongly incline to Lie and Over-reach; and obſerve the <hi>Saturday Evening</hi> with a Jewiſh nicety, and on the ſucceeding, fall into all the Works of the Gentiles, that can be contained within the Veil of Hypocriſy.</p>
            <p>THIS Obſervation might be run through eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Precept of the Second Table, tho' I ſhall for my Purpoſe only inſtance in that which relates to Riot and Exceſs; where we may take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that beſides drinking to a Debauch, there is another kind of Intemperance flowing from the bilious Ferment of the Paſſions, and the Fumes of <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> and a heared Fancy.</p>
            <p>HAD the Author of the <hi>Remarks</hi> duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this, he could never have prefixed ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper an Epithet as that of <hi>Sober</hi> unto them. I don't indeed know that he is a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in the groſſer Meaning of the Word, yet I think there is no Propoſition in <hi>Euclid</hi> more demonſtrable, than that the Guilt of Intemperance taken in the laſt Senſe is chargeable upon him. And to ſhow you that all the Symptoms and Diſorders of that Vice are applicable to him, and that by Conſequence his <hi>Remarks</hi> could not be <hi>Sober</hi> ones, I ſhall repreſent him unto you, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing really to be under all the Signatures of the Crime of Intemperance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:002510_0005_0FDB6422D042DB68"/>WE may diſcern a Perſon to be under this Diſorder by theſe Marks and Signs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> THAT his Head is full of delirious <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> and <hi>Deluſions</hi> imagining <hi>chimerical Exiſtences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> THAT he is ſo tenacious of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that he is full Proof againſt Conviction by the cleareſt Evidence, but thinks himſelf privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to affirm or deny at his pleaſure, without any other Satisfaction than his Word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> THAT he is very inconſiſtent in his Talk, and apt to contradict himſelf, as well as others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> THAT he is ſoon angry, and often very quarrelſome, even without Provocation.</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p>NOW it theſe Spots are remarkably diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in the <hi>Remarker</hi>'s Countenance, I hope is will be granted, that theſe <hi>Remarks</hi> will not be allowed the Performance of a Perſon under a <hi>ſober</hi> Character: And that they evidently appear in him, will be clear and manifeſt by obſerving.</p>
            <p>Firſt, THAT his Head ſeems giddilly to ſwim (as if there was a Vortex in his Brain) with deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Viſions and deluſive Phantoms, his Fancy repreſenting to him Images that are meer Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meras, which never had nor ever could have any real Exiſtence; thus by a ſudden Whirl, Saints and Sinners inſtantly change Places in his vertiginous Imagination, and by the nimble Powers of Transformation, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:002510_0006_0FDB6426E82DF708"/>THUS the Viſionary paints on his Fancy, Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendant <hi>Spotſwood,</hi> in a <hi>Geneva</hi> Dreſs, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth to Independant Congregations: For this is the certain Conſequence of his affirming, that both <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were againſt <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy</hi> at the Reformation; whereas it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable Fact, that this was the Government of the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> ſince the planting of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity in it to this very Day, excepting the Anarchy from 1641, to 1660. and that the <hi>Church</hi> was reformed by <hi>Biſhops,</hi> who afterwards became <hi>Martyrs</hi> under their <hi>Epiſcopal Characters;</hi> who muſt in the <hi>Remarker</hi>'s Judgment been Fools, or Knaves, or both, to have practiſed even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death, ſo contrary to the Principles he dreams they had.</p>
            <p>AND as for <hi>Scotland,</hi> there is nothing clearer in Hiſtory, than that the <hi>Church</hi> at and after the Reformation there, was governed by <hi>Superintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,</hi> whoſe Office was ſo far from being an Anti-prelatical Creation, as the <hi>Remarker</hi> fondly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, that it differed in nothing from <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> but the Name; and it is not to be diſputed, but that the Reformation not only in <hi>Britain,</hi> but in all Monarchical Governments, was carried on by <hi>Praelates;</hi> as in <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed every where, ſave in a few <hi>Republican</hi> States, ſuch as <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> where their Church-Government was framed to their Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bean Schemes. No Man whoſe Head was not ſtrangely turned, would imagine the <hi>Fathers</hi> on the <hi>Remarker</hi>'s Side, who all with one Breath
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002510_0007_0FDB6428D5F66020"/>
condemn his Opinions. Tho' with equal Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Aſſurance that he provokes unto their Judgment, he diſpiſes it, and contemns the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> for this very good Reaſon, becauſe it teſtifies againſt him. In fine, who but a ſilly Dreamer could have feigned himſelf an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> or rather ſome body of a ſuperiour Character, in giving and taking away Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions at his pleaſure, and which have no Foundation but in Fancy, to be ſure not in the <hi>ſacred Pages.</hi> It is with difficulty that he will allow <hi>Stephen</hi> to be a Preacher, tho' I think we have a good long Sermon of his <hi>Acts</hi> 7. But as to <hi>Philip,</hi> the Inſtance is ſo flagrant of his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and baptizing, that there was no other way to condemn the <hi>Epiſcopal Deacon</hi> following that Practice, than by framing a new Commiſſion for <hi>Philip:</hi> For he would not allow the Powers for his Practice were contained in his <hi>Diaconate;</hi> however we call upon him and his Brethren for a ſight of an authentick Copy of that Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon Divine Record, which becauſe we are ſure they can't produce, we can't but firmly adhere to our Opinion, that the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is an imaginary Fiction. And ſince ſo good Men would not be found in theſe Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Functions without a <hi>Miſſion,</hi> we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that they diſcharged them in the virtue of that which they received, at the impoſition of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.6. But this will be anon more fully conſidered; this Inſtance with the foregoing being only here adduced, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Diſorders the <hi>Remarker</hi> was under,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002510_0008_0FDB642A5822FC50"/>
having his Head full of delireous <hi>Viſions</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions,</hi> imagining <hi>chimerical Exiſtences,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not with any Truth or Honeſty prefix the Epithet of <hi>Sober</hi> to his <hi>Remarks.</hi> Nor could he, if we conſider</p>
            <p>Secondly, THAT he is ſo tenacious of his Opinions, that he is full Proof againſt Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the cleareſt Evidence, but thinks himſelf privileged to affirm or deny at his pleaſure, without any other Satisfaction than his Word.</p>
            <p>TO prove this Charge upon him, I ſhall make it appear, that he has without any Ground de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Diſtinction of the three Orders of <hi>New Teſtament</hi> Miniſters, with their proper Functions and Adminiſtrations, as retained in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and without any Proof introduced Officers and Offices into the <hi>Goſpel Miniſtry,</hi> not founded in Scripture, and Strangers to the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> in its beſt and pureſt Times. Now for the evincing of this Charge, wherein lies the Merits of the Cauſe, and whereon the Hinge of the whole Controverſy turns, I ſhall proceed gradually, and make it good in every one of thoſe Orders.</p>
            <p>FIRST then, to begin with the loweſt, that of <hi>Deacons,</hi> we muſt conſider that Office in the Reaſon of its Inſtitution, and the Exerciſe of it; it's plain they were appointed to take ſome Charge and Care from off the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Offices of the Miniſtry, as their Name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, part whereof was to diſtribute the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at the Celebration of the Lord's Supper, as well as to ſuperviſe the <hi>Churches Treaſury,</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002510_0009_0FDB642E9AD5C428"/>
ſupply the Poor; but theſe Services do not ſeem to include all that was implied in their deſignation to this Office, and that for theſe two Reaſons: Firſt. For theſe only there ſeems no neceſſity for ſo great a Solemnity as an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination</hi> by the <hi>Apoſtolick Hands.</hi> And ſecondly, Becauſe we find ſome of them actually employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in more ſacred Functions, for which they doubtleſs then received their Power and Orders. For we don't find they received any for thoſe ſacred Miniſtrations at any other Time: Now ſince they could not preach without being ſent, and that it don't appear they were ſent at any Time but this we are upon, it muſt be granted, that either they now received their Powers for the miniſterial Functions of Preaching and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, or that they acted without any, and were intruders on the ſacred Function. But this is impious and abſurd, therefore they were now ordained to thoſe Parts of the Miniſtry, they afterwards diſcharged with ſo much Diligence and Succeſs. And now let us view what thoſe Parts were, in the exerciſe whereof we find any of them; for from their Practice, we may well conclude that of all the reſt. There are but two of thoſe <hi>Deacons,</hi> whoſe Acts are more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly taken notice of by the <hi>ſacred Hiſtorian,</hi> One of then, as has been already hinted, we find has left us an excellent Sermon <hi>Acts</hi> 7. and the other we know preached ſo ſucceſsfully, as to gain many Converts, whom he alſo baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. And beſides theſe, we don't find any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Act. of their Miniſtration in holy Things:
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002510_0010_0FDB642F8FB8DF30"/>
For tho' they aſſiſted indeed at the Lord's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet we don't find that ever they conſecrated the Elements, or ever were veſted with the Powers of <hi>Abſolution</hi> or <hi>Cenſures,</hi> but rather the contrary is implied <hi>Acts</hi> 8.14, 18. For that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Samaritans</hi> were baptized by <hi>Philip the Deacon,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> went from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Samaria</hi> to confirm the new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts.</p>
            <p>NOW let us ſee how the <hi>Church of England Deacon</hi> comes up to the Inſtitution and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Office; after he is recommended, tried, approved and found meet for it, he is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ordained by laying on of Hands, inveſted with Power to ſerve Tables, provide for the Poor, to preach and to baptize, but not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Lord's Supper; as that implies the Act of Conſecration, nor remit or retain Sins, in our Saviour's Sence of thoſe Words, but as for the <hi>diſſinting Deacon,</hi> if ever, he is very rarely ordained, and to be ſure never to the Offices of preaching and baptizing; and pray now who comes neareſt to the primitive Inſtitution, and the manifeſt Acts of that Office? the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which deſires to obey Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and be guided in her Conduct by Divine Examples, and in this Inſtance comes as near the Pattern as is poſſible for Imitation, or thoſe who ſacrilegiouſly mutilate this Office, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive it of the beſt and moſt uſeful Parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: And therefore who that was <hi>ſober</hi> and in his Senſes, could have expreſſed his Virulence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the preaching <hi>Deacon,</hi> as the <hi>Remarker</hi> has
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002510_0011_0FDB64312A483BE8"/>
done, to ſay no worſe in Language like his Cauſe, and therefore evident it is upon the whole and muſt be owned, that thoſe <hi>Remarks</hi> on this the loweſt Office in the <hi>Evangelical Miniſtry,</hi> betray a Mind full of Confuſion and Diſorder, and therefore that they could never be the neat Produce of a <hi>ſober</hi> Man, nor they ever juſtly claim an Epithet they have no Title to. From hence let us proceed,</p>
            <p>Secondly, TO the next Order, that of <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> and ſee if there be any more Marks of Sobriety on the <hi>Remarks</hi> on their Order than on the former; and here I think it will be obvious to every Eye, that the further he goes, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſtaggers from the Truth, until he falls into groſs Abſurdities, from whence he cannot recover himſelf, from theſe Reflections.</p>
            <p>THE Author of the <hi>Modeſt Proof</hi> had alledged with a great deal of Reaſon, that <hi>Presbyters</hi> were Succeſſors to the <hi>Seventy Diſciples,</hi> who by many Marks of Imparity by him there adduced, and not yet diſproved, were in an Office inferiour in Dignity and Power unto the <hi>Apoſtolate.</hi> Now he ſeems extreamly concerned to expunge this Notion, and blots ſeveral Pages, to blot <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Seventy</hi>'s Commiſſion; and ſo fiercely contends againſt the Perpetuity of it, that upon the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of its continuing, he would grant <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> to be their proper Succeſſors. Now upon this Conceſſion we will join Iſſue with him and give up the Cauſe, if we don't make appear, that the <hi>Seventy</hi>'s Commiſſion continued after the Time he affirms it determined; and that the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002510_0012_0FDB6432A5CFB000"/>
Grounds he goes upon are abſurd, ſuppoſitious and contrary to Fact and the Reaſon of Things, he affirms but without Proof, that their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is not now in being, inaſmuch as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired with themſelves, or rather at their Return unto our Lord, and that it was limited only to <hi>Judea.</hi> Now if theſe Premiſſes be not true, the Concluſion that he would draw from them muſt needs be falſe; and that there is no Truth in either of thoſe Pretences, will be clear as Light, from the following Conſiderations on each of them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, THAT that Commiſſion having never been formally revoked, and the Reaſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it was granted continuing, it muſt alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as long as they do.</p>
            <p>Secondly, SO far it is from being true, that it was revoked at their Return, that they were then furniſhed with new Powers for the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of thoſe Functions it authoriſed them unto.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſay the <hi>Seventy</hi>'s Commiſſion having never been formally revoked, and the Reaſons whereon it was granted continuing, it muſt alſo continue as long as they do. There is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Silence in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> about the Revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Commiſſion, not the leaſt Inuendo that glances that way, no Account of the Time, Place, and Perſon, when, where, or by whom it was taken from them, and they diſcharged from that Service; and therefore he muſt have a hardy Front, that would affirm this Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have been formally revoked. And that it was not virtually ſo, is ſtill, if poſſible, more
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002510_0013_0FDB64370FDCE9C0"/>
evident, for the Reaſons of its firſt Inſtitution continuing, it muſt be of the ſame Duration with them; Now theſe Reaſons we have <hi>Luke</hi> 10.2. The greatneſs of the Harveſt, and the fewneſs of the Labourers, and ſince the Harveſt will continue until the laſt Conflagration, ſo muſt the Labourers, and by Conſequence their Commiſſion for it. The <hi>Remarker</hi> therefore muſt be guilty of this abſurd Suppoſition, That the Harveſt is over, ſince the Labourers Commiſſion to work therein, is according to him, annulled; unleſs he will ſtill more abſurdly ſuppoſe, that there is a Harveſt and no Labourers in it. But ſince both theſe Suppoſitions are falſe in Fact, and blaſphemous Imputations on the Wiſdom of its Maſter; and that therefore the Harveſt will continue to the laſt period of Time, ſo muſt the Labourers Work, and their Commiſſion for it, run in a Line parallel to that Duration. Add to this,</p>
            <p>Secondly, THAT it is ſo far from being true that the <hi>Seventy</hi>'s Commiſſion was revoked at their return to our <hi>Lord;</hi> that they were then by him furniſhed with new Powers for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of tho' Functions it authoriſed them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Of this we have an inconteſtible Proof <hi>Luke</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.18, 19. where we are told, that even after their return from their firſt Progreſs, that our <hi>Lord</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>I <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſhall by any means hurt you.</hi> I demand therefore to what purpoſe were
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002510_0014_0FDB64395B29CFC8"/>
theſe extraordinary Powers conferred, if not to aſſiſt them in the Work of their Miniſtry? for as private Chriſtians they were uſeleſs to them, having no direct tendency to promote Faith and Repentance in themſelves: The <hi>Remarker</hi> muſt therefore either go upon this blaſphemous Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that our <hi>Lord</hi> did in vain beſtow upon them theſe Powers, and for no wiſe End or Uſe, or confeſs to the Truth that they were endowed with them, for the better enabling of them, ſucceſsfully to diſcharge the Functions contained in the Commiſſion they had received from him; the Converſion of the World to the Faith and Acknowledgements of their Maſter, by their Doctrines, atteſted with Miracles. Nor will it follow here, that becauſe Miracles are ceaſed, therefore their Commiſſion has likewiſe: For they are two different Things, Commiſſion or Authority whereby to act, and Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gifts whereby to make their acts Succeſsful, and perſwade the World that their Commiſſion was Divine; and therefore it muſt be granted, that the Reaſon of the one ceaſing, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continuing, tho' the one has ceaſed, the other muſt continue.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole, now I appeal to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe of Mankind, if the <hi>Remarker</hi> can be ſaid to be in his Senſes, when he affirms, that the <hi>Seventy</hi>'s Commiſſion is expired, or that ſuch a <hi>Remark</hi> can be called <hi>Sober,</hi> any more than the Second, That their Commiſſion was limited to <hi>Judeae.</hi> It is owned, that in their firſt Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they were to go unto Places whither our
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002510_0015_0FDB643ADB5880E8"/>
               <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf would come, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.1. But even then not excluſively of others; it is no where ſaid to theſe Places only, or as it was once to the <hi>Apoſtles, That they ſhould not turn into the way of the Gentiles,</hi> Matth. 10.5. Nothing of all this, much leſs is there any reſtraint laid on them after their return: For as their Work concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mankind in general, ſo muſt needs their Commiſſion be of univerſal Extent; and not a Word to be found that confines them to any Place or Nation. But becauſe the <hi>Remarker</hi> can find no ſuch Limitation to the Circumciſion in the <hi>Seventy</hi>'s Commiſſion, his Eyes reel back to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> firſt Commiſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.5. and would argue it from thence, but how unfairly. They were two diſtinct Commiſſions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is all precarious Reaſoning from one to the other. Nor will it follow upon the Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the <hi>Seventy</hi> were to go out unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> before they went to them, were to make the firſt Offers of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> that therefore the <hi>Seventy</hi>'s Commiſſion was more honourable than the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> any more than that the <hi>Remarker,</hi> who, for ought I know, may be a Native of <hi>Britain,</hi> and now upon his pretended <hi>Miniſtry</hi> in a far diſtant Country, is more honourable, than that publick Scandal and avowed Enemy to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, that denier and derider of the Divinity of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> his Brother <hi>Pierce,</hi> whoſe Books and Quotations he is ſo fond of. No, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had the greateſt Honour in beginning their <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry</hi> amongſt the once peculiar People of God,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002510_0016_0FDB643FD16D6918"/>
before they made any tender thereof to thoſe who were Aliens from that Common-Wealth. But ſince he knows it is denied him, that the <hi>Seventy</hi> were ſuperiour to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> either in Power or Character, he is reſolved to bring them upon a level; and ſince he cannot find, he will make, 82 <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> by a new Creation of Seventy at a Time; and rather than fail in this attempt, impiouſly charge the Inſpiration <hi>Luke</hi> 10.1. with an Omiſſion, and the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators, for not enliſting a Word that was not in the Original, and in ſpite of both, add the Word <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> that it may run, as it does in his Head, and be read <hi>Seventy Apoſtles.</hi> But what would the <hi>Remarker</hi> get by it, if we ſhould allow his fictitious Reading, and falſe Suppoſition to be a true one? nothing ſurely but the ruine of his Cauſe, by ſubverting that Foundation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he deſigned to erect it, the expiration, of the <hi>Seventy</hi>'s Commiſſion. For now by his own Confeſſion, and Pleading too, it muſt be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual: For he has freely and frequently allowed, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Commiſſion, with regard to their ordinary Miniſtrations in the Word and Sacraments, is perpetual, and to continue to the end of the World: Now if theſe <hi>Seventy</hi> be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> as he would have us believe, their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion according to him muſt continue to the end of the World, and then what has he been diſputing about all this while, and contending that the <hi>Seventy</hi>'s Commiſſion is expired; and yet very conſiſtently with himſelf, that it is not expired, but is to continue to the end of Time,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002510_0017_0FDB64418D538790"/>
becauſe they were <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Or we may obſerve him Reaſoning after this ridiculous manner, as they were <hi>Seventy Diſciples,</hi> their Commiſſion is ſpent and ceaſed, but as they were <hi>Seventy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> it will laſt as long as the World. There is no eviting ſuch Conſequences as there will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally flow from this new Hypotheſis, which I will allow him the Honour to be the Author and Inventor of, and all his own; and as ſuch I have only argued upon it, for I don't believe the <hi>Seventy</hi> to be a whit the more <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> for his dubbing them, nor that any of them aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that ſuperiour Order, but as they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by the immediate call of Heaven, or mediately by a Conſecration to the <hi>Apoſtolate.</hi> Add, that it was the Opinion of the primitive Church, as it is of the beſt part of the preſent, that the Helpers and Fellow-Labourers of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> of whom we have frequent Mention in the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Joſeph</hi> called <hi>Barſabas, Mark, Luke, Apollos, Rufus, Niger,</hi> and <hi>Matthias</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> before they were made <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> were of the Number of the <hi>Seventy.</hi> Who would know the Truth of this, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult <hi>Euſeb.</hi> Lib. 1. Cap. 12.</p>
            <p>AND now to ſum up the Evidence of this Charge againſt the <hi>Remarker</hi> upon this ſecond Head, in his denying the continuance of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty</hi>'s Commiſſion, but to make amends in tranſlating them to the <hi>Apoſtolate,</hi> and all upon his bare Word without any Proof.</p>
            <p>IT has, been made appear, that the <hi>Seventy</hi>'s Commiſſion never was formally revoked; and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002510_0018_0FDB6443487F1450"/>
that the Reaſons whereon it was granted conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing, it muſt alſo continue as long as they do, and that again it was ſo far from being true that it was revoked at their return, that they were furniſhed with new Powers for the exerciſe of thoſe Functions it authoriſed them to; and that moreover it does not appear that their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was confined to <hi>Judea,</hi> eſpecially after their firſt return, and their new Endowments, and that he is guilty of the greateſt Profanity in his impious Attempts to add unto the Scripture, and create <hi>Apoſtles</hi> at his pleaſure. It muſt be granted, that the <hi>Remarks</hi> are ſo far from being a <hi>ſober</hi> Performance, that they are an undeniable Evidence of an intractable Perſon, incapable of Conviction, and reſolved to maintain Paradoxes, I therefore appeal to the World that this is his Caſe, and in conſequence thereof, that he ought to allow <hi>Presbyters</hi> to be Succeſſors to the <hi>Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> ſince he ſeem'd to lay the Streſs of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, upon the Point of their Commiſſion being perpetual, and not limitted to the Circumciſion.</p>
            <p>BUT if he will further wrangle and ſay, that if we will not grant him that the <hi>Seventy</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion did determine at their return to our Lord; yet we can't deny but that it expired with themſelves, for ſince according to us, they were meer <hi>Presbyters,</hi> they could not ordain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and tranſmit their Succeſſion; and their Maſter had left the World but no Power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate that Order. Yet however he may like it, we will deny him the Favour even of that Suppoſition, and affirm and prove it too, that the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002510_0019_0FDB64448DE1E8C8"/>
Succeſſion to the <hi>Seventy</hi> was continued in the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> who were ordained to that Office by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the <hi>Biſhops</hi> their Succeſſors, and will be to the end of the World. For the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Commiſſion continuing beyond their Lives, even to the end of the Harveſt, their Commiſſion muſt alſo be ſuppoſed to do the ſame, and muſt actually therefore have been continued, and contained, and confirmed, in the laſt Commiſſion given to the <hi>Apoſtles, Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>John</hi> 20.21, 22, 23. the higher Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Power including the two lower Orders and their Powers. For the <hi>Remarker</hi> confeſſes this to be the Evangelical Charter for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Miniſtry. And by this alſo the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> firſt Commiſſion was not only confirmed and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, but enlarged with regard to Place, and powers of Government and Ordination. For Mr. <hi>Remarker</hi> acknowledges that this laſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion muſt be thus interpreted, to include Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Ordination, as well as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry in the Word and Sacraments, Pages 19 and 25.</p>
            <p>IF it be asked, What are the Offices of thoſe <hi>Presbyters</hi> we here contend for? I anſwer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides preaching and baptizing, the adminiſtring the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, and abſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Penitents.</p>
            <p>IF it be further demanded, By what Divine Warrant they are veſted with ſuch Offices? I anſwer, That we are willing to have our Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice regulated by the primitive Pattern, as we find it in the Scriptures. And</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:002510_0020_0FDB644AA46ADC58"/>Firſt, THERE we don't find that ever meet <hi>Deacons</hi> did conſecrate the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, or had the Powers of Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, WE find that the Brethren that were ſettled <hi>Presbyters</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> did adminiſter the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. (For, there was there in Fact, an Adminiſtration of that Sacrament, and by Conſequence ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Powers for it; the Reprehenſions there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning only the irregular Approaches of the Communicants) and did abſolve the inceſtuous Perſon upon his Repentance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 7. For who could abſolve, but thoſe who had laid him under Cenſures by Excommunication? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12. And therefore,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, THAT it muſt be <hi>Presbyters</hi> who can affix both Seals of the Covenant to the Pardon, that can abſolve Penitents, eſpecially in Caſes of Relapſes after Baptiſm, &amp; that can affix one of them; all which Powers are conferred upon and conveyed unto them by the impoſition of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Hands. This will be made evident upon my bringing home upon him the fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Charge, with reſpect</p>
            <p>Thirdly, TO the higheſt and moſt venerable Order of Chriſts Church-Officers, the <hi>Apoſtolate,</hi> and to which muſt needs ſucceed the <hi>Epiſcopate,</hi> taken in its proper preſent Senſe The <hi>Remarker</hi> has here indeed perplexed the Caſe, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to <hi>darken Counſel by Words without Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> Job 38.2. But I ſhall trace his Windings, and fiſh him out. But to do him Juſtice, I muſt
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002510_0021_0FDB644C0E57EFA0"/>
ſhow wherein he yields, and my ſelf, wherein againſt all Reaſon, he does not.</p>
            <p>BE it known then that, by this own Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we are upon this Head agreed in theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</p>
            <p>Firſt, WE agree, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with extraordinary Powers and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and amongſt them, with an unlimitted Juriſdiction over all the Churches, which was to expire with themſelves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, WE are agreed, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> laſt Commiſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19 and 20. empow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered them and their Succeſſors, not only to the Miniſtrations of the Word and Sacraments, but to the Government of the Church, and to the Ordination of Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, WE are further agreed, that the Powers of Government and Ordination are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, HE will doubtleſs grant with me, That in Fact, whatever it may be as to Reaſon, the Government of <hi>Praelates</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> are two different ſorts of Government; that is, the Government of a <hi>Praelate</hi> over a <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> wherein are many <hi>Presbyters</hi> and Congregations, is not the ſame with that of a <hi>Presbyter</hi> over a ſingle <hi>Flock.</hi> And I wiſh we were agreed as well about the</p>
            <p>Fifth Point. THE Diſcuſſion whereof deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the Controverſy, whereby I affirm, what he denies, That the Power of Ordination was annexed to the Government of <hi>Praelates,</hi> taken in its proper preſent Eccleſiaſtical Senſe, and not to that Government that meer <hi>Presbyters</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:002510_0022_0FDB644D8DC1F130"/>
have over their ſingle Congregations.</p>
            <p>Now there is no other way to be determined in this Point, but by Facts and Precedents upon ſacred Record, and the Reaſon of Things For to run out into wild Excurſions, and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: Quotations, (which make up the bulk of the <hi>Remarks,</hi> and whereof if ſtrip'd, there would remain nothing of a real Argument,) is to fall from ſolid Reaſoning, and run wide of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. And I appeal to both theſe for the Proof of my Aſſertion, and venture the Cauſe upon the Arguments formed on them. The cleareſt and moſt unexceptionable Facts and Precedents of what kind of Government was annexed to the Power of Ordination, by and after the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> upon the ſacred Records, are contained in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and Chriſts unto the <hi>Aſian Angels, Rev.</hi> 1.20. and Chap 2.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I mention St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles firſt, becauſe firſt wrote. To proceed the more methodically, I ſhall</p>
            <p>Firſt conſider the Nature of a <hi>Praelates</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as a <hi>Dioceſan Biſhop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That with ſuch a Government <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were veſted.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That to them veſted with ſuch a Government, was committed the Power of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the <hi>Aſian Angels</hi> were veſted with the like Government, and in juſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence had the Power of Ordination.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That to them veſted with ſuch a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, was committed the ſole Power of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002510_0023_0FDB6451EECDEB18"/>
Ordination, excluſive of meer <hi>Presbyters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, That the Reaſon of the Inſtitution of the <hi>Epiſcopal Order</hi> continuing, it muſt alſo be of the ſame Continuance.</p>
            <p>THE clearing theſe Points, muſt needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Controverſy.</p>
            <p>Firſt, LET us conſider the Nature of a <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi> Government, as he is a <hi>Dioceſan Biſhop;</hi> and upon enquiry we ſhall find, that it implied at its firſt Inſtitution, as it does now, the giving Inſtructions to thoſe <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> that are within the Verge of his Inſpection, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Behaviour, and the exerciſe of their Offices, the preſcribing Rules for a decent and regular Performance of publick Worſhip, taking care that their Doctrines be Sound and Orthodox, encouraging and promoting thoſe that are faithful and diligent, as on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry puniſhing with Cenſures or Suſpenſion, the contumacious and diſobedient; inſpecting alſo into the Converſations of the People within their Juriſdiction, that they be as becometh their Profeſſion, and if not, being liable to his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Correction. Theſe are ſome Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Praelatical Government</hi> of a <hi>Dioceſan Biſhop.</hi> Now let us ſee,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whether <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were intruſted with ſuch Powers and Authority, and if their Government be found <hi>Praelatical</hi> in theſe Inſtances, I hope it will not be denied, that they were in the preſent proper Senſe of the Words, <hi>Dioceſan Biſhops.</hi> Now that in Fact they were veſted with ſuch a Government, will be clear by
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002510_0024_0FDB6452D5136E78"/>
having recourſe to the Epiſtles to them, where Records thereof are preſerved. For there we ſhall find them endowed with theſe Powers and Charges, to inſpect into the <hi>Presbyters</hi> Conduct, and if it be not becoming the Goſpel and their Character, they were to cenſure and ſuſpend <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 19 and 20. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. To direct the Method for Divine Worſhip, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1—9. To take care that the <hi>Presbyters</hi> preached ſound Doctrine, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. and rebuke them ſharply, and even ſtop their Mouths if they did not. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6, 7, and 11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.9, 10, and 11. And to prefer the deſerving, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13. and Chap. 5.17. And many Rules are given not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Government of their Miniſters, but of their Congregations alſo, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.2—17. Ch. 6.17, 18, and 19. Now theſe were all proper Acts of a <hi>Praelatical Government,</hi> over ſeveral <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> and Congregations, and not over a ſingle <hi>Fleck,</hi> as is here evident from the ſeveral Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Rule over <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable from <hi>Crete</hi>'s being a place where were many Cities, in every one of which <hi>Presbyters</hi> were to be ſettled; it will therefore follow, they were <hi>Dioceſan Biſhops,</hi> in the ſtrict proper preſent Senſe of the Words.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, WE are to obſerve, that to thoſe very Perſons thus veſted and intruſted with the <hi>praelatical Powers</hi> and Government of <hi>Dioceſan Biſhops,</hi> was committed the Power of Ordination. It was no other than <hi>Timothy</hi> adorned with all thoſe Signatures of Rule over the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that was to lay on Hands with Caution,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002510_0025_0FDB64551034DD60"/>
and as he found the Candidates qualified for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Services, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21, 22. It was no other, than this very <hi>Titus,</hi> in whom we have found ſuch legible Characters of a <hi>Dioceſan Biſhop,</hi> that for this very end was left in <hi>Crete,</hi> to ordain El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in every City, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. And it is to no purpoſe for the <hi>Remarker</hi> to alledge, that they had thoſe Powers of Government and Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as endowed with extraordinary Powers or Gifts. This is <hi>petitio Principii,</hi> or in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Expreſſion, a mean begging of the Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for as we know, he will hardly believe us, even although we prove, ſo he may be aſſured that his <hi>perhaps</hi> and <hi>may be</hi>'s are of no weight with us; for we will never take his Word for any thing he don't make appear. And it is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous for him and his Party, who are ſo Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous for Scripture Proofs and Examples, for every thing that is to be done about ſacred Things or Perſons, to go upon bare Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Things of the higheſt Moment. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary either of Powers or Gifts, appears in the whole Caſe; nothing but what <hi>Dioceſan Biſhops</hi> with their ordinary Powers may and do ordinarily perform. And it is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and againſt all the Laws of Reaſoning, to put us upon the proof of theſe Negatives, That they had no Aſſiſtance, that they did not all this as <hi>Presbyters,</hi> &amp;c. We deny all theſe groundleſs Surmiſes, and therefore the Proof belongs to him the poſitive Affirmer, which becauſe there is no Ground to go upon, we are aſſured it can never be done. We are now further for the Confimation of our Point,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:002510_0026_0FDB6456903D8C08"/>Fourthly, TO evince, that the <hi>Aſian Angels</hi> were veſted with a like Government, and in juſt Conſequence had the Power of Ordination. That they were veſted with a <hi>praelatical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> appears from hence, that ſeveral of them were threatned and condemned by our Lord, for ſuffering or not reſtraining the Doctrines of <hi>Balaam,</hi> the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> and <hi>Jezebel,</hi> Rev. 2.14, 15. and 20. which plainly implied, that they were veſted with a coercive ruling Power over theſe Churches: For if they were only <hi>ſenior Paſtors</hi> or <hi>Moderators,</hi> as the <hi>Remarker</hi> dotes, how could they be culpable and made criminal for not doing, what was not in their Power to do? For as ſuch they could only give their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Judgement and Vote, but not reſtrain the Actions, with the Toleration whereof they are charged. So that the <hi>Remarker</hi> muſt either blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly feign our Lord to bring an unjuſt Charge againſt thoſe <hi>Angels,</hi> accuſing them of what they were not guilty, and puniſhing them for what they could not help, or confeſs the Truth, that their Accuſation and threatned Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment was juſt, becauſe they had not exerted their <hi>praelatical Powers</hi> in cenſuring and reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing licentious Doctrines of ſeducing Teachers, within their ſeveral Juriſdictions; and that tho' they were conſtituted Guardians of the Purity of the Chriſtian Faith, they had been remiſs in their Charge, and permitted the Corruption of it, to the Diſhonour of its Author, and the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of their own Characters. This is the only good and true Account that can be given of
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002510_0027_0FDB645A404A6AC8"/>
that Matter; as for the <hi>Remarker</hi>'s Dream, that every <hi>Angel</hi> was a Company of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> it is hardly worth while to awake him out of it, by any ſerious Obſervation on ſo remarkable a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. He may with much more Reaſon allow all the <hi>Presbytery</hi> that ordained <hi>Timothy</hi> to be in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> than all the <hi>Presbyters</hi> that were in the <hi>leſſer Aſia</hi> to be in ſeven <hi>Biſhops.</hi> But I ſhall not follow him in his Wild-Gooſe Chaſe, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to obſerve, That ſince thoſe <hi>Angels</hi> had committed to them the <hi>praelatical</hi> Power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they muſt alſo have been veſted with the Power of Ordination; for we find theſe Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers annexed, as in the foregoing Inſtances of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and ſince it plainly appears they were veſted with the Powers of the one, there is no reaſon to deny them the Power of the other. And by juſt Conſequence in both they were <hi>Dioceſan Biſhops.</hi> Having then found ſo many <hi>Prelates</hi> in their <hi>Dioceſſes,</hi> let us now ſee whether there were any Coadjutors appointed to aſſiſt them in their Ordinations, or to the making them the more valid: And upon a due enquiry we ſhall find,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, THAT to them veſted with ſuch Powers of Government, was committed the ſole power of Ordination, excluſive of meer <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> For in Points of ſo great Conſequence, we muſt go upon certain Facts and Precedents, and not upon meer Conjecture, ſupported by no Reaſon; and when nothing of this Nature ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears or is affirmed, it is intolerable Boldneneſs to conclude it confidently. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002510_0028_0FDB645BD7DAEB18"/>
I charge <hi>Thee</hi> to lay Hands, I left <hi>Thee</hi> to ordain, without the leaſt mentioning of <hi>Presbyters</hi> to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that the ſole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Ordination was committed to them only, ſince we have no Warrant or Precedent for the neceſſity of <hi>Presbyters</hi> Concurrence, unleſs it be in that often miſ-interpreted Text, <hi>The laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery,</hi> whereby is meant even in the Judgment of thoſe who were not in every thing the greateſt Friends to the <hi>Epiſcopal Order,</hi> the Office which was transferred on <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> at his Ordination by St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s own Hands. And therefore what Aſſurance muſt it be in meer <hi>Presbyters,</hi> to aſſume to themſelves the greateſt Power in the Church, that of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and pretending to perform that Action not only without a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> but in oppoſition to him. For neither of which Practices is there any Foundation in the Word of God, or any Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſuch a Practice there. And now to ſum up the Evidence,</p>
            <p>IF from Facts and Precedents upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Records, if it appears that a <hi>Praelatical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Dioceſan Biſhops</hi> conſiſts in their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement above, and Rule over <hi>Presbyters</hi> and their Churches, that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were veſted with that Government, that the ſole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Ordination was committed to them veſted with thoſe Powers of Government, that the <hi>Aſian Angels</hi> were veſted with ſuch a <hi>praelatical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and that therefore to them alſo the ſole Power of Ordination was committed excluſive of others the Propoſition muſt be granted, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002510_0029_0FDB646095CDF478"/>
That the Powers of Ordination was annexed to the Government of <hi>Praelates,</hi> taken in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Eccleſiaſtical Senſe, excluſive of meer <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I argue the Truth of this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the <hi>Remarker</hi> from the Reaſon of Things. He allows the Neceſſity and Being of <hi>Praelacy</hi> during the Times of Inſpiration, before the Canon of the Scripture was finiſhed, and during the Infancy of the Church, and all thoſe Reaſons now ceaſing, he ſays, there is no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Occaſion for it, and that the Church now wants no ſuch Governours, inaſmuch as the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Religion will be as well provided for without them; an Inſtance whereof is the ſtate of Religion in this Country, as he ſays. Now if the reverſe of all this be the Truth, as it is demonſtrable, ſo then the Neceſſity of <hi>Praelacy</hi> ſtill continues. And</p>
            <p>Firſt, IF there was a Neceſſity of <hi>Praelacy</hi> in the Times of Inſpiration, it is much more Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it ſhould continue, that ceaſing: For the infallible Conduct, of the Spirit, was ſufficient to guide the Church in all its Duties and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, whereas now there is a neceſſity for a ſettled Government and Laws. And it's more than probable, for that very Reaſon a <hi>Praelacy</hi> was inſtituted, to keep the World within the proper Bounds of their Duty, and direct their Practice, and their Conſcience in more doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Caſes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, THERE is as much if not more Reaſon for <hi>Praelacy;</hi> to be ſure, more clear In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002510_0030_0FDB64635A3AA920"/>
of it after, than before the finiſhing of the Canon of the Scripture. However, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels were writ before the cleareſt Marks we have of the eſtabliſhing <hi>Praelacy,</hi> and there is nothing in the Epiſtles or Revelation that tends to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it, but much every way to confirm and eſtabliſh it. And</p>
            <p>Thirdly, AS to the Infancy of the Church, if that be a good Reaſon for it, it ſtill holds, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in this Country, where the Church is in its infant State. But why ſhould it be ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Infant, and ſo needleſs for Adult Chriſtianity? When Perſons grow up, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten grow unruly, and very much want to be kept under Reſtraint and Government. And</p>
            <p>Laſtly, AS to Appeals to his own Country, and the ſtate of Religion in it, what could have been brought as a more fragrant Evidence for the Neceſſity of another kind of Government than what is in it, than the Diſorders and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, the Contentions and Confuſions that are among them, for want of one to whom the dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier Reſort is to be made, and the Hydra of Hereſies which ought to be beat down by the Croſier.</p>
            <p>ADD therefore the Reaſon of the Things to the Facts and Precedents we have for <hi>Praelacy,</hi> and upon them both, I think I may venture to appeal to the common Senſe of Mankind, for its agreeing to the Truth of the Propoſition. I can't paſs from this Head, without animadvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſome Cavils, that the <hi>Remarker</hi> has at two Texts adduced by the <hi>Modeſt Proof,</hi> for the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002510_0031_0FDB13B92B117F58"/>
perpetuity of the <hi>Apoſtolate.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.17. He may ſet his Teeth and grin at the Word <hi>Set</hi> in one of thoſe Texts, yet there is an obſervable Emphaſis on it, as if it denoted the Stability of that Inſtitution in the Divine Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And as to his imperious Demand, By what Laws of Interpretation we conſtrue what follows the three Words firſt named, (whereby we mean the three Orders we contend for) of Gifts, and the Exerciſes of them.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, By the acknowledged Laws of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting Scripture by Scripture, for as to <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> he himſelf acknowledges their Continuance, and that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue as long as the World. The Texts are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and we have no Account of any other Office of a ſtanding Nature: And therefore all thoſe Deſignations that are delivered in abſtract Words, muſt be applied to the three Orders which are expreſſed in concrete Terms.</p>
            <p>LET us here again view his Vanity, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him glorying in an imaginary Conqueſt over thoſe Conceſſions in the <hi>Modeſt Proof, That tho' the Apoſtles were veſted with an unlimitted Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, yet thy only tranſmitted a limitted one.</hi> But notwithſtanding of this, they have true Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors both in Government and Ordination. For theſe are Truths, and even reconcileable to our Apprehenſions. Suppoſe a great Prince has ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sons, and ſeveral Principalities, and to each Son he gives a Principality, and all the Power whereby he governed it, certainly each Son ſucceeds the Father in the whole Power
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002510_0032_0FDB646915CBD198"/>
over his reſpective Principality, tho' not in the whole of the Power the Father had over all the Principalities. This is the very Caſe; St. <hi>Paul,</hi> for Inſtance, and ſo by a Parity of Reaſon, the ſame is to be ſaid of the reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> gave his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> as he calls him, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as he did <hi>Titus</hi> that of <hi>Crete,</hi> with full Power to govern thoſe Places, as he would do was he preſent. And now who can deny but that <hi>Timothy</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Paul</hi> in the whole Power he had over <hi>Epheſus,</hi> tho' not in the whole of the Power he had over all other Churches; and the like of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and all others whom the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> conſtituted <hi>Biſhops</hi> in their reſpective <hi>Dioceſſes.</hi> And has not Mr. <hi>Remarker</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged all this? Yea verily, all the Difference is, that he contends this limitted Juriſdiction ſhould neceſſarily be contracted to a ſingle <hi>Pariſh,</hi> whereas we deny that Neceſſity, and have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it was not thus originally ſo bounded.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' it's thus evident that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſettled by Chriſt and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the Church, was founded in an Imparity of Officers, or rather in a proper <hi>Dioceſan Epiſcopacy;</hi> yet ſince often the Diſtance is wide between Poſſeſſion and Right, I don't affirm there is ſuch an inviolable and eſſential Connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Powers of Ordination and Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they muſt always be found in an actual Conjunction. For the Ordinations of a <hi>Biſhop</hi> unjuſtly expelled his See, are good and valid, wherever he is, and to whoſe Character the Faithful will always every where pay their doe Regards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:002510_0033_0FDB646A12A164D8"/>NOR do I meaſure the <hi>Epiſcopal Power</hi> of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination by the extent of Juriſdiction, for that Power varies not by Accidents or Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And therefore let the <hi>Remarker</hi> make as little Logical a Dioceſs for a <hi>Biſhop</hi> as he can, we cannot admit his <hi>independent Paſtor</hi> to uſurp it, or ſuſtain ſo much as the very loweſt Office in the Goſpel Miniſtry; and that for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we have been upon, becuuſe he has not been ordained by a Succeſſor to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in whom always according to the original Inſtitution, the powers of Ordination and Juriſdiction over a plurality of <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> either in Fact or Right, that is a capacity or plenitude of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for ſuch a Government, are connected; the Fact he diſowns, and the Right he diſclaims, and therefore from neither can he make any juſt pretence to a valid Ordination.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now under this ſecond Head ſubjoin ſome Defences of the Anſwers, that were made to the Objections which the <hi>Remarker</hi> and his Party commonly urge againſt <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi> Firſt, as to that of <hi>Acts</hi> 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>17, and 28. thoſe were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly preſent at that Meeting at <hi>Miletus</hi> with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> among whom he had gone preaching for three Years in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and theſe were undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly <hi>Biſhops</hi> about, as well as the Elders of the City of <hi>Epheſus</hi> unleſs we will admit theſe three Abſurdities, Firſt, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> travelled three Years preaching only in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which who can believe, who conſiders not only the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of the Expreſſion, but the greatneſs of his Work, and the extent of his Commiſſion?
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002510_0034_0FDB646F0B374AC8"/>
Secondly, that the Country <hi>Biſhops</hi> were ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult of acceſs and ſtiff, that they could not ſo eaſily be convened as the <hi>Epheſian Elders;</hi> for the <hi>Remarker</hi> ſeems to hint ſuch a thing, when he ſays, The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was in haſt, and could not wait for them; which who can believe of ſo good a Man? And Thirdly, That <hi>Timothy,</hi> whom we have proved by all the Marks of a <hi>praelatical Power</hi> to have been a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and whom the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker</hi> ſays was preſent, was ſtill an <hi>Elder</hi> and no more; and therefore unleſs we will grant theſe Abſurdities, we muſt conclude, that there were <hi>Biſhops</hi> preſent as well as <hi>Presbyters.</hi> Secondly, As to <hi>Ti<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</hi> 1.7. as it was neceſſary that <hi>Titus</hi> at his firſt Reſidence in the Iſland, ſhould ordain Elders in every City, ſo as the number of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and Congregations in each City increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was neceſſary he ſhould ordain <hi>Biſhops</hi> to preſide over the <hi>Presbyters</hi> and Churches that were in each City. For it is moſt probable that in the dawning of the Goſpel, when there were ſo few of thoſe Lights the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> that one <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> not only ordained <hi>Presbyters</hi> but <hi>Prelates</hi> too, tho' Antiquity tells us <hi>Timothy</hi> was a <hi>Metropolitan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, All this to be replied and applied unto 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2—7. And however ſtrange the <hi>Remarker</hi> may think that St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not expreſs himſelf in Language ſignificant to his Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, it is much more ſtrange that he ſhould fault the Conduct of an inſpired <hi>Apoſtle.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever for his Satisfaction in this Point, I remit him to St. <hi>Chryſ.</hi> whom he will find giving a very good Reaſon, why there is little ſaid to or of

               <hi>Presbyters,</hi> where <hi>Biſhops</hi> were preſent, or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, in Hom. 11. on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. Edit. <hi>Savil.</hi> Tom. 4. P. 289. <hi>A peri Epiſcopoon eipe tauta kai tois Presbuterois armottei tee gar Cheirotonia monee Uper bebeekaſi kai touto monon dioikouſi pleonektein tous Presbuterous.</hi> Implying, <hi>That the ſame Rules giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to</hi> Biſhops, <hi>may be applied to</hi> Presbyters, <hi>except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the Caſe of Ordination, which was peculiar to</hi> Biſhops.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As to <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. it is certain that <hi>Philippi</hi> was a chief City of <hi>Macedonia, Acts</hi> 16.12. round which were doubtleſs a great many Churches and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> who might be denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the <hi>Metropolis;</hi> I ſay doubtleſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is paſt all doubt but that theſe People were mightily increaſed in Numbers, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly commended for their Piety and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in that Epiſtle, and as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igencies of the Churches required, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours unqueſtionably often met to conſult about the common Concerns of Chriſtianity; for they were deſired to ſtrive together for the Faith of the Goſpel, <hi>v.</hi> 27. And therefore it was no greater a Solociſm in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to write to the <hi>Biſhops</hi> at <hi>Philippi,</hi> than it would be to write to the <hi>Biſhops</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> in the ſitting of the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, tho' we know there is but one <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>London.</hi> And notwithſtanding all he has ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Tranſlation offered in the <hi>Modeſt Proof,</hi> there is nothing in the Original that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it being exactly ſo rendered; unleſs it be the Cauſe of <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi> The Caſe indeed may be otherwiſe where the Original will allow, but the Senſe will not ſuffer the Tranſlation, leſt it ſhould ſuffer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:002510_0036_0FDB6472B0DF3EE8"/>Fifthly, As to what he trifles about the Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Names, I obſerve firſt, That it is certain great Perſonages are ſometimes ſtiled from the loweſt Offices they ſuſtain; and yet it muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be allowed without any Diminution to their Characters, to which higher Appellations are likewiſe due. Secondly, That it is a very laudable Attempt in many great Divines (tho' faulted by our <hi>Remarker</hi>) to reconcile their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Names to their Offices; tho' after different Methods, yet all concurring in the ſame general Deſign, of bringing the different Orders to their reſpective Appellations, according to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions we find founded in their Nature Thirdly, That the <hi>Remarker</hi> is reſolved to have two of theſe common and promiſcuous Names, as he calls them, and appropriate them to one Office, and like an Ambidexter, with one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them repel the Force of any Argument.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That when a <hi>Biſhop</hi> is mentioned, is always underſtood one of the higheſt of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Order, who is alſo a <hi>Presbyter</hi> and <hi>Deacon.</hi> When a <hi>Presbyter</hi> is mentioned, one that is alſo certainly a <hi>Deacon,</hi> and who may by ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Circumſtances appear to be alſo a <hi>Biſhop.</hi> And when a <hi>Deacon</hi> is mentioned, the loweſt Order of Church Officers, but by a narrow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection in<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Times and Circumſtances, and the Occaſions of mentioning him under that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, may be actually at the ſame time, not only a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> but a <hi>Biſhop.</hi> And this for the Identity of Names. Sixthly, As to that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.25. it's certain our Saviour's Anſwer
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:002510_0037_0FDB647677416A90"/>
was pertinent to the Petition, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that appears in either, intended of Church Authority; for the two Apoſtles imagining that their Maſter was to be a Temporal Prince, were willing by their maternal Advice and Requeſt, to beſpeak Advancement in that Kingdom; and therefore not a <hi>Biſhoprick,</hi> but ſome Principality or ſecular Dominion. The Argument therefore in this Inſtance, is wide of the Caſe and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, As to 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.23. it's certain, that whatever Defects of Ingenuity or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Mr. <hi>Remarker</hi> diſcovers, he is ſure to make it up in Malice, here inſinuating, that the <hi>Engliſh Biſhops</hi> are conſecrated <hi>Lords Biſhops,</hi> as Succeſſors in, or Partakers of that Temporal Kingdom the Brethren dreamt of; whereas the Title of <hi>Lords</hi> proceeds only from the Munificence of <hi>Princes,</hi> as the Rewards of the <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s Piety and Services, and for the greater Honour and Reverence to their Character; and the Temporalities are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed for the ſupport of their Dignity, and to enable them for Acts of Charity and Hoſpitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and therefore our <hi>Engliſh Biſhops</hi> would be equally <hi>Chriſt's Biſhops,</hi> if they were no <hi>Lords</hi> and had no Lands; tho' for the Reaſons given, it is juſt and neceſſary they ſhould be the one, and have the other, and be treated with Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and good Manners.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, As to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. I am willing to be determined by the Author he has appeal'd unto, whoſe Words on the Place I ſhall ſet down in his own Language, to avoid the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults

I ſay his own abuſed <hi>Calvin,</hi> for that tho' in moſt things he is on his own ſide, yet becauſe he had frankly confeſſed a known Truth, that <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was the primitive Church Government, he brings him in talking this Nonſenſe, p. 53. Out of the Order of <hi>Elders,</hi> they choſe preaching and ruling Elders; whereas there is not a Word of thoſe <hi>Elders</hi> in the Place he refers to, but the three Orders of Miniſters which the ancient Church retained, according to the Scriptures. And p. 17. he tranſlates <hi>Secundo loco,</hi> the Time of their Miſſion. I call upon him therefore to confeſs, that either he deſigned to abuſe that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in the Tranſlation, or that he did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his Language, and ſo could not help it.</p>
            <p>He had better let Dr. <hi>Scott</hi> been at reſt, for he has raiſed a Ghoſt he can never conjure, nor all the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in the World ever anſwer the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Argument. For there being only a ceaſing of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> extraordinary Powers, but no Repeal of the Inſtitution of the Apoſtolical Order; and the Reaſons whereon it was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manifeſtly continuing, it can never be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be diſcontinued, which would alſo ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

a violation of the Divine Promiſe, that it ſhould continue to the end of the World: And all Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi>'s Specialties relate only to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> peculiar and extraordinary Gifts and Priviledges; the not obſerving of which Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (only when it can ſerve a turn) is the <hi>Prot<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now I hope what has been ſaid is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to convict him of having this Symptom of Intemperance upon him, That he is tenacious of his Opinions, againſt the cleareſt Evidence, and that he affirms and denies any thing at his pleaſure, and without any Proof but his bare Word. I proceed to the</p>
            <p>Third Charge that he has upon him, that Sign of Intemperance, that he is full of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies, and not only contradicts others, but himſelf: And as to the former part, I think I have made it appear, that he has very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with Truth or Manners, contradicted the beſt and wiſeſt of Men, and that he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himſelf, ſince perhaps he will not take my Word, I hope he will take his own, and believe his dear ſelf, when he talks at random after this manner, p. 48. <hi>It can't be proved but that</hi> Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>was an itinerant Miſſionary, having no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Relation to the Church of</hi> Epheſus; and then tacks about and denies it all, p. 56. and ſays, <hi>Timoth<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:002510_0040_0FDB647DEC9183F0"/>Laſt Sign I mentioned of his being inflamed with Intemperance, and that is his being ſoon angry, and very quarrelſome without Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; elſe, why <hi>occaſional Perjury?</hi> the modeſt Gentleman he was ſnarling at, had ſaid nothing to raiſe his Choler, unleſs it was inſinuating, that <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Praelacy</hi> mutually ſupport each other, and that <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Sedition</hi> are near a-kin; and I verily believe this was the Caſe, and he was touched in the tender Part; for neither he nor any of his Party are willing to hear this ſad Truth, That <hi>Presbytery</hi> was hardly any where ever eſtabliſhed, but on the Ruins of <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> None but an angry Non-con C—b would have given the Name of <hi>prating Coxcomb</hi> to a <hi>Biſhop</hi> or <hi>Deacon,</hi> and that meerly becauſe he performs his Office according to the Powers of its Original Inſtitution. And why ſo angry with <hi>My Lords the Biſhops?</hi> Is the Plumb green becauſe it is ſo high? Sure they ought to be treated with Deference and Diſtinction, on account of their Titles that are of Regal Creation. But I muſt quit his Company, leſt I alſo ſhould ſeem to grow angry at his intolerable Inſolencies.</p>
            <p>But here perhaps the <hi>Remarker</hi> may alledge, I have miſtaken him, and that by <hi>Sobriety</hi> he meant <hi>Modeſty</hi> and <hi>Integrity;</hi> I ſhall therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent him to you in the Dreſe of thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Characters, that it may be known what right he has to wear them: And I have reſerved this View of him to this Place, being unwilling to mingle with the Diſpute, what did not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally concern it.</p>

               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:002510_0041_0FDB647F1468A7B8"/>Now if to appeal to the venerable Order of <hi>Biſhops</hi> (for ſo moſt of them were whom he cites to vouch for him) to condemn their own Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and confeſs themſelves bold Uſurpers upon the Rights of <hi>Presbyters</hi> and People, as holding an unlawful Office, by as unwarrantable a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure; or if to ſummon Perſons of the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected Veracity, to affirm as Truth, what they knew to be falſe, and <hi>e contra;</hi> or if to put them to the Torture to ſpeak againſt their Knowledge; or if laſtly to pervert and wreſt their Words to a Meaning, the direct contrary whereof they were deſigned to expreſs, be <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt</hi> and <hi>ſincere;</hi> then the <hi>Remarker</hi> is the Man he pretends to be; for this is his very Caſe, and has been his laboured Practice.

Men have defended him from allowing any more than commemorative Prayers. But ſuppoſing him in an Error in one Point, will it follow, that all he ſays is falſe? if that be admitted as a Rule, the <hi>Remarker</hi>'s Teſtimony muſt never be allowed in any Caſe; for I appeal to the World, that I have detected him guilty of a great many Errors. But beſides this Teſtimony, we have St. <hi>Aug.</hi> condemning that Heretick, for this very Reaſon, <hi>Quod aſſeverat Presbyterum ab Epiſcopo nulla differentia debere diſtingui. Aug.</hi> Lib. de Heret. <hi>Becauſe he acknowledged no difference between a Biſhop and a Presbyter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus have we the Senſe of thoſe Fathers upon the Diſpute, whom the <hi>Remarker</hi> has had the modeſty to affirm to be on his ſide of it.</p>
            <p>And by the way I would obſerve, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his learned Criticiſm upon the Word <hi>Presbuterion,</hi> that in the Language of the Greek Fathers <hi>Cheirotonia Presbuteriou</hi> ſtands for the Decree or Order of Presbyterat, as is plain <hi>Euſeb.</hi> Lib. 6.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker</hi>'s pretence to this Virtue, I would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that it amounts to no leſs than a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that <hi>Epiſcopal Government</hi> is of a Divine Original, and that upon theſe Reaſons:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That in Fact it being found in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, no Time can be aſſigned but the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> when it begun.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:002510_0046_0FDB648E2DF32B18"/>Secondly, That it was ſo far from being ſet up by the ſecular Power, that it was the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church in the heat of the fierceſt Perſecutions, wherein the <hi>Biſhops</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, were in a manner ſure of a Crown of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That if <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was not coeval with Chriſtianity, it would be a Miracle that at one and the ſame Inſtant, the Government of the Church ſhould become univerſally <hi>prelatical,</hi> for ſo we find it every where eſtabliſhed where Chriſtianity was planted. And</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That it would be no leſs Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that there ſhould be no Envy or Ambition among any of the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as not to complain and remonſtrate againſt the <hi>Praelates</hi> Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on their Priviledges, before the Heretick <hi>Aerius,</hi> nor any of them have ſo much Goodneſs and Reſolution, as not to aſſert their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority againſt thoſe unreaſonable Uſurpations upon their Powers, had they eſteemed them ſuch.</p>
            <p>And therefore upon the whole, it muſt be granted, that whether by Miracles, or (which is moſt evident) by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles Epiſcopacy</hi> was eſtabliſhed, it is every way of a Divine Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>
            <p>But as if it was not criminal enough to break open the Monuments of Antiquity and bring forth thoſe Reverend Perſons to diſown their avowed Principles, &amp; deny their kown Practice, he has the Sincerity to apply to others of a later Date, for the ſame purpoſe; and even
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:002510_0047_0FDB651090A12FD8"/>
where the Fallacies lie more liable to Diſcovery. Thus he faſtens upon Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> to extort ſuch Confeſſions from him as may ſpeak his Senſe: St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> as quoted by him on this Head, has been already vindicated from his Calumny and Cavils; St. <hi>Jerom</hi> (unfairly cited by him) is brought in by the <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſaying, <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes tamen Epiſcopi quicunque ſunt, ſunt Succeſſores Apoſtolorum, Apol.</hi> p. 167. <hi>All Biſhops whatever are the Apoſtles Succeſſors.</hi> And giving his own Senſe of the matter, and that of the Church he was defending, he ſays, <hi>Varios in Eccleſia eſſe Ordines Miniſtrorum, alios eſſe Diaconos, alios Presbyteros, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lios Epiſcopos, quibus inſtitutio populi, et Religionis cura et procuratio commiſſa eſt, Apol. p.</hi> 25. <hi>Edit.</hi> Lond. 1692. <hi>There are ſeveral Orders of Miniſters in the Church, ſome Deacons, ſome Presbyters, ſome Biſhops, to whom the cure Souls, and the care of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is committed.</hi> Thus Biſhop <hi>Jewel.</hi> With the ſame degrees of Integrity would he impoſe upon the World in the Inſtance of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift,</hi> who in the place he refers to, only denies the extraordinary Powers of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to be continued; but for what of their Power is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, let us hear himſelf in his Diſpute upon this very Point with <hi>Cartwright,</hi> where he tells him, <hi>Foraſmuch as you greatly contemn Authority, and would have all things proved by Scripture, let me hear a Word of the ſame that doth but intimate theſe Offices to be temporal; the place it ſelf ſeemeth to import a continuance of theſe Functions unto the coming of Chriſt,</hi> for he ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I am perſwaded you cannot ſhew

            <p>He miſtakes the Principle Arch-Biſhop. <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft</hi> went upon, which was, that the <hi>Epiſcopate</hi> contained in it ſelf the inferiour Orders, and therefore he looked on ſuch as had only <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> Ordination to be meer Lay men, and in this he had Precedents in the extraordinary Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> made Biſhop of <hi>Millain,</hi> at the Inſtance of the <hi>Emperor Valentinian,</hi> and <hi>Nectari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the like Inſtance of <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> without going through the intermediate probational Stations.</p>
            <p>Tho' <hi>Henry the Eighth</hi> as an arbitrary Prince obliged the <hi>Biſhops</hi> to take out Royal Licenſes for the exerciſe of their Spiritual Authority, yet ſurely they derived that from no King but Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: And tho' Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> rather yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too far to the Humour of that King, tho' for a good End, the better to promote the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, yet Mr. <hi>Strype,</hi> in his Life tells us, <hi>that being askt if a Biſhop can make a Prieſt, replied, We read not that any other not being a Biſhop, hath ſince the beginning of Chriſt's Church ordained a Prieſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a perverſe Slander be a Sign of Integrity, the <hi>Remarker</hi> has it upon him, in affirming the <hi>Irenicum</hi> to have been wrote by any Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and as to what is or can be made of it, ſtands all for nothing, for the reaſon of this Promiſe, that when the <hi>Remarker</hi> ſhall act the ingenuous part of the <hi>Dean</hi> of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, who by

            <p>If the <hi>Remarker</hi> will read A. B. <hi>Spotſwood</hi>'s Hiſtory of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 153. to <hi>p.</hi> 160. and <hi>Petries</hi> on the ſame Subject, from <hi>p.</hi> 232. to <hi>p.</hi> 380. he will find, (contrary to the falſe Poſition he has laid down) that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Superintendants had power of Ordination, which they called Admiſſion, of Viſitation, Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Depoſition, holding Dioceſan Synods, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Appeals, judging Divorces, injoining Pennance, and in a Word, doing every thing that is properly Epiſcopal.</p>
            <p>And if he will read Father <hi>Paul</hi>'s Hiſtory of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 573. to <hi>p.</hi> 687. he'l find, that the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Legates there uſed all their Endeavours to overthrow <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> which wicked Deſign however the <hi>Gallican</hi> Biſhops chiefly as ſtrenuouſly oppoſed, and maintained <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> to be <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> ſo that had the <hi>Pope</hi> then obtained his Ends, <hi>Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> would have been ſet up in all the Popiſh Countries and the <hi>Pope</hi> been <hi>Moderator,</hi> and would ſtill if he could, ſo that in him indeed <hi>Presbytery</hi> has a Patron and a Pillar, and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker</hi>

a Friend to his Cauſe, tho' that is not the only Point wherein they meet.</p>
            <p>But finding no Friends a home, the <hi>Remarker</hi> lays aſide all his modeſt Pretences to their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages and with an Air of Aſſurance would look for ſome Countenance abroad, but for all his Confidence, he needs not be ſo ſanguine to think that he is much in the Favour of any there; for I might produce the moſt conſiderable of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Divines, pronouncing ſolemn Anathemas upon the rebellious Separatiſts from the <hi>Engliſh Epiſcopal</hi> Communion, and make it appear that they ſtand condemned Schiſmaticks by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Calvin, Bezs, Amyrould<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Claud, Le Blanc,</hi> &amp;c. only in hopes of his becoming a Penitent, I would not increaſe his Sorrow, by ſaying now, what they have ſaid upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>But one remarkable Teſtimony is worth our Obſervation, and our Pains to bring it out to Light, becauſe it has been induſtriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and now not very commonly known, and that is of Mr. <hi>David Blondel,</hi> the <hi>Coriphaeus</hi> of all the Parity Men, who having been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the <hi>Weſtminſter Aſſembly</hi> to write his <hi>Apologia pro Hieronymo,</hi> concludes it in Words to this purpoſe; <hi>By all that we have ſaid to aſſert the Rights of the</hi> Presbytery, <hi>we do not intend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate the ancient and Apoſtolick Conſtitution of</hi> Epiſcopal <hi>Preheminence, but we believe that whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is eſtabliſhed conformable to the ancient Canons, it muſt be carefully preſerved, and whereſoever by ſome heat of Contention or otherwiſe it has been put down or violated, it ought to be reverently reſtored.</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:002510_0051_0FDB648F9440F3A8"/>
Which Paſſage being deſtructive to his Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Deſign, upon their vehement and reſtleſs Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, he was prevailed upon to put it out. So prevailing oftentimes is Party Affection and Intereſt over Truth. Now that this is Fact, we have the Teſtimony of Dr. <hi>Peter Du Moulin</hi> in his Letter to Dr. <hi>Durell,</hi> to be ſeen in the laſt Page of the 4th Vol. of the <hi>Memoirs of Literature,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Monſieur <hi>La Rocque,</hi> wherein <hi>Du Moulin</hi> ſays he had the certain Account of this Affair, not only from Primate <hi>Uſher,</hi> but from Mr. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Blondel</hi> himſelf, in a Letter to his Brother.</p>
            <p>And now upon the whole of the <hi>Remarkers</hi> pretences to thoſe Characters of Modeſty and Integrity, however ſome may call evil good, yet Vice and Vertue are of unalterable Natures, and it's in vain to vail one with the Appearance of the other; for upon drawing aſide the Curtain, the unmasked Spectacle will be ſeen in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Habit. And therefore to finiſh this Head, it muſt be granted me, that if he is abandoned to ſuch an inſenſible State, that he feels no Horror or Relenting at the Injuries and Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he has offered to ſome of the greateſt and beſt of Men, what all the World beſides himſelf, and ſuch whom Demonſtration cannot convince, will allow me, that he has aſſumed Characters he has no Right in, or any juſt Claim unto.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude, by an Anſwer to all his cornuted Dilemma's, with the Story of the Man who had the unhappy Dilemma put to him, to kill his Father, abuſe his Mother, or be Drunk; whereupon he choſe the laſt, becauſe, as he
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:002510_0052_0FDB64910EBD6448"/>
thought, the leaſt of the Evils: And when he was under that Diſorder, became guilty of both the other Crimes. If the Story is a Fable, the Moral is plain; that a Perſon in the <hi>Remarker's</hi> Frame, would be guilty of the moſt unnatural Parricide, in deſtroying the Fathers the Biſhops, and in ſpite of all the Ties of Gratitude and filial Reverence, proſtitute the Honour of his Mother the Church of <hi>England</hi> to his vile Luſts and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and expoſe her to Contempt and Scorn. The Inference therefore is eaſy, that whoever would avoid being involved in the Guilt of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

For nothing is more certain, than that as ſoon as any one ſtarts from the Center of Unity, he is liable to be carried round the Circle of Error, until he falls over the Precipice from whence there is no recovery, unleſs by wiſe Reflections, aſſiſted by Divine Grace, he is brought to himſelf, and back again to his firſt Principles, from whence he unwarrantably receded.</p>

            <p>THE Adverſaries to the Book I have been defending, offer themſelves Evidences of its not being ſo contemptible a Piece as they would repreſent it; ſince with all the Efforts of impotent Malice, they fly from every Quarter to hiſs and ſpit their Venom on it: For as I was concluding my Letter, the Preſs was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of a miſ-ſhapen Production, ſprung from the diſordered Brain of one <hi>J Dickinſon,</hi> who with the ſame degrees of Aſſurance, as when Canting from his <hi>Tub,</hi> would commence an Advocate for <hi>Presbyterian Ordination;</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Principles peculiar to that Side, equal Pretences to the Modeſty and Manners they are equal Strangers to. Tho' it muſt be owned, theſe Scribblers have their ſingular Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and that the <hi>Remarker</hi> as much excels in Craft and Quibble, as the <hi>Defender</hi> does in Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Confidence, and therefore there muſt be ſome Difference in dealing with them.</p>
            <p>Having then treated the <hi>Remarker</hi> as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, I ſhall now Remark on the <hi>Defender,</hi> with reſpect to things peculiar to him; and ſhall not repeat what I have ſaid to the Inſtances where they fall into the ſame Ditch, in climbing
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:002510_0054_0FDB649412067C98"/>
over the Hedge deſign'd to keep them out of the Paſtoral Charge. For like the Herds of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Animals, if one breaks looſe, all are prone to follow the Tracks of the firſt Tranſgreſſors.</p>
            <p>To detect his Fallicies, and prove the Truths he has denied, and illuſtrate thoſe he has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, I ſhall firſt animadvert on his <hi>Preface</hi> and <hi>Introduction,</hi> and then on what the bold Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender liſps on every Head.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Preface</hi> gives the Idea of the Man, and diſcovering his Petulence and Ignorance, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſnows the narrow View he has, of what Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Order the Myſtical Body of Chriſt has been in all Ages, and is in the preſent; elſe how could he have ſuggeſted that the Beſt and Brighteſt Part of the Catholick Church is an upſtart Sect? We will here allow him all the Club of <hi>Socinians, Antinomians, Muggletonians,</hi> and <hi>Deiſts</hi> in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, joined in a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy with all the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> there, and upon a fair Poll contend, that they all together are not One to Ten, who are hearty and ſtrenuous Aſſertors of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> there, and that all the <hi>Sectaries</hi> in the World, are not One to Twenty in the Catholick Church, who maintain it in all its Powers and Rights.</p>
            <p>And however far Zeal and Charity may be the Objects of thoſe Perſons Envy, who are of his Size of thinking, yet we cannot allow it to be an Exceſs of one, or a Defect in the other, to deny the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Separatiſts the Favour of ſorouding themſelves under the Covert of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Churches; for the one oppoſe <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:002510_0055_0FDB64959D8C6C30"/>
and the Men of Learning and Conſcience in the other condemn them for it. But here with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to all, the Maxim holds univerſally true, That if the Premiſſes are juſt, Conſequences make themſelves, which ſuch are to look to as are affected with them. Nor does any thing that is or can be ſaid upon the Subject, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church any <hi>Proteſtants</hi> who have proper Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Sacraments, neither doth it Unchurch them if they have not, for they never were nor are they now any Parts of the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>The Government will doubtleſs reſent the advancing that ſeditious Poſition, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Paſſive Obedience and Non Reſiſtance, whereon is founded its own Security, are <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite Principles, and ought to be exploded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Paſs we now to the <hi>Introduction,</hi> a meer jingle of Words, without Senſe or Signification, unleſs in ſome Strokes, where it was well if they had had none.</p>
            <p>I have in my Reply to the <hi>Remarker,</hi> given the Senſe of thoſe venerable Perſons on the Caſe, whoſe Voices the <hi>Defender</hi> has the Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to ſollicit for him, and ſhall only add, that the Reaſon why <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are ſo fond of <hi>Aerius,</hi> ſeems to be, that he being branded for an <hi>Arian</hi> as well as <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> they are willing to pay a Deference to his Opinions in Doctrine, as well as in Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Modeſt Proof</hi> would have ſuppoſed ſome difference betwixt <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Presbytery,</hi> by alledging, that tho' <hi>Epiſcopal Rights</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:002510_0056_0FDB649713BB77C8"/>
had deen early uſurped upon by the Papal <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,</hi> yet that they had not been diſputed by the other for 1400 Years together; but this the <hi>Defender</hi> won't grant, but infers that becauſe there were Papal Uſurpations on that Order, therefore <hi>Presbyterian Government</hi> was ſet up at <hi>Rome</hi> before that Period.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing the <hi>Defender</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> agreed not only in that Point, but in that of Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, yet I do not conceive him ſo incapable of Error, as to have had any Occaſion for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, <hi>Have I miſtaken this Author all this while?</hi> Yet he has; and it is impoſſible for him, or any that would defend his Principles, not to go on in an endleſs Miſtake; and particularly he errs in the Inſtances he has brought here of his being infallible.</p>
            <p>For however near the Nature of the <hi>Stygian,</hi> the Waters of <hi>Geneva</hi> Lake may be, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſwift the <hi>Geneva Raven</hi> in its Flight, yet Thanks to the Glorious Head of the Church, it was preſerved from being poiſoned with their peſtiferous Influences: And therefore it will not follow, that there are no real <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Kingdoms, tho' <hi>Bugenhage</hi> was improved as an Inſtrument of the Reformation in <hi>Denmark,</hi> where we are aſſured there are two <hi>Arch-Biſhops</hi> and thirteen <hi>Biſhops,</hi> any more than that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to known Fact and the Truth of Hiſtory, there were no <hi>Superintendants</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where <hi>Knox</hi> was improved as a like Inſtrument.</p>

               </gap>, and here he begins with the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker</hi>'s Iniquity of adding to the Scriptures, creating <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and giving Commiſſions at pleaſure, and therefore let them both ſtand to the ſame Correction I have already given that Wickedneſs. And I ſhall only further obſerve, that either ſome evil Genius muſt have cull'd out for them both, that Paſſage of Mr. <hi>Sage,</hi> (whoſe drift there was to prove a Truth that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had not at the time he was upon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their laſt Commiſſion for Government) or that they muſt be judicially hardened, to have read that Book unto that Paſſage, and not have dropped the Pen out of their trembling Hands, ſtruck with the ſtrength and light of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, adduced there for <hi>Epiſcopcy.</hi> But rather than yield that the <hi>Seventy</hi>'s Commiſſion was continued after their firſt return, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their own Friends, and deny Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> to be their Oracle, who in <hi>Luke</hi> 10.19. ſays, <hi>He repeated, ratified and enlarged their Commiſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But under this Head there are ſome Strokes peculiar to the <hi>Defender,</hi> which muſt not eſcape their juſt Rebukes; as that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were no Goſpel Miniſters, while bleſt with their Maſter's Preſence upon Earth, and that in that Interval there was no Goſpel Church. Upon this Point I deſire a Reſolution of theſe <hi>Queries;</hi> Might not Believers in the Meſſiah the Lamb of God come to take away the Sins of the World, eſpecially when baptized in that Faith, be accounted Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Goſpel Church? and was our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:002510_0058_0FDB649E9170C090"/>
Miniſtry ſo unſucceſsful, as to gain no Converts to the Faith of this Article? Were not thoſe who in ſo many Words are ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.6. to have went through the Towns preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel, Miniſters of the Goſpel? And is the Doctrine of the Reſurrection the only Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Chriſtian Faith? If the <hi>Defender</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers conſiſtently with the Principle he here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, he muſt be concluded to be far removed from, and preach another Goſpel than that of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Another grand Miſtake he here labours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is with reſpect to the <hi>Deacons</hi> Office, part of which, it is readily granted, was their being charged with the Church Stock, and the care of the Poor; but here he ſtrains the Point unto ſo high a Pin, that he would have it to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing they were ordained to, and for this purpoſe would feign theſe Suppoſitions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the primitive Church was ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſly Rich in reſpect to what it is at preſent, that there was a neceſſity there ſhould be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Treaſurers for the Charge of their Wealth, tho' according to him, the Church Stock is ſince fallen ſo low, that there is no Occaſion now for thoſe ordained Officers, page 13.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That they had their Lazarettos and Hoſpitals, where the Poor were ſet at Tables, and whereat theſe Treaſurers were to ſerve.</p>
            <p>Now that there is no juſt Foundation for theſe Fancies, will appear from theſe Reflections.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Tho' ſome ſold their Poſſeſſions for the good of the Community, yet it's plain the chief
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:002510_0059_0FDB64A0104F4EE8"/>
Support of their Poor, was from Collections among the Churches, who, according to their Abilities, miniſtred to each others Neceſſities. But what were they to the Riches and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Churches every where at preſent? And even in the Meetings in this Country, large Sums are often collected, under the Colour of charitable Uſes; ſo that if there was Reaſon to have Officers ordained for the Charge of them <hi>then,</hi> it muſt be owned there is much more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>now.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, What a groundleſs Fancy is it, that in the wandring perſecuted State of the Church, there ſhould be ſuch Attendance given to the Poor at Tables, and that by ordained Miniſters? But the <hi>Defender</hi> ſeems utterly ignorant of the Nature of thoſe Tables, which were ſuch where the Euchariſt was celebrated; and for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, I refer him to the Opinion of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients concerning the <hi>Deacons</hi> Office about them. Thus <hi>Juſt.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here we are to obſerve, what I have made appear in dealing with the <hi>Remarker,</hi> that beſides theſe lower Offices of the care of the Churches Stock and Poor, and Attendance upon the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſtical Tables, they were ordained for the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:002510_0060_0FDB64A4602585D0"/>
Superior, of preaching and baptizing. Nor will the <hi>Defender</hi>'s ſhift, here avail him, that the <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi> preached as <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> for that is a plain Tautology, and no more than they preached as Preachers, <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> being the <hi>Greek</hi> of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Goſpeller,</hi> and both mean a preacher of the Goſpel. So that if the <hi>Defender</hi> would ſpeak Senſe, he muſt ſay, they evangelized or preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as <hi>Deacons.</hi> Tired theerefore with theſe liſps, let us hearken to what is uttered from the</p>

               </gap> the <hi>Defender</hi> breaths nothing but the Vanity and Vapours of an empty, Skull, for the Defence of which, from being crackt, (if it is not ſo already) he will have occaſion now to <hi>hold up his Shield;</hi> for by his Mr. <hi>Hereboord</hi>'s leave, one of the meaneſt of the Tribe of <hi>Praelatiſts,</hi> will undertake to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his Herculean Argument by another <hi>ad Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem,</hi> tho' it equally affects all the Parity Tribe.</p>
            <p>They are bold and inſolent Intruders into the Incloſure wherewith our Lord has fenced his Vineyard, who uſurp the Miniſterial Function without being ordained to it by a Succeſſor to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in whom, by the original Charter, the Powers of Ordination and Juriſdiction over a plurality of <hi>Presbyters</hi> in Churches, are annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either in Fact or Right, as I have explained theſe Words in my Reply to the <hi>Remarks;</hi> but <hi>Jonathan Dickinſon</hi> was never ordained by any ſuch Succeſſor.</p>
            <p>Ergo, <hi>Jonathan Dickinſon</hi> is a bold and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent intruder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and no Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel at <hi>Elizabeth-Town;</hi> and therefore in the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:002510_0061_0FDB64A785AA7080"/>
mentioned Reply he will find a full Anſwer to his Sophiſm, which ſuppoſes, that there is but one ſingle Office contained in the Commiſſion, and one ſingle Part of the Goſpel Miniſtry. For there I have made it appear, that by the Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations given of that Commiſſion, by the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of thoſe who acted by it, and who being under the infallible Direction of the Spirit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it fully; that there were ſeveral things contained in it, and ſeveral Offices warranted by it, as the Powers of Preaching, adminiſtring the Sacraments, Ordination, and Government, by proper Officers, and that tho' all that diſcharged any of thoſe Functions, acted by virtue of this Commiſſion, yet that all were not authorized thereby, to do all that was contained therein, and I inſtanced that <hi>Deacons</hi> by virtue thereof, did preach and baptize, but not conſecrate the Lord's Supper, nor meddle with the Powers of Abſolution and Cenſures, which <hi>Presbyters</hi> did; but not Ordain, becauſe not veſted witht the Epiſcopal Powers of Ordination and Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</p>
            <p>So that there being ſeveral Parts of the Goſpel Miniſtry to be diſcharged by ſeveral Officers, his Argument is loſt, and is no more than they that are authorized by the ſame Commiſſion, to the exerciſe of the ſame Parts of the Goſpel Miniſtry, have the ſame Office and Authority: But now for want of a Minor, there is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, and ſo the frightful Spectre vaniſhes. But yet after this vain fit is over, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him coming into Conceſſions enough to
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:002510_0062_0FDB64A865F479F8"/>
give up the Cauſe, or Contradictinos enough to overthrow it. For he confeſſes that our Lord did maintain the Symmetry and Proportion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Jewiſh Synagogue and the Chriſtian Church; and he has brought in Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, who were the Officers there, a <hi>Biſhop, Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons;</hi> from whence it neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows, according unto him, that thoſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are to be continued in the Chriſtian Church. And here he has given us the very thing we contend for. For by <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government he doubtleſs means a Government that ought to be, and he ſays that having <hi>Biſhops, Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> is an exact Deſcription of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is all we plead for; and therefore we are only now to agree upon the Propriety of the Name, which after ſo free Conceſſions, he will not ſurely be ſo ill natured, as to deny to be Epiſcopal; ſince ſo excellent a Government ought to be denominated from its moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Title.</p>
            <p>In my Reaſoning with the <hi>Remarker,</hi> I have fully replied to what the <hi>Defender</hi> has offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Third Head,</hi> tho' he has here one pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Stroke, in denying St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Honour of being an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> for before his Converſion he had not ſeen our Lord, and the <hi>Defender</hi> expreſly ſays, none could be admitted into the <hi>Apoſtolate,</hi> but ſuch as had ſeen <hi>Jeſus</hi> before his Death. He indeed afterwards owns him as an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> but that however, involves him in a Contradiction Proceed we now to what he ſays from the</p>
            <p>Fourth Head, And ſince this chiefly relates to
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:002510_0063_0FDB64AC8DA846E0"/>
Facts, I muſt clear them from his Miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; for doing this I ſhall appeal to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Reaſon, and Authorities. The Inſtances are chiefly of <hi>James</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem, Timothy</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as <hi>Titus</hi> of <hi>Crete,</hi> and the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> or <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>the ſeven Churches in the leſſer Aſia;</hi> as for <hi>Matthias,</hi> it's granted his Call to the <hi>Apoſtolate</hi> was immediate, tho' probably his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration to it, was by the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and ſtill the Probability advances in the <hi>Apoſtle Barnabas,</hi> whoſe Call does not appear to have been imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate.</p>
            <p>To begin therefore with <hi>James,</hi> there are juſt Grounds from Scripture, as well as Authorities from the Ancients, to conclude for his being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twenty Years reſident <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for when St. <hi>Paul,</hi> three Years after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, went to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he found none other of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> there, ſave <hi>James,</hi> Gal. 1.18, 19. And St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſays, in Loc. <hi>Hic autem</hi> Jacobus <hi>Epiſcopus Hieroſolymorum primus fuit cognominatus Juſtus.</hi> This <hi>James,</hi> Sir-named the Juſt, was the firſt <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Eleven Years after this, or fourteen after his Converſion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.1. St. <hi>Paul</hi> goes again to the General Council held at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whereof we have an Account, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and where, after hearing the Caſe brought before it, this <hi>James</hi> decides the Controverſy, <hi>v.</hi> 20. And St <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> in Loc. gives the Reaſon, <hi>Epiſcopos een tees en Jeroſolumon Eccleeſias.</hi> He was then Biſhop of the Church in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Nine Years after this St. <hi>Paul</hi> goes again, the laſt time he was at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> computed to be <hi>Anno Dom.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Come we now to the Inſtance of <hi>Timothy,</hi> whom the buſy Mocker had almoſt men ioned under the Stile of a <hi>Primate.</hi> If the Sting in the Tail be not Devil, be that as it is, he thereby deſigned a <hi>Hail King,</hi> and to treat that venerable Character, with an Air of Impiety, and the flouting Sneer of a Scorner; for nothing incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them more, than the flaming Evidences that are produced of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s being veſted with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical Powers, and therefore I ſhall now take off the Exceptions he has ſeign'd againſt them.</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Will it follow, that becauſe <hi>Timothy</hi> had been with <hi>Paul</hi> in ſeveral Places, that he was not afterwards ſettled at <hi>Epheſus?</hi> when the Words he ironically cites, do plainly prove he was, any more, than becauſe <hi>Jonathan Dickinſon</hi> has been ſometimes at a ſchiſmatical Seminary, and other Places, that therefore he is not now ſettled a pretended Paſtor, at <hi>Elizabeth-Town,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="unknown:002510_0065_0FDB64B03536E8D8"/>Secondly, Is there any more Evidence from <hi>Acts</hi> 20.25. of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s not being <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi> than there is from thence, of <hi>Jonathan Dickinſon</hi>'s not being the <hi>Defender</hi> of <hi>Presbyterian Ordination?</hi> And,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I believe <hi>Jonathan</hi> would look on any one of his Brethren with a jealous Eye, who ſhould offer at the exerting any prelatical Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in cenſuring his Manners, (for which by the way, there are juſt Grounds for ſome others to do it) or charging him with unſound Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, (which indeed don't ſeem very Orthodox) and that he would ask the Queſtion, <hi>Who made thee a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, It's plain, if <hi>Jonathan</hi> can't pray better than he pleads, tho' it even be a very bad Cauſe, he has great need of a <hi>Common Prayer</hi> Book, as an Inſtrument under the Conduct of the Spirit, to help his Infirmities.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, All Commiſſions are excluſive of all but thoſe to whom they are granted; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince M. A. <hi>Jonathan</hi> of this, ſuppoſe his <hi>Deacon Tom</hi> ſhould ſtep up into his Stall, and alledge, that M. A. <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s <hi>Ordainers,</hi> did not by Name, exclude him form the Paſtor's Office, and that he thought it a Duty upon Occaſion, to exhort and teach; I ſuppoſe M. A. <hi>Jonathan,</hi> for the recovery of his Desk, would ſoon reply, Tho' you was not excluded by Name, yet you was by the Nature of Commiſſions, which exclude all to whom they are not given; and tho' as a Chriſtian and a Parent, you may privately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort your Neighbours, and teach your Children,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:002510_0066_0FDB64B1527C8F28"/>
yet preaching in the proper Senſe, is the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Duty of Goſpel Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, All Accuſations are not ſlanderous and evil Reports, for I have brought ſome very true and juſt ones againſt the <hi>Defender,</hi> and ſuch as it is the Prerogative of <hi>Biſhops</hi> to take Notice of, and puniſh ſuch Perſons of evil Report, as it was of <hi>Timothy,</hi> not as an <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> and ſo an extraordinary Perſon, as he dreams: For the <hi>Defender</hi> pretends to be an <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> or Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and I am well aſſured, he is no extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Perſon, unleſs it be for Impertinence and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
            <p>The next Inſtance is <hi>Titus,</hi> whom the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> upo his bare Word, deſires us to believe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver returned to his See, after his Journey to St. <hi>Paul;</hi> but he has ſo often falſified his Word, that we can't but disbelieve every thing he ſays: However, he has not here been carried on with his uſual Aſſurance, to deny what we plead for, that <hi>Titus</hi> diſcharged the Epiſcopal Office, while he was at <hi>Crete.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are at laſt come to the Company of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> at the ſight of whom the <hi>Defender</hi>'s Head is filled with Apocaliptick Viſions, which want a new Revelation to explain them, and would from them infer, that becauſe ſometimes the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. reſpect thoſe <hi>Angels</hi> and their Churches, therefore they muſt always do ſo; and gives this as the only Reaſon for it, becauſe the plural Number is ſometimes uſed there: Now if this be a good Argument, I have ten to one of ſuch againſt him, where the ſingular
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:002510_0067_0FDB64B6AA83B290"/>
Number is uſed ten times to once of the Plural, and therefore however great a piece of Wit and Gallantry he may eſteem his prophane Ribaldry on that Chapter, an Atheiſt of an equal Talent with him at burleſquing Scripture, has much more room to reply upon him, from the other Number. However, it's plain the <hi>Defender</hi> is an utter Stranger to the Idiom of Scripture Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, where an Anallagy of Numbers is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. <hi>She ſhall be ſaved in Child-bearing, if they continue in the Faith.</hi> In treating with the <hi>Remarker</hi> on this Point, I have accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Senſe of the Word <hi>Angel,</hi> and that I have juſtly done it, I have the Concurrent O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of ancient and modern Divines, thus <hi>Aug.</hi> Ep. 162. <hi>Divina voce ſub Angeli nomine lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur praepoſitus Eccleſiae.</hi> The Governour of the Church is praiſed by the Voice of God, under the Name of an Angel.

               <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>Biſhops.</hi> Nay <hi>Beza,</hi> Annot. Cap. 2. 1 <hi>Apoc.</hi> ſays, <hi>Angelo</hi> Proeſtoti <hi>quem nimirum oportuit in primus de his rebus admoneri.</hi> To the <hi>Angel</hi> that is the <hi>Preſident,</hi> who muſt firſt have Notice of this Charge. And it's worth obſerving, that Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi> the Inventer of the <hi>Defender</hi>'s Fable, founded it upon the ſingle Particle <hi>Kai</hi> in Verſe 24. which is wanting in the moſt ancient Greek Copies of the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>And thus for the Epiſcopal Inſtances, that ſtill do, and ever will ſtand impregnable, againſt all the Attacks that are made upon them by ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy puny Scriblers.</p>
            <p>We are now to enter upon a new Logical, I wiſh I could ſay, Rational Scene; where by Mood and Figure, the <hi>Defender</hi> would argue all the Goſpel Miniſtry out of the World. But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the Enquiry into the Nature of his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralogiſms.</hi> we are to obſerve, that a Word got into his Head, which he could not get rid of, and therefore without knowing its Meaning, ſets it down ſeveral times in <hi>

                  </gap>,</hi> and that is the Word <hi>Co-ordinate,</hi> which means Equality, and not Identity; ſo that he has more Powers than he thought of; for if he is <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and they are <hi>Co-ordinate,</hi> he has two diſtinct Powers, tho' according to him, equal, and thus tho' all his Powers are <hi>Co-ordinate</hi> to his Brethren's, yet they are not numerically the ſame; the Powers he has are not the indivual Powers ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has, tho' they may be equal or <hi>Co-ordinate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having remarkt this Blunder, I am further to obſerve, that in my Reply to the <hi>Remarks,</hi> I

have accounted for the Community of Names mentioned in the Arguments, and how to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate them, and thither I refer him. It remains therefore, that I demonſtrate, that by his way of Reaſoning, he has gratified the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſis</hi> and <hi>Libertines,</hi> in that by his Craft, he would clear the World of <hi>Prieſts.</hi> In order to this, I muſt ſet down ſome Poſitions, which he has either expreſly granted, or muſt confeſs to.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He affirms it to be juſt arguing from a Community of Names, to a Co-ordination of Powers; that is, if he means any thing, that he who has any, or all of thoſe Names, is the ſame Officer, under all or any of thoſe different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignations.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He will doubtleſs grant, but in Caſe he ſhould not, ſince he has not mentioned them with the other Names, I ſhall prove, that <hi>Deacon</hi> is a Name of a Goſpel Miniſter. Thus 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.7.17. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.2. the Words Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter or Miniſtry, are in the Original <hi>Deacon,</hi> or <hi>Deaconſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Page thirteenth he gives the Reaſon why <hi>Deacons</hi> are not now ordained, and that for want of Church Stock; tho' I think he don't want a ſort.</p>
            <p>Now from theſe Poſitions, I will, by his way of Reaſoning, prove upon him theſe two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That there is a Church-Stock at <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth-Town,</hi> and that he is reſponſible for it, as he pretends to be the <hi>Deacon</hi> there.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That to relieve him from his fear of Refunding, I will by the ſame way of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:002510_0070_0FDB64BE0D564A98"/>
prove, that he is no <hi>Deacon</hi> there, nor any where elſe, nor a Miniſter of the Goſpel at all, and ſo not at the Place he pretends to be.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By his way of Reaſoning, I prove there is a Church-Stock at <hi>Elizabeth-Town,</hi> and that he is reſponſible for it, as he pretends to be <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> there: Thus by his way of arguing,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Biſhops, Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> are a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Names for Goſpel Miniſters, from whence it's juſt to argue, a Co-ordination of Powers. I ſuppoſe he means an Identity of Offices, if he has any meaning.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Jonathan Dickinſon</hi> ſays, that the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Names with their <hi>Co-ordinate</hi> Powers, that is an Identity of Offices, if his Words have any Signification, are applicable to him:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo, Jonathan Dickinſon</hi> is a Goſpel Miniſter in all its Offices. Again,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deacons</hi> were ordained to the Care of the Church-Stock, where there was enough to be taken care of.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Jonathan Dickinſon</hi> was ordained to the Office of a <hi>Deacon,</hi> that being one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Names of a Goſpel Miniſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo, Jonathan Dickinſon</hi> is chargeable with the Churches Stock, which he muſt anſwer for.</p>
            <p>But leſt as an Inſolvent he ſhould think of running, I will relieve him under that Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, and by his way of Reaſoning prove, that he had nothing to do with their Stock nor Church, and that he is no Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel at all. Thus,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:002510_0071_0FDB64BFA32B0D40"/>
               <hi>Deacon</hi> is one of the common Names of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Miniſters.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Jonathan Dickinſon</hi> for want of Church-Stock, was not ordained <hi>Deacon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> Is no Goſpel Miniſter, nor has any thing to do with Church or Stock.</p>
            <p>And this Rule of Reaſoning will univerſally hold with reſpect to all the Goſpel Miniſtry, which <hi>Jonathan Dickinſon</hi> has now ſyllogized out of the World, by his ridiculous arguing from a Community of Names, to an Identity of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; which he falſly calls a <hi>Co-ordination</hi> of Powers.</p>
            <p>And now at laſt we are come to his Expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory Concluſion, wherein he ſums up his idle Tales with the ſame Appeals to Belief, as if he was vending them to his credulous Audience; but what little regard they deſerve, I appeal to the World in the following Particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The moſt obſerving Part of Mankind, muſt and do grant, that the Contempt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have treated the Epiſcopal Character, and Sacerdotal Powers, has given Occaſion to the <hi>Libertine</hi> to call in Queſtion the Truth of all revealed Religion; and to conclude that <hi>Prieſts</hi> of all Religions were the ſame, and no Truth in any.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> firſt encouraged the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conventicles, by ſending their gifted <hi>Emiſſaries</hi> to hold forth amongſt them; ſo have they always promoted theſe Separations, with a Deſign to divide and weaken the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the chiefeſt Bulwark in Chriſtendom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:002510_0072_0FDB64C110632508"/>
               <hi>Popery,</hi> well knowing, that their <hi>Idolatry</hi> can never be introduced, but at the Breaches made on that Church, by <hi>Schiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, That it is a very daring Aſſurance in the <hi>Defender,</hi> whereby he would dive into the Political Reaſons of State, whereby <hi>Presbytery</hi> is eſtabliſhed in <hi>North,</hi> as well as tolerated in <hi>South Britain.</hi> I hope he won't affirm it has ever been determined, by the Legiſlature, that it is a <hi>Jure Divino</hi> Government: Nay, the contrary ſeems to be, and doubtleſs is, the fixed Opinion of the Legiſlature. For the King and the Officers of his Government are Members of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and under the ſtrongeſt, the moſt ſolemn and ſacred Engagements ſo to be; ſo that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Inſults are offered, by the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> to the Church, are direct Affronts upon the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and their Sentiments of Things of the higheſt Conſequence, and is no leſs than to call in Queſtion, whether they be Members of a Church from which a Separation is groundleſs, and which with their uſual Modeſty and Duty they deny; and the Members of the Church, with a becoming Behaviour, and the ſtrongeſt Evidence, maintain and prove.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That it is in the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> own power, to put in Tune the jarring String, they are always harping on, and whence yet they ſay they can't bear the diſpleaſing Sound of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churching <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> It has been already hinted, that nothing that can be ſaid, doth Unchurch any that have true Paſtors and Sacraments, and that thoſe who have not, are not organized
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:002510_0073_0FDB64C48853DDD0"/>
Parts of the Myſtical Body of Chriſt; for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will own it or no, theſe things are clear and demonſtrably true.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Notes of a true Church, are the Orthodox preaching of the Word, and the regular Adminiſtrations of the Sacraments, by Perſons fully authorized for thoſe Functions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That from the Holy Scripiures, we are to learn what Doctrines are Orthodox, what the Nature of Sacraments, and alſo (there being now no immediate Miſſion from Heaven) what the Powers of Preachers and Adminiſtrators, and who are veſted with them.</p>
            <p>And ſince it is the laſt of thoſe that has been now under Conſideration, I appeal to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſſed and diſintereſted Part of Mankind, who they are who appear to have the true and only Title to thoſe Powers.</p>
            <p>From all which the Inference is natural, that it as much concerns every one as his Salvation amounts to, to be well aſſured that he is within the Pale of the true Church, and ſits under the Means of Grace, and that at the great Audit, he ſhall be owned by Chriſt, to have been a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Myſtical Body upon Earth.</p>

FORTY ONE, breathing the true Spirit of the Party, and that Day. His Jargon being indeed a Compound of Bombaſt and Billingſgate. He has told us how he came by his Pedantry, in the Collegians handing him Books he knew not the Uſe of, and we can account for his Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, from the Scurrility of his Temper, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Principles, and the Manner of his Education: So that he writing neither like a Scholar nor a Gentleman, he and nine Tenths of his Reveries, are properly to he anſwered by one equipped in a Porter's Armour, namely his Language and his Club.</p>
            <p>But leſt, by what remains, he ſhould impoſe on ſuch as can Reaſon at no better rate than himſelf; I ſhall, overlooking all his Rant and Ribaldry, apply my ſelf only to the expoſing the Falſhoods he would advance, with reſpect to Epiſcopal Succeſſion; the maintaining where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the ſum of the Book, he has the Aſſurance to write againſt: And then take hold on the Impartial Hand that writes the <hi>Appendix to the Sober Remarks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In replying to whatever has the Face of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in this Rhapſody of the <hi>Son of Martin,</hi> alias <hi>Belial,</hi> I ſhall prove,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Goſpel Miniſtry was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an Imparity of Officers, or rather a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Epiſcopacy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That neither Idolatry nor Hereſy, ſuppoſing them universal in all the viſible Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, do invalidate the Offices and Functions of the Prieſthood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:002510_0076_0FDB64C8942EA428"/>Thirdly, That there are undeniable Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from Fact and Reaſon, that the Chain of Succeſſion, in Epiſcopal Government and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations, was never broke; and that the moſt impious Abſurdities follow, upon <hi>Mar-Prelates</hi> Suppoſition, that ever it was, or could be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>Firſt I affirm, upon the higheſt as well as cleareſt Evidences, that the Goſpel Miniſtry was founded in an Imparity of Officers, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a proper Epiſcopacy. This muſt be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if the Acts of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> are allowed to be Authentick, for theſe ſhew them to have been inveſted with a Superiority over ſome Brethren, <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> Acts 6.2, 8. 14.11, 12.22.12, 25.13.5. And while the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> are allowed to be Canonical, they will continue, and contain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, that thoſe who ordained <hi>Presbyters,</hi> had a Juriſdiction both over them, and their Churches. 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 1, 3, 5, 19, 20, 22. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. And therefore, until Atheiſm has diſproved the Authority of the ſacred Regiſter, wherein thoſe Teſtimonies are preſerved, the firſt Particular muſt be concluded certain. I proceed then</p>
            <p>Secondly, to evince, that neither Idolatry nor Hereſy, ſuppoſing them univerſal in all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Members of the Church, do invalidate the Offices, and the Functions of the Prieſthood. I ſay viſible Members, for to bring thoſe that are inviſible into the Argument, is to go wide of the Caſe: For an inviſible Church can have only inviſible Priviledges, and when it loſes
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002510_0077_0FDB64CA64BF0738"/>
them, or if it is capable of loſing them, cannot be known to us, and therefore the Diſpute can only refer to the viſible Church; and in that we are to obſerve a vaſt Difference betwixt even groſs Idolatry, and a total Apoſtacy, the one of which does, tho' the other does not, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the very Being of a Church. Thus tho' the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes the Apoſtles Creed, probably in the ſame Senſe, and upon the ſame Arguments with us, yet in as much as it worſhips the true God, under improper Repreſentations, it cannot be excuſed from the Charge of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: Which, however, is ſtill a Crime of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature, than a full denying the God that is above, and the Lord that bought them, for this quite deſtroys the Relation of God in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with any People, but the other puts them only ſo far out of Favour, as they are capable, yet ſtill with a Preſervation of their Being: For none who have been admitted into the <hi>Peculium,</hi> are excluded from the Priviledges of it, until they have explicitly renounced the Advantages of being in it. Thus <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Acceſſion to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, did not vacate his Commiſſion of being <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> nor the People's repeated Idolatry, deprive them of peculiar and diſtinguiſhing Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, <hi>Neb.</hi> 9.18, 20. And while that Polity ſtood, the Prieſthood remained, even until our <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> did abrogate that Oeconomy, with all its Rites, and Offices. And even in the early Times of Chriſtianity, we find Churches over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread with great Corruptions, as thoſe of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11. 5.7, 11, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002510_0078_0FDB64CD7759C108"/>
and thoſe in <hi>Rev.</hi> Ch. 2 and 3. and for them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, but their Being and Exiſtence, was never on that ſcore denied. And now granting his Argument, all the ſtrength it can have, and that for the ſake of the inviſible Members, the Priviledges of the viſible Church were continued, I have the ſame Evidence on my ſide, that our Lord had an inviſible Church, through all the Ages of Chriſtianity, for the ſake whereof, he preſerved the Covenant Priviledges, to that which was viſible. This he muſt grant, unleſs he confeſſes that the Gates of <hi>Hell</hi> had a greater prevalency over the Chriſtian, than the Jewiſh Church, which is a Suppoſition too abſurd, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be asked, or allowed: And here we may obſerve the partial Spirit of the Party, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that Idolatry, or Hereſy, unchurches all, but ſuch as they are; for according to them, the moſt flagrant Impieties will not unſaint any, on their ſide. I come now</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to evince, that there are undeniable Evidences, from Fact and Reaſon, that the <hi>Chain of Succeſſion,</hi> in Epiſcopal Government and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations, was never broke, and that the moſt impious Abſurdities follow, upon <hi>Mar-Prelate</hi>'s Suppoſition, that ever it was, or could be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we appeal to Fact, that as the Goſpel Miniſtry was founded in Epiſcopacy, ſo by all who have wrote the Hiſtory of the Church, from the Acts of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to this Time, we have an Account of the Churches being univerſally under Prelatical Government, as from <hi>Euſebius,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002510_0079_0FDB64D0181252B0"/>
Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Evagrius Scholaſticus,</hi> until about the Year 600, and from thence, every Country where Chriſtianity was planted, can produce Regiſters of their <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and we challenge the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> to aſſign a Time, after the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> when there was no Epiſcopacy, or when it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued in the Chriſtian Church, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any Inſtance of a National Church, that ever was under the Government of meer Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters before <hi>Calvin,</hi> or even ſince, but ſome very few that follow him, in other of his rigid No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Inſtance of the <hi>W<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> can be of no Service to them here, unleſs they prove that their Eccleſiaſtical Affairs were carried on in a Parity, which they may, after their uſual way affirm, but muſt, as they always do, ſail in the Proof. Come we from Fact,</p>
            <p>Secondly, To Reaſon upon the Caſe, and I argue againſt the maintainer of that Paradox, that the <hi>Chain of Succeſſion,</hi> can, and has been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, from theſe two Arguments.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If it is, the Chriſtian Religion is an Impoſture. And</p>
            <p>Secondly, Suppoſe it true, there are now no proper Miniſterial Powers therein.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If the <hi>Chain of Succeſſion</hi> is broke, the Chriſtian Religion muſt be an Impoſture, for the Author of it affirmed, that he would be with it until the end of the World: Now if he was not ſo, but by withdrawing his Preſence, let it be broken, he failed in his Promiſe, the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence whereof is, to disbelieve every thing he ſaid; for no Reaſon can be aſſigned for the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002510_0080_0FDB64D19B3F4010"/>
Faith of one Article, more than another, which equally depends upon the Veracity of the Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and if the one be found falſe, the other can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved true; and ſo with our <hi>broken Chain,</hi> there is an end of Chriſtianity. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, If we ſuppoſe a ſingle failure in this Point, it will make it impoſſible, that there can be now any proper Miniſters of the Goſpel; for when the Succeſſion was interrupted, and the <hi>Chain</hi> broke, there muſt either have been ſome Power lodged in the Community of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to ſoulder it again, or the Original Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor muſt have made a ſecond, or there muſt now be none.</p>
            <p>The firſt as falſe, cannot be proved, for in Fact thoſe Powers were originally left with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Officers, and not with the Faithful, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.16 <hi>ad fin. John</hi> 20.19, 20, 21, 22, 23. Nor can any Laws of Neceſſity, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant an Intruſion, upon what is the peculiar Prerogative of a Divine Power to inſtitute, namely, to appoint Perſons to diſcharge the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal Functions, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.40. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.6, 7.2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, 5.</p>
            <p>Not the ſecond, unleſs they will condeſcend upon the Time, Place and Perſons, when and where this new <hi>Chain</hi> was forged, and to whom committed, and who thoſe are that are now linked in it; and prove that either our Lord came from Heaven to renew it, or delegated ſome by an audible Voice, or the Power of Miracles to vouch for their Commiſſion to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002510_0081_0FDB64D667E1EA48"/>
that Purpoſe, which cannot be done. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It will neceſſarily follow, that upon ſuppoſing a Breach in the Succeſſion, there has not been any Goſpel Miniſtry ſince the Moment it happened, nor is there at preſent, nor can be for the future, without a new Revelation for it.</p>
            <p>To ſum up then the Evidence upon the Ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gument, ſince it appears from the Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, that the Goſpel Miniſtry was founded in Epiſcopacy, and from the ſame, that neither Idolatry nor Hereſy are able to invalidate the Sacerdotal Powers, that in Fact the Epiſcopal Succeſſion has continued uninterrupted through all the intermediate Ages from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Times to ours, and that the moſt impious Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities follow up <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the denial, the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is unavoidable, that the <hi>Son of Martin,</hi> who would marr Prelacy, and conſequentially ſubvert the Foundations of Chriſtianity, muſt be a Son of Perdition.</p>
            <p>Having thus accounted for what is material in that Libel, I turn to the Appendix, writ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in a ſofter Strain, but ſuperiour to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Arts of Sophiſtry, for the one is one continued Rhodomantado, but the other now <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> our View, has more of Cunning and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; the Author often varies Shapes and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, to avoid the Stroke he might be ſubject to, under any one; for now he perſonates an <hi>Independent,</hi> and anon a <hi>Ruling Elder,</hi> which is
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002510_0082_0FDB64D792E4EDE8"/>
exceeding diſingenuous and unfair, to oblige us to enter the Liſts with an Enemy in Maſquerade. It's true indeed, all the <hi>Sectaries</hi> militate under the ſame common Standard of <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> but then it would be fair to diſtinguiſh their Squadrons by their proper Enſigns.</p>
            <p>However, we muſt take him in his way, (an Expreſſion often uſed ironically by him) and for his Conviction, as well as that of others, I ſhall ſet down ſome Preliminaries, which may give a juſt turn of Thought to thoſe who have been under an unhappy Biaſs in the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, and then give the true Senſe of the Texts he miſtakes or miſapplies. As to the Prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, I ſhall</p>
            <p>Firſt explain the Nature of the Commiſſion given to the <hi>Apoſt<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider the Nature of the Gift conferred in Ordination.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, enquire whether the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were meer <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or whether they were not veſted with proper Epiſcopal Powers.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As to the Nature of the Apoſtolical Commiſſion, which is on all Hands agreed to be the Grand Charter for the Evangelical Miniſtry, in all its Powers and Offices, it is delivered in ſuch general and yet ſo few Words, that it is by all confeſſed, to contain more in its Nature than is expreſſed; for taking in both Places where the Commiſſion is mentioned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>John</hi> 20.21, 22, 23. we find nothing to be expreſſed in both of them, except the Powers of Preaching, of Abſolution and Cenſures, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002510_0083_0FDB64DC99FF3278"/>
diſpenſing one of the Sacraments; but then the other Sacrament muſt alſo ſurely be meant, as well as there muſt be included therein the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Ordination and Government, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Intent and Purport of this Commiſſion, muſt be gathered from the Practice of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> as they underſtood and explained it in their acting by and upon it.</p>
            <p>By virtue whereof we find in Fact, that they ordained <hi>Deacons,</hi> beſides ſome lower Offices to preach and to baptize, that in ſome Churches they ſettled <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as at <hi>Corinth,</hi> who had the Powers of both Sacraments and Cenſures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5, 7, 12, 13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2, 6. and that Dioceſan <hi>Biſhops,</hi> in whom the Powers of Ordination and Jurisdiction over a Plurality of <hi>Presbyters</hi> &amp; Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were annexed, were ſettled by them, in their reſpective <hi>Sees,</hi> is evident from the Inſtances of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and the <hi>Apocalyptical Angels,</hi> and is made fully to appear in the Defence of the <hi>Modeſt Proof.</hi> So that if following the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations given of this Commiſſion by Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Practice be warrantable, the Aſſertors of Epiſcopacy are undoubtedly right. Let us now</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider the Nature of the Gift con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in Ordination, and thereby is unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably meant the Office and the Power whereby to diſcharge it, and not the Holy Ghoſt, which never was, nor is it poſſible to be, in the Power of Man to beſtow; for tho' indeed its Influences are conveyed by its glorious Author, through Means and Inſtruments, as the Word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Impoſition of Hands, yet no Creature in a proper Senſe, can be ſaid to confer it; and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002510_0084_0FDB64DD92DE3340"/>
therefore the Expreſſion muſt be taken in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical Meaning, let it be uſed by whom and on what ſide ſoever. For tho' it's ſaid the Holy Ghoſt was given at the laying on of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17. yet it is not ſaid they gave it; and tho' our Church retains our Saviour's Form in its Ordinations, and the Ordainers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Ordained may receive the Holy Ghoſt, yet do not ſay that they beſtow it; their Action indeed is the Conduit of its Conveyance, but its ſelf muſt flow from the Fountain of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Let us enquire whether the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were meer <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or were not alſo veſted with proper Epiſcopal Powers; and here the Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are plain and numerous to prove them ſo veſted, as in their Ordination of <hi>Deacons,</hi> Acts 6.5, 6. <hi>Elders in every City,</hi> Acts 14.23. and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. And it's granted on each ſide, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were veſted with Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over the <hi>Presbyters</hi> and the Churches too.</p>
            <p>Having thus adjuſted theſe Preliminaries, I ſhall now take hold on the <hi>Impartial Hand,</hi> if it is not too nimble or ill-natured to be taken in its own way; and all that is offered will be fully replied to, by ſetting a few Texts in their true Light.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, As to 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. I will take him in his own way, by condemning <hi>Calvin's Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi> and admitting his <hi>Comment</hi> on the Text that <hi>Timothy</hi> was ordained by a <hi>Colledge of Presbyters;</hi> but then he muſt grant alſo, that thoſe <hi>Presbyters</hi> were either <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or meer ſingle <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> preſiding among them in either Caſe: If the firſt, our Point is gained; for the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:002510_0085_0FDB64DF1150FBC0"/>
were not only <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but <hi>Biſhops</hi> alſo in the full and ſtricteſt Senſe of the Word, by the third Preliminary; and this will ſave the Credit and the Evidence of the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> for Epiſcopacy, and be exactly agreeable to the Practice of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> if the ſecond, its plain, that <hi>Paul</hi> alone conferred the Gift, that is, the Office and the Power of executing it, which is there its meaning, by the ſecond Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary, and that the <hi>Presbyters</hi> only gave their Aſſent, it being impoſſible in the Nature of the Thing, that the <hi>Presbyters</hi> could have any other Influence on the Act; for taking him in his own way, if the Gift conferred was the Holy Ghoſt, (which by the way I do not grant) and if <hi>Paul</hi> alone did not conſer it, then every ſingle <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> did that as well as he, and every one has Power to give it, which is contrary to his own Scheme, which confines it to the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and it will follow, that the more ordaining <hi>Presbyters</hi> there be, the more of the Holy Ghoſt the ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall receive; and in that Caſe, who would not covet to be ordained by an <hi>Oecomenical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> of them, and with ſuch vaſt Collations of it ſuch a Perſon might be fitted alſo to be <hi>Paſtor of the Oecomenical Church,</hi> and in Proportion, thoſe who had fewer Ordainers, had fewer Shares in this Gift or the Holy Ghoſt, and proportionably would be of leſs uſe to the Church. Or if by Gift be underſtood the Office and the Powers for its Execution, as ſeems moſt evident, then if <hi>Paul</hi> did <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> alone confer it, it will follow, that each ordaining <hi>Presbyter</hi> conferred a Part, or the Whole
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002510_0086_0FDB64E314226758"/>
of his Gift; if a Part, it would gratify the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, to condeſcend upon what Part, or how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there muſt be to make up the Whole; if each Ordainer conferred the whole Gift, then in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their Number, muſt the Offices be multiplied, and then inſtead of one, there might be a dozen or more Offices conferred, according to the Number of Ordainers. From theſe Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions therefore, and the Abſurdities that flow from them, it muſt be owned, that if there were <hi>Presbyters</hi> who laid their Hands with <hi>Paul</hi>'s on <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> that it could be only to expreſs their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; ſo that whether that Place refers to the <hi>Presbyterate</hi> or <hi>Epiſcopate,</hi> he is extreamly ſilly who affirms this to be an Evaſion, it being demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the very Nature of the Action, that it could be for no other End. A Second Text is <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1. where he ſays, we ſhall find <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſeparated to their ſpecial Miniſtry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by the Hands of certain <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> who were neither <hi>Apoſtles</hi> nor <hi>Dioceſans,</hi> but has he proved it? no, that is an unuſual Method with the Writers on that ſide; however, we cannot believe them, when the Aſſertion appears plainly falſe, as it does in this Caſe. For in that Text we find Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons there of a ſuperiour Character to meer <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> and yet only ſaid there to be <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers;</hi> for it's certain <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and as ſuch of a ſuperiour Character to meer <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and no Reaſon can be given to queſtion it in the others, for <hi>Biſhops</hi> not being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways mentioned under the Title of their higheſt
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002510_0087_0FDB64E451D4D5A8"/>
Office and Order, it will not follow, that tho' ſometimes named under the Character of their loweſt Order, that they have no higher; and therefore it will follow, that if <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were (notwithſtanding their being called there <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi>) really <hi>Apoſtles</hi> or <hi>Biſhops</hi> that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were alſo really ſuch, tho' with them alſo mentioned under inferiour Characters.</p>
            <p>As to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. he here acts the diſingenuous Part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in not being poſitive which of the Expoſitions he is for, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he takes the <hi>Eliers</hi> for the ſame or one, as he words it, or for two kinds of <hi>Presbyters.</hi> I am ready to think he is ſo far in the right, as to be for the former, and that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. to be a good Comment on that Text, the Senſe whereof according to him, muſt be, that part of your Office which is Doctrinal, is more to be honoured, than that which is Ruling; or you are to be honoured as a <hi>Ruler,</hi> but with half the Honour of a <hi>Teacher.</hi> Now this ſilly Expoſition can have no Conſequence, unleſs he can prove our <hi>Biſhops</hi> to have renounced their Powers of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when they were veſted with the Powers of Ruling; and ſince this is falſe in Fact, it remains, that ſince to their Powers of Preaching, there are added the Powers of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and both Offices joined, the honours annexed to them muſt be alſo, and then it will follow, that they are to be honoured with all the Honours due to all the Offices.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole therefore, ſince it's thus evident, even upon the <hi>Appendix maker</hi>'s own way of arguing, that <hi>Paul</hi> alone conferred the Office, with the Powers to execute it, the <hi>Presbyters</hi> only aſſenting to it, that thoſe who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> were Perſons of a ſuperiour Character to meer <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and that <hi>Biſhops</hi> who Rule well, and Labour in Word and Doctrine, are to be held worthy of more than double Honour, becauſe if there is a Complication of the Offices, there ought to be of the Honours annexed to them: The Conſequence is plain, that the <hi>Appendix maker</hi> has no leſs miſtaken his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the <hi>Remarker,</hi> and to borrow his own decent Expreſſion, <hi>Confuſion muſt equally cover them both.</hi>
