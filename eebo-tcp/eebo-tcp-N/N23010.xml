            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Prelude.</head>
            <p>WHEN we ſpeculate on the vaſt productions of literary pens, we are apt to ſuppoſe that every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is diſcuſſed; but we find genius every day expanding, and ſomething new and intereſting preſent itſelf to view. From philoſophical to ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental writers the obſervation may be equally applied. This, perhaps, may be deemed only a trivial reaſon for the publication of the following Letters, the deſign of which is to convey inſtruction with amuſement.</p>
            <p>It may be objected, that there are already a variety of this deſcription in circulation. It is true there are;
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:030397_0003_0FE6C585C228D370"/>but are there not many philoſophical diſcoveries of the ſame nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by different pens? Are there not many authors, who relate the ſame hiſtorical facts? many divines who make diſquiſitions on one the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological ſubject? and ſhall moral writers be denied this privilege? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every author has ſome new ideas in his writing; and the language of one may impreſs the minds of ſome readers, though it may ſcarcely affect the underſtandings of others. This, it is hoped, will be conſidered a little apology for the preſent intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and were not ſome apology introduced, ſenſibility would extort the latent bluſh, when the author contemplated thoſe ſhining orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the age whoſe writings are
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:030397_0004_0FE6C58CD2CBA928"/>ſo highly ſuperior, and ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate their memories.</p>
            <p>The generous and the candid will paſs over any ſentiments that may not be entirely congenial with their own; and on the ſame principles the author would rely for any inaccura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that may occur. The cenſure of vulgar or unfeeling minds, ought ever to be conſidered as too inſignificant to be regarded.</p>
            <p>Theſe Tales are original; and if the reader only takes a ſlight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective around, there will appear may features in life which bear a perfect reſemblance. The author has endeavoured to give a few real copies of ſome important tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and from thence drawn ides tending to regulate moral affections,
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:030397_0005_0FE6C58CE103C458"/>to awaken a love of virtue, and to render civil intercourſe more pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Happineſs is an object of univerſal ſearch; and ſurely, if any thing can be pointed out that may lead to ſo deſirable and end, it will not lie neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by thoſe who are votaries.</p>
            <p>Should theſe little efforts meet with approbation, the author will feel ample ſatisfaction.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE often almoſt perſuaded myſelf, that if it were not for the ſingular degree of attachment, which I flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030397_0008_0FE6C594F08F1378"/>you feel for me, your patience would are now have been tired with the trifling incidents I have ſo perpetually heaped upon you in the courſe of my correſpondence: but the candid manner in which you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to treat my ſcruples, I confeſs in a meaſure abates them. I do not in the leaſt diſſemble, when I tell you, that one of the greateſt felicities I enjoy, is having a friend whoſe mind is ſo perfectly ſimilar to my own—equally as happy to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate as to receive;—though I muſt be free enough to add, I wiſh the former could be a little more practiſed. Ah, my dear Louiſa! were friendſhip always contracted on right principles, we ſhould ſeldom ſee ſuch revolutions in its profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, nor would our ears be ſo often offended with its illiberal tendencies. But, alas! what extremes are continually preſented to our view, merely for want of properly underſtanding the term—or, perhaps, be being too inſenſible to its ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred influences!</p>
                  <p>We need only take a perſpective around us, and innumerable inſtances will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly evince the reality of theſe reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030397_0009_0FE6C595032E06A0"/>—from exceſs of profeſſed friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to an equal extreme of actual ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. And what adds to the misfortune ſtill more, is, that it ceaſes not its ravages, nor is confined to either ſex or ſtation.</p>
                  <p>The female ſex, my dear, of which we have the honour to be a part, too often disfigure the natural delicacy with which they are favoured by Providence, by a propenſity to theſe extremes; whilſt thoſe of the other ſex, who are exalted in life, abuſe the beneficence of the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, by not cultivating ſuch feelings as would reflect an honour on their benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and afford a laſting ſource of peace to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>When we conſider, my dear, that we are created ſocial beings, and that it is not repugnant to the fineſt principles of reaſon, religion, or humanity, to be actuated by ſocial principles; we cannot help lamenting, that people ſhould ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate in their ideas as well as in their practice. Nor is it leſs unfortunate, that thoſe who feel, or <hi>affect to feel,</hi> the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures of <hi>friendſhip,</hi> ſhould be ſo changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their profeſſion of it. The truth
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030397_0010_0FE6C59642EBF0A8"/>however is, we are more ready to diſcover and magnify error aboard than at home. I cannot help perſuading myſelf, how particularly unhappy it is for females, that they expoſe themſelves ſo frequently to this foible: for if, in their civil inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with ſociety, they are often diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering little incidents to diſguſt and <hi>fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> their friendſhips, it is but too probable they will diveſt themſelves of every ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſentiment, and will equally fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in the nearer connexions of life—even in thoſe of <hi>wife</hi> and <hi>mother.</hi> I would forbear—but examples are too prevalent. Let women ſtudy themſelves, and only think a moment for what they were made; and, if they cannot heal a wound, let them not make it deeper.</p>
                  <p>Happy, my dear, is it for us, that we are bleſt with reaſon and ſenſibility enough, to protect us, in ſome degree, from theſe extremes; and it would be the higheſt ingratitude, were we to deny that we are reſtrained from exceſs by the kind interpoſition of a ſuperior power.</p>
                  <p>Though nature has been liberal in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing on us active minds, yet it would
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030397_0011_0FE6C59651D333B0"/>be very irrational to deny the benefits of education. Many a gem continues hidden in the earth, out of the reach of diſcovery; and there are many capacities capable of the greateſt improvement, which, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent circumſtances, are hid to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor and to the world; ſociety is denied the benefit of their ſervices; and we have reaſon to fear, that many important diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries are forever loſt.</p>
                  <p>I do not mean, however, to awaken gratitude in your breaſt for the ſuperior advantages you have enjoyed; I know you too well to doubt the efficacy of your good ſenſe. But as letters of friendſhip ſometimes fall into the hands of other friends beſides thoſe for whom they were originally intended, ſo mine may not, perhaps, eſcape the eyes of ſome, whoſe minds, for want of cultivation, make but and unpleaſing appearance in life.</p>
                  <p>Reaſon and humanity teach us to love our fellow creatures; therefore we ſhould endeavour to promote their happineſs, by communicating ſuch ideas as may ſeem moſt calculated for that purpoſe. If there are any within the limits of your
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030397_0012_0FE6C59E1A469BB8"/>acquaintance who correſpond with the portrait I have drawn, that which I write for the amuſement of my dear Louiſa, will ſerve for their information.</p>
                  <p>To illuſtrate a virtuous character, I propoſe giving you a ſhort account of my two young friends, Mr. and Mrs. Anſell. We contracted an intimate acquaintance with theſe amiable people a ſhort time ſince at a watering-place. My mother was ſo highly pleaſed with their converſation, that ſhe gave them a general invitation to our houſe, whenever they could make it convenient to viſit the metropolis. We little ſuſpected, that they would have made choice of our company, to cheer their drooping ſpirits, when the hand of death had cauſed them to ſink, by depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of the conſolations of a tender father and kind friend. The hiſtory of this good man is ſo pleaſingly interwoven, that I know you will be delighted at the tale; but the length of this epiſtle obliges me to poſtpone it till my next.</p>
                  <p>I have treſpaſſed, perhaps, on your time and patience too long. Pardon the error, if it is ſo—and be aſſured that the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030397_0013_0FE6C59E28715CF0"/>idea of having an affectionate remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance in the boſom of Louiſa, will always be an addition to the happineſs of</p>

                  <p>Your ideas of friendſhip and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation perfectly coincide with mine. It is certainly under the influence of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the former is moſt likely to have a permanent footing in the human heart. As the faculties of the mind are expanded
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030397_0014_0FE6C59F39185D10"/>by education, ſo the judgment becomes leſs liable to err. Obſervation is ever ready to diſcern—but if reflection be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we ſhall counterbalance the errors of our friends with thoſe of our own—and after all, perhaps, the ſcale will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate on the ſide where we leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it.</p>
                  <p>A ſenſible mind will endeavour to reſiſt every impediment to its peace; convinced that if anger, reſentment, or any other vice interpoſe, their baneful effects will be more eaſily traced, both in perſon and action, and will produce a more unſeemly aſpect, than in the profeſſedly vulgar.</p>
                  <p>Your incidents, my dear, are not <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling</hi>—therefore do not wound my ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility ſo much as to repeat the idea. It is not indeed trifling, to aim at promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing virtue, and extirpating vice. That man or woman, who is ſo far employed in the cauſe of humanity, as to endeavour to cheer thoſe who are ſinking under the weighty oppreſſions of life, and to ſoften the obdurate heart of the haughty oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, is engaged in a deſign that is of too noble a nature to bear the epithet of <hi>trifling.</hi>

I anticipate ſomething intereſting in the relation of Mr. and Mrs. Anſell; and I conſider myſelf greatly indebted to your kindneſs for introducing the tale. Precepts accompanied with examples, generally impreſs the young mind more than when given ſeparately: I ſhall therefore preſume upon your conjecture, and ſhew your amuſing letters to others of my young friends—ſome of thoſe too, perhaps, of the deſcription you have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me. Should their happineſs thereby be promoted, we ſhall feel a mutual reward.</p>
                  <p>You have liberty to exerciſe my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience as much as you pleaſe, it will not be ſoon exhauſted; nor will it be deemed a treſpaſs. Let us each improve upon the idea, <hi>not to diſſemble in the purſuit of friendſhip.</hi> Be aſſured, I am as happy to receive as you are kind to communicate. You muſt, however, acquit me of neglect, in not writing to you oftener. I will do it at a more convenient ſeaſon. But the duty I owe to my aged parent, muſt, for the preſent, ſuperſede the neceſſity of my writing long letters. His declining ſtate
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030397_0016_0FE6C5A5B71159E0"/>of life and health requires ſo much atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to preclude me from a ſufficient interval. I know you will excuſe me on the ground of duty: but I look forward to days, when my father may enjoy a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtate of health. In the mean time, I will acknowledge the receipt of your epiſtles, either by verbal meſſages or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe notes.</p>

                  <p>LOUISA's affectionate letter I received, and her philoſophical reaſoning afforded amuſement.</p>
                  <p>Agreeably, my dear, to your requeſt, I acquit you of neglect, ſince you have ſuggeſted a future period. I will patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wait till thoſe intervals arrive, when, by the re-eſtabliſhment of your father's health, your time and inclination will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030397_0018_0FE6C5A84B56D118"/>you to imitate the example of Matil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da. Believe me, I feel a pleaſing exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the reflection, that I have a friend who will not on any account deſert her duty to her parent. Continue in the exerciſe of your pleaſing employment. Pleaſing, did I ſay? Yes;—indeed it muſt be ſo; particularly if we look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the days of infirmity. Where ſhall we find the child whoſe feelings are not amply ſatisfied with the reflection, that age called them into exerciſe; and where ſhall we ſee the aged ſire, who does not receive the attention of a child, with double the pleaſure he would that of an indifferent perſon?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now proceed with Mrs. Anſell's narrative. We were one day ſitting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether after dinner, buſily employed with our needle-work, when I obſerved that her ſpirits appeared very much depreſſed. Being under the neceſſity of leaving the room a few minutes to give orders in the family, I was prevented from endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to inveſtigate the cauſe. On my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, are I had opened the door, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought I heard an echo like theſe words,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030397_0019_0FE6C5A85A2972E0"/>"O my father! my father!" I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately looked ſtedfaſtly in her face; but ſhe made every effort to conceal her grief, and turned towards the window. A heavy ſight, however, ſoon ſhook her tender frame, and intereſted my heart in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. I accordingly took a ſide-glance at her face, and obſerved a tear now and then ſteal involuntarily down her cheek.</p>
                  <p>I muſt have been poſſeſſed of more than brutiſh inſenſibility, if my feelings on ſuch an occaſion had not been called into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I immediately ran to her, and aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her the cauſe of her uneaſineſs. She begged met not to be frightened, for that ſhe hoped ſhe ſhould ſoon recover herſelf. I then lent her my ſmelling-bottle, and after ſome minutes' pauſe ſhe thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued:</p>
                  <p>"If I were not convinced, my dear Matilda, of the goodneſs of your heart, I ſhould feel more uneaſineſs at the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I have juſt given you; but as I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly perſuaded you are always as ready to ſhare in the griefs and ſorrows of your friends as you are in their joys and pleaſures, I will not heſitate to diſcloſe
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030397_0020_0FE6C5AFF5BA9F98"/>the feelings of my boſom. You are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, my dear, with the loſs I have lately ſuſtained in the death of my father." Here ſhe ſobbed, and it was with great difficulty ſhe could go on. "He was," ſays ſhe, "an amiable parent, and his virtues will ever be deeply impreſſed on my mind. The guardian of my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the years of childhood and youth is no more!—I need not theſe mournful colours with which I am decorated, to keep my ſenſibility alive; his abſence is ſufficient! But you are already anxious to know ſomething more particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting him. I will, therefore, endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to ſatisfy your curioſity: but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſeparate the hiſtory of my father from that of myſelf—you muſt therefore take them in connexion.</p>
                  <p>"My father was the ſon of a merchant in London; and, being left with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable fortune, had but little to fear from the frowns, and leſs to court from the ſmiles, of the world. He was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of a delicate turn of mind, and very fond of retirement; in conſequence of which, he fled from the buſy croud to a
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030397_0021_0FE6C5B0083F2138"/>beautiful ſeat in Hampſhire, which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered on the ſea-ſhore. Here he devoted a great part of his time to reading and ſtudy. The celebrated works of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Grecian and Roman authors were familiar to him;—hiſtory and philoſophy were his chief delight; his imaginations were attentively carried to all parts of the world; nor did he ſuffer ſcarce any thing to eſcape his penetrating genius, from the minuteſt infect to the great globe itſelf. From theſe acquiſitions he had learned to make a proper eſtimate of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to be very impartial in his deciſions on manners.</p>
                  <p>"But though he had a taſte for a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary life, yet he was not inſenſible to the pleaſures of friendſhip. He made choice of a few ſelect friends, whoſe minds in ſome degree bore a ſimilarity to his own. Occaſional viſits took place; at one of which he became enamoured with the ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his hoſt.</p>
                  <p>"His partiality increaſed, from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated diſcoveries he made of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her heart: nor could he, after a few intervals, ceaſe to inform her of the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030397_0022_0FE6C5B117AC5168"/>impreſſion ſhe had made on his mind. She received his careſſes with a becoming ſimplicity, without immediately ſtifling his hopes or increaſing his fears. At ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery interview he ſaw ſomething more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting to animate his prejudices in her favour. A mind poſſeſſed of the greateſt tenderneſs, a gentle, kind, and affable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, joined to a good underſtanding, were diſcoveries that operated too pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully to ſuffer him any longer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in ſuſpenſe.</p>
                  <p>"The next opportunity he aſſured her how much happineſs he enjoyed in her friendſhip; though he was in hopes a greater degree of it was ſtill in reſerve for him, by his having a ſhare in her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Yet he candidly confeſſed, that if the latter were not poſſible, he would not heſitate to withdraw every pretenſion; for, by perſiſting, he ſhould not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy her preſent peace, but make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his own, at leaſt for a while, inevitable.</p>
                  <p>"It were next to impoſſible, for a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible heart not to be captivated with a mind that could make a profeſſion of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030397_0023_0FE6C5B1278BB7E0"/>eſteem in ſo open and generous a manner. Nor was her reply leſs pleaſing.</p>
                  <p>'Your open and manly conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, my dear Sir, added to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence with which you are actuated, attract my admiration and eſteem. It is true, I have taken but a ſhort period, in compariſon with the generality of the world, to inveſtigate your pretenſions, and to form an adequate idea of my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate feelings. I am not, I hope, led to an extreme that will ever be a bane to my peace. I have too much confidence in your good ſenſe, to believe you will put an illiberal conſtruction on my ſentiments, when I inform you how much I have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly admired your virtues. You are worthy the favour you aſk, and I now candidly avow my attachment. And though it may be deemed a deviation from delicacy in me to declare ſo early in your favour, yet I can triumph no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger over thoſe feelings of your boſom, in which my own are ſo intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. Take, Sir, my heart, which is your own. I place the firmeſt reliance on your confidence, and anticipate the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030397_0024_0FE6C5B3D22B94B0"/>ſweets of ſocial enjoyment in your affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate ſociety. At a proper time, my hand ſhall follow what you have already in poſſeſſion. Continue the generous character you have hitherto exhibited, and you will be worthy of every feeble effort I can make to conſtitute your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Let propriety diſtinguiſh our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and it will be well."</p>
                  <p>"The artleſs and unaffected ſtyle in which ſhe ſpoke, ſo powerfully operated on my father, that he exclaimed with a degree of rapture,</p>
                  <p>'How can I be ſilent any longer? Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous woman! I have often beheld thee as one of the beſt of thy ſex; but now, methinks, thou art the moſt exalted of all. Thou art worthy—yes—thou art more than worthy of my higheſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eſteem. Friendſhip, love, and every ſacred ſweeter ſound, the attendants of virtue, ſhall be thine. If <hi>thou</hi> canſt anticipate happy moments in futurity, what muſt be the delightful proſpects which ſo pleaſingly agitate my ſoul! The diſtinction thou haſt favoured me with ſhall never, no, never, abate my conſtancy.'</p>

                     <pb n="27" facs="unknown:030397_0025_0FE6C5B3E096E928"/>
"After a proper time had elapſed, the day of celebration was fixed on, and they were married.</p>
                  <p>"Though I have only been able to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect a few ſcattered fragments of their courtſhip (part of which I obtained from my father) yet I am perſuaded they were models of propriety and virtue; and were their example univerſally adopted, it would ſave many from being the victims of folly and caprice. I believe you will agree with me, when I read to you two letters which paſſed between them a ſhort time previous to their marriage, during my father's abſence from the country."</p>
                  <p>She then took from her pocket-book the letters, which ſhe told me ſhe ſhould keep as ſacred to the lateſt period of her exiſtence, being the only intereſting me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentos of the kind ſhe had been able to reſcue from obſcurity.</p>
                  <p>I have tranſcribed the letters, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed them with this. In my next I ſhall continue her narrative.</p>

Happy, doubly happy am I, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the virtues of your mind. It was not, my dear, your perſonal charms alone that attracted my notice—no, it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more.</p>

                  <p>Though I deſpiſe the ſentiments of that man or woman, who can build their hopes of happineſs on ſhadows that quickly paſs by; I pity the objects whoſe paſſions are ſo blindly captivated as to leave them the dupes of their own depravity. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed poſſible for perſonal charms to be blended with a mind equally attracting; nor can there, I think, be a more pleaſing ſight.</p>
                  <p>Time will naturally furrow the beauties of nature; but the mind muſt bear up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every viciſſitude, that the body may be protected from too ſtrong impreſſions. A mind like this, I am happy in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you are poſſeſſed of. It is highly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary you ſhould be thus armed; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities are natural to the human ſpecies; and you may, perhaps, hereafter have to
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030397_0028_0FE6C5BFC8E17FA0"/>contend with many little foibles in me, which at preſent you are a ſtranger to. But as I believe our affections are mutual, I am the more ready to conclude we ſhall equally aim at extenuating the effects of folly on each other's mind. Were I to tell you I expected perfection, I ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble too much from my own perſuaſions to gain any credit from one ſo capable of diſtinguiſhing as yourſelf. I muſt howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er inſiſt, that the degree of excellence you have diſcovered in the courſe of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, has rooted an idea in my mind that, unleſs I can claim the poſſeſſor of ſuch excellence for my own, virtue itſelf will be the deſtruction of my peace.</p>

                  <p>Perplexities are indeed the common lot of humanity; yet I am convinced, that rectitude of conduct, were it more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, would ſpare many from the troubles they experience. How depraved is the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind! Though it dreads natural and unavoidable calamities; yet, how ſwiftly does it fly to thoſe unfriendly exceſſes, which are certain to involve in ſtill great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er difficulties! The reflection, I confeſs, is unpleaſing—but not more ſo, I fear, than it is true.</p>
                  <p>View the principles which actuate the world in general; and inſtead of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that life appears ſo very uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we muſt be aſtoniſhed that it is not beyond conception worſe. Pride, avarice, with all their horrid attendants, ſeem to be the moving ſources of action; and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030397_0031_0FE6C5C2870DD8E0"/>if vice remains at the root, it cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce virtue. Such alas! are the propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities which are often the means of joining the moſt diſaffected minds in the conjugal ſtate, and of inſuring to them a life of perpetual miſery. I hope we ſhall eſcape theſe ſnares, ſince a mutual and firm affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will guide us to the altar; nor will one bitter reflection interpoſe, to diminiſh that ſublime peace and tranquillity which will invariably be nurtured in our boſoms. I do not mean, however, to exult over the unfortunate:—No; objects of diſtreſs, whatever may be the original cauſe of their miſery, demand the utmoſt pity from feeling hearts.</p>
                  <p>But to be a little more ſerious with you, my dear Sir! You ſeem to lay by your ſteady philoſophical powers, when you ſtart even the poſſibility of <hi>excellency</hi> to be the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of your <hi>peace.</hi> The compliment you paid me I ſhould have received with diſguſt, as a piece of the moſt offenſive flattery, from any other but yourſelf;—but how oppoſite were my feelings, when I ſhed the ſilent tear over your wandering lines! It was not the tear of diſdain—no,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030397_0032_0FE64B7E2A902DE0"/>Charles; it was that of pity. I anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the penetrating ſigh which burſt from your heart when you was penning the idea; and lamented the treachery of your reaſon, that it ſhould deſert you at the very moment when the weakeſs of humanity demanded its aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Recollect, Sir, a thouſand difficulties may yet await us, and finally diſſolve the union you wiſh: one moment does not bring a protection for the next, nor does the evening ſhade inſure to us the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light. Were the arm of death to caſt an arrow at my feeble frame, and take me from you and all my friends; would reaſon then forſake you, and leave you to dwindle out a miſerable exiſtence, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of one conſolatory moment?—For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it, Heaven! The idea pierces my heart.</p>
                  <p>It is probable, in the height of your ecſtaſy, you may have made a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper eſtimate of my excellence; but, ſuppoſing it to be a perfect one, would you not triumph at the exchange of virtue which at beſt is only in a fluctuating ſtate, for that celeſtial purity and happineſs
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030397_0033_0FE6C5C915BFE2E8"/>which can never change nor decay? Yes, ſurely you would. I will venture to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge the thought, that inſtead of virtue oppoſing your peace, it would produce an harmony which would only cloſe with your exiſtence.</p>
                  <p>But in the midſt of all my reaſoning, I find it is eaſier to give advice than apply it; and muſt confeſs, that I am often loſt in the moſt pleaſing anticipations; theſe I am continually anxious to realize.</p>
                  <p>Farewel! May the ſweeteſt repoſe be thine!—Haſten, quickly haſten to the cottage where thy abſence feeds with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience the boſom of</p>

                  <p>NOTHING in this world can animate me to purſue the intereſting hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Mr. and Mrs. Anſell, but the pleaſure I have received from it, and the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030397_0034_0FE6C5CB38EA01E0"/>deſire of communicating it to my dear Louiſa. I know not where it will end, nor am I particularly anxious about it.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Anſell, after reading the letters, was going on with her narrative, when we were interrupted by the appearance of the ſervant with the tea-things. As ſoon as they were removed ſhe reſumed her tale, and related as follows:</p>
                  <p>"To be as conciſe as poſſible," ſaid the excellent woman, "the firſt year produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them a fine boy. It lived only a few months, during which period the world ſeemed to be neglected by them, as an empty void, and their mutual happineſs centered in the dear babe. The next year produced them a girl, which was <hi>your friend.</hi> This happy period too was but ſhort:—my mother, after ſuckling me three months, was ſeized with a violent cold which ſettled on her lungs. The phyſicians ordered her to refrain from ſuckling; but, alas! every effort was in vain—a haſty conſumption carried her off in about ſix weeks.</p>
                  <p>"My father, rendered diſconſolate by this adverſe ſtroke, was ſeized with a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefaction.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030397_0035_0FE6C5CB4D45F300"/>He ſaw but few people, and knew not thoſe he ſaw;—till at length, one of his intimate friends, who had more influence over him than the reſt, ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reaſon with him on his ſituation.</p>
                  <p>"When his recollection was recovered, he remembered that the infant of his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt partner claimed his paternal regard—and determined from that moment to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote the whole of his time to me; and, to palliate his misfortune, to make me (as he termed it) "the exact reſemblance of his dear Eliza." How far my fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er has ſucceeded in his wiſhes, I am not at liberty to ſay: though I may with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety affirm, that no parent ever took more pains to inſtil the pureſt principles of virtue into the mind of a child than himſelf.</p>
                  <p>"A nurſe was taken into the houſe, to attend me through my infant days. As I grew, ſo my father's fondneſs increaſed. At the age of four years he began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct my tender mind; and it affords me a ſingular degree of pleaſure when I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ollect his aſſiduity, and the happineſs it gave him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="unknown:030397_0036_0FE6C5D31FA902D0"/>
"He procured me ſuch books as he thought would gradually open and pleaſe my tender mind, firſt carefully peruſing them himſelf. He taught me every rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative duty; not with an air of auſterity, which is too common among parents, but with that ſerenity and cheerfulneſs, which, inſtead of agitating the breaſt with fearful apprehenſions, inſpire the mind with a kind of modeſt confidence, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe mutual happineſs to the ſire and the babe. He kept me chiefly under his own eye, yet he thought it abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that I ſhould be introduced a little to ſociety, leſt a ſhyneſs became habitual, and rendered me a diſagreeable companion when neceſſity called me more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into life. He ſought a few young aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates for me, as well that I might copy good examples, as avoid bad ones; and when I remarked any miſconduct in my young friends, as not agreeable to the impreſſions I had received, he endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured to ſtifle the idea of my ſuperior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, by conſtruing every error into a leſſon for my future conduct. If I chanced my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to deviate from the path in which he
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030397_0037_0FE6C5D32DCB0D90"/>had inſtructed me, he pointed out my fault, and its conſequence, with that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of delicacy and tenderneſs which is ever a more powerful mean of exciting reformation, than auſterity and correction.</p>
                  <p>"Thus inſtructed, the motives which impelled me to love, urged thoſe tender fears to offend an honoured father, which ſpring from gratitude, and which ought to inhabit the breaſt of every child.</p>
                  <p>"My mind, which was rather active, expanded itſelf every day; and I ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to learn the importance of religion and virtue. Young and ſuſceptible as I was, no wonder if the baits of vice had eaſy acceſs to my heart. But though I did not enter into thoſe unhappy errors which ſo often enſnare the younger, yet I felt ſuch propenſities to err as coſt me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſevere conflicts. Yes, Matilda! I ſaw the excellence of education, and adored the wiſdom of that Providence who had appointed me ſuch a friend and parent.</p>
                  <p>"In domeſtic exerciſes were my youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hours partly employed; my father judging that a knowledge of thoſe affairs was as neceſſary for a woman, as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030397_0038_0FE6C54D09DD3908"/>knowledge of the world. At length I arrived to thoſe years when a mutual confidence became indiſpenſable; and he endeavoured by gentle and perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive arguments to diſpel every fear that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it.</p>
                  <p>"I now reached my twentieth year; and my vanity was often flattered by ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral young beaux, who endeavoured to ingratiate themſelves in my favour. Though I was at times pleaſed with their artifice, yet my reaſon kept the aſcendan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſo far ever my heart, as to prevent my becoming a victim to impoſture. I laid every pretenſion before my father with ſimplicity, who always adviſed me as an intimate friend, but never urged againſt my inclination.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Anſell was ſoon after introduced to our houſe by a neighbouring gentleman. At firſt ſight of the lovely youth I felt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf embarraſſed, but was almoſt at a loſs to know the reaſon. The ſilent bluſh conveyed powerful ideas to each of our minds; and I then for the firſt time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think myſelf really in love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="unknown:030397_0039_0FE6C5D442CC6E40"/>
"While the two ſenior gentlemen were employed in talking over the news of the day, the young ſtranger addreſſed me in an eaſy and bewitching manner. Our converſation turned chiefly upon books and poetry. He appeared ſo intelligent, that his company became every moment more deſirable, and I wiſhed him only to give me the moſt diſtant hint of his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. But this he prudently reſerved for another opportunity, when both our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might be more mature. However, he gave me to underſtand, that he ſhould take the liberty of paying us a morning viſit or two during his reſidence in the country. Invitations were exchanged on both ſides by the old gentlemen, and the two viſitors departed.</p>
                  <p>"I remained in a ſituation better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived than expreſſed for the ſpace of three days, continually wiſhing for a ſecond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview: my appetite began to fail, and I was diſagreeably haraſſed between fluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating hopes and fears. The day came that diſſipated my anxiety.</p>
                  <p>"As I was looking from the window, I ſaw a young gentleman alight from his
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030397_0040_0FE6C5C906A54B40"/>horſe, and haſten towards the door. My heart leaped as it were within me; I felt thoſe tender emotions which are familiar to ſenſible minds in theſe ſituations.</p>
                  <p>"My father was gone to viſit ſome poor objects who depended chiefly on his generoſity for their ſubſiſtence; we were therefore alone. Mr. Anſell approached me with an air of modeſt aſſurance, which rendered him doubly captivating; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt compliments were over, we employed ourſelves in a general conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
                  <p>"Two hours fled with the utmoſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and he began to think of returning. He gently preſſed my hand, as a prelude to ſomething more momentous. I antic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipated his meaning, and fancied myſelf an excellent phyſiognomiſt. The language of his eyes was ſo very pathetic, that I was ready to grant his requeſt before he had given me an opportunity.</p>
                  <p>"With a ſmile of tenderneſs, he requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to know if his addreſſes would be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. I was ready to anſwer in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative;—but the recollection of duty which I owed my father, together with
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030397_0041_0FE64B7E498B40A8"/>his generous behaviour toward me, forbad my doing it before I had at leaſt conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. I therefore told Mr. Anſell, that it was impoſſible for me to give him a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itive anſwer, till I had obtained paternal approbation. This I articulated in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed manner, attended with a bluſh that rendered me for the moment very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. He relieved me from this awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſituation by approving of my reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and taking his leave, with a promiſe to wait on me in the courſe of a few days.</p>
                  <p>"When my father returned, I acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with the circumſtance. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of my conduct, and promiſed to inquire into the character and ſituation of the young man. He accordingly made inquiries, and received the moſt agreeable intelligence reſpecting him.</p>
                  <p>"As I ſat one day in my chamber, muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on my ſituation—forming reſolutions and breaking them—my father entered, and ſhut-to the door. His appearance ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the confuſion of my mind. I was convinced ſomething remarkable muſt have hurried him into my apartment. He obſerved my confuſion, and diſſipated my
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030397_0042_0FE64B80087EDDA0"/>apprehenſions by aſſuming a familiar aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and addreſſing me as follows:</p>
                  <p>'I perceive, my dear, your embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but do not let the preſence of your father diſturb the ſerenity of your heart. Be calm, my love, nor ever diſtreſs me by doubting my confidence. I feel for you, as every parent ought to feel for a child. Remember, I was once young myſelf, and felt thoſe propenſities which you are at preſent acquainted with. I have made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries reſpecting Mr. Anſell, but find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very flattering in his circumſtances. This, however, ſhall be no obſtacle. He has been unfortunately deprived of a great part of his property by the perfidious ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of his guardian. I am highly pleaſed with his character. It is ſuperior to rank and fortune. Receive his addreſſes—and be happy. You are my only child, therefore I cannot bear the idea of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with you. I know you will not object to reſide with me; particularly when I tell you, that the proſpect of your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will be a great addition to my own. Do not, however, let me decide for you. You are come to an age in which the laws
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030397_0043_0FE64B8028BDF268"/>of your country, as well as thoſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, leave you to your own choice. Think well, whether your mind be prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſubmit to be a wife. In learning to be a child, I will hope you have learned alſo to be a parent. Many important truſts will call your mind into action;—your real character will now be open to the world—for in no ſituation are the good or bad qualities of a perſon ſo read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily delineated as in he marriage ſtate: beauties and deformities are traced with perſpicuity—virtues and vices are expoſed to the gazing world, and ridicule and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or the moſt diſguſting flattery, will flow from the retroſpect. Theſe it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary you ſhould be aware of, that you may avoid the ſcrutiny of the one, and be indifferent to the artifice of the other?</p>
                  <p>"He then held out the letters which I read to you, and continued:</p>
                  <p>'I preſent you with theſe letters, that you may be acquainted with the motives which united your parents. If you imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the precepts they contain, you will arrive to the ſame ſummit of happineſs we enjoyed; but of what duration it will
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030397_0044_0FE6C543F5FD0798"/>be, is only in the womb of Providence to determine.'</p>
                  <p>"Then, with tears of anguiſh which penetrated my heart, he ſaid, 'Ours was but ſhort. The death of your mother was a ſevere ſhock to my feelings; and the only conſolation left me, was the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that ſhe reached a ſuperior abode of happineſs, where I hope one day or other to unite with her forever. In your purſuit after happineſs, be prepared to meet the events of Providence with forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: ſteeled by the influence of relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and virtue, you will feel a diminution of horror, and exhibit an example to the world worthy of imitation.'</p>
                  <p>"A ſudden rap at the door put an end to his ſpeech; and I had only time to thank him for his kind intentions before his company was deſired below.</p>
                  <p>"With tears of gratitude ſtreaming from my eyes, I was again left to myſelf. Contending between the paſſions of love and duty, I knew not which to place up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt in my boſom. When my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment became a little cool, I reſolved to make them inſeparable companions. 'I
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030397_0045_0FE6C5440B085F10"/>muſt,' thought I, 'be juſt, be dutiful and affectionate to my father—I feel I muſt; though my heart be divided with another. Yes, I will nurſe him in his old age; and, as he protected me in the infirmities of infancy, ſo will be aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in leſſening the pangs of infirmity in his latter days. It is a bleſſing to have ſuch a father, and a privilege to be able to convince him of my eſteem by every dutiful office.'</p>
                  <p>"I was awakened from my reverie by the maid, who came to inform me that Mr. Anſell was waiting to ſee me. After collecting my ſcattered ſenſes as much as poſſible, I haſtened to the parlour. He roſe to ſalute me, and informed me that he had obtained permiſſion of my father to wait on me, and requeſted my appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation to complete his wiſhes. This I granted with a ſmile—and I can only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the feelings of his heart by thoſe of my own."</p>
                  <p>Here, my dear Louiſa, we were again interrupted by the ſervant, who came to inform us, that the ſupper was ready; and I think it high time to cloſe this epiſtle.</p>

                  <p>MY laſt letter was rather too late for conveyance: but I think it a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble circumſtance; otherwiſe you would, perhaps, have been unpleaſingly ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in anxiety for the completion of Mrs. Anſell's hiſtory. As ſoon as the table was cleared of the ſupper, ſhe concluded as follows:</p>
                  <p>"The attachment between Mr. Anſell and myſelf became mutually ſincere, and my father beheld it with pleaſure. I was ſitting with the latter alone one day, when he addreſſed me, as near as I can recollect, in theſe words: 'My dear Eliza, I was once vain enough to hope, that your merit would have raiſed you to a diſtinction in life, that would have been an honour to my old age; but, upon reflection, I found that my rational moments were ſometimes invaded by ſlights of fancy that flowed from ambition and pride—imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030397_0047_0FE6C54ADAF0D1F0"/>at times elevated my mind, as well as my body, to an immenſe height; but, alas! a ſlight movement hurried it from the baneful precipice; it returned cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grined to its former ſentiments, and folly ſtared it in the face. I forgot that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment was equally attainable in the middle as in the higher ranks of ſociety—and that a peaſant could boaſt of its famil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iar intercourſe with a king. Obſervation however interpoſed, and ridiculed my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium—I then called myſelf a fool, and determined never to be biaſſed by ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in future. In this reſolution I have continued ſtedfaſt, and am happy in the proſpect that you are likely to be united with one, who, though he cannot beſtow on you wealth nor titles, yet will watch tenderly over your peace. I long for the morning to dawn when you will both be happy; and I hope you will cultivate thoſe principles (however unfaſhionable) that are moſt likely to conduce to happineſs.'</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Anſell was obliged to return to London—but as ſoon as a convenient op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity preſented itſelf we were marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the preſence of my father. He liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:030397_0048_0FE6C68D51235C10"/>with us fifteen months, and was delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the conjugal happineſs we enjoyed; for which he offered up his tribute of praiſe to the Giver of every good gift, who had preſerved him to witneſs ſuch enjoyment." She ſighed, and faintly articulated, "I now come to the cloſing period of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence. He was taken with a violent cold, which brought on a fever. At intervals he was perfectly ſenſible: he ſaw that his end approached; nor did he murmur at his fate. No timidity was to be ſeen on his countenance; no deſire to prolong his days. The conſolations of religion animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with calmneſs and compoſure, and taught him to look beyond the grave. He called us to his bedſide, and taking each of us by the hand he ſaid,</p>
                  <p>'My dear children, you have now to witneſs a ſcene that humanity in general ſhudders at. I feel I am haſtening to my exit. The ſtroke I ſuppoſe will be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you both. But recollect, we were not ſent into this world to live in it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; our probation is but ſhort—we wander but a little ſeaſon, and then we retire to a ſettled reſidence. It is good to

                        <l>'—Draw his ſteady bow,</l>
                        <l>And throw his quivering dart'—</l>
                     </q>
I will extort no promiſe of tenderneſs to each other after my deceaſe: my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence forbids it, becauſe I have beheld your mutual attachment with uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted pleaſure; and were it not that my mind is prepoſſeſſed with joys beyond the grave, nature would ſubmit with greater reluctance to the fatal blow. It is indeed a conſolation, that I leave my daughter in the hands of one who regards her happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as his own: this reflection diveſts me of every unpleaſing apprehenſion, and I retire without a dread to the ſilent tomb. I fondly hoped to have enjoyed your ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety many years; but theſe hopes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and I am ſupported by a more permanent one—even that of anticipating an inſeparable union. Continue in the exerciſe of religious virtue, and train your children up in her paths; and when you come to the cloſing period, terror will yield to tranquillity, and the horrors of death will become the implements of bliſs.'</p>

                  <p>"Then he preſſed our hands; and while the paternal tear ſtole gently down his venerable cheek, he continued in a ſtill fainter voice, 'I now take an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate leave of you. Farewel, my dear children! May you be bleſſed; and may the ſmiles of Heaven proſper you!—I die in peace.'</p>
                  <p>"Exhauſted with this exertion, he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a little wine, and after wetting his lips, he laid down and expired without a groan. Mr. Anſell and myſelf were bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in agonizing tears, and with the moſt ſorrowful hearts we performed the laſt duties. Now ſay, Matilda, have I not enough to affect my feelings, to urge my tears? Few ſuch fathers—few ſuch friends!"</p>
                  <p>Here the ſweet woman cloſed her nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative; and I think ſhe has given us as perfect a hiſtory of an upright character as the world can produce. Her father had a generous mind, which made him the friend of virtue, and rendered him great through almoſt every action of his life. Magnanimity was conſpicuous in his latter moments; and the ſerenity with
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030397_0051_0FE6C5DCF3182788"/>which he made his exit was a ſpectacle of grandeur rarely to be equalled: and though his death was a ſevere ſtroke to ſurviving relatives, who but the unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would wiſh to have detained him a moment from the peaceful habitation to which he is gone?</p>
                  <p>Mr. and Mrs. Anſell have juſt left us, and are returned to the family manſion in Hampſhire. They have made my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſelf promiſe to viſit them early in the ſpring; and I confeſs I ſhall be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to embrace the opportunity. I felt a kind of ſelfiſh ſorrow at parting with them, and know not how to make up the loſs any other way than by hoping again to ſee them.</p>
                  <p>I have taken a deal of trouble in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the above to paper. You will now be able to imitate my precedent, as I am informed your father gains ſtrength; for which reaſon you will have a little more time.

                  <p>MY dear Matilda will be a little ſurpriſed at the date of my letter. Juſt as your laſt epiſtles arrived we were preparing for our journey, the phyſician having adviſed my father to drink the Bath waters. Perhaps I cannot better
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030397_0053_0FE6C696645BC128"/>ſatisfy you for the trouble you have taken, than by informing you that your letters afforded us ſo much pleaſure as made us forget the fatigues of travelling. I am at a loſs where to begin my commendation—and yet I think you have a prior claim. I admire your patience, and am going in a meaſure to imitate it.</p>
                  <p>The deſcription Mrs. Anſell has given you of her father and mother, ſurpaſſes every thing of the kind that has come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the circle of my knowledge. She might well ſay, that "were their example uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally adopted, it would ſpare many from becoming the victims of folly and caprice." Such inſtances of ſimplicity and candour are ſeldom to be met with.</p>
                  <p>I am equally charmed with the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the parent and the child. I am affected at their loſs, and feel a tender ſympathy for them.</p>
                  <p>How happy would it be for the world, if parents in general adopted Mr. Elmer's plan! By inſtilling principles of virtue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mind of his child, he laid a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for confidence, and converted that duty to a privilege, which to a mind
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030397_0054_0FE6C5DD08D6B5E8"/>otherwiſe educated would have appeared a taſk. Heaven certainly deſigned him for a being of a ſuperior order: he knew how to combine the father and the friend; and, inſtead of acting the tyrant where he had power, he generouſly diſdained to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs humanity. Yes, Matilda, I feel a high veneration for thoſe characters, who can boldly ſtep out of the common track, and bid defiance to the prejudices of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, by facilitating the happineſs even of a child.</p>
                  <p>How are the regiſters of marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into monuments of diſgrace! See the parties moſt intimately concerned ſtanding like a beaſt—neuter. The miſer and the proud ſire contract, while the poor victims remain paſſive; and at laſt, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the craving appetites of pride, are obliged to ſubmit to miſery and diſgrace, or, in ſeeking an aſylum of peace, be abandoned to poverty and wretchedneſs. O humanity, how art thou fallen from thy original purity!</p>
                  <p>Inſtances of depravity are common in this city. We generally viſit the Pump-room, where he company reſort, every
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030397_0055_0FE6C5E4F8C55B10"/>morning. Here we are preſented with a group of figures that at once excite pity and contempt. You can hardly conceive the contraſts that alternately appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
                  <p>The old and decrepit libertine, unable to ſupport his ſteps only a few paces, is obliged to be wheeled in a chair. His countenance is a picture of debauchery; and you may obſerve, amidſt all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions of his features, a deſire to repair the emaciated injuries which his conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has ſuſtained.</p>
                  <p>The aged female tottering with infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, though convinced that ſhe is haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her exit, would fain deceive herſelf and the world with reſpect to the date of her exiſtence: ſhe daubs her venerable locks, the colour of which, to a virtuous mind, would reflect an honour and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and decks herſelf in all the gaudy trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of faſhion; and were it not for thoſe unavoidable wrinkles which furrow her brow, and the reeling of her fabric, ſcarce able to ſupport itſelf againſt a puff of wind, one would be at a loſs to diſtinguiſh the young and the giddy, from thoſe who are juſt ready to ſtep into the grave.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="unknown:030397_0056_0FE6C5E50C163530"/>
Here the proud coxcomb, whom folly and diſſipation have reduced almoſt to a ſtate of dependence, dreads the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant idea of poverty, and, like a bird of prey, watches an impetuous moment when he may ruſh on the unwary woman, who, by reinſtating him in his former poſſeſſions, too often becomes the partner of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, with a certain proſpect of miſery.</p>
                  <p>Many, too, are the unthinking girls whoſe happineſs centres in flirting about with fops. Aiming to gain the aſcendancy over their gallants, they lay aſide the mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt veil of delicacy. This affords them only a temporary triumph. At length, mortified by ſucceſſive diſappointment and vexation, they deſcend to be the dupes of their own folly, and finally ſwell the annals of infamy.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, Are there no charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that deſerve a more pleaſing deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?—Yes, my dear, there are. Here you may ſee blended in one, the fair, the gentle, and the amiable—here the wiſe and the prudent—and here alſo the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate. An inſtance of the latter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription I will give you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="unknown:030397_0057_0FE6C5E61CFFE3A0"/>
I was one day walking in the fields, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the beauties of nature, when I ſaw, ſeated on a bank under a hedge, a female. Her appearance was penſive and dejected. I approached her, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince myſelf of her ſituation. To my ſurpriſe, I beheld a countenance beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully delicate; and though time had given her clothes the marks of poverty, yet it was evident ſhe was a being above the common ranks of ſociety. I felt myſelf intereſted in her favour. She obſerved me drawing near her, and in all probabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, had I not quickened my pace, would have concealed her diſtreſs ſome time longer.</p>
                  <p>I endeavoured to appear as cheerful as my feelings would admit, and prudence forbad my inquiring abruptly into the cauſe of her diſtreſs; I therefore aſked her the way to a neighbouring village. She replied with an accent that at once convinced me of my ſuſpicions,</p>
                  <p>'Madam, I am a ſtranger to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; otherwiſe I ſhould be happy to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you.'</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="unknown:030397_0058_0FE6C5E62CCE90D8"/>
'From what part then did you come?' ſaid I with a ſmile. She bluſhed, and a torrent of tears ſtreamed from her eyes, when ſhe ſaintly ſaid,</p>
                  <p>'I am an unfortunate woman, early exiled from my friends and myſelf; but perhaps it were better to hide my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes than—'</p>
                  <p>'Why hide your misfortunes? What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may have been the cauſe of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, you are not undeſerving of pity.'</p>
                  <p>'Can you feel then for diſtreſs?' ſaid ſhe.</p>
                  <p>'I can not only feel, but I can be happy alſo in being the friend of virtue, and in relieving diſtreſs. Tell me by what means you are deſerted by your friends, and I will endeavour to—'</p>
                  <p>'Impoſſible, Madam; endeavours will be fruitleſs. I, perhaps, ſhall be conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered the aggreſſor, by firſt deſerting them; nor do I wiſh to return, till the arbitrary feelings of a mother be reduced to thoſe of a friend.'</p>
                  <p>A mother! Is it poſſible that a mother can act the tyrant to ſuch exceſs, as to oblige her daughter to fly from her
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030397_0059_0FE6C5ED835B8EE0"/>preſence? By what motives was ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated?'</p>
                  <p>'By pride and avarice, Madam. As you ſeem to be intereſted in my diſtreſs, I will entruſt you with my hiſtory. I need not deſcend into all the particulars reſpecting my parents. It will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to inform you, that I was born in Birmingham.</p>
                  <p>'My father was concerned in a capital manufactory, and acquired a conſiderable fortune by his aſſiduity. He died in the prime of life, leaving my mother ſole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutrix. And though I was, of four children, the only one that ſurvived, yet ſhe felt herſelf happy in reſigning me to the care of a maiden aunt; who, fearing my morals would be either extirpated or corrupted, requeſted as a favour to have me for a companion.</p>
                  <p>'My mother was as much pleaſed at the idea of being relieved from ſo much trouble, as my aunt was at reſcuing the daughter of her brother from certain ruin. I am ſorry to ſay, that the former always delighted more in diſſipation and faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able amuſements, than in thoſe domeſtic
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030397_0060_0FE6C5ED917763C8"/>concerns which ornament the character of a woman.</p>
                  <p>'My aunt's general employment was inſtructing me in relative duties; nor did ſhe exempt me from thoſe accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which with prudence are ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully attracting in our ſex. She care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endeavoured to encourage ſuch principles of virtue in my young mind, as ſhe thought would be neceſſary to guard me from error.</p>
                  <p>'At length I was attended by ſeveral young ſuitors. Age and education had ſo far matured my underſtanding, as to make me prefer the virtuous mind, even though his fortune were contracted, to the man who had habituated himſelf to vice. My good aunt approved of my choice; and the ſanction of my mother only remained to complete my wiſhes.</p>
                  <p>'The addreſſes of one gentleman, who had a fortune even beyond my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but whoſe character and conduct had equally rendered him diſagreeable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I refuſed. Inſtead of receiving my anſwer as poſitive, he immediately haſtened to my mother; thinking that by an offer of
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030397_0061_0FE6C5EEA5676C98"/>a ſplendid ſettlement he ſhould eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by force, what would be otherwiſe inacceſſible; and when Mr. Williams, for whom I was partial, applied for the ſame favour, he was rejected with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and informed, that her daughter had already an admirer more ſuited to her birth and fortune.</p>
                  <p>'In a few days I was ſummoned to appear before her; and, to my ſurpriſe, was informed that ſhe had given her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to Mr. Green to wait on me, at the ſame time praiſing him for his perſonal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, and reminding me of the advantages of his ſuperior fortune; tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me that ſhe expected I would receive his addreſſes without any heſitation.</p>
                  <p>'I could no longer be ſilent; I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore told her, I was exceedingly ſorry that it was not in my power to comply with her wiſhes—for I had conceived a ſettled diſlike to his perſon as well as to his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter; and that I muſt beg leave to decline the favour ſhe had intended me. At this ſhe threw herſelf into a moſt violent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion—wondering at my taſte—and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to deſert me if I did not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030397_0062_0FE6C5EEB4458FB0"/>conſent to his propoſals. She ſaid, that ſhe had a right to diſpoſe of me as ſhe pleaſed without hearkening to the ſilly nonſenſe of a fooliſh girl; and that ſhe had fixed the time for the ceremony, which was to be in the courſe of two months. She per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me to take my leave, and deſired me to prepare myſelf for the event.</p>
                  <p>'I returned with a ſorrowful heart to my aunt, whom I found ſpeechleſs. An apoplectic fit during my abſence had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived her of her ſenſes. She ſoon, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, recovered, ſo far as to attend to my diſcourſe, and appeared anxious to know the reaſon of ſo ſudden a call to my parent. I related every particular. She heard me with attention, and raiſed herſelf in bed to write to my mother. All was in vain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the latter continued inflexible, and ordered me immediately to come and reſide with her. This unexpected news had ſo great an effect on the mind of my aunt, that ſeveral fits ſucceeded, and at laſt carried her off.</p>
                  <p>'To complete my miſery, a billet was put into my hand by the ſervant, which ſhe ſaid came from Mr. Williams. The
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030397_0063_0FE6C5F517B21210"/>perſon who brought it deſired that it might be delivered immediately, as the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man from whom it came was gone abroad; a copy of which I will ſhew you.' She then took it from her pocket. It runs thus:</p>

                  <p>'I was diſtracted with the heap of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes that attended me. To add to the reſt—the next day, before I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030397_0065_0FE6C5F78C643208"/>my ſhock, I was mortified by the appearance of Mr. Green. His manner appeared more diſguſting than ever. He began by informing me of his ſucceſs with my mother. I interrupted him, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him at leaſt to be ſilent for the preſent on the ſubject, as my mind was ſufficiently agitated by the affliction that had ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently befallen me. After a few inquiries he left me, and promiſed to wait on me again at a more convenient ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>'I was now obliged to attend to the laſt duties Lowed my aunt, before I could obey my mother's mandate. You will, perhaps, wonder that my aunt did not provide for me before ſhe died; but this was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as her eſtate, which was but ſmall, became the property of my couſin, the next heir at law. She left me all that ſhe could; which amounted in value to about four hundred pounds, including her clothes and furniture. As ſoon as I had depoſited her remains, I haſtened to my mother. She ſuffered me to live in peace a week; when ſhe informed me, Mr. Green had ſent a card to acquaint us, that he intended waiting on us in the afternoon,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030397_0066_0FE6C5F7A0DEB410"/>and deſired me to conduct myſelf towards him as though I approved of his ſuit.</p>
                  <p>'I told her, it was impoſſible; that I could by no means accept of him. She replied, that in a few days ſhe would ſee the ceremony performed; otherwiſe I muſt quit her preſence, nay, her houſe. The latter I preferred, rather than become a legal proſtitute. I was convinced, in ſuch a connexion I could not do juſtice to my own feelings in the character of a wife, nor to him as my huſband.</p>
                  <p>'My mother previouſly poſſeſſed herſelf of nearly all my clothes, and I had only about fifty pounds left: it did not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, deter me from my deſign. I have wandered theſe ſix months, my little treaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure is nearly exhauſted, and I am at laſt arrived at the pitiful condition in which you ſee me.'</p>
                  <p>I then aſked her if I ſhould write to her mother, and endeavour to ſoften her heart by argument. She conſented to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. I immediately took her home to our lodgings, and made her as comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as I could. The gratitude ſhe diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered at my little attentions increaſed my ardour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="unknown:030397_0067_0FE6C5FD813EF458"/>
I wrote to her mother; and in four days had a letter to inform me, that ſhe was on the point of death, and only wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee her daughter, that ſhe might confeſs the injuries ſhe had done her, and receive her forgiveneſs; that Mr. Green had died a miſerable victim to vice; and that a letter had been received from Mr. Williams, who was in the Weſt Indies, but was expected ſoon to return. This Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I read to her; and ſuch was the filial tenderneſs of her heart, that ſhe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſwooned away. When ſhe recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herſelf, ſhe appeared in a kind of fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy at the idea of her mother's death. I procured her every medical aſſiſtance that was neceſſary; and when ſhe was able to bear the journey, aſſiſted her with my purſe.</p>
                  <p>Miſs Blair had only left us a week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had a letter from her, written in ſuch a ſtyle, that I now conſider her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance as an acquiſition rarely to be met with. After reciting the death of her mother, with the diſagreeable incidents attending it, ſhe concludes,</p>

'I ſhould charge myſelf with ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, were I not to acknowledge your kind interpoſition, when I was ſinking under a weight of obſcurity and diſtreſs: the rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged hand of poverty had nearly deranged my animal ſyſtem. To whom am I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted? to whom can I make a return? I know the generoſity of your nature, nor will I diſturb it. You feel a recompenſe within that ſprings from a conſciouſneſs of doing good: this is all you wiſh. I confeſs I am happy in claiming a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with a perſon who can delight in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the friend of the oppreſſed. My heart dictates more—but the unhappy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that now attend me forbid it. The death of my mother is a ſhock to my feelings. I can forget the injuries I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from her hand, and hide them under the weakneſs of humanity. You will not wait for invitations, but come and ſee me when you can make it convenient.— Adieu, &amp;c.'</p>
                  <p>The laſt accounts I received of this ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able woman were, that Mr. Williams was arrived from abroad, and that they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoon to be married.</p>

What a contraſt do the characters of Mrs. Anſell's father, and of the mother whom I have deſcribed, preſent! The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer conſidered his child had an equal right to the privileges of humanity with himſelf; but the latter, poor woman! never gave herſelf the trouble to think. She conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the idea of parent was inſeparable from uſurpation and tyranny; and that peace of mind was only a ſmall compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for wealth and titles. In theſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhe was unfortunately deceived, and no arguments were ever forcible enough to controvert her miſtaken ideas, till the near approach of death removed the veil from her bewildered ſenſes. Then it is, in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, that the human mind begins to feel the importance of truth and equity, and confeſs them ſuperior in quality to faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ionable and diſſipated notions. How ill calculated was Mrs. Blair for either wife or mother! She diſcovered a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted mind, with little education, or leſs of its good effects.</p>
                  <p>I muſt now conclude with a deſire to have a letter from you immediately. I

                  <p>REALLY, my dear Louiſa, you have acquitted yourſelf admirably. I return you a thouſand thanks for your tale, and ſhould be happy in a perſonal acquaintance with Miſs Blair. I applaud her motives for leaving her mother— though it was a dangerous experiment. What are not wandering women expoſed to! Many unhappy creatures, by endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:030397_0072_0FE6C6011838B6D0"/>to avoid one evil, are inſenſibly led into ſnares and temptations which they little ſuſpect. This world is treacherous; and ſew females have learned the art of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence enough to be always on their guard, when their peaceful hours are likely to be invaded. Inexperienced in the arts of vice themſelves, they cannot bear to harbour ſuſpicion of others, till at length they are caught in the net, and feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to bow at the ſhrine of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. To add to their misfortunes, they are deſerted by their neareſt friends; and what they ſubmitted to in an unguarded moment, they are compelled to continue for a pitiful ſubſiſtence. Lucinda, the daughter of a reſpectable citizen, is an eminent inſtance of this kind of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
                  <p>Lucinda had all the advantages that affluence could beſtow, at an age when, without a little reſtraint, it is moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. She was young, beautiful, and ſprightly in her imaginations—but withal virtuous. Her charms attracted a retinue of admirers: each one ſtrove for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; but all were equally unſucceſsful.
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:030397_0073_0FE6C604B94FFF40"/>At length the young Philaſter, who had ſome previous knowledge of Lucinda's family, ſaw her at the play-houſe. He was attracted by the beauty of her perſon, and the elegance of her dreſs; and being of a genteel appearance, he eaſily introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced himſelf to her notice. He was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly verſed in frivolous converſation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on the dreſs, ſcenery, &amp;c. The awkward manner in which ſhe conducted herſelf, ſoon convinced him of the ſtate of her mind.</p>
                  <p>When the play was over, he begged leave to attend the young lady and her mother home. The accepted his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal; and he had ſagacity enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the further impreſſion he had made on the former.</p>
                  <p>Philaſter was the ſon of a wealthy knight at the weſt end of the town—but an extravagant libertine—poſſeſſed of more loquacious ſenſe, than ſolid virtue. The volubility of his tongue, together with his perſonal appearance, were much in his favour; and in a little time he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a paſſport to the tender heart of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda. He was her equal in fortune—
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030397_0074_0FE6C604CD43BC98"/>but, owing to an old family diſpute, had a difficulty in getting the conſent of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents on each ſide. Every thing, however, was at length amicably ſettled. The time was appointed for the marriage, and the news readily circulated.</p>
                  <p>Some days before the period arrived, the following note was ſent to Lucinda by a young lady, whoſe fortune was rather contracted, but whoſe agreeable manners made her beloved by all who had the pleaſure of knowing her.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <head>TO LUCINDA.</head>
                        <p>"THE news of the day informs me, you are ſhortly to be united to Philaſter. Be it ſo—you are innocent. But feel for me, Madam, when I tell you, that the treachery of the man who is ſoon to be your huſband has reduced me to ſhame, has conſtituted me wretched. My ſtate of mind forbids the unfolding my tale of woe: could you know it, you would drop the ſympathetic tear. I once anticipated the morn like yourſelf—but may you eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the miſery of the unfortunate —"</p>
                     </body>
                  </floatingText>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="unknown:030397_0075_0FE6C60F36EEC650"/>
Lucinda's father intercepted the above, and in conſequence countermanded his former conſent. He made inquiries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the unfortunate young lady, and found that Philaſter had by promiſes ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced her, and them deſerted her. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the note to his daughter, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her of the particulars he had heard, forbidding her to ſuffer Philaſter to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her preſence again, or forfeit his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal eſteem. It did not, however, affect the feelings of the hardened debauchee, nor deter him from villainous purpoſes. He had never felt the virtuous influence of love; and inſtead of being mortified at the diſcovery, he conſidered it a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opportunity to be revenged of a family enemy.</p>
                  <p>Lucinda, unfortunately, too early in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Philaſter of her attachment to him, before ſhe had properly ſtudied his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter or the bent of his inclinations: ſhe had gone too far—nor would the feelings of her heart permit her to obey her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's injunction. Fatal love! Unhappy woman! Why didſt thou form weapons to appoſe thy own peace? Why betray
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:030397_0076_0FE6C60F4988EEE8"/>thy weak credulity, and ſuffer the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to increaſe in power?</p>
                  <p>Philaſter found means to get admiſſion to her company. He was not at a loſs to juſtify his conduct, nor to reprobate the ſeverity of her father. He made uſe of inſinuating proteſtations, that are too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten proof againſt reaſon. He told her, there was no poſſibility of their being ever united but by ſtealth—that ſhe muſt elope with him, and depend on his hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our—that he ſhould believe ſhe had no affection for him, unleſs ſhe complied im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately with his wiſhes. This, howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſhe refuſed—though with ſuch a ſpirit of timidity, that it did not deprive him of the hope of ſucceeding in his baſe deſign. He ſwore to love and conſtancy—painted the horrors to which ſhe muſt expoſe him if ſhe perſiſted in denying his requeſt—the ſea—the ſword—the ball—with a thouſand other terrifying ſcenes which the humane female trembles at. At laſt ſhe thought him ſincere. Neither the threats of her father, nor the entreaties of her mother, had any weight on her mind. She conſented—fatal conſent!—fatal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!—ſhe
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030397_0077_0FE6C6105881E530"/>packed up all her moveables againſt the time appointed—ſhe fled—and that too with a wretch who had no ſooner deprived her of the conſolations of virtue, that he retired from her preſence, and left her a conſiderable diſtance from home. In a few hours after he ſent her the following card:</p>

                  <p>In conſequence of this unhappy cataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophe, Lucinda dreaded to return to her parents; ſhe ſpent all her money; and not till the pinching hand of poverty had
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030397_0078_0FE6C610673356E0"/>overtaken her did ſhe make know her ſituation. The pride of her friends was too great to take a repenting child again to their boſom. She had been guilty of a crime that had diſgraced herſelf and her family, and no pardon was to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. A wretched ſituation for a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible mind!—Her reſources were entirely ſtopped. Poverty threatened her on one hand, and infamy on the other: to avoid the former, ſhe ſubmitted to the latter.</p>
                  <p>She was ſoon reduced to thoſe unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py extremities that attend the miſerable wretches who wander the ſtreets; and ere two months had elapſed, her delicate conſtitution began to decay. Death ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her in the face. She made it known to her friends.</p>
                  <p>The idea of death awakened parental tenderneſs, and her father haſtened to her lodgings. He entered her miſerable apartment, where he found her ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a group of wretches—who, though they were loſt to the common feelings of humanity, yet had ſenſibility enough to lament her ſituation in tears.</p>

She knew his venerable voice, and lifted up her worn-out eye-lids. She ſaw him approach; and with a ſhriek, which ſhook the bed that ſupported her, ſhe ſtretched forth her hand, cloſed her eyes, and expired. He, in return, beheld her pallid cheek—and whilſt his fabric ſhiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with horror at the affecting ſpectacle, he exclaimed,</p>

                  <p>An acquaintance who related to me the tale, ſavoured me with a manuſcript of reflections which was found in a box directed to her father. I will tranſcribe them for your peruſal—but muſt beg to reſerve it for my next. I feel ſleepy—aſſure yourſelf I am ſtill</p>

My heart is ready to burſt with filial tenderneſs!—my mind ponders what I cannot expreſs!—Affection! What would I not give to ſee them!—my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!—my mother! Perhaps they would relent, if they beheld this couch of ſorrow. But, ah! were this the caſe, they would have ſought their long-loſt child:—they might have reclaimed—they might have ſpared me theſe bitter agonies! I muſt not reproach them—I will not. Gracious Father of the univerſe! Friend of the unfortunate!—pardon <hi>their</hi> errors—par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>mine</hi>—and unite us finally with thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf! Farewel, farewel!</p>

Will not Louiſa join in ſhedding a tear at the ſhrine of ſorrow? Poor Lucinda! how did her credulity betray her into errors the moſt fatal! She ſeems as though ſhe had been born to be a victim to wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. Betrayed by a monſter in human ſhape, rejected and deſpiſed by her friends, and conſoled only by the miſerable, what muſt ſhe feel! Unhappy woman! How many females eſcape thy puniſhment, who are more deſerving of it than thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf! Many a ſplendid equipage ſupports a deſpicable proſtitute, who delights in infamy, but by cunning preſerves her character; and from circumſtances un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, or ſcarcely to be conceived, many deluded creatures are conſigned to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual diſgrace. Perhaps they will expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience a tranſpoſition in their feelings hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Fatal pride, that will not ſuffer the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated parent to pardon an unfortunate crime in a child! Though, in a moment of deluſion, her virtue and her reaſon forſook her, yet ſhe might have been reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued from the ruinous conſequences that followed. How many of thoſe deluded
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:030397_0084_0FE6C621F6AAA4E8"/>wretches might be recovered, were only the hand of pity extended towards them!</p>
                  <p>The unhappy tale of Lucinda, howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſhould be a leſſon of caution to fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, ever to be aware of either too much levity or credulity in their conduct, whilſt in the preſence of the other ſex. Nor let the ſycophant or the fop—the ſervile or the proud—nor even the ſteady—the brave—the wiſe—or the prudent, be the ſubjects of confidence, till con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their integrity; but let females remember, that love without reaſon is dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Happy are thoſe who are out of the reach of temptation! Let them not tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. Had they been expoſed alike with the unfortunate, their fate, perhaps, would have involved them in the ſame calamities. Nor have thoſe who reſiſt the power of temptation a right to exult, ſince, were it their reaſon, education, or religion, that prevented them from becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing victims, they are indebted to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than humanity for theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable bleſſings.</p>

                  <p>We have at laſt, my dear, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with the entreaties of our kind friends Mr. and Mrs. Anſell, and are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at this manſion of bliſs. Really,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:030397_0087_0FE6C62AB9024CA0"/>Louiſa, you would be delighted if you could imagine the extent of their conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal happineſs. Nature herſelf ſeems am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to add to their felicity.</p>
                  <p>The ſituation of the houſe is beautiful beyond conception: a riſing hill which commands an extenſive proſpect over the ſea—a view of the Iſle of Wight—and the varying ſcenes which ſurround us by land and by ſea, make as pleaſant an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance as ever I ſaw.</p>
                  <p>In the bottom of yonder dale I ſee a leſſer farm: the peaſant and his family are buſily employed—and ſurely they have enough to excite them to induſtry. The field wants the labouring hand to preſerve its cultivation; the cattle depend on their ſteady care. In the yard are the fowls pecking round the barn; the ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling ducks in the pond; the milk-maid milking her cows; and the pigs following the dairy-woman to their trough.</p>
                  <p>In a further vale I view a lonely cottage ſurrounded with a ſmall garden: its poor inhabitant has ſtowed it with vegetables and fruits, and in a corner has placed a few bee-hives: with theſe he provides a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:030397_0088_0FE6C62ACB5BA378"/>winter ſtore, that he may abate the crav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appetites of his family, when the rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the ſeaſon prevents his manual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and threatens them with want. A friendly ſtranger enters the decaying wicket—he is complimented by a ſnarling cur—nor dares he approach, till the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful animal is relieved from his truſt by the appearance of his maſter, or ſome of the domeſtics.</p>
                  <p>On one ſide is a winding river, with a mill—on the other, an aſcent, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of which is a village church with a ſpot of ground the receptacle of the dead. There, think I, the hero and the vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have equal claims to diſtinction: there the ſquire has nothing to boaſt over his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent tenant: one cannot oppreſs, the other has no reaſon to murmur. There the philoſopher, the divine, and the lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertine ſink to a common heap; nor can human ſagacity diſtinguiſh the particles of either. There, thoſe whom the ſmiles of Providence have elevated above their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, reſt on the ſame mouldering couch with the unfortunate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="unknown:030397_0089_0FE6C62BDD058120"/>
At the top of the aſcent are the ſhatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed remains of an an ancient caſtle. At ſight of this venerable pile I am loſt in thought. Here the rich and the poor have equally murmured at their hard fate. Misfortunes have followed them alike. How many brave, animated ſouls have fallen ſacrifices in its defence! How many anxious, hapleſs wives have been deprived of their tender, their endearing huſbands! How many helpleſs infants have loſt their only ſupport! How many families have been reduced from poverty to wretchedneſs! Ah happier days, that ſcreen the preſent age from ſuch woes! Gratitude ſhould uſurp an univerſal em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in the human heart. Now the ſtrength of the mighty is yielding to the influence of time—is become a tottering fabric—But enough.</p>
                  <p>I believe this ſcene is calculated to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the muſe. I ſend the following lines as a continuation, which have flowed from my heart this morning whilſt contemplat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an arbour. If I thought you were fond of diſcovering faults, I would beg you to be favourable in your criticiſms.</p>

In addition to the above deſcription, our friends have a dear little infant: they unite in telling me it is the ſweets of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimony. I am ready to believe them, and feel myſelf almoſt inclined to envy.</p>
                  <p>How do you think we ſpend our time? Perhaps it may be called an unfaſhionable manner, but I believe you would like it much.</p>
                  <p>In the morning we riſe about ſeven o'clock, and take a walk, if we have time, in the fields—otherwiſe, in the garden, till eight. After breakfaſt, when the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the family are over, if we have no particular engagement, we again reſume our walk to ſome adjacent village, or to viſit one of the lonely cots.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes we witneſs the moſt affecting ſcenes of poverty and diſtreſs; and when this is the caſe, our dear friends ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo very aſſiduous in leſſening afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I begin to think them almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their equal. They diſtribute a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs where ever they go; and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances of the poor creatures are ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably marked with gratitude, that a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible mind muſt ever feel itſelf amply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:030397_0092_0FE6C633D90D3158"/>in adminiſtering to their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities.</p>
                  <p>At other times, we have a more pleaſing ſcene. Picture to yourſelf a group of four, five, or ſix children, riſing in regular gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and running to the door to meet and welcome us to their hoſpitable dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Here we are employed a quarter or perhaps half an hour, in inquiring into the conduct and behaviour of each child; that who has the beſt character is rewarded with a little book, as a token of approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By this means each is ambitous to merit the good opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Anſell; and it ſometimes happens that they have all an equal claim to a preſent. After viſiting ſeveral of theſe cottages of different deſcriptions, we return home to dinner.</p>
                  <p>Some mornings we viſit the genteel and reſpectable neighbours, and then thoſe of the middling rank; for our friends' affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility has ſecured them the good-will of all.</p>
                  <p>I abſolutely think that, of every claſs of mankind, to be neither rich nor poor ought to be the moſt preferable, as it is certainly the ſituation wherein the human
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:030397_0093_0FE6C63536705EF0"/>mind is moſt capable of enjoyment. Theſe are the people, who, in general, know the ſtate of their finances, and the extent of their abilities. And though they cannot boaſt of ſplendid equipages or glittering liveries, yet they have enough to ſecure them from the inroads of poverty, or to prevent their being perpetually haraſſed by mercenary creditors. Neither extreme to corrode the peace of their boſoms, how thankfully happy ought they to be!—and yet, alas! how little gratitude is to be ſeen even among them!</p>
                  <p>We were a few evenings ſince at a concert of vocal and inſtrumental muſic; where, among a variety of other company, I obſerved two young ladies, who appeared to be ſiſters; and having a little phyſiogn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omical ſkill, I concluded their diſpoſitions were oppoſite. One of them, whom I ſuppoſed to be the eldeſt, was of a ſour, moroſe countenance; ſhe had a brow of contempt, a ſatirical grin, and a conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſmile. The other had an open coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which rather attracted admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:030397_0094_0FE6C6354AD715E0"/>My notice, however, was ſoon tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from them to the muſic; but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined when I returned, if poſſible, to make myſelf acquainted who they were.</p>
                  <p>When we are at home, if we have no company, our evenings are employed with the needle. Mr. Anſell ſometimes reads, of elſe we divert ourſelves with tales. I thought it therefore a favourable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to make my inquiries reſpecting the two young ladies I had ſeen at the concert, and of whom I had formed my opinion. Mr. Anſell thanked me for the honour I had done him; though he confeſſed it was rather an unpleaſing taſk to analyze living characters; but as he had a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal acquaintance with them, he would endeavour to be impartial in his ſketches. He continued thus:</p>
                  <p>"The names of the ladies you allude to, are Caroline and Sabina. They are daughters of a gentleman who died about fifteen years ago in the neighbourhood; their mother being previouſly dead. Their father was of a proud, imperious diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a deſpot to all who were neceſſitated to bend to his power; but their mother
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:030397_0095_0FE6C63D6320DFC8"/>was univerſally beloved and reſpected for her amiable manners.</p>
                  <p>"Caroline and Sabina were left or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, when the age of the eldeſt did not exceed five years, with a fortune of 10,000 <abbr>l.</abbr> each, under the direction of guardians. It was eaſy to diſcern even from infancy a contraſt in their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
                  <p>"They had an education ſuited to a ſuperior rank. All the polite accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that could poſſibly ornament the ſex, they were made acquainted with. But natural inclinations, unfortunately, too often are not to be governed by theſe. It is indeed poſſible for the mind that has received the poliſh of education, to be more eaſily convinced of error than the uncultivated; but it is frequently diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to regulate actions by moral impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. So it is with Sabina, whom you thought to be the eldeſt of the two, but who in fact is the youngeſt. With her exiſtence ſhe ſeems to have received the principles of her father; ſhe is vain enough to believe every one beneath her. It is true, ſhe has a fine perſon; but her
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:030397_0096_0FE6C63D711B2EA8"/>unhappy temper having habituated her to diſtort her features, that which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly ſtole on her from pride, will never, I fear, forſake her, till the cold hand of death ſhall diſplay its irreſiſtible power.</p>
                  <p>"If you happen to be in her company, ſhe is inceſſantly engroſſing the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to herſelf; her lap-dog is a favourite topic; and if you chance to be heedleſs of her frivolous chat, ſhe ſeels herſelf mortified; her countenance becomes the tranſcript of her mind; ſhe gives you a ſullen contemptuous look, and often will flirt out of the room.</p>
                  <p>"Sabina is now about nineteen years of age. She has had ſeveral admirers of her perſon; but as ſoon as they have penetrated a little into her mind, they feel themſelves diſguſted, and forſake her with ridicule. It is true, ſhe has had one gentleman, who would have made a ſacrifice of himſelf if ſhe had only accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. It was a happy diſappointment, could he have thought it ſo; but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuation which ſeizes ſome minds is ſo great, that though they were hang over
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:030397_0097_0FE6C63ECFCC6730"/>a dreadful precipice by the moſt brittle thread, yet would they be unconſcious of danger; they would convert fortunate events into unfortunate ones: in ſhort, nothing but direful circumſtances will awaken them from deluſion, and reſcue them from miſery.</p>
                  <p>"Sabina would often appoint to meet the young Alphonſo, and as often diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him; or, to mortify him ſtill more, ſhe would contrive to invite ſome other beau, with whom ſhe would be more familiar. At length his patience was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted; he ſaw no hope of ever attaining the ſummit of his wiſhes; deſpair and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation preyed upon his ſpirits, and a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at once big with horror and diſgrace haunted his imagination. He went one morning to a river, and threw himſelf in; but happily ſome labourers coming by whilſt he was in the ſtruggles of death, prevented the fatal ſtroke: he was to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance dead, but immediate recourſe being had to medical aſſiſtance he recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered.</p>
                  <p>"Sabina was informed of the event: but inſtead of being touched with Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo's
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:030397_0098_0FE6C63EE0E572A0"/>misfortunes, ſhe triumphed in her conſequence, that ſhe was capable of being the means of ſo much miſchief.</p>
                  <p>"Alphonſo, when he grew well, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his miſtake, and determined never to have any thing more to ſay to a woman, who could trifle with his affections, and expoſe him to inconceivable pangs. He now ſaw, that her heart was formed of too harſh materials ever to afford him any conſolation in the marriage ſtate. She was not the lovely woman his haſty imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination had formed her. No traits of del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icate ſentiment could he now diſcover in her mind. It is natural to ſuppoſe, that when he reflected on the recent circum ſtances of his life, his underſtanding muſt be ſhocked. When his frenzy however was ſubſided, and reaſon reſumed her ſeat in his heart, he again began to turn his thoughts to ſocial life, and made choice of an amiable young lady, who was every way qualified to render him happy.</p>
                  <p>"Sabina is now an object of pity and contempt. Even her ſervants are perpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually complaining of her unfeeling beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: ſhe treats them as though they
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:030397_0099_0FE6C64724E84DA0"/>were of the animal kind; and if ſhe thinks they are a moment happy and peaceable in themſelves, ſhe will haraſs them to ſuch a degree as to deprive them of the leaſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment. She never regards the entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the poor, nor turns an eye of pity to the afflicted. She is unhappy in her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor can ſhe communicate any thing but unhappineſs to thoſe around her. Her ambition is unbounded: ſhe envies her ſuperiors, and deſpiſes her inferiors. If it were not for the gentle Caroline, it is probable ſhe would be utterly forſaken by all. This is the character of Sabina; the lateneſs of hour obliges me to poſtpone that of Caroline till another evening."</p>
                  <p>I muſt follow Mr. Anſell, and break off for the preſent, reſerving the character of Caroline for my next. Mr. and Mrs. Anſell unite in kind love; I believe the latter will incloſe a few lines when I write again, to beg the favour of you to return this way to London. My mother alſo joins in love to Louiſa, with</p>

                        <p>THE following evening Mr. Anſell favoured us with his continuation of the contraſt.</p>
                        <p>"In the countenance of Caroline," ſaid he, "you may obſerve an open, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous and cheerful diſpoſition; from her infancy ſhe has been beloved by all—even the noble and the beggar unite in her praiſe. She does not, like Sabina, intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date with a frown, but engages by her amiable ſmiles. I cannot better deſcribe her character, than by deſcending into ſome of her more retired actions, to which I have been witneſs.</p>
                        <p>"I have ſeen her at aſſemblies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certs, where ſhe has univerſally attracted notice: it did not, however, elevate her above herſelf: ſhe preſerved a bewitching decorum.</p>
                        <p>"In her dreſs ſhe always diſcovers ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple elegance with taſte; in her manners,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:030397_0101_0FE6C64873C7A938"/>ſhe has eaſe unaccompanied with diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freedom; and in her converſation ſhe betrays no affected airs, but pleaſes without the leaſt oftentation. With ſuch qualifications, you may ſuppoſe that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oline poſſeſſes the admiration of every one.</p>
                        <p>"Her purſe is ever ready to aſſiſt the poor; and ſhe takes a delight in retiring at intervals from the more buſy and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating ſcenes of life, to viſit the houſes of poverty and the beds of affliction.</p>
                        <p>"I once met her at the hut of ſome poor old decrepit people, who were hardly able to ſupport their exiſtence, owing to pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, age, and infirmity. She hearkens to their tales of diſtreſs; and I have ſeen the commiſerating tear of ſympathy trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down her cheek, while ſhe bold forth her beneficent hand to relieve their wants.</p>
                        <p>"I aſked her, if ſhe was not afraid of venturing to viſit thoſe decayed houſes, as well from their antiquity, as from the danger of catching diſorders? to which ſhe replied,</p>
                        <p>'Shall I be afraid to viſit my fellow mortals, who are formed of the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials with myſelf? No: I am too well
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:030397_0102_0FE6C64886E58890"/>perſuaded that the cauſe of humanity is the cauſe of God. Were every one to fly from the beds of the afflicted, what would finally become of the whole human race? Can I live in affluence, and ſee the poor dying with hunger? Can I ſee them linger to their exit, unregarded like brutes, and not turn an eye of pity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them? No: humanity forbids it, my feelings would upbraid me, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would condemn me for not being more attentive to its dictates.'</p>
                        <p>"A ſingular inſtance has lately come to my knowledge, which eminently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes Caroline's compaſſionate ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. A poor man came from a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring pariſh to that in which ſhe lives, becauſe it was more contiguous to his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. He brought with him his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which conſiſted of his wife and three children, and provided a ſmall houſe (or rather hovel) for their reception. They lived in the greateſt harmony and affection, and ſupported themſelves as comfortably as it was poſſible, out of the little pittance from their joint labour, which ſeldom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ten ſhillings a week. The family
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:030397_0103_0FE6C64F560B4B98"/>was increaſing; the poor woman was very far advanced in pregnancy. Of this the overſeers had information; and fearing they would become burthenſome to the pariſh, came and perſecuted them in the moſt unjuſtifiable manner—contrary to every ſentiment of humanity, and in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the ſacred principles of relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; and inſiſted on their leaving the pariſh in four days.</p>
                        <p>"As their little manſion was not of conſequence enough to conſtitute them pariſhioners, they had no other choice than to leave the pariſh quietly, or to be forcibly dragged like ſlaves or criminals in a cart.</p>
                        <p>"The good man endeavoured to get his former habitation again, but it had been newly occupied ſince he had left it; nor could he meet with a place to ſhelter himſelf and family from the weather, in his native pariſh. Theſe unfortunate cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances had ſo great an effect on the mind of his wife, that it brought on a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature labour, and had nearly been the means of depriving her helpleſs infants of a mother's care.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="106" facs="unknown:030397_0104_0FE6C64F64905618"/>
"The amiable Caroline, hearing of the diſaſters which had happened to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious family, fled immediately to their aſſiſtance. She inquired into the partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulars; and finding the overſeers were the inſtruments of their miſery, hurried away to them. She charged them in the moſt delicate manner with inhumanity, painted the diſtreſs in which they had involved the poor victims of their diſpleaſure, and rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robated their conduct in the moſt ſevere manner. She told them, that from their induſtry; there was no proſpect of their becoming burthenſome; and that ſuch a circumſtance ought to have had a little more weight on their minds, and to have encouraged them to lenity.</p>
                        <p>"By the feeling manner with which ſhe ſpoke, ſhe convinced them that they had done wrong, and they promiſed to permit the poor creatures to remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleſted till the woman was recovered. Caroline diſdained their terms, and told them ſhe would become their ſecurity.</p>
                        <p>"She fled again to the diſtreſſed family, and left them a little money, that they might provide what neceſſary comforts
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:030397_0105_0FE6C6519461FCB0"/>the poor woman ſtood in need of; then haſtened home, and ſent ſome food for the helpleſs babes. As ſoon as they were recovered from this melancholy affliction, Caroline ſought a better employment for them. She put them in a ſmall ſhop, and collected a ſum of money; to which ſhe added a loan of twenty pounds, which they were to repay if they ſucceeded. With theſe helps they purchaſed a ſtock of goods in the grocery line; from which they had a comfortable ſubſiſtence, and were ſoon enabled to pay the loan of their kind benefactreſs.</p>
                        <p>"Their houſe now conſtituted them pariſhioners; and inſtead of becoming a burthen themſelves, they contributed to the ſupport of thoſe who were already burthenſome. Proſperity attended them in all their undertakings—and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to manifeſt gratitude and affection to the perſon who was the inſtrument of raiſing them from indigence to comfort.</p>
                        <p>"Thus we have reaſon to believe, that many poor creatures who are now ſtarving with poverty and oppreſſion, many who are treated with deriſion and contempt
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:030397_0106_0FE6C651A31EB130"/>by thoſe who are a ſtep or two above them, if the ſmiles of fortune and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence attended them, would move in a ſphere very different from that in which they now are, and would become ſhining ornaments to ſociety.</p>
                        <p>"To the benevolence of Caroline may be added her diſtinguiſhed piety. How amiable does a character appear when ornamented with theſe united graces! Where the human mind is thoroughly impreſſed with the latter, it will produce eminent inſtances of the former; for I maintain, that religion is no more religion, than while it influences to feeling, and charity to fellow creatures in diſtreſs.</p>
                        <p>"I think, ladies, you will ſhare an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of veneration and affection while I relate an inſtance of Caroline's benevolent piety.</p>
                        <p>"I was entering the houſe of an old woman, who lived about half a mile from ours, was univerſally reſpected for her exemplary conduct, and was indebted for her ſubſiſtence to the generoſity of thoſe around her; where I heard the echo of a female voice. I had previouſly been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:030397_0107_0FE6C65A194F33C8"/>the poor woman was near her end, and made it my buſineſs to go and inquire.</p>
                        <p>"When I opened the door of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed apartment, I found the lovely Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oline in the exerciſe of prayer. Ah, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought I could have continued days and weeks a ſpectator of ſuch devotion; and I think I ſhall ever remember a ſentence or two which dropped from her lips.</p>
                        <p>'— O thou Eternal Father of the wide Univerſe! thou Supreme Judge and Everlaſting King! who reigneſt through the vaſt expanſe of eternal ages—who canſt call millions and millions of angels to manifeſt thine unparalleled ſplendor at the twinkling of an eye!—Thou to whom kings muſt yield obedience, and princes bow their knees!—Thou, who had the command of univerſal empire, canſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of kingdoms at thy pleaſure, and art not to be controlled by the wiſdom of ſenators!—ſhall we dare to approach thy celeſtial Majeſty? ſhall we dare to celebrate thy praiſe with our feeble tongues, or to aſk a bleſſing at thy hands? Is it poſſible that thou, who canſt ſcarcely behold pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the inhabitants of heaven, ſhouldſt
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:030397_0108_0FE6C65A2742CBE8"/>condeſcend to the infirmities of mortality? Yes, Lord, thou haſt ſaid it! The rich and the poor are equal in thine eſtimation—Oh! do thou look down on thy poor worm, teach her to be reſigned to thy wiſdom, animate her ſoul with ſublime proſpects, and, whether ſhe lives or dies, may ſhe be happy, &amp;c.—'</p>
                        <p>"The poor afflicted woman heard her with ſilent ecſtacy—her ſoul ſeemed to be carried to the ſummit of glorious immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, contemplating the goodneſs of God, and cheerful in the hope of happineſs. She took Caroline's hand, and bathed it with grateful tears—acknowledged the many favours ſhe had received, and expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed while ſhe was uttering her bleſſing.</p>
                        <p>"To ſervants, Caroline is kind and gentle. They all ſeem pleaſed when ſhe is happy, and affected if ſhe is otherwiſe. What a contraſt in the characters of the two ſiſters! One is hated and rejected for her pride—the other beloved and courted for her condeſcenſion, affability and kindneſs.</p>
                        <p>"Caroline is now admired by a young gentleman of conſiderable property. He
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:030397_0109_0FE6C65B4ED61498"/>is delighted with her charms, and promiſes a great addition to her happineſs. I have given them both, together with Sabina, an invitation to our houſe to ſpend the evening, early in next week; you will then, ladies, be able to form your own opinion of them."</p>
                        <p>Here Mr. Anſell finiſhed his deſcription of the young ladies. I believe I ſhall wait till I have a perſonal interview with them, before I ſend you theſe lines. I ſhall then, perhaps, give you a further account.</p>

                        <p>Caroline and Sabina, and the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who admires the former, have been with us; we have ſpent a very agreeable evening together, owing to the polite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of Mr. Milward and the pleaſing manner of Caroline. Of Sabina I muſt ſuſpend my judgment, allowing the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:030397_0110_0FE6C65B5D818EF0"/>which Mr. Anſell has already drawn to be nearly perfect.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Milward is a man of conſiderable abilities, and, I think, a very ſuitable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion for the amiable Caroline: integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is the characteriſtic of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. An unity of ſpirits plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; and ſurely thoſe who are thus united in the ſacred bonds of affection, will be happy and bleſſed in bonds which are of a civil nature. They parted with us about eleven o'clock; and if we live, we are to return the viſit ſoon.</p>

Mr. and Mrs. Anſell are returned. Gloom is painted in every feature. We all drop tears, thoſe ſilent tokens of grief, at their recital. Oh! Louiſa, your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception will be deficient for the ſcene. My pen is inadequate to the taſk.</p>
                  <p>"At intervals (ſaid Mrs. Anſell) Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oline was perfectly ſenſible. She called for her beloved Milward; and when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, ſhe preſſed his hand, and begged him to be compoſed; and when ſhe ſaw the agonies of his mind, ſhe continued:</p>
                  <p>'My deareſt Friend, I have, perhaps, too much indulged myſelf with the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hopes of being happy in your affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but 'tis now time to bid adieu to theſe faſcinating charms. I am perſuaded it cannot be long ere I leave you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to yonder world: but till I ſee you calm, I cannot yield to the fatal ſtroke with Chriſtian dignity. Do not diſturb my laſt moments. I carry my affection for you to the grave; and I hope to unite with you where we can never part. The eternal goodneſs of God decreed this ſeeming calamity for wiſe and better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. It is our duty mutually to ſubmit
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:030397_0113_0FE6C66602CF8738"/>without a murmur to the great demands of Omnipotence. 'Tis he that gave, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lent us life: he has a right to diſpoſe of us as he pleaſes, and a claim to our implicit obedience. Be virtuous, my dear Milward! Let piety diſtinguiſh your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Remember, that virtue will have its own reward. You will feel thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations in the hour of departure, which can be derived from no other ſource. Let the poor be objects of your concern: ſuccour them in their diſtreſs, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to abate their oppreſſions.'</p>
                  <p>"She again preſſed his hand; and while they were exchanging the parting kiſs, ſhe faintly articulated,</p>
                  <p>'Farewel! Be comforted, and aſſure yourſelf you will find many friends; I hope, ſome too who will be able to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate your ſorrows, and ſupply your loſs. Adieu!'</p>
                  <p>Mr. Milward was too much agitated to make any reply. We perceived it was more than his ſpirits could ſupport. He was accordingly prevailed on by Mr. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to leave the room. When he came to the door, he looked back, and then
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:030397_0114_0FE6C6661208DDF8"/>haſtened again to her bed-ſide. He gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fearful eyes on the expiring object of his faithful love—ſtole a few more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der embraces, and retired with reluctance from her preſence. How heart-rending was this ſcene! Before he had reached another apartment in the houſe, he ſighed with violence, and then gave vent to his grief by fainting away. In this inſenſible ſtate he remained a conſiderable time. Surely this was unaffected ſorrow!</p>
                  <p>The dying Caroline took an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate leave of thoſe around her: ſhe ſpoke tenderly to her ſiſter—and when ſhe had recommended us all to the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful kindneſs of that God in whom ſhe had repeatedly truſted, ſhe became a lifeleſs corſe, and fled beyond pain or ſorrow. Thus ended the days of an amiable young woman, one who lived as ſhe died—pious in her life, and reſigned in her death—univerſally beloved, and as univerſally ſorrowed after.</p>
                  <p>"The village is already become a ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of diſtreſs. Countenances which were once lively, betray inward dejection. Every aged furrow enfolds bitter anguiſh.
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:030397_0115_0FE6C66F869B5478"/>Thoſe who have enjoyed the ſweets of her friendſhip, and thoſe who have ſhared her beneficence, are drooping with deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. The tears which have fallen on this occaſion have ſpread a dimneſs on the eyes of all, inſomuch that the beauties of ſpring have no charms—the fields are become diſcoloured. The tuneful birds ſeem to have forgot their cheerful notes—nor have all the united ſcenes of nature enough to lull the aching hearts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe" Here Mrs. Anſell ceaſed.</p>
                  <p>Thus, Louiſa, I have been faithful in penning, as far as my recollection will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, the whole of this affecting event. A young woman in the bloom of life, animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a proſpect of a happy connexion, is of a ſudden taken off, and the hapleſs lover deprived of the pleaſures he ſo fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſought after. But there is a conſolation left; ſhe was prepared for either life or death. In both ſhe evinced her virtue and her piety; and I think thoſe only who are fit to live, can be fit to die. It ſhould teach us never to be too anxiouſly concerned for the things of time. Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:030397_0116_0FE6C66F94996C18"/>and adverſity are alike fluctuating. Virtue itſelf cannot boaſt of a power to reſiſt the cold impulſe of death; and vice is too feeble to fly from its impreſs. Youth is not ſuperior to age: each muſt ſubmit, each muſt die.</p>
                  <p>I need not ſay more to excite your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility. Already fancy has painted Louiſa bedewing my letter with tears while ſhe reads the melancholy tale: indeed we have all ſought relief by this means. Mrs. Anſell intends writing a few lines to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, according to her promiſe; but it will be by way of poſtſcript to what I have already written: for the preſent, they both join with my mother in kind reſpects to your father, and love to yourſelf.</p>

                     <p>Mrs. Anſell's compliments to Miſs Louiſa Hartley, and begs ſhe will excuſe her from writing a formal epiſtle. The diſagreeable circumſtances which Matilda has already related, ſhe hopes will be a ſufficient plea. Mrs. Anſell, however, has
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:030397_0117_0FE6C670D534ECB0"/>been highly delighted with Matilda's deſcription of her friend—for which reaſon ſhe wiſhes to be perſonally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted; and has therefore added this poſtſcript, to requeſt the favour of Louiſa and her father to extend their journey into Hampſhire, before they return to the metropolis. Should it be convenient for them to honour this requeſt, Matilda, and perhaps Mr. and Mrs. Anſell, will then accompany them.</p>

Our ſtay there is uncertain. I muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beg leave to decline informing you when we ſhall arrive at your houſe; but perhaps when I write to Louiſa I may be better able to acquaint you.

                  <p>SINCE I received your laſt, we have thought proper to viſit this place: the variegated hue which Spring affords, invited us to partake of her ſweets by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending our travels.</p>
                  <p>But ere I go farther, I ſhould inform you, that ſince I wrote to Mrs. Anſell, I have laid her kind invitation before my father, and preſſed him to accept of it, as
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:030397_0120_0FE6C6755E59F178"/>it would add conſiderably to my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to be favoured with the friendſhip and ſociety of one whom you have traced through every circumſtance of her life, and in whom you have diſcovered ſuch amiable qualities. Her actions have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy excited liberal opinions, and endeared her to all; and need not the feeble pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric of my pen to enhance her merit. In addition to my father's compliments, be ſo obliging as to preſent my love, and tell her we ſhall be at her houſe in about one month. It is our united requeſt, that there may be no kind of ceremony in our reception, as we prefer friendly interviews to the modern inconveniences which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend viſiting.</p>
                  <p>I cannot paſs over the tale of Caroline and Sabina in ſilence; and yet it were almoſt ſuperfluous to ſay more than that it has entirely engaged all my ſpeculative faculties. I have, indeed, bedewed your lines with my tears; and I think the wiſe concluſion of that ancient philoſopher Plato, has been thoroughly verified in my feelings—<hi>that one extreme ſucceeds another.</hi> I felt diſguſt at the character of Sabina,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:030397_0121_0FE6C678DE6547D0"/>but it ſubſided in pity. All the pleaſing enthuſiaſm of joy and friendſhip employed my mind, whilſt I contemplated the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Caroline;—but, alas! theſe were ſoon ſwallowed up in the moſt exceſſive grief. I have raiſed a monument in my heart to her memory—I have venerated a mind that was every way lovely—I have ſighed at her diſſolution—I have rejoiced at her happy exchange.</p>
                  <p>But will not thoſe who have been bleſt with her ſociety, and admired the beauties of her mind, erect a marble pile to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate her virtues as an example to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages? Yes, ſurely they will; and I would gladly contribute to ſo noble a purpoſe. Ah! as I paſſed by the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpot wherein were depoſited the ſacred remains of this valuable woman, ſympathy would ſteal the ſilent drop from my eyes; my ſoul would be ſuſpended in thought —I would ſeat myſelf near her tomb, and methinks I ſhould contemplate thus:</p>

                     <l>Thou'rt fled to joys above;</l>

                  <p>I could dwell a long time on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but I muſt forbear, to inform you of our journey. Perhaps a little variety will engage your heart, and help to diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate your ſorrows.</p>
                  <p>You will naturally imagine that I viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited all the public places in Bath, before I left it. Yes, Matilda, I did ſo; but more from curioſity than inclination. I
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:030397_0123_0FE6C681B40BC6B8"/>muſt however acknowledge, that its amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſcarcely to be equaled even in London. The ball and concert rooms are elegant indeed; and when they are ornamented by ſuch crouds of beauties ſo richly attired, as are ſometimes to be ſeen, one cannot help being charmed at the ſight. The play-houſe is neat. In ſhort, the city is compoſed of magnificent buildings, ſquares, and creſcents. Your laſt letter overſhadowed my mind with ſuch gloom, that it deprived me of every reliſh for thoſe ſocial enjoyments. When I ſee young folks regardleſs of every thing but gaiety and diſſipation, I feel a kind of pity for them. I do not wiſh to deprive them of rational pleaſures—no; I believe them innocent; but I want them to diveſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of pride—to conſider they are but creatures—creatures of a day—and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of a moment—that in the midſt of deluſive joys they are expoſed to death.</p>
                  <p>The human mind wants relaxation; but having once taſted fancied delights, it can ſeldom be ſatisfied, and exceſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes dangerous. I think parents ſhould lay a little more reſtraint on their children,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:030397_0124_0FE6C681C660F710"/>than to ſuffer them to frequent balls. There are perhaps no amuſements more calculated to do miſchief than thoſe of dancing. The young females are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with beaux who delight in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation, and who ſcarce ever feel a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or a generous ſentiment; but exult in deſtroying the peace of thoſe who fall victims to their villany. In the exerciſe I allude to, the body is warmed, the heart is elated, and the imaginations are heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the conſequence of which is, the ſtripling hero takes advantages of thoſe delirious moments—he ogles and he ſighs, and the ſilly girl hearkens implicitly to his tale. If ſhe eſcapes the worſer evil, ſhe afterwards feels herſelf unable to reſiſt the powerful impulſe of love—ſhe flies from civil intercourſe—ſhe lingers and dies. A young married gentleman with whom my father is intimate, related the following anecdote:</p>
                  <p>"When I once," ſaid he, "returned to London in one of the ſtage coaches, the company conſiſted of two young ladies, a gentleman, and myſelf. The gentleman was one of thoſe vulgar beings which ſeem
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:030397_0125_0FE6C6831F8B68B0"/>to be formed to make a variety on the theatre of the world: he uttered but few ſpeeches, and thoſe of a courſer ſort, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the journey, but ſat heedleſs of himſelf or his company. One of the ladies was young; ſhe was not handſome, but had ſomething attracting in her countenance: the other (who was of ſuperior age, and ſeemed to be a friendly companion) call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Maria.</p>
                  <p>"Maria entered the coach with reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: ſhe wept bitterly; nor could the kind entreaties of the other lady prevail on her to be compoſed. I ſat oppoſite to her; and before we had left the city ſhe became ſenſeleſs. I leaned forward and ſupported her. In this ſituation ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſome miles. When ſhe awoke, ſhe aſked pardon for the trouble ſhe had given me. I endeavoured to cheer her ſpirits by converſation, but ſhe was too much dejected.</p>
                  <p>"As we paſſed by ſome decayed houſes, ſhe looked out at the window, and ſighed. 'Ah!' ſaid Maria, 'could I but inhabit one of thoſe lonely cottages, how happy ſhould I be! I would gladly exchange ſituations.
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:030397_0126_0FE6C6832E4542B8"/>The rays of contentment ſpread their genial ſweets—there their days of poverty are not embittered with pride. Ambition is bounded by manual employments!—I am unhappy!'—To which I replied:</p>
                  <p>'If you knew, Madam, the hardſhips which poverty expoſes them to, you would be led to different concluſions. The poor think, if they were rich, ſorrow and pain would forſake them; but they, perhaps, are equally miſtaken with yourſelf. Every rank in ſociety is properly filled: thoſe who are now poor, would make but an indifferent figure in a higher ſphere; and <hi>you</hi> would find it a difficult taſk to ſupport oppreſſion and want.'</p>
                  <p>"But they are contented," ſaid ſhe.</p>
                  <p>'Contentment is equally attainable in every rank. Neither riches nor poverty can conſtitute the invaluable prize: but the mind that can confine itſelf within its own bounds is ſure to be in poſſeſſion of it. If you ſought through the whole ſyſtem of creation, you would find that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had diſpenſed his bleſſings alike. Every one has an inward ſource of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The rich ſhould feel thankful for
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:030397_0127_0FE6C68C1DECA118"/>their meaſure of comforts; the poor be grateful that it is not worſe with them.'</p>
                  <p>"Maria's heart was too much agitated to continue the converſation—ſhe again became convulſed, and continued in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate fits till we reached our journey's end. I inquired of the other lady the cauſe of her diſorder, and found that ſhe had been ſome time poorly, and that her parents had permitted her to go to Bath, in compliance with the phyſician's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, for the benefit of the waters. When ſhe grew better, ſhe frequented the public places of amuſement, and happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to dance with a handſome young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whoſe genteel deportment engaged her affections: but finding that her charms had not made the tender impreſſion ſhe wiſhed on his heart, ſhe ſuddenly gave way to melancholy. Her father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hearing that the waters had reſtored her (though ignorant of the other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) requeſted her to return. In obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their injunctions ſhe complied; but the idea of leaving the object of her love behind had this ſtrange effect on her mind, and I fear will produce a fatal concluſion."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="130" facs="unknown:030397_0128_0FE6C68C2BE0F8A0"/>
I will not inſiſt more on the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of expoſing the credulous girl to temptation; this inſtance will perhaps more readily convince, than all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of rhetoric.</p>
                  <p>We left Bath in the morning, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Wells early enough for dinner. My father's curioſity leads him to inſpect every venerable pile he paſſes by. For my own part, I am at preſent engaged too much in ſentiment to attend to theſe things.</p>
                  <p>My father viſited the Cathedral; after which we purſued our journey till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came late, and then repoſed at an inn on the road. In the morning we ſet forward again, and reached the town of Dorſet to dinner.</p>
                  <p>At the entrance of this town is a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and ſpacious lawn, where are a vaſt number of ſheep continually feeding. I think it an excellent ſpot for the pencil of an artiſt; and if I had time, I ſhould certainly employ my own pencil.</p>
                  <p>In the afternoon, after two hours' ride, we approached Weymouth. We have a view of the rolling waves ſome miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:030397_0129_0FE6C68D42468CD0"/>we enter the town. The place is ſo much expoſed to the wind, that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſely cold; and I hope our ſtay will be ſhort. I ſhall be more ready to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate at a perſonal interview. Believe me, Matilda, I want to ſee you after ſo long an abſence. Our affections, I believe, ſtill ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt uncontaminated under all the changes of life. I ſhall not have an opportunity of writing to you again before we meet; therefore this letter will cloſe my correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence till we ſhall experience another ſeparation. Your engagements are not urgent; I muſt beg you to ſend me a few more lines, and entreat you will not deny my requeſt. Adieu.</p>

                  <p>A MONUMENT to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of Caroline is ſhortly to be erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at the ſole expenſe of her faithful Milward. He thinks it the leaſt tribute he can pay her. It is to be of entire mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the workmen are buſily employed about it. A croſs is to be ſupported by a pillar on each ſide, which are to aſcend from beautiful pedeſtals. There are to be ſeveral emblematical figures, which will render it ſuperbly rich.</p>
                  <p>I have ſhewn your lines to Mr. Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; he is ſo highly pleaſed with them, that he ſays they ſhall follow the epitaph, which runs thus:
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:030397_0131_0FE6C69408651BE0"/>
                     <q>Stop, Stranger—pauſe awhile, And read The following Lines: Not Far from hence, Secure from human view, In Yonder ſilent Vault, Where cares or troubles never enter; Where ſoft repoſe is ne'er diſturb'd, Nor human ills inrade; In yonder dark Retreat, In yonder ſolitary Cave, Lies unmoleſted CAROLINE. Her frame lies mouldering there; But ah! her happy ſpirit's gone to bleſſedneſs. Peace ſits ſmiling on her Heavenly brow, And Love celeſtial brightens every feature. The village mourn'd her death; It felt the loſs Of Virtue and Benevolence like hers. Her hapleſs Swain Bore all the agonies of grief; The rais'd this Marble Monument, To tell the gazing throng That Virtue never dies, And Bid the world be virtuous. LINES BY A LADY. There reſt in peace, thou lovely maid! &amp;c.</q>

Thus, Louiſa, your wiſhes will be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally fulfilled. You will pardon me for giving up your lines; I am perſuaded your vanity will not be too much flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. It was the requeſt of the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Milward,</p>
                  <p>I have another ſecret to unfold. Mrs. Anſell has ſeen the whole of our letters ſince our laſt ſeparation. She is inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teazing me to give her copies of them, and wiſhes me to ſubmit them to public view. She thinks the young will be amuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without the danger of having their morals corrupted. I have at length yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her entreaties, before I have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your conſent. I know you cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it, particularly as Mrs. Anſell has promiſed to conceal our real ſignatures, and adopt others; and the peruſal of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine letters of friendſhip, may perhaps be of ſervice to many young people.</p>
                  <p>Before I cloſe this correſpondence, give me leave to ſay, I have caſt my eyes round my own little circle, and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion leads me to conclude that life has its difficulties as well as its pleaſures. We ought to be prepared to meet viciſſitudes
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:030397_0133_0FE6C6965596DEE8"/>with compoſure; and if we eſcape the woes of the unfortunate, let us not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to their ſighs. The brighteſt genius, or the moſt exalted character, will never be diſgraced by ſenſibility. We are all fond of pity in misfortune, and ſhall we deny the troubled ſoul that ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetic tenderneſs we ſhould conſider an hardſhip to be deprived of ourſelves?</p>
                  <p>I anticipate our happy meeting; but I fear to be too anxious, leſt our pleaſures ſhould be marred by ſome unpleaſing oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence. I need not beg Louiſa to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue he affectionate regard for</p>
