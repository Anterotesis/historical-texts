            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>AS the following pages may poſſibly be read by perſons who are unacquainted with the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its of the tranſactions, therein alluded to, which have occurred at Norwich, in the State of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, it may not be amiſs to give a brief ſtatement of the ſame. It is generally known that ſince the commencement of the preſent war in Europe, the trade of America has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended beyond any former example. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of trade has occaſioned a great demand
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:034537_0003_0FFDC6F9445FE368"/>
for money; and although many Banks have been eſtabliſhed, in different parts of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, their funds have not been ſufficient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the demands of the Merchants. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this deficiency, recourſe has been had to rich individuals, who, thinking their money, like merchandiſe, ſhould bear a price in proportion to the demand for it, have, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, purchaſed Notes and Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, at 3, 4 and 5 per cent per month diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, in the large towns, ſuch as Philadelphia, New-York and Boſton. This practice has, on a ſmaller ſcale, extended to ſome of the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable places, and, among the reſt, to Norwich; where notes have, it ſeems, been purchaſed at a diſcount of 2 per cent per month. This deſperate ſituation of money affairs has alarmed ſome of the <hi>good</hi> citizens of Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut to a very conſiderable degree; inſomuch that at Norwich, and, I am informed, at anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er place in Hartford County, (the only places in the United States, or in the world, I believe, that ever poſſeſſed ſuch worthy guardians of the publick weal,) ſocieties have been formed to cruſh this alarming evil, as it is called, by means of the Statute againſt Uſury. The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:034537_0004_0FFE2013AA864AA0"/>
at Norwich is headed by a Mr. Eli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Hyde, an Attorney, whoſe common Informer is a perſon of the name of Cyrus Biſhop. The Deputy Informers of the Society are a Mr.—Ames, (not the honourable Mr. Ames, Reader,) Mr. Biſſel, Mr. Daviſon, &amp;c. There are ſeveral perſons belonging to the Society whoſe names I do not know; but I am told they are people who are not of a deſcription to have much to do with either buying or ſelling of Notes: This circumſtance, however, proves them to be the moſt proper men in the world for the buſineſs they have engaged in; they being perfectly diſintereſted—for although they laid informations, againſt different gentlemen, to the amount of about four thouſand Dollars, one half of which was to come to them, if they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, they meant to pocket their own two thouſand Dollars, merely for the publick good.</p>
            <p>ONE of theſe cauſes came to a hearing before the City Court in the month of January laſt. It was then contended by the Counſel for the Defendant, that the action was brought before a wrong Court, the City not having authority to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y cauſes of that nature. The members of
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:034537_0005_0FFE1FCE29077AA0"/>
the City Court, actuated no doubt by the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt motives, decided that they were competent to try this cauſe: but from their deciſion the Defendent appealed to the Superior Court. In March laſt the Superior Court ſat at Norwich, and the Judges decided that the City Court had no juriſdiction of the cauſe, it being the province of the County Court to try it. This determination of the Judges of courſe annulled all the writs that had been iſſued by Mr. Hyde, who had to pay coſts and begin <hi>de novo.</hi> But with what muſcles ſhall I relate the cataſtrophe of this great affair! When Mr. Hyde's new writs arrived, (the morrow after this determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Judges,) it was diſcovered that the Defendants had all been ſupplied with oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er writs the evening before! and the worſt part of the buſineſs is, there is great room to ſuſpect that ſome of their friends have ſtepped in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Society, and demanded the 4000 Dollars in queſtion. I hear that on this occaſion the ſurpriſe and diſmay of Mr. Biſhop was equal to that of Parſon Adams, when he fell from his imaginary throne into a Tub of Water. Nor was that of Mr. Hyde exceeded, when the weighty hand of Mr. Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geu fell, like thunder, on the table of the
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:034537_0006_0FFE20168CD20350"/>
Houſe of Repreſentatives, and he ſaid "Sit down Mr. Hyde."</p>
            <p>SUCH is the preſent ſtate of the buſineſs. What will be the final iſſue of it is more than I can determine. I ſhall however proceed to enquire what the end of it ought to be.</p>

            <head>CURSORY REMARKS, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE attention of the people of America, from ſome of the beſt to the baſeſt, from the Governor and Legiſlature of New-York, to the Connecticut Societies, having lately been turned, in a conſiderable degree, to the ſubject of Uſury, it has been a matter of ſome ſurpriſe to me to obſerve, that no one has undertaken a thorough inveſtigation of the principles of Uſury laws. In order to promote inquiry on the ſubject, I ſhall take leave to offer a few cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory remarks relative to it, in hopes that ſome perſon poſſeſſing better information, may be
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034537_0008_0FFE1FD54A670A48"/>
induced to produce a more perfect work. I conceive that the beſt manner of treating the queſtion will be 1ſt, To give a brief hiſtory of the laws reſpecting Uſury. 2. To conſider them in their relation to Religion. 3. To take a view of their Moral tendency. 4. To examine the juſtice of them. 5. To inquire into the neceſſity for them. 6. To make a few remarks on their political tendency; And, 7. To compare the proceedings of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich Society with the law.</p>

            </head>
            <p>LAWS againſt Uſury have been made in many countries. Probably that of Moſes (Deut. xxiii. 19, 20,) was one of the firſt. The Intereſt of Money was fixed at 12 <hi>per cent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um per annum,</hi> by the Roman Decemvirs, and that law exiſted till the time of Juſtinian. The character of Juſtinian exhibited the paradoxical

extremes of avarice and profuſion. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of his finances was ſuch as would hardly admit of being remedied; but in order to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, he reduced the Intereſt of money to 4 <hi>per cent. per ann.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>THE Inſtitutes, Pandects and Code of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian have been the Scriptures from which the Engliſh Civilians have drawn their legal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. From them they probably got the idea of laws againſt Uſury. In England there was very little trade before the ſixteenth century, and, conſequently there was not much money in circulation. Scarcity of money always has a tendency to raiſe the Intereſt of it; ſuch at leaſt was the caſe in England; for from the time of Edward 3d, to that of Henry 7th, and indeed for ſeveral centuries, the Jews and Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards, who had money to lend to the Barons, and others, on perſonal ſecurity, could make
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034537_0010_0FFE1FD6D246F480"/>
from 45 to 50 per cent. for if. Henry the 8th was an avaricious man who wanted to borrow money cheap, and as he could oblige the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to do juſt what he pleaſed, he got a law paſſed<note n="*" place="bottom">37 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> to fix the rate of Intereſt at 10 per cent. This was the firſt Engliſh Uſury law, and this law was repealed by the Parliament of Edward 6th, which declared the law itſelf to be "unlawful, and moſt impious." The Statute of Henry, was, however renewed by Elizabeth (13. c. 8.) who had it declared, in the pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Act of Parliament, that Uſury was forbidden by the law of God, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was unlawful. James 1ſt, (c. 17) reduced the intereſts of money to 8 per cent, and the Rump Parliament lowered it to 6 per cent. This rate of intereſt was fixed in New-England, and, I ſuppoſe has continued ſo ever ſince; a law of the Rump Parliament, having been conſidered as of equal authority with both law and goſpel, by many of the firſt ſettlers of Maſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. That act of the Rump Parliament was confirmed by Charles 2d. (c. 13) who wanted large ſums of money to ſupport the licentiouſ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Indeed endeavoured to reduce the rate of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtill lower, and employed Sir Thomas Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pepper, and others, to publiſh pamphlets on the ſubject; but the parliaments of thoſe times were not ſo manageable as ſome which had met before. Anne carried on a very expenſive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental war, and in order to raiſe money on better terms, the parliament paſſed a law (12 Ann. St. 2. c. 16.) which fixed legal intereſt at 5 per cent. and enacted that whoever took more ſhould forfeit treble the money borrowed. That ſtatute, although ſo groſsly unjuſt, is now in force in England, but almoſt the only purpoſe it anſwers is to diſtreſs ſuch people as cannot give good ſecurity, by putting it out of their power to borrow money. The Uſury laws in England have been made ſometimes under a pretence of religion, but in reality they have always been made with a view to enable the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to get as much money as poſſible from the people, on the cheapeſt terms. The govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment however cannot now borrow money at 5 per cent. or any thing like it. The miniſter cannot get more than about £ 45 for £ 100 of 3 per cent Annuities, and the Navy, Victualling and Tranſport Bills, &amp;c. are at ſuch a diſcount as makes the intereſt on them equal to about
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:034537_0012_0FFE1FD85746F430"/>
15 per cent. The mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed men in England prefer government ſecurity to any other, and as much more than legal intereſt can be got for that ſecurity, perſons in trade who often want to borrow money, cannot now get any for the paltry conſideration <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 5 per cent; they are therefore obliged to go without money, as a larger intereſt cannot be taken with ſafety. This ſtate of things has made the money-bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers clamorous for a repeal of the Uſury Laws, and if the government can find reſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by forced loans, or any better method than borrowing, thoſe laws will doubtleſs be repealed.</p>

This opinion is taken from the law of Moſes, (Deut. xxiii. 19, 20.) which ſays, <hi>Thou ſhalt not lend upon uſury to thy brother; uſury of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, uſury of victuals, uſury of any thing that is lent upon uſury. Unto a ſtranger thou mayeſt lend upon uſury, but unto thy brother thou ſhalt not lend upon uſury.</hi> Now, whatever Chriſtian carefully examines this paſſage, he will find that the law was not intended for any other people than the Jews; it was to bind them in their tranſactions between each other only, but like the reſt of their laws and ceremonies, was not extended to either Heathens or Chriſtians, and even a Jew was allowed to take uſury of any perſon who was not a Jew. Religious men may, however, be diſpoſed to heſitate about be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving me on this occaſion; I will therefore produce the authority of the learned and Rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erend Archdeacon Paley, who was as religious as the beſt of them.

               <p>THE ſcruples that have been entertained upon this head, and upon the foundation of which the receiving of Intereſt or Uſury (for they formerly meant the ſame thing) was once prohibited in almoſt all Chriſtian coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, aroſe from a paſſage of the law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Deut. xxiii. 19, 20.<note n="*" place="bottom">Quoted above.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THIS prohibition is now generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to have been intended for the Jews a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, as part of the political or civil law of that nation, and calculated to preſerve amongſt themſelves that diſtribution of property, to which many of their laws were ſubſervient; as the marriage of an heireſs within her own Tribe; of a widow who was left childleſs to her huſbands brother; the year of Jubilee, when alienated eſtates reverted to the family of the original proprietor—regulations which were never thought to be binding upon any but the commonwealth of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>THIS interpretation is confirmed, I think beyond all controverſy, by the diſtinction made in the law between a Jew and a foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <q>unto a ſtranger thou mayeſt lend upon
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034537_0015_0FFE2024E5232038"/>
uſury, but unto thy brother thou mayeſt not ſend upon Uſury</q> a diſtinction which could hardly have been admitted into a law, which the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Author intended to be of moral and ;univerſal obligation.</p>
            </q>
            <p>BUT left the conſciences of Religious men ſhould not be quieted, or their doubts removed by the Divine, I will produce the teſtimony of a Lawyer, whoſe opinion is not often controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; I mean that of Judge Blackſtone. He ſays<note n="*" place="bottom">Commentary, Vol. 2. p. <hi>455</hi> and ſequel.</note> 
               <q>The enemies to intereſt in general make no diſtinction between that and Uſury, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any increaſe of money to be indefenſibly uſurious. And this they ground as well on the prohibition by the law of Moſes among the Jews, as alſo upon what is laid down by Ariſtotle<note n="†" place="bottom">Pelit. l. <hi>1,</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note>, that money is naturally barren, and to make it breed money is prepoſterous, and a perverſion of the end of its inſtitution, which was only to anſwer the purpoſes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and not of increaſe. Hence the ſchool divines have branded the practice of taking Intereſt, as being contrary to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law both natural and revealed; and the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034537_0016_0FFE1FE0C6832510"/>
canon law has proſcribed the taking any, the leaſt, increaſe for the loan of money as <hi>a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſin.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>BUT in anſwer to this it may be obſerved, that the Moſaical precept was clearly a polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical, and not a moral precept. It only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the Jews from taking uſury from their brethren the Jews; but in expreſs words permitted them to take it of a ſtranger: which proves that the taking of moderate U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, or a reward for the uſe, for ſo the word ſignifies, is not <hi>malum in ſe,</hi> ſince it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed where any but an Iſraelite was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And as to Ariſtotle's reaſon, deduced from the natural barrenneſs of money, the ſame may with equal force be alledged of houſes, which never breed houſes; and twenty other things, which nobody doubts it is lawful to make profit of by letting them to hire.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THESE authorities and arguments will I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume be ſufficient to convince any man that there is no connexion at all between Religion and Uſury. No wonder however that many men are now puzzled on the ſubject, as that is
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034537_0017_0FFE2027C59C0130"/>
no more than has happened before to Ariſtotle, Cato, Seneca and Plutarch among the heathens; to Cyprian, Lanctantius, Baſil, Chryſoſtom, Gregory, Ambroſe, Jerom, Auguſtin and Shakeſpeare, and other caſuiſts, with whole councils among the Chriſtians. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of James I. inſerted in his Uſury law, which allowed 8 <hi>per cent.</hi> intereſt, <q>that this Statute ſhall not be conſtrued or expounded to allow the practice of Uſury <hi>in point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or conſcience.</hi>
               </q> And the learned Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op Sanderſon determined that <q>to take ſix in the hundred is ſabbath breaking, becauſe the plow goes on Sundays.</q> If all theſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities were to be admitted as authorities, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery man who receives intereſt of any kind ſhould be denominated a Uſurer, and it muſt be believed, that he who receives only 6 per cent breaks the Sabbath by ſo doing: indeed there are very few abſurdities which ſome of the above named writers have not maintained. Now I not only differ with them all, after the example of Paley and Blackſtone, but I go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I mean plainly and unequivocally to aſſert, that ſo far from being conformable to religion, the exiſting Uſury laws are contrary
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034537_0018_0FFE1FE261DFDC18"/>
to the ſpirit of both the Jewiſh and Chriſtian religions. The utmoſt extent of the law of Moſes goes no farther than <hi>an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth</hi>—that is make good what you have taken wrongfully; if you have taken Uſury of a brother reſtore it—but the law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Uſury ſays you ſhall forfeit both princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and intereſt: which is at the rate of all your teeth and eyes for one. The goſpel directs that <hi>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, do ye even ſo to them</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. vii. <hi>12.</hi>
               </note>. Now ſuppoſe any one of theſe religious men ſhould have charged 6, 12, or 18 per cent more than is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by law, would they wiſh, for ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercharge, to pay £ 124? Impoſſible! If then they would not chuſe to be ſubject to this law themſelves, how can they deſire to ſubject others to it conſiſtently with this ſacred rule; which is the moſt comprehenſive that ever was was laid down, and contains in itſelf a whole body of morality and practical religion. It is diſguſting to hear religious tradeſmen—Paper-makers, Carpenters, Coopers, Bakers, &amp;c. declaiming againſt Uſury, and, like the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee in the Goſpel, thanking God that they are
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:034537_0019_0FFE202960DEDB20"/>
not as Uſurers are—unjuſt, covetous and extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners—they never charged more than 6 <hi>per cent:</hi> whereas the true ſtate of the caſe is, they make a virtue of neceſſity, and their not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing charged more is ſolely owing to their not having money to charge upon. They can ſee the more in the eye of their brother but not the beam which is in their own eye. For what Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-maker is there who does not, or would not if he could, make 100 per cent profit on every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Are there not Coopers who ought to be indicted for extortion on every hoop they ſell? Bakers too, who condemn U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, have not ſcrupled to ſell twelve ounces of Bread for ſix-pence, and yet theſe pious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen take upon them to aſſert that they nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er charged more than 6 per cent. Might it not with propriety and juſtice be ſaid of them <hi>Thou that judgeſt another doeſt</hi> worſe <hi>things.</hi> If the intereſt of money is to be ſettled by religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let us have the profits of trade ſettled by the ſame rule.

this? Not at all, although this would be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt and religious with fixing the intereſt of money, for the law of Moſes ſays, that Uſury is not to be charged to a brother on victuals or any thing elſe, any more than on money: therefore if the old laws againſt Uſury are to be put in force, let us have the old laws againſt Extortion enforced alſo<note n="*" place="bottom">Such is the va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>BUT without proceeding farther, enough has been ſaid to warrant the concluſion, that what is mentioned reſpecting Uſury in the law of Moſes, is not binding on Chriſtians; and this concluſion will be confirmed beyond all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of doubt or cavil, when we conſider that the ſubject is no where mentioned in the New Teſtament. On the contrary an oppoſite doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is every where inculcated, and the law of retaliation is totally aboliſhed by the goſpel. I may therefore ſafely aſſert in the words of the Statute of Edward VI. that, ſo far from being religious, the laws reſpecting Uſury are <q>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and moſt impious.</q>

            </head>
            <p>THE next thing I propoſe to conſider is, the moral tendency of Uſury Laws. In this point of view, however, I can ſee nothing but a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal departure from, and oppoſition to, all the rules of morality, notwithſtanding the pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to ſome of thoſe laws make a whining pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of regard to poor debtors. I conceive the morality of trade conſiſts in every man ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the beſt bargain he can, and adhereing with religious exactneſs to that bargain; wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he be a buyer or ſeller, borrower or lender. Now if the rule I have here laid down is right, the non-compliance with an agreement, muſt be a breach of morality. The Uſury laws not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſanction this breach, but they authorize the moſt outrageous oppoſition to this rule of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:034537_0022_0FFE1FE81CF8EE60"/>
They encourage a ſharper to agree for the payment of more than legal intereſt, and that poſſibly with a man who does not know that ſuch laws exiſt, and afterwards to cheat him out of the whole ſum, principal and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. Indeed they do more for they hold out a lure, and, as it were, invite the ſharper to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this deliberate piece of villainy; for one half of the money forfeited by the lender, is to go to the informer. Or whole gangs of theſe ſharpers may conſpire together for the purpoſe of ruining men who poſſeſs more property than themſelves; and though they might not ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately ſucceed in their wicked deſigns, the laws put it in their power to diſturb the peace of families, and much better members of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than themſelves, for a certain time. If ſuch be morality, then the Robbers of Greece, the Pirates deſtroyed by Pompey, the plundering Arabs, and the Banditti of Italy were good and moral people. For if the Uſury Societies pretend that they are going to get the money of Uſurers for the Public Good, the ancient Societies, I have mentioned, did not act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome pretence equally plauſible. The Greeks robbed becauſe they thought it Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable

               <note n="*" place="bottom">The writings of the ancients prove the truth of this aſſertion in numerous Inſtances. For example, Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les could <hi>boaſt</hi> that he had ſacked twelve cities in the Iſlands of the Archipelago; and an equal number on the plains of Tray.

The principles however on which theſe people acted were evidently vicious and immoral; but not more ſo, I conceive, than is a law which authoriſes a gang of people to aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate for the purpoſe of plundering thoſe who perhaps never ſaw them or had at ſingle tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with them. Would it not be equally mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and more honourable to tolerate by a law the practice of taking a man's property by force and violence? He would then have a chance of defending himſelf.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER kind of immorality attendant on Uſury Laws is their rewarding Informers; who, in all European countries, at leaſt, are conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their word or oath, in a court of juſtice, in England, is conſidered as of no conſequence or value, nor will it have any weight whatever, with a Jury of men of the very meaneſt capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If then Uſury laws have a tendency to reduce men to this degraded and wretched ſtate, no farther proof or argument need be ſought after to convince the world of the Immorality of them.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE queſtion reſpecting the Juſtice of Uſury laws is determined by the laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:034537_0025_0FFE20339A3FBA00"/>
The law of England, on a conviction of uſurious practices, enjoins a forfeiture of three times the amount of the capital loaned. The law of the State of Connecticut alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts that <q>Every perſon who ſhall take, accept and receive by any way or means, more than Six Dollars for the uſe of One Hundred Dollars, for a year, ſhall forfeit and loſe for ſuch offence, the full value of the money ſo lent; one moiety thereof to the public Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of this State, the other half to the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer who ſhall ſue for and proſecute the ſame to effect.</q> Now it will, at firſt ſight, be evident to every perſon that no man, although he were more learned than Yelverton, or Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton, or Coke, or Hales, or Blackſtone, or Mansfield, or all of them together, can ever prove that there is any juſtice in ſuch moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and barbarous forfeitures. With a Goth, Vandal or Monk, they might indeed be juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, but never can paſs for ſuch in any enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened or liberal ſtate of Society. Any thing in the Uſury law of Connecticut, which has the leaſt appearance of juſtice, is that part of it which directs the proceedings to be by a bill in equity<note n="*" place="bottom">And even this part is unjuſt, for, in ſtrict juſtice no more than what is paid over and above the current value of the money, ought to be deducted.</note>. In that way the lender loſes the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:034537_0026_0FFE1FEDDB224A00"/>
only, and certainly that is the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that any legiſlature had a right to proceed to: but to take away the principal, to reduce a man to beggary and ruin, for an action which is not either immoral or unjuſt, certainly has much more of the appearance of violence and robbery, than of juſtice, in it—and I am moſt fully convinced that no Law makers had a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight to paſs ſuch laws, as they are evidently both immoral and unjuſt. But admitting there ought to be Uſury laws, thoſe which now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt appear to be juſt the contrary of what they ought to be; for living is at leaſt fifteen times as expenſive now, as it was when the Intereſt of money was 10 or 12 per cent. In the 12th Century a fat ox and a meal of bread for an hundred men could be had for two ſhillings; and twenty horſes might be fed for four pence. In the 13th Century, wheat might be bought for a ſhilling, and oats for four pence a quarter, a gooſe for four pence, a lamb for ſix pence, and fowls at a penny for a couple. Such were generally the prices for ſeveral ages afterwards; and I have ſeen a tavern bill for Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, her attendants and ſervants, for a break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt

               </gap> other articles of trade increaſes? Does this look like juſtice?</p>
            <p>ANOTHER ſpecies of injuſtice which the Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry laws ſanction, is their tolerating a ſpecies of perſecution againſt men of property. Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Jay, in his laſt ſpeech to the legiſlature of New York, complains that <q>men of otherwiſe irreproachable character are guilty of the practice of Uſury.</q> Uſury is merely a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative point on which men may naturally be expected to differ in opinion. Governor Jay is an enemy to the practice; but he ſpeaks of it in the language of a Gentleman. Very different however is the caſe with the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erality of people, and the Societies, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe on the ſubject. They repreſent people who have money to lend as a ſet of Robbers, Swindlers, Extortioners, and I know not what beſide; and they ſucceed in raiſing an odium againſt monied men amongſt unthinking peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:034537_0028_0FFE1FEF5FD1B0E0"/>
who neither underſtand or examine the matter. It would be prudent in ſuch people to follow the advice of an ancient writer, who ſays, <hi>Underſtand firſt, and than rebuke.</hi> Let them conſider that NO MAN IS OBLIGED TO BORROW MONEY. But if I have money to lend, and another man wiſhes to borrow it, ſurely I have a right to conſider his ability to repay it, the inconvenience I might be put to by lending, the value of money, and to demand intereſt accordingly. If he accepts my offer that in itſelf is a demonſtration that he cannot do better elſewhere, and is it juſt that after I have done better than any other perſon for him, he ſhould have it in his power to cheat me? <q>If (ſays Blackſtone<note n="*" place="bottom">Comment. Vol. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>456.</hi>
                  </note>) I borrow £100 to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in a beneficial trade, it is but equitable that the lender ſhould have a proportion of my gains.</q> This is certainly agreeable to the nature and ſpirit of trade; for if a Farmer has corn, or cattle, or any other article to ſell, or a Merchant has goods for ſale, it will be uſeleſs for me to tell them what the price of thoſe articles was ten or an hundred years ago, and demand the articles at that price: they
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:034537_0029_0FFE2036C7ECCB18"/>
will inſiſt on the preſent market price, and if I will not give that they will go elſewhere. I have paid 16 Dollars for a barrel of Flour; this I ſhould doubtleſs have been glad to get at the old price of 5 Dollars, but as I knew it was then worth 16 Dollars to the ſeller, I was obliged to pay ſo much;—and in juſtice the caſe ought to be the ſame with money. When money is ſcarce and much wanted it ought to produce a larger profit, juſt as all other articles in trade do.</p>
            <p>THERE are great numbers of people in the world who are paſt labour, and who have ſaved a ſum of money ſufficient to ſupport them in cheap times; but when the neceſſaries of life are advanced to three times the amount of their ordinary value, is it juſt to oblige ſuch people to take common intereſt for their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and thus to cut them off from two thirds of the nouriſhments, &amp;c. which are neceſſary to the ſupport and comfort of life?</p>

Certainly theſe things ought not ſo to be. If men are to be tempted and bribed to violate every principle of good faith and honour, why are not the penalties of the law to fall equally on the borrower, ſeeing, if this is a crime, that he is equally culpable.

            <p>THE next thing to be remarked on, is the Neceſſity for the exiſtence of Uſury laws. This neceſſity will appear to be very trifling indeed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> it be once admitted that money, like every other article of exchange and merchandiſe, if left to its own ſimple operation, will find its own value. That it will do this is proved by a variety of facts, none of which I think is ſtronger than that of the variation in the price of gold and ſilver, according as it is ſcarce or plenty. In China the proportion between gold and ſilver is as one to ten, that is, one ounce of gold is worth ten <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

in other parts of the Eaſt-Indies, the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion varies from one to eleven, twelve and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen. In ancient Greece it was as one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen. In ancient Rome as one to ten, but in the time of Tiberius it roſe to thirteen. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reign of the Monks the variations were greater in extent and almoſt infinite in number; but when Columbus firſt diſcovered America, the proportion was one to twelve<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Raynal, Hiſt. Philos. of Politique Tom. <hi>3. 503.</hi>
               </note>. From that time the importations of ſilver from Mexico and Peru, have been more than a counterpoiſe to the gold of Brazil, and it now requires near fifteen ounces of ſilver, both in Europe and America, to purchaſe an ounce of gold; but at times when ſilver has been ſcarce and much demanded, I have known the proportion redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as low as one to twelve, in England. The relative value of gold and ſilver being thus clearly proved to be governed by circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there can be little doubt, but the value of money, in general, would always be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the quantity, as it ought to be, therefore there can be no neceſſity for fixing it by law.</p>
            <p>BUT I will mention another fact, which I
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:034537_0033_0FFE203F37F07328"/>

It is only in times like theſe, when the ruinous war carried on in Europe, and the great increaſe in the trade of this country, has made money ſcarce there, and much demanded here, that more than a very moderate rate of Intereſt can be obtained.

            <p>IT is ſaid by ſome that Uſury laws are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to reſtrain the avarice of creditors, who, if their debtors cannot pay them, either advance the intereſt or demand ſomething for forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; that they are a reſtraint upon taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a man's diſtreſſed circumſtances, to extort a large intereſt from him, and therefore they are politic. But if ſome creditors are apt to be hard on debtors, why do they not borrow of other perſons to ſave the advance of Intereſt, or forbearance money, if they can do it on bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter terms? Their not doing ſo is a ſufficient preſumption that they cannot get the money cheaper, or perhaps, on any terms whatever, elſewhere. Again, where a man is in diſtreſſed circumſtances, who, except a very uncommon friend, would ſtep forward and relieve him from his diſtreſs, without a proſpect of an advantage which ſhould be equivalent to the riſk he runs? In this reſpect the Uſury Law is ſo far from being politic, that I am convinced many men fall to ruin and decay, becauſe no one for 6 <hi>per cent</hi> will advance money to relieve him at

            <p>There can be no good policy in a law which countenances a combination of knaves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the ruin of their more wealthy neighbours and creditors.

Suppoſe the practices of theſe Societies were ſucceſsfully and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively put into effect, and many men ruined by the ſame, would it be ſtrange if a principle of revenge ſhould ſtimulate the monied intereſt to withdraw their property from the Government, from the Banks, from the Merchants, &amp;c. and to lodge it in their own coffers until they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a redreſs of this grievance? It is eaſy to foreſee what would be the conſequences of ſuch a proceeding. Now as monied men have the power of doing ſo much miſchief, and do not uſe that power, I think they ought to be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome indulgence, and not be expoſſed to be harraſſed and made uneaſy by the dregs of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and perſons with whom they never had a tranſaction. It appears to me that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon their acting according to the rules of nature, of trade, and of common policy, ought to be taken out of the way.</p>

FROM what has been ſaid before, it evidently appears that prohibiting the lending of money is altogether impolitic. The preſent Uſury laws are equal to a prohibition, therefore they muſt be impolitic alſo. For what man will now lend to an individual on perſonal ſecurity at <hi>Six per cent?</hi> The Funds of the Government, the Banks, Turnpike Roads, &amp;c. pay more, where the money can at any time be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is not the caſe with individuals. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man lends another man 100 Dollars on a note, he will think himſelf well off if he gets the money in calling for it three times. If the note ſhould be at two months, he will get a Dollar diſcount (at 6 per cent) and if he has to hire a chaiſe to go two or three miles, three times, that will coſt him nine ſhillings, ſo that the buyer of ſuch a note ſtands a chance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing half a dollar out of pocket beſides being kept out of his money two or three months, and taking as much trouble as would coſt him a dollar or two more if he was to hire a perſon to do the buſineſs. As payments are now made it is worth about 2 per cent to collect money, ſo that it cannot be expected any man in his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhould enter into the ſyſtem of lending at 6 per cent. It will therefore be politic for the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:034537_0045_0FFE2050AE5465B8"/>
legiſlatures either totally to aboliſh Uſury laws, or increaſe the rate of intereſt, if they wiſh there ſhould be any trade; for (I ſay it on the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Blackſtone) <q>Unleſs money can be borrowed, trade cannot be carried on.</q>
            </p>
            <p>ANOTHER circumſtance which indicates the good policy of repealing the Uſury laws, is their being particularly injurious to certain claſſes of individuals. Among theſe are ſome of the Engliſh nobility and gentry who poſſeſs entail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Eſtates, which they cannot either ſell or mortgage without an act of Parliament. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this deſcription might get money for little more than legal intereſt if their friends could give legal ſecurity for them; but as that cannot be done they are obliged to raiſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey in a very diſadvantageous way, by <hi>Poſt-obit</hi> bonds, or Life Annuities. In the latter caſe a gentleman borrows a certain ſum of money for life, and mortgages the <hi>rent</hi> of his Eſtate for the payment of the Intereſt, or Life Annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as it is called. He alſo has his life Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the amount of the ſum borrowed, at one of the offices, eſtabliſhed in London for ſuch purpoſes, and the policy remains with the len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; who is thereby enabled to recover from
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:034537_0046_0FFE2009963FD0E8"/>
the office the original ſum loaned, at the death of the borrower. For money borrowed in this way the Intereſt and premium of Inſurance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not amount to leſs than 15 or 18 per <hi>cent. per <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nn.</hi> when money is plenty; yet a tranſaction of this kind is not adjudged to come within the Statute againſt Uſury.</p>
            <p>BUT there it another and more numerous claſs of men who are much more materially injured by the Uſury laws, I mean the poorer fort of tradeſmen. Perſons or Societies who Inſure property at ſea charge a premium in proportion to the riſk; for example the Premium of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance to the Weſt Indies may now be 20 per cent; but in time of peace would be only two per cent. So if a poor tradeſman, who is thought in a hazardous ſituation, attempts to borrow money he muſt pay 24 <hi>per cent.</hi>—whereas if he could legally give the ſecurity of two or three of his friends, it is probable the lender would rather let him have the money at 8 or 10 per cent, than at 24 or even 30 per cent, and run the riſk of his ſingle ſecurity and the Uſury laws. Such is the difficulty this deſcription of men often experience in raiſing money, that they are frequently obliged to ſend
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:034537_0047_0FFE2053921D5058"/>
their goods into auctions and ſell them for hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> what they coſt. I could produce the example of a man in Norwich who bought a hogſhead of ſugar for 9 Dollars per Cwt. at three months credit, and ſold the ſame for 7 Dollars ready money, in order to raiſe a little current caſh. Now ſuppoſing there was no more than 10 Cwt. of ſugar in the hogſhead, he loſt 20 Dollars by the ſpeculation, whereas if he had borrowed the money, he raiſed, at 2 per cent a month, it would have coſt him only 4 Dollars and a frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and had there been no Uſury law ſo that he could have given legal ſecurity, no doubt he could have borrowed the ſum for two Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.—Probably ſimilar inſtances occur daily in larger Towns.</p>
            <p>THUS in whatever way I view the Uſury Laws, I can find in them neither Religion, Morality, Juſtice, Neceſſity or Policy, but they contain abundance of the directly contrary qualities. As men become enlightened, legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators will ſee the neceſſity for repealing theſe laws, as they have already repealed others which were made by the Monkiſh and gloomy profeſſors of religion, in earlier times. I could wiſh, for the honour of Connecticut, that its

For when theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes come to a full hearing in a court of juſtice, it will appear that they are acting on an entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly new ſyſtem; ſuch as was never heard of, or thought of, before, in any age or country. It will be diſcovered that in order to a convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion

the law requires "full evidence." I will not attempt to deny that in ſome caſes the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who borrowed money at uſurious intereſt might be admitted as a competent witneſs by a court of juſtice; but it is far from being evident that this practice was contemplated by the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of the Connecticut Uſury law. On the contrary there is ſtrong preſumptive evidence of an oppoſite diſpoſition.—1ſt. In the clauſe (called obſolete by Mr. Swift) which directs Grand-jurors to preſent ſuch perſons as are of "Evil name for taking exceſſive intereſt." Now if the law-makers thought that the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a perſon who had tranſacted buſineſs with the Uſurer was ſufficient, what neceſſity was there for this clauſe? 2.

               </gap>ous contract with a lender, there is a proviſo in the Statute, in caſe the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is proſecuted for amount of the loan, which enables him, the defendant, to file a bill in equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereby the plaintiff is obliged to be exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined on oath touching the real ſum he lent; and he is to receive that ſum only, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt: Now if the makers of this law had been of opinion that the evidence of the defendant alone, would be ſufficient proof of uſurious practices, is it to be ſuppoſed that they would

                  <hi>Always provided,</hi> That nothing in this act be conſtrued to prevent any perſons from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding upon <hi>full Evidence</hi> in the common courſe of law againſt exceſſive Uſury, and uſurious contracts.</q> Thus there is a clear diſtinction made between <q>one credible wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</q> and "full evidence." This conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation alone I ſhould think ſufficient to prove that the compilers of the Uſury Statute had it not in contemplation to admit the evidence of one man, and he a party in the tranſaction, as <hi>full evidence.</hi> The legiſlators of thoſe times muſt have known that a law ſo conſtrued would occaſion many frauds, there being in all countries men who, for the ſake of a reward, would invent or forge a caſe in uſury, and ſwear that there was uſury in tranſactions were none exiſted. They knew very well that there is no method to prevent a man from giving a premium privately on money, becauſe every man has a natural right to do ſo if he chuſes it; but it appears to me that the law was only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to prevent the receiving more than le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal

intereſt by courſe of law. I know very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the practice of the courts in this country. But in England I believe I can ſafely aſſert, that there never was a conviction on the Uſury State on the evidence of an Informer: A man of that deſcription would not dare to ſhew his face on any exchange in that country. No doubt uſurious practices are carried on to a conſiderable extent in England, but proſecutions for Uſury ſeldom occur, unleſs in caſes of Bankruptcy, or Death; and they do not then occur unleſs it can be proved by the clear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable evidence of Deeds, Books, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted living witneſſes; which is there cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>full evidence</hi>

If the Norwich (Liſbon) Society was in England their witneſſes would not only be thought ineligible, but the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Society themſelves would be indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a conſpiracy: for ſuch their aſſociating, actually is. When a man voluntarily comes forward with an information on a caſe of Uſury,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:034537_0059_0FFE2069F0D4AFC8"/>
he it certain of making himſelf infamous for the remainder of his life; and few men will run this riſk without a proſpect of conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. I underſtand the witneſſes of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety are to ſwear that they are totally diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted; but will any Jury ever believe ſome of of them? And even if a credible witneſs ſhould be examined the evidence of one man does not appear to be <hi>full</hi> evidence, and therefore will not warrant the giving of a verdict for the plaintiff. And when it is conſidered that the Uſury Statute is almoſt obſolete; that it is ſo highly injurious to ſociety as it has been proved to be; that Juries ought to do ſtrict juſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all parties; and that they are judges of Law as well as of Fact, a Jury ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely cautious about going into the practice of convictions under this Statute.</p>
            <p>SUCH indeed the conduct of Juries generally is in regard to old and barbarous laws. In the cale where a man is killed in a duel the law calls it murder; but if the duel is fought by mutual agreement, and nothing diſhonourable appears on the part of the ſurvivor, a Jury al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways brings it in Manſlaughter only. Juries in England are generally very ſcrupulous in
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:034537_0060_0FFE2075C4B7BF98"/>
ſuch caſes, inſomuch that I have known a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of Manſlaughter brought in when the Judges charged the Jury to find the priſoner guilty of Murder. Two inſtances of this come within my own immediate knowledge, namely, on the trials of Mr. Patterſon and R. England for killing Gen. Adair, and Mr. Rowles. Lycurgus the Spartan Law-giver, in his code of laws, directed that every child born with any natural defect ſhould be put to death. Draco decreed that every crime ſhould be puniſhed with death. It was the law, of cuſtom, at leaſt, among the Poles, ſo late as the 13th century, to put every old man, who was paſt labour, and every imperfect child to death. And by the laws of France, England and Maſſachuſetts Bay, every poor old woman who happened to be troubled with convulſions, St. V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tus's dance, &amp;c. was condemned to be burnt for a witch. In the barbarous times when thoſe laws were made, they were carried into execution: but if they exiſted now, and a Jury was impanelled to try a child for being crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a man for being old, a boy for ſtealing an apple, or an old woman for having fits, would the Jury condemn theſe ſeveral perſons to death on ſuch accounts? No Jury could be
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:034537_0061_0FFDC6F01EC3FA00"/>
found to do this, whatever the law might ſay, in any civilized country; in England ſuch Laws as are barbarous and unjuſt are always got rid of by what is called Fictions in law. When the caſes in Uſury come to be heard, a Jury will no doubt be puzzled to know how perſons who never had a tranſaction with Cyrus Biſhop, can be made to owe him 4000 Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars by law. If the law could be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the caſe, a Jury would ſee the neceſſity for evading it by a fiction; but the Jurors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom theſe cauſes are brought will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that it never was the intention of the law to do more than put it in the power of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon aggrieved, or his heirs to injure the Uſurer; they will learn that very few convictions have ever been had under this Statute; that proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions like theſe of the Society have never been carried on, or even thought of; and that they cannot either on the principles of Law, Juſtice or Honour, give a verdict for Cyrus Biſhop and Company.</p>
