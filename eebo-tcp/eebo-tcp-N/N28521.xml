            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM LXXXIX, 48.</bibl>
               <q>What man is he that liveth and ſhall not ſee death?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT hath been the cuſtom in every civilized na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to perpetuate the memory of illuſtrious men by monumental inſcriptions; or in the hiſtoric page to record their worth, and to hold up to view their peculiar virtues, not only for the admiration, but for the imitation of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages: And to promote the ſame lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable purpoſes, funeral ſermons, and orations have for ſeveral hundred years been delivered in Europe. And I am perſuaded, that ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a congregation in America, hardly a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher in the UNITED STATES would have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this laſt tribute of reſpect, to the worthy character whoſe death we this day deplore, if the government had <hi>not</hi> recommended it. Let the ſolemn funeral proceſſions in our Cities, and Villages—Let the elegies, and the orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that have already been written and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered—Let the tokens of mourning ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally worn throughout our nation—Let <hi>these avouch</hi> the truth of my ſentiment, that; WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, the great, the virtuous WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:038000_0003_100FB0C1789CCC40"/>
as he lived <hi>almost</hi> univerſally admired and loved, ſo he died <hi>universally</hi> lamented. Our aſſembling in this Church this morning is a partial evidence, that we are of the number who conceive his death to be loſs to our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. But let us remember that Waſhington is not <hi>alone to die;</hi> that, we ſhall <hi>soon</hi> follow him into the region of eternity, and that the great buſineſs of <hi>our</hi> life is to be prepared for <hi>our</hi> death. To aſſiſt my hearers in ſeeking this preparation, and to recount the virtues of <hi>our</hi> illuſtrious patriot, <hi>our</hi> hero and <hi>our</hi> friend, are the deſigns I have in view in this diſcourſe; and in order to execute theſe important purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, I ſhall in the,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> place, Briefly conſider the origin—the nature—and the effects of death; and Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Illuſtrate the happy conſequences of being prepared for this awful hour; and under this head ſhall introduce the<note n="*" place="bottom">The hiſtorick and characteriſtic parts of this ſermon are derived from the moſt reſpectable authorities; or given on my own knowledge. The publications from which I have made extracts are Dr. Morſe's Geography; a peace ſaid to be written by a Senator of the United States, and publiſhed in the news papers of this city; and General Lee's Oration. Sometimes I have omitted <hi>whole ſentences</hi> in the quotations, in order to include in as few words as poſſible the great variety of matter neceſſarily introduced.</note> character of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted and beloved General. In purſuance of this method; I begin with conſidering the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, nature and effects of death. Firſt its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. Here we are entirely indebted for infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to the ſacred oracles; we might enquire,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:038000_0004_100FB0C466F991D0"/>
but enquire in vain at any other ſource to know, whether man was made originally mortal, or, became ſo by any caſuality. Revelation aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us Rom. V-12. "Wherefore as by one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin; and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned." Our firſt progenitor having taſted the interdicted fruit, became inſtantly liable to the threatned penalty. "In the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die." Gen. 11-17. On that day his ſoul died to God. i. e. he loſt that knowledge of, and love to God, he ſo eminently poſſeſſed before his tranſgreſſion; and his body with thoſe of his poſterity became inevitably ſubject to death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The nature of death; is the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the union ſubſiſting between our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and our ſouls; on this union the animal life depends. This union it is impoſſible in our preſent ſtate to underſtand, or deſcribe; it is one of the myſteries that in eternity only we ſhall be able to comprehend. This union is diſſolved by the command, or permiſſion of God, when he ſummonſes our ſpirits hence. He gave us life, and when he pleaſes he diveſts us of it. In vain we try with all our efforts to retain the ſpirit of departing friends; our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and tears are of no avail; they faulter—they ſink—they die.</p>

               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The effects of death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1ſt, It is the termination of our preſent exiſtence; the final period of our joys and ſorrows concerning the things of this life. The ſun ſhall riſe with its accuſtomed luſtre, and ſpread its beaming light, and genial warmth throughout the earth; but not to them who are in the cold and dreary manſions of the grave. The buſy ſcenes of life no more attract the ſight, nor the love of riches, fame, or pleaſure, arreſt the midnight hour of ſleep. See, the corpse all pale and wan!—It's active ſtrength is gone!—It's vigour proſtrate!—It's hands forget to move, the pliant fingers ſtiff and cold! Once we ſurveyed our friend; we ſaw, admired and loved—Once we viewed our riſing offspring, and as they played and prattled our hearts beat fondneſs. But, they are dead! Not many days ſince we met the eye of our friend—Our love, with joy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but its cloſed for ever, no more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey in ſilent language, the ſoft, the tender movements of the heart. The tongue, that buſy member ſo prone to pleaſe—to hurt—to wound moves now no more in ſcandal or in praiſe. Death! Death! Diſplays his triumphs over every part, and ſilence, awful, univerſal ſilence reigns.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ndly.</hi> Death renders all diſtinctions void. If we view the repoſotiries of our lifeleſs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; we ſhall ſee perſons of every age and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038000_0006_100FB0C9EA0B0020"/>
of every rank and condition in life; the young and the old, the poor and the rich, the gay and the grave, all mingling promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly their duſt <hi>together</hi> in their parent earth. There the poor oppreſſed ſlave lays down at the laſt the burden of his toilſome life, and feels his cruel ſervitude no more; no more to be raiſed from needful ſlumber on his bed of earth, nor driven from his ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anty meal to the hard labours of the day. There lieth the aged pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of a numerous offspring who ſunk into reſt amidſt the tears of his progeny. Here is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombed the ſmiling infant; the flower nipped as it began to blow. The parents wonder why heaven has been ſo unkind, and are ready to ſay (although improperly) "all theſe things are againſt me." Thus one generation cometh, and paſſeth away, another riſeth, and is no more ſeen. We may ſay therefore at the tomb of the Monarch, as well as the ſlave.
<q>
                  <l>A heap of duſt alone remains of thee,</l>
                  <l>'Tis all thou art, and all the proud ſhall be.</l>
               </q>
Oh! tranſitory and fleeting life. When will the ſons of men learn to think of thee as they ought? when will they <hi>every day,</hi> nay <hi>every hour</hi> recollect, that nothing can ſhield them from the ſtroke of death? "That there is <hi>no</hi> eſcape in that war?" If conſummate beauty could have ſaved from death, Abſalom, nor Helen would never have died. If valour could have ſtopped his career, Alexander would <hi>now</hi> be traverſing the earth. If philoſophic wiſdom, learning or judgment, could have ſaved mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals from his icy arms, a Newton, a Critchton
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038000_0007_100FB0CDC73E8DA0"/>
and a Locke would ſtill have been living. If piety and uſefulneſs could have ſecured our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence here, an Uſher and a Baxter; a White-field and a Weſley, would be daily diſplaying their holy and heavenly zeal, in building up the Church of God; and if love of his country, diſintereſtedneſs, gentleneſs, humanity, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and patriotiſm could have eluded the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiate monſter's graſp, our Waſhington would not have been laid in the ſilent tomb. But the unchangable decree of heaven is "<hi>Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</hi>" And we may enquire in the language of our text, what man is he that liveth, and ſhall <hi>not</hi> ſee death? But our enquiry will be <hi>fruitless and vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3<hi>dly.</hi> Another effect of death is ſtill more awful. It is the gate that opens into eternity—It leads us to God; to receive a reward or a puniſhment as our works have been; to hear our impartial, irrevocable doom. No time <hi>now</hi> for repentance; no promiſes of acceptance, or pardon to encourage us; no ſermons to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us to the ſinner's friend; no friends to counſel and to pray for us; our ſtate is unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terably, unchangably fixed. How neceſſary then is it, that we NOW endeavour to attain a ſuitable preparation for the ſolemn moment? The happy conſequences attending ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, I was in the <hi>second</hi> place to point out. Here we may <hi>first</hi> enquire what this preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is? And,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> We have all ſinned againſt our Maker.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038000_0008_100FB0D2298662E8"/>
If we ſay we <hi>have not sinned,</hi> we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. 1 John 1 cap. 10. We are <hi>guilty</hi> therefore before God; and if the holy law which we have violated is a righteous law; we are conſequently <hi>justly</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; and if ſo, muſt be under the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the MOST HIGH. This guilt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>must</hi> be pardoned, thoſe ſins <hi>must</hi> be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, or God will <hi>not</hi> receive us to favour or to happineſs. Our guilt can only be removed, and pardon beſtowed, through a deep conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of our loſt and ſinful ſtate; wrought in our ſouls by the HOLY SPIRIT, exciting us to confeſs—to mourn for, and to forſake our ſins; and by looking to, and believing in that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſaviour who died for our offences. A cloud of ſcriptures prove theſe important truths. I ſhall refer you only to Matt. V. 4. Luke XIII. 3. John XVI. 8. and III. 16. Proverbs XXVIII. 13.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> We are unholy, and conſequently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for the company and employments of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. It would be an inſult to thoſe who have bibles in their houſes, or, attend to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of their own minds, to ſuppoſe them ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of this eſſential truth. If any doubt it, let them read Pſalm XIV. 2 &amp; 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11. 5. Rom. VI. 16 to 22. Iſai 1. 6. In fact, all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to purity and holineſs, with which the ſcripture abounds neceſſarily preſuppoſe that we are unholy. Then it clearly follows, we <hi>must</hi> be made holy, muſt have a diſpoſition ſuited to the nature of Heaven, "For without
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038000_0009_100FB0D453DB5FC0"/>
holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord." Heb. XII. 14. And as we cannot make <hi>ourselves holy</hi> it muſt be wrought <hi>in us</hi> by the power and grace of God. The ſuitable preparation for death <hi>then</hi> is; to be <hi>justified</hi> thro' faith in the merit &amp; righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus; &amp; to be <hi>sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified</hi> through the ſame medium, by the Spirit of the living God. That without this work of grace we can have no admittance to heaven, is undeniably proved from Acts XXVI. 18. 1 Cor. VI. II. Colos. 1. 12, 15, 22. Heb. XII. 14. From this work of grace <hi>always</hi> proceeds a life of holy obedience to the precepts of the Goſpel. Our Redeemer hath given us this teſt to try our religion. "He that hath my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and keepeth them, <hi>he it is</hi> that loveth ME." The happineſs attending ſuch a preparation I am now to point out. And</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> Such gracious ſouls have an abiding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the favor of God. St. Paul ſays "WE KNOW that if our earthly houſe of this taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle were diſſolved, we have a building of God, a houſe not made with hands, eternal in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens." And he again informs us, We are <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways confident</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. 2 Cor. V. 1-5-6. How exquiſite the joy that ariſes from this conſciouſneſs of the favour of God, is beyond the power of language to communicate; called therefore by one who poſſeſſed it for many years, and who could have deſcribed it, if any man could, "a joy unſpeakable and full of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry." This ſweet ſenſibility of our heavenly Father's love, chaſes from the mind the fear of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038000_0010_100FB0D97129A9B0"/>
death. Pſalm 23-4. "Though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, <hi>I will fear no evil.</hi>" This calms the terrors, and draws the ſting of death: "The ſting of death is ſin, but thanks be to God who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt." 1 Cor. XV. 56. Victory! over its horrors that it cannot amaze; victory! over its power that it cannot detain.</p>
            <p>Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ndly.</hi> In every ſaint when God calls him hence, there is a <hi>willingness</hi> to go. The grace and love of God opens his <hi>grasp</hi> of life. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his friends—his boſom friend—his riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing progeny are entwined about his heart, with the cords of earthly affection, ſo cloſe and firm, that with the higheſt aids of reaſon they can never be looſed. But when our Jeſus ſhines into the ſoul with a ray of heavenly light and joy, his language is "I deſire to depart and to be with Chriſt, which is far better. Some of the Saints die in the full triumphs of faith; while others equally pious, who are greatly emaciated by lingering diſeaſe, feel ſweet ſubmiſſion, and ſail more gently with a peaceful ſtream into the haven of eternal reſt. Some have had hard fighting with the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the confines of eternity, but have <hi>always</hi> obtained the victory before the conflict cloſed. "My grace is ſufficient for thee." And "I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee," are the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies left to every ſaint.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> They reſt from all their toils. "Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the dead that die in the LORD from

Jſai. XXXV. 10. Their grief and ſorrows in this life ariſe from many cauſes, not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary now to enumerate; but in that "reſt which remains for the people of God," every tear is wiped from every eye; there ſorrow never comes; there all is calm, and joy and peace.</p>

But on this part of the ſubject I ſhall not endeavour to enlarge; our excurſions might probably ſully the views of that land of reſt, they endeavour to exalt. I ſhall only ſay, that beſides the preſence, and manifeſted love of their God, and their Saviour, they ſhall mingle with Prophets, Patriarchs and Apoſtles, and with all thoſe great, pious, and illuſtrious ſpirits, who through faith and patience have already inherited the promiſes.

            <p>This day is dedicated by authority publicly to expreſs our ſorrow (though with ſubmiſſion to heaven) for his removal. This day is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly ſet apart to rehearſe his matchleſs deeds—To recount his virtues, and declare his praiſe.</p>
            <q>He was born the 11th of February 1732 old ſtile, at the pariſh of Waſhington, Weſtmoreland county in Virginia. Was the firſt fruit of a ſecond marriage, and received his education from a private tutor employed in the family. He early diſcovered a diſpoſition for a military life; and at the age of fifteen was entered as a midſhipman on board a Britiſh man of war then on the American coaſt, but the reluctance his mother expreſſed to his engaging in the ſea ſervice, occaſioned the proſecution of the plan to be abandoned.</q>
            <p>"Previous to this transaction when he was but ten years of age his Father died, and the charge of the family devolved on his eldeſt brother: This brother had a command in the colonial troops employed againſt Carthagena; and on his return from that expedition named his new patrimonial Manſion, <hi>Mount Vernon,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:038000_0013_100FB0E1C5C1F7F0"/>
in honor of the admiral of that name from whom he had received many civilities, and who commanded the ſquadron on that expedition. But he did not long ſurvive; at his deceaſe the eldeſt ſon by the ſecond marriage (who was our Waſhington) inherited this ſeat, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable landed property. Before he attained to his twentieth year, he was made Adjutant General of the militia in Virginia with the rank of Major. When he was about twenty one years old an event occured which called his abilities into public notice, in 1773 en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments were reported to have been made by the French on the territories of the Britiſh colonies to the weſtward. Major Waſhington was ſent with full powers to aſcertain the facts; to treat with the ſavages; and to warn the French to deſiſt from their aggreſſions; he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the duties of this miſſion with ſingular induſtry, intelligence and addreſs; and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to governor Didwiddie diſcovered thoſe talents in embryo, which have ſince been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded to general admiration." In 1755 he was advanced to the rank of colonel, in the provincial troops employed in conjunction with the Britiſh forces, to drive the French from their encroachments on our frontiers. We have all heard, or read of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he obſtinate, and unfortunate Braddock who commanded thoſe forces. He was totally defeated; ſlain himſelf; his whole force routed; Britiſh and American blood mingling and flowing in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents along the banks of the Monongahela. "It was here our youthful Waſhington in the gloomy hour of Indian victory, ſaved by his
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038000_0014_100FB0E46E4CC0B0"/>
judgment and his valour, the remains of a fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing army, preſſed by the conquering ſavage foe." It was on this occaſion that the Revd. Mr. Davies, who was afterwards Preſident of Princeton College uttered that remarkable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. "That Waſhington was raiſed up by the providence of God to be the <hi>protector and saviour of his country.</hi>" In this war he had at different times ſeparate commands, in all which victory declared Waſhington her future favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. The great fatigues he underwent in the three ſucceeding years of the war, brought on a complaint of the lungs, which it was <hi>then</hi> thought would prove mortal; and tranquility being at this time reſtored to the frontiers, by a ſeries of ſplendid victories gained by Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can and Britiſh valour; Colonel Waſhington reſigned his military appointment. His health was gradually re-eſtabliſhed; and untill the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the American revolution he cultivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the arts of peace; he was conſtantly a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Aſſembly; a magiſtrate of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and a judge of the court.</p>
            <p>The worth of Waſhington was not yet <hi>fully</hi> known. "Once more the gathering ſtorm of war agitates this peaceful country—our rights are violated by <hi>Britain</hi>—our privileges abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—a tribute claimed—a ſenſe of <hi>fancied</hi> ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior power, requiring ſubmiſſion preſents itſelf. From the ſhore to the mountains—from Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia to Maine, all is commotion, while reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hope and diſpair alternately predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate." In '74 a continental congreſs conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Waſhington was choſen a delegate from his
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038000_0015_100FB0E5F5A5EAD0"/>
native ſtate; the next year he was choſen again. The aggreſſions of Britain, and the inſolence of her officers increaſed. They ſpilled <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can blood at Lexington</hi> in the month of April—<hi>Horror, and resentment thrilled through our hearts.</hi> TO ARMS, TO ARMS the patriots cry. TO ARMS—TO ARMS, re-echoed through the land; while I remember the event<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful period, the ſound ſtill vibrates on the ear. We appealed to the world that we were <hi>forced</hi> into the conteſt. We appealed to heaven for the <hi>justice</hi> of our cauſe. An army was collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the vicinity of Boſton. Waſhington was appointed to command. A ſeven years war ſucceeds. The memorable events are too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to need a particular recital. It cloſed in the diſmemberment of a Mighty Empire; <hi>in the establishment of American freedom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The warrior's ſword is ſheathed, and the graceful victor comes dreſſed in the garland of peace. His country now completely trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, is univerſally acknowledged indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and free. Now he enjoys a full recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for all his toils, a conſciouſneſs of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done his duty <hi>with effect;</hi> and with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of his fellow citizens. "Entwined with laurel he now returns to his native home equally the object of eſteem and admiration: He lives the theme of the brave, the counſell of the wiſe, the benefactor of the poor, and the friend of mankind."</p>
            <p>The confederation theſe ſtates had formed in the hour of danger, was found after 11 years trial to be inadequate for a peaceful ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038000_0016_100FB0E89ADE6718"/>
indeed it was a compound of neceſſity and jealouſy which threatned danger <hi>only</hi> held together; the danger being over, it relaxed in all its parts, and was rapidly ſinking to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. The neceſſity of a new ſyſtem of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment appeared to all—A convention was called—Waſhington preſided. A conſtitution is formed on the model of human perfection; combining in its various branches whatever is excellent in every other form of government, and partaking of <hi>none</hi> of their defects. In this conſtitution an executive Magiſtrate is wanted to enforce its laws, when the unanimous voice of our country call him to be <hi>President of the United States.</hi> "Under his adminiſtration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry raiſed her drooping head—Agriculture reſumed her plow—virtue ſmiled—learning rejoiced—commerce flouriſhed"—peace and plenty; joy and gladneſs were ſeen and heard throughout our land; but the revolutions &amp; wars in Europe reach in their effects our happy ſhores, and threaten our country's peace. Waſhington is equal to every danger. He proclaims the laws of peace; yet wiſely <hi>prepares</hi> for war. He lays the foundation of his policy in the principles of private juſtice, and public faith;" from these he deviates not a moment, and his country <hi>now</hi> feels and rejoices in their good effects. How well he performed his part, how highly we eſteemed, and approved his conduct, are clearly evinced by the univerſal call for him to fill the preſidental chair again without <hi>one</hi> diſſenting voice. "Again he ſerves, and again he manifeſts that he is ſtill
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038000_0017_100FB0EA554F2788"/>
the ſame wiſe and faithful guide." To recount all his ſervices, and the difficulty of ſteering at the helm of government, amidſt the convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive wars and jarring intereſts of the European nations, would take up too much time; let it ſuffice to ſay, that wiſdom, prudence and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were diſcovered on every occaſion. His duty well performed he once more returns to domeſtic life. "He ſerved from a ſenſe of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and he retired from a voluntary choice." But how uncertain is the ſtate of human af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs? While we were cultivating peace with all the hoſtile powers, a cloud gathered in our horiſon, and the alarm of threatened war again was heard throughout our land. Our cities, our villages reſound with martial muſic; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battled ranks of <hi>Volunteers</hi> proffer their ſervice to repel the foe—an army is raiſing, and Waſhington, the aged Waſhington is invited to command. When his country calls, he inſtantly obeys; he accepted the charge, and confidence chears our anxious minds.—But! oh! he is gone—No more! in caſe of war to lead our armies to victory; to grace our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils with his preſence, and enlighten them by his wiſdom. He is gone! to the ſilent manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the dead! <hi>Yet he lives in the hearts of the American people.</hi> He lives in the eſteem and admiration of the world,—And while ſuns ſhall riſe and ſet; while virtue remains on the earth, the name of Waſhington ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced with veneration.</p>
            <p>In collecting, and arranging materials for this luminous character, from the obſervations
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038000_0018_100FB0EF414B4898"/>
of others, and from my own knowledge; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable difficulties have occurred in determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what parts to retain, or to omit. <hi>The all of Washington was worth rehearsing;</hi> but this would have lengthened my diſcourſe beyond all reaſonable bounds, and I fear that I have already treſpaſſed on your patience; but as you will not probably hear another ſermon on this intereſting ſubject; be pleaſed to permit me before I conclude, to point out a few of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of his mind, exemplified in correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent actions.</p>
            <p>Firſt. As a ſoldier and a commander he was intrepid and brave, he was cool and determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Let the dangerous, but ſucceſsful attack he made at Trenton, in the dead of winter, in a dark and gloomy night, with diſpirited ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, evince his proweſs and the vigor of his mind. "He fought—He conquered—The morning ſun cheered the American world—Our country <hi>rose</hi> on the event." Let his retiring not long after this victory, from the front of a numerous army, and while he retreated <hi>unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> from their front, he unexpectedly fell upon their rear cantoned at Princeton, and captured the whole. Let theſe maſterly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuvres declare his ſuperior knowledge in the art of war. They will teſtify to ſucceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, his ſagacity, his prudence &amp; his valour.—Long Iſland can witneſs a retreat not ſurpaſſed in the page of hiſtory; an hoſtile army in his front, not two hundred yards diſtant, conſiſting of more than <hi>three times</hi> his number; a rapid river a full mile wide in his rear; the enemies
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038000_0019_100FB0F1E97FEE90"/>
ſhipping ready to move in order to cut off his <hi>only</hi> retreat; not boats ſufficient to tranſport a fifth part of his army at once, this army unuſed to diſcipline; and conſequently to ſilence. Under all theſe diſadvantages almoſt impoſſible to be ſurmounted by any other general; he brought off his troops to the great ſurpriſe of the enemy, without the loſs of a <hi>single man.</hi>—Let the hills of Brandewine—Let the fields of Germantown—Let the plains of Monmouth witneſs his bravery, his cool and determined valour. How often have I ſeen him undiſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the greateſt danger, giving his orders with calmneſs, while deaths flew thick around.<note n="*" place="bottom">The author of this diſcourſe was an officer in the Continental army, in the Jerſey line, and was in every action in the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionary war, where the illuſtrious Waſhington perſonally commanded; except the battle of Monmouth, and the ſiege of York Town.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi>ndly.</hi> He was apparently unmoved in the moſt adverſe circumſtances.

All looked to Waſhington. No ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſeemed to ſet on his brow. He was ſerene and clear as the unclouded ſun. He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed then more than a hoſt. His words, his example, his countenance all jointly contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to inſpire us with confidence and courage. To finiſh this part of his character, <hi>I must say</hi> that he was unequalled by any of the heroes of antiquity; by any general of modern times.

virtues it is true, but they were tarniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their defects. Alexander was brave like Waſhington, but he was cruel and intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate. Caeſar was intrepid, but he enſlaved his country. Cromwell was wiſe and ſucceſsful, but he acted like a hypocrite, and aimed at the regal power. Suwarrow is undoubtedly a great commander, but has he not <hi>boasted</hi> of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements? Buoneparte is full of martial fire, is an able and excellent General, but has he not like Cromwell deſtroyed the ſacred right of election? the grand palladium of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Has he not undertaken to frame a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution for the French people, when they have <hi>not delegated to HIM this authority?</hi> Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough in the reign of Queen Anne, in many things moſt reſembled our Waſhington. He had like our hero a handſome perſon, and an elegant manner of addreſs. He was wiſe in the cabinet, he was brave in the field—he knew when to attack and when to be paſſive—He poſſeſſed great calmneſs in action, and was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful in victory; but Marlborough, the famous Marlborough was <hi>avaritious.</hi> He poſſeſſed by the bounty of his Country the higheſt hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and one of the greateſt eſtates in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Yet he defrauded the ſoldiers by dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing their allowance of bread, and applying their loſs to his own uſe; the cloth for the uſe of the ſoldiers was purchaſed by <hi>his agents</hi> and overcharged to the government; theſe diſgraceful peculations cauſed a poet<note n="*" place="bottom">Pope.</note> of his time to ſatirize him in the following lines.

But our Waſhington was, <hi>thirdly:</hi> diſintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Let it be remembered that he received <hi>no pay</hi> for his long and toilſome ſervices: he ſuffered, he fought for his country's freedom, and not for its money. Let it be known that when the Governor and Legiſlature of Virginia, by an act of that common wealth veſted in him fifty ſhares in the companies for opening the navigation of the James and Patowmac rivers, as a ſmall acknowledgment of his merit and ſervices; he made this noble and generous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. "When I was firſt called to the ſtation with which I was honoured during the late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict for our liberties; to the diffidence which I had ſo many reaſons to feel in accepting it, I thought it my duty to join a firm reſolution to ſhut my hand againſt <hi>every pecuniary recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</hi>"</p>
            <p>4<hi>thly.</hi> He was not ambitious of retaining power. I adduce his chearful and voluntary reſignation of the command of the army as a ſufficient proof. Let his intention of retiring from the Preſidentſhip when the term of his firſt election expired (though certain of being re-elected) demonſtrate to the world, that his motives were pure; that neither ambition, nor the love of power reigned in his breaſt.</p>
            <p>5<hi>thly.</hi> As a ſtateſman he was well informed. He underſtood the true intereſts of his country, and purſued them with undeviating ardour. With what ability and ſkill he conducted the

helm of government undeniably appears in the unparaleled growing greatneſs of our country.</p>
            <p>6<hi>thly.</hi> He was a uſeful citizen; as he ever paid the ſtricteſt obedience to the laws of the land. He encouraged every plan calculated to increaſe the welfare of our country. Some of the meaſures entered into, for the opening, and improving our inland navigation, are ſaid to have originated with him; and it is certain that he promoted every meaſure of public uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity by all the means in his power.</p>
            <p>7<hi>thly.</hi> He was mild and condeſcending, and never treated with contemptuous language, any perſon that behaved with propriety, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed him with decency. He had none of that <hi>hautier</hi> of office, ſo frequently diſcovered in ſome men, who are in exalted ſtations; he was always acceſſible, at ſuitable times by the private ſoldier, and the pooreſt citizen.</p>

            <p>9<hi>thly.</hi> He was temperate, and decent in all his deportment.

his table; he conducted himſelf on every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with <hi>uncommon propriety and decorum,</hi> and evinced to all, that he was not only the wiſe ſtateſman, and the great commander, but that he was <hi>really</hi> a gentleman.</p>
            <p>10<hi>thly.</hi> He was charitable and generous. His ſecretary informed <hi>me</hi> in New York, that during his reſidence in that city, he diſtributed to the common objects of diſtreſs that reſorted to his houſe for relief, upwards of a guinea every day; beſides what he gave occaſionally in larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er amounts to perſons of worth, who had been reduced to poverty. Let his generous gifts to charity ſchools in his life time,—Let the ample donations in his will, for ſimilar purpoſes, and the advancement of learning, declare that Waſhington was charitable and generous.—HIS WILL Ah! let HIS WILL, prove that he poſſeſſed a beneficient heart. What ſweet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of philanthrophy moved in his breaſt while he penned that <hi>heaven-inspired</hi> ſentence; ALL MY NEGROES ARE TO BE FREE? What ſoft benevolence flowed through his ſoul, when he made proviſion for the helpleſs infancy, and decrepid age that ſhould be found among them? While I am reciting theſe magnanimous acts of Waſhington; I catch ſome of his generous ſpirit, and am ready to exclaim; happy ſlaves! thrice happy maſter! and to raiſe my heart to the GREAT ETERNAL in devout ſupplication; that he would be pleaſed to incline the hearts of thoſe in ſimilar circumſtances, <hi>to imitate so noble an example.</hi>

11<hi>thly. He had a deep and solemn reverence for God and religion.</hi> During his reſidence in Philadelphia, he generally kept a BIBLE open, in a private apartment, to which he uſed to reſort;<note n="†" place="bottom">The author of this diſcourſe was ſtationed at Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia in 1794 as a preacher in that Church of which he is a member; and received the above recited fact through a channel which leaves <hi>in his mind</hi> no doubt of its authenticity.</note> He frequently attended public pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and preaching in the army; and as we had chaplains of different denominations, he gave a proof that his mind was not confined with narrow bigotry, by attending at conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent opportunities, the prayers at the different brigades, and regiments. While he reſided in New York, and Philadelphia he regularly attended divine ſervice in that church of which he was a member. Let it be remembered to his praiſe, that he always attributed to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintending <hi>providence of God,</hi> the ſucceſs of every meaſure both civil and military. The anſwers to <hi>all</hi> the numerous addreſſes preſented to him on his firſt elevation to the Preſidental chai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In a word; although many have been equally brave as ſoldiers—Equally patriotic as citizens; while ſome have been equally chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and generous, mild and humane, while
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:038000_0026_100FB105504E4160"/>
others have been equally wiſe, unambitious, or pious; I have not known; I have not heard of; I have not read of, <hi>one man</hi> in whom, all theſe qualities and virtues have been concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered as in our Waſhington. And to cloſe our deſcription of his character in the words of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. "Whether we view him in the field or the cabinet; the ſhade of retirement or chair of ſtate, he is ever the ſame. Great and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful in command. A hero in the day of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. In victory mild and merciful. In policy, uniting perfection of ſyſtem with grandeur of deſign. Firm and unſhaken in the face of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and ſtorm of adverſity. Uniting and blending with all; gentleneſs and ſimplicity of manners. With pure and bright morality.—"And thus forming a character as well cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to inſpire confidence; command reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and benefit his country, as ever was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by a mortal man."—Then let love and gratitude enroll his name among the wiſe, the honourable, and the virtuous of every age.—And the people of America to the lateſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, ſhall ſpeak of Waſhington with vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and delight. He died on the 14th of December, 1799; had he lived to this day he would have been 68 years old. He died with compoſure of mind, without any dread of death. We hope; we humbly hope; <hi>we have reason to hope, he is gone to</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>To conclude—We are not called to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of armies, or to fill the chair of ſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we are called to be good citizens; let us then imitate our departed Waſhington, in
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:038000_0027_100FB106D86C1728"/>
obeying the laws of our country; in promoting its welfare by every laudable means in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Let us practice all the relative and ſocial virtues as he has done before us; let us be hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and temperate, and mild and condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and charitable and generous, let us fill up our ſeveral ſtations with duty and dignity; with propriety and decency. We are called to be chriſtians, let us then prize in our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and obey in our practice, the ſacred truths, and holy precepts in the word of GOD.</p>
            <p>We are called this day by the providence of GOD; by the death of Waſhington; and the voice of the preacher, to remember, THAT WE ARE TO DIE. That in a few years at moſt our bodies will be carried on men's ſhoulders, and lodged in the cold and ſilent tomb, and our ſouls ſhall wing their flight into a dreadful, or, a glorious eternity; where we muſt lie down in unabating ſorrows, or, be raiſed to everlaſting joys. Let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that it is our duty and our privilege; our wiſdom and our intereſt, to be prepared for thoſe ſolemn ſcenes. "Let our faith this day be to us as the <hi>evidence</hi> of things not ſeen," and bring home to our hearts an impreſſive view <hi>of our near approach</hi> to the world of ſpirits; and while ſolemnity reſts on our minds, let us raiſe our hearts to GOD in fervent prayer; that he would be pleaſed to enlighten our minds by the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> to a diſcovery of our wretched and guilty ſtate; of the evil and malignant na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſin; and excite in us anſwerable affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to this view of ourſelves; that we may
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:038000_0028_100FB10987C2E0A0"/>
deteſt every evil way, and turn to the Lord our God; and under a deep conſciouſneſs of the <hi>just desert</hi> of our tranſgreſſions, that we may apply to, and believe in, the meritorious mediation of the adorable Jeſus, for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins that are paſt. And being thus brought into the favour of GOD, we may from love and gratitude be "ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord;" that we may "increaſe in the knowledge, and love of GOD;" and through mercy and grace, attain a <hi>meetness</hi> to be partakers of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the ſaints in light, that when our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are diſembodied, we may join thoſe holy ſouls who have left this world before us, in adoring, and praiſing the GOD of our ſalvation. GOD grant it for Chriſt's ſake.</p>
