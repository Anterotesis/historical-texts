            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>SEVERAL pieces with the ſignature of PACIFICUS were lately publiſhed, which have been read with ſingular pleaſure and applauſe, by the foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and degenerate citizens among us, who hate our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican government, and the French revolution; whilſt the publication ſeems to have been too little regarded, or too much deſpiſed by the ſteady friends to both.</p>
               <p>Had the doctrines inculcated by the writer, with the natural conſequences from them, been nakedly preſented to the public, this treatment might have been proper. Their true character would then have ſtruck every eye, and been rejected by the feelings of every heart. But they offer themſelves to the reader in the dreſs of an ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate diſſertation; they are mingled with a few truths that may ſerve them as a paſſport to credulity; and they
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:030734_0003_0FE8CE753B86C500"/>are introduced with profeſſions of anxiety for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of pcace, for the welfare of the government, and for the reſpect due to the preſent head of the executive, that may prove a ſnare to patriotiſm.</p>
               <p>In theſe diſguiſes they have appeared to claim the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention I propoſe to beſtow on them; with a view to ſhew, from the publication itſelf, that under colour of vindicating an important public act, of a chief magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, who enjoys the confidence and love of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, principles are advanced which ſtrike at the vitals of its conſtitution, as well as at its honor and true inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>
               <p>As it is not improbable that attempts may be made to apply inſinuations, which are ſeldom ſpared when par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular purpoſes are to be anſwered, to the author of the enſuing obſervations, it may not be improper to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that he is a friend to the conſtitution, that he wiſhes for the preſervation of peace, and that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent chief magiſtrate has not a fellow-citizen, who is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated with deeper reſpect for his merits, or feels a purer ſolicitude for his glory.</p>
               <p>This declaration is made with no view of courting a more favourable ear to what may be ſaid than it deſerves. The ſole purpoſe of it is, to obviate imputations which might weaken the impreſſions of truth; and which are the more likely to be reſorted to, in proportion as ſolid and fair arguments may be wanting.</p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of the firſt piece, ſifted from its incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies and its vague expreſſions, may be thrown into the following propoſitions: That the powers of declaring war and making treaties are, in their nature, executive powers: That being particularly veſted by the conſtitution in other departments, they are to be conſidered as excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of the general grant to the executive depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: That being, as exceptions, to be conſtrued ſtrictly, the powers not ſtrictly within them, remain with the executive: That the executive conſequently, as the organ of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with foreign nations, and the interpreter and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:030734_0004_0FE8CE76D3333110"/>executor of treaties, and the law of nations, is autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed, to expound all articles of treaties, thoſe involving queſtions of war and peace, as well as others;—to judge of the obligations of the United States to make war or not, under any <hi>caſus federis</hi> or eventual operation of the contract, relating to war;—and, to pronounce the ſtate of things reſulting from the obligations of the United States, as underſtood by the executive: That in particular the executive had authority to judge whether in the caſe of the mutual guaranty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the United States and France, the former were bound by it to engage in the war: That the executive has, in purſuance of that authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, decided that the United States are not bound:— And, That its proclamation of the 22d of April laſt, is to be taken as the effect and expreſſion of that deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>The baſis of the reaſoning is, we perceive, the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary doctrine, that the powers of making war and treaties, are in their nature executive; and therefore comprehended in the general grant of executive power, where not ſpecially and ſtrictly excepted out of the grant.</p>
               <p>Let us examine this doctrine; and that we may avoid the poſſibility of miſtating the writer, it ſhall be laid down in his own words: a precaution the more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as ſcarce any thing elſe could outweigh the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, that ſo extravagant a tenet ſhould be hazarded, at ſo early a day, in the face of the public.</p>
               <p>His words are—"Two of theſe [exceptions and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications to the executive powers] have been already noticed—the participation of the ſenate in the <hi>appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of officers,</hi> and the <hi>making of treaties.</hi> A <hi>third</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be mentioned—the right of the legiſlature to <hi>declare war, and grant letters of marque and repriſal."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again—"It deſerves to be remarked, that as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Senate in the <hi>making treaties,</hi> and the power of the legiſlature to <hi>declare war,</hi> are <hi>exceptions</hi> out of the general <hi>executive power,</hi> veſted in the Preſident,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030734_0005_0FE8CE7E8ECA7020"/>they are to be coaſtrued <hi>ſtrictly,</hi> and ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no farther than is <hi>offential</hi> to their execati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on."</p>
               <p>If there be any countenance to theſe poſitions, it muſt be found either 1ſt, in the writers, of authocity, on public law; or 2d, in the quality and operation of the powers to make war and treaties: or 3d, in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the United States.</p>
               <p>It would be of little uſe to enter far into the firſt ſource of information, not only becauſe our own reaſon and our own conſtitution, are the beſt guides; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a juſt analyſis and diſcrimination of the powers of government, according to their executive, legiſlative and judiciary qualities are not to be expected in the works of the moſt received juriſts, who wrote before a criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal attention was paid to thoſe objects, and with their eyes too much on monarchical governments, where all powers are confounded in the ſovereignty of the prince. It will be found however, I believe, that all of them, particularly Wolfius, Burlamaqui and Vattel, ſpeak of the powers to declare war, to conclude peace, and to form alliances, as among the higheſt acts of the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty; of which the legiſlative power muſt at leaſt be an integral and pre-eminent part.</p>
               <p>Writers, ſuch as Locke and Monteſquieu, who have diſcuſſed more particularly the principles of liberty and the ſtructure of government, lie under the ſame diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, of having written before theſe ſubjects were illuminated by the events and diſcuſſions which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh a very recent period. Both of them too are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently warped by a regard to the particular government of England, to which one of them owed allegiance; <note n="*" place="bottom">The chapter on prerogative, ſhews how much the reaſon of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher was clouded by the royaliſm of the Engliſhman.</note> and the other profeſſed an admiration bordering on ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. Monteſquieu, however, has rather diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf by enforcing the reaſons and the importance of avoiding a confuſion of the ſeveral powers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than by enumerating and defining the powers which belong to each particular claſs. And Locke, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030734_0006_0FE8CE802D7B2870"/>the early date of his work on civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the example of his own government before his eyes, admits that the particular powers in queſtion, which, after ſome of the writers on public law he calls <hi>federative,</hi> are really <hi>diſtinct</hi> from the <hi>executive,</hi> though almoſt always united with it, and <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to be ſeparated into diſtinct bands.</hi> Had he not lived under a monarchy, in which theſe powers were united, or had he written by the lamp which truth now preſents to lawgivers, the laſt obſervation would probably never have dropt from his pen. But let us quit a field of reſearch which is more likely to perplex than to decide, and bring the queſtion to other teſts of which it will be more eaſy to judge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we conſult, for a moment, the nature and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the two powers to declare war and make trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it will be impoſſible not to ſee that they can never fall within a proper definition of executive powers. The natural province of the executive magiſtrate is to execute laws, as that of the legiſlature is to make laws. All his acts, therefore, properly executive, muſt pre-ſuppoſe the exiſtence of the laws to be executed. A treaty is not an execution of laws: it does not pre-ſuppoſe the exiſtence of laws. It is, on the contrary, to have itſelf the force of a <hi>law,</hi> and to be carried into <hi>execution,</hi> like all <hi>other laws</hi> by the <hi>executive magiſtrate.</hi> To ſay then that the power of making treaties which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly laws, belongs naturally to the department which is to execute laws, is to ſay, that the executive depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment naturally includes a legiſlative power. In theory, this is an abſurdity,— in practice a tyranny.</p>
               <p>The power to declare war is ſubject to ſimilar rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. A declaration that there ſhall be war, is not an execution of laws; it does not ſuppoſe pre-exiſting laws to be executed: it is not, in any reſpect, an act merely executive. It is, on the contrary, one of the moſt deliberative acts that can be performed; and when performed, has the effect of <hi>repealing</hi> all the <hi>laws</hi> opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a ſtate of peace, ſo far as they are inconſiſtent with a ſtate of war: and of <hi>enacting</hi> as a <hi>rule for the executive,</hi> a <hi>new code</hi> adapted to the relation between the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030734_0007_0FE8CE87AFC54750"/>ſociety and its foreign enemy. In like manner, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of peace <hi>annuls</hi> all the <hi>laws</hi> peculiar to a ſtate of war, and <hi>revives</hi> the general <hi>laws</hi> incident to a ſtate of peace.</p>
               <p>Theſe remarks will be ſtrengthened by adding that treaties, particularly treaties of peace, have ſometimes the effect of changing not only the external laws of the ſociety, but operate alſo on the internal code, which is purely municipal, and to which the legiſlative authority of the country is of itſelf competent and compleat.</p>
               <p>From this view of the ſubject in muſt be evident, that although the executive may be a convenient organ of preliminary communications with foreign governments, on the ſubjects of treaty or war; and the proper agent for carrying into execution the final determinations of the competent authority; yet it can have no pretenſions from the nature of the powers in queſtion compared with the nature of the executive truſt, to that eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial agency which gives validity to ſuch determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>It muſt be further evident that, if theſe powers be not in their nature purely legiſlative, they partake ſo much more of that, than of any other quality, that under a conſtitution leaving them to reſult to their moſt natural department, the legiſlature would be without a rival in its claim.</p>
               <p>Another important inference to be noted is, that the powers of making war and treaty being ſubſtantially of a legiſlative, not an executive nature, the rule of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting exceptions ſtrictly, muſt narrow inſtead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging executive pretenſions on thoſe ſubjects.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It remains to be enquired whether there be any thing in the conſtitution itſelf which ſhews that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of making war and peace are conſidered as of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive nature, and as comprehended within a general grant of executive power.</p>
               <p>It will not be pretended that this appears from any <hi>direct</hi> poſition to be found in the inſtrument.</p>
               <p>If it were <hi>deducible</hi> from any particular expreſſions it may be preſumed that the publication would have ſaved us the trouble of the reſearch.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:030734_0008_0FE8CE89A20CC048"/>
               <p>Does the doctrine then reſult from the actual diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of powers among the ſeveral branches of the government? Or from any fair analogy between the powers of war and treaty and the enumerated powers veſted in the executive alone?</p>
               <p>Let us examine.</p>
               <p>In the general diſtribution of powers, we find that of declaring war expreſsly veſted in the Congreſs, where every other legiſlative power is declared to be veſted, and without any other qualification than what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to every other legiſlative act. The conſtitutional idea of this power would ſeem then clearly to be, that it is of a legiſlative and not an executive nature.</p>
               <p>This concluſion becomes irreſiſtible, when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected, that the conſtitution cannot be ſuppoſed to have placed either any power legiſlative in its nature, entirely among executive powers, or any power execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in its nature, entirely among legiſlative powers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out charging the conſtitution, with that kind of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture and conſolidation of different powers, which would violate a fundamental principle in the organiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of free governments. If it were not unneceſſary to enlarge on this topic here, it could be ſhewn, that the conſtitution was originally vindicated, and has been conſtantly expounded, with a diſavowal of any ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixture.</p>
               <p>The power of treaties is veſted jointly in the Preſident and in the Senate, which is a branch of the legiſlature. From this arrangement merely, there can be no inference that would neceſſarily exclude the power from the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive claſs: ſince the ſenate is joined with the Preſident im another power, that of appointing to offices, which as far as relate to executive offices at leaſt, is conſidered as of an executive nature. Yet on the other hand, there are ſufficient indications that the power of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is regarded by the conſtitution as materially dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from mere executive power, and as having more affinity to the legiſlative than to the executive character.</p>
               <p>One circumſtance indicating this, is the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal regulation under which the ſenate give their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030734_0009_0FE8CE9102B57758"/>in the caſe of treaties. In all other caſes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the body is expreſſed by a majority of voices. In this particular caſe, a concurrence of two thirds at leaſt is made neceſſary, as a ſubſtitute or compenſation for the other branch of the legiſlature, which on certain occaſions, could net be conventiently a party to the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaction.</p>
               <p>But the concluſive circumſtance is, that treaties when formed according to the conſtitutional mode, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſedly to have the force and operation of <hi>laws,</hi> and are to be a rule for the courts in controverſies between man and man, as much as any <hi>aber laws.</hi> They are even emphatically declared by the conſtitution to be <q>the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme law of the land.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So far the argument from the conſtitution is preciſely in oppoſition to the doctrine. As little will be gained in its favour from a compariſon of the two powers, with thoſe particularly veſted in the Preſident alone.</p>
               <p>As there are but ſew, it will be moſt ſatisfactory to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view them one by one.</p>
               <p>"The Preſident ſhall be commander in chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia when called into the actual ſervice of the United States".</p>
               <p>There can be no relation worth examining between this power and the general power of making treaties. And inſtead of being analogous to the power of decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring war, it affords a ſtriking illuſtration of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patibility of the two powers in the ſame hands. Thoſe who are to <hi>conduct a war</hi> cannot in the nature of things, be proper or ſafe judges, whether <hi>a war ought</hi> to be <hi>commenced, continued,</hi> or <hi>concluded.</hi> They are barred from the latter functions by a great principle in free government, analogous to that which ſeparates the ſword from the purſe, or the power of executing from the power of enacting laws.</p>
               <p>"He cray require the opinion in writing of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal officers in each of the executive departments upon any ſubject relating to the duties of their reſpective of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; and he ſhall have power to grant reprieves and pardon for offences againſt the United States, except
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030734_0010_0FE8CE9296D788C0"/>in caſe of impeachment." Theſe powers can have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with the ſubject.</p>
               <p>"The Preſident ſhall have power to fill up vacancies that may happen during the receſs of the ſenate, by granting commiſſions which ſhall expire at the end of the next ſection." The ſame remark is applicable to this power, as alſo to that of "receiving ambaſſadors, other publicminiſters and conſuls". The particular uſe attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be made of this laſt power will be conſidered in another place.</p>
               <p>"He ſhall take care that the laws ſhall be faithfully executed and ſhall commiſſion all officers of the United States." To ſee the laws faithfully executed conſtitutes the eſſence of the executive authority. But what rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has it to the power of making treaties and war, that is, of determining what the <hi>laws ſhall be</hi> with regard to other nations? No other certainly than what ſubſiſts between the powers of executing and enacting laws; no other, conſequently, than what forbids a coalition of the powers in the ſame department.</p>
               <p>I paſs over the few other ſpecified functions aſſigned to the Preſident, ſuch as that of convening the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp;c. &amp;c. which cannot be drawn into the preſent queſtion.</p>
               <p>It may be proper however to take notice of the power of removal from office, which appeans to have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to the Preſident by the laws eſtablishing the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive departments; and which the writer has endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to preſs into his ſervice. To juſtify any favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable inference from this caſe, it muſt be thewn, that the powers of war and treaties are of a kindred nature to the power of removal, or at leaſt are equally within a grant of excutive power. Nothing of this fort has been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, nor probably will be attempted. Nothing can in truth be clearer, than that no analogy, or ſhade of analogy, can be traced between a power in the ſupreme officer reſponſible for the faithful execution of the laws, to diſplace a ſubaltern officer employed in the execution of the laws; and a power to make treaties, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare war, ſuch as theſe have been found to be in their <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Thus it appears that by whatever ſtandard we try this doctrine, it muſt be condemned as no leſs vicious in theory than it would be dangerous in practice. It is countenanced neither by the writters on law; nor by the nature of the powers themſelves; nor by any general ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements or particular expreſſions, or plauſible analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, to be found in the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>Whence then can the writer have borrowed it?</p>
               <p>There is but one anſwer to this queſtion.</p>
               <p>The power of making treaties and the power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring war, are <hi>royal prerogatives</hi> in the <hi>Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and are accordingly treated as <hi>Executive prerogatives</hi> by <hi>Britiſh commentators.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhall be the more confirmed in the neceſſity of this ſolution of the problem, by looking back to the aera of the conſtitution, and ſatisſying ourſelves that the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could not have been miſled by the doctrines maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our own commentators on our own government. That I may not ramble beyond preſcribed limits, I ſhall content myſelf with an extract from a work which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a ſyſtematic explanation and defence of the conſtitution, and to which there has frequently been aſcribed ſome influence in conciliating the public aſſent to the government in the form propoſed. Three circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances conſpire in giving weight to this cotemporary expoſition. It was made at a time when no application to <hi>perſons</hi> or <hi>meaſures</hi> could bias: The opinion given was not tranſiently mentioned, but formally and critically elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidated: It related to a point in the conſtitution which muſt conſequently have been viewed as of importance in the public mind. The paſſage relates to the power of making treaties; that of declaring war, being arranged with ſuch obvious propriety among the legiſlative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as to be paſſed over without particular diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <q>Tho' ſeveral writers on the ſubject of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment place that power <hi>(of making treaties)</hi> in the claſs of <hi>Executive authorities,</hi> yet this is <hi>evidently</hi> an <hi>arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary diſpeſition.</hi> For if we attend <hi>carefully,</hi> to its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it will be found to partake <hi>more</hi> of the <hi>legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> than of the <hi>executive</hi> character, though it does not
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030734_0012_0FE8CDE40BCA66F0"/>ſeem ſtrictly to fall within the definition of either of them. The eſſence of the legiſlative authority, is to enact laws; or in other words, to preſcribe rules for the regulation of the ſociety. While the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the laws and the employment of the common deſence, ſeem to comprize <hi>all</hi> the functions of the <hi>Executive magiſtrate.</hi> The power of making treaties is <hi>plainly</hi> neither the one nor the other. It relates neither to the execution of the ſubſiſting laws, nor to the enaction of new ones, and ſtill leſs to an exertion of the common ſtrength. Its objects are contracts with foreign nations, which have the <hi>force of law,</hi> but derive it from the obligations of good faith. They are not rules preſcribed by the ſovereign to the ſubject, but agreements between ſovereign and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. The power in queſtion ſeems therefore to form a diſtinct department, and to belong properly neither to the legiſlative nor to the executive. The qualities elſewhere detailed as indiſpenſible in the management of foreign <hi>negociations,</hi> point out the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive as the moſt fit agent in thoſe tranſactions: whilſt the vaſt importance of the truſt, and the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of treaties <hi>as laws,</hi> plead ſtrongly for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the whole or a part of the <hi>legiſlative body,</hi> in the office of making them. <bibl>Federaliſt, vol. 2. p. 273.</bibl>

               <p>It will not fail to be remarked on this commentary, that whatever doubts may be ſtarted as to the correctneſs of its reaſoning againſt the legiſlative nature of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make treaties: it is <hi>clear, conſiſtent</hi> and <hi>confident,</hi> in deciding that the power is <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>evidently</hi> not an <hi>executive power.</hi>

               <p>THE doctrine which has been examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is pregnant with inferences and conſequences againſt which no ramparts in the conſtitution could defend the public liberty, or ſcarcely the forms of Republican go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Were it once eſtabliſhed that the powers of war and treaty are in their nature executive; that ſo far as they are not by ſtrict conſtruction transferred to the legiſlature, they actually belong to the executive, that of courſe all powers not leſs executive in their nature than thoſe powers, if not granted to the legiſlature, may be claimed by the executive; if granted, are to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>ſtrictly,</hi> with a reſiduary right in the executive; or, as will hereafter appear, perhaps claimed as a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent right by the executive; and no citizen could any longer gueſs at the character of the government under which he lives; the moſt penetrating juriſt would be unable to ſcan the extent of conſtructive prerogative.</p>
               <p>Leaving however to the leiſure of the reader deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the author having omitted might not chuſe to own, I proceed to the examination of one, with which that liberty cannot be taken.</p>
               <p>"However true it may be (ſays he) that the right of the legiſlature to declare war <hi>includes the right of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> whether the legiſlature be under obligations to make war or not, it will not follow that the executive is <hi>in any caſe</hi> excluded from a <hi>ſimilar right</hi> of judging in the execution of its own functions."</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:030734_0014_0FE8CEA450A2D1D0"/>
               <p>A material error of the writer in this application of his doctrine lies in his ſhrinking from its regular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. Had he ſtuck to his principle in its full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and reaſoned from it without reſtraint, he would only have had to defend himſelf againſt his opponents. By yielding the great point, that the right to declare war, <hi>though to be taken ſtrictly,</hi> includes the right to judge whether the nation be under obligation to make war of not, he is compelled to defend his argument not only againſt others but againſt himſelf alſo. Obſerve how he ſtruggles in his own toils.</p>
               <p>He had before admitted that the right to declare war is veſted in the legiſlature. He here admits that the right to declare war includes the right to judge whether the United States be obliged to declaire war or not. Can the inference be avoided, that the executive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of having a ſimilar right to judge, is as much excluded from the right to judge as from the right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare?</p>
               <p>If the right to declare war be an exception out of the general grant to the executive power; every thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the right muſt be included in the exception; and being included in the exception, is excluded from the grant.</p>
               <p>He cannot diſentangle himſelf by conſidering the right of the executive to judge as <hi>concurrent</hi> with that of the legiſlature. For if the executive have a concurrent right to judge, and the right to judge be included in (it is in fact the very eſſence of) the right to declare, he muſt go on and ſay that the executive has a concurrent right alſo to declare. And then what will he do with his other admiſſion, that the power to declare is an exception out of the executive power.</p>

               <p>Whatever difficulties may ariſe in defining the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive authority in particular caſes, there can be none <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> by the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in another department. In this caſe the conſtitution <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030734_0015_0FE8CEA5E4281698"/> though it may not have clearly decided in every caſe what ſhall be ſo deemed. The <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of war is expreſsly made a legiſlative function. The judging of the obligations to make war; is admitted to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded as a legiſlative function. Whenever then a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion occurs whether war ſhall be declared, or whether public ſtipulations require it, the queſtion neceſſarily belongs to the department to which thoſe functions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long —And no other department can be <hi>in the executive of its preper functions,</hi> if it ſhould undertake to decide ſuch a queſtion.</p>
               <p>There can be no refuge againſt this concluſion, but in the pretext of a <hi>concurrent</hi> right in both departments to judge of the obligations to declare war, and this muſt be intended by the writer when he ſays, "it will not ſollow that the executive is excluded <hi>in any caſe</hi> from a <hi>ſimilar right</hi> of judging, &amp;c."</p>
               <p>As this is the ground on which the ultimate defence is to be made, and which muſt either be maintained, or the works erected on it, demoliſhed; it will be proper to give its ſtrength a fair trial.</p>
               <p>It has been ſeen that the idea of a <hi>concurrent</hi> right is at variance with other ideas advanced or admitted by the writer. Laying aſide for the preſent that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it ſeems impoſſible to avoid concluding that if the executive has a concurrent right with the legiſlature to judge of obligations to declare war, and the right to judge be eſſentially included in the right to declare, it muſt have the ſame right to declare as it has to judge; and by another analogy, the ſame right to judge of other cauſes of war, as of the particular cauſe found in a public ſtipulation. So that whenever the executive <hi>in the courſe of its functions</hi> ſhall meet with theſe caſes, it muſt either infer an equal authority in all, or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge its wants of authority in any.</p>
               <p>If any doubt can remain, or rather if any doubt could ever have ariſen, which ſide of the alternative ought to be embraced, it can be with thoſe only who overlook or reject ſome of the moſt obvious and eſſential truths in political ſcience.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:030734_0016_0FE8CEAED0DB46F0"/>
               <p>The power to judge of the cauſes of war as involved in the power to declare war, is expreſly veſted where all other legiſlative powers are veſted, that is, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the United States: It is conſequently determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the coaſtitution to be a <hi>Legiſlative power.</hi> New omitting the enquiry here in what reſpects a compound power may be partly legiſlative, and partly executive, and accordingly veſted <hi>partly</hi> in the one, and <hi>partly</hi> in the other department, or <hi>jointly</hi> in both; a remark uſed on another occaſion is equally concluſive on this, that the ſame power cannot belong <hi>in the whole,</hi> to <hi>both</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, or be peoperly ſo veſted as to operate <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately</hi> in <hi>each.</hi> Still more evident is it, that the ſame <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific function <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               </p>
               <p>Legiſlative power may be <hi>concurrently</hi> veſted in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent legiſlative bodies. Executive powers may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currently veſted in different executive magiſtrates. In legiſlative acts the executive may have a participation, as in the qualified negative on the laws. In executive acts, the legiſlature, or at leaſt a branch of it, may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate, as in the appointment to offices.— Arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this ſort are familiar in theory, as well as in practice. But an independent exerciſe of an <hi>executive act,</hi> by the legiſlature <hi>alone,</hi> or of a <hi>legiſlative</hi> act by the executive <hi>alone,</hi> one or other of which muſt happen in every caſe where the ſame act is exerciſeable by each, and the latter of which would happen in the caſe urged by the writer, is contrary to one of the firſt and beſt maxims of a well organized government, and ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be founded in a forced conſtruction, much leſs in oppoſition to a fair one. Inſtances, it is true, may be diſcovered among ourſelves where this maxim, has not been faithfully purſued; but being generally acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be errors, they confirm, rather than impeach the truth and value of the maxim.</p>
               <p>It may happen alſo that different independent depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the legiſlative and executive, for example, may in the exerciſe of their functions, interpret the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion differently, and thence lay claim each to the ſame
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030734_0017_0FE8CEB067760148"/>power. This difference of opinion is an inconvenience not entirely to be avoided. It reſults from what may be called, if it be thought fit, a <hi>concurrent</hi> right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the conſtitution. But <hi>this ſpecies</hi> of concurrence is obviouſly and radically different from that in queſtion. The former ſuppoſes the conſtitution to have given the power to one department only; and the doubt to be to which it has been given. The letter ſuppoſes it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to both; and that it may be exerciſed by either or both, according to the courſe of exigencies.</p>
               <p>A concurrent authority in two independent depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perform the ſame function with reſpect to the ſame thing; would be as awkward in practice, as it is unnatural in theory.</p>
               <p>If the legiſlature and executive have both a right to judge of the obligations to make war or not, it muſt ſometimes happen, though not at preſent, that they will judge differently.—The executive may proceed to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the queſtion to day, may determine that the United States are not bound to take part in a war, and <hi>in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of its functions</hi> proclaim that determination to all the world. To-morrow, the legiſlature may follow in the conſideration of the ſame ſubject, may determine that the obligations impoſe war on the United States, and <hi>in the execution of its functions,</hi> enter into a <hi>conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional declaration,</hi> expreſsly contradicting the <hi>conſtitutional proclamation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In what light does this preſent the conſtitution to the people who eſtabliſhed it? In what light would it preſent to the world, a nation, thus ſpeaking, through two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent organs, equally conſtitutional and authentic, two oppoſite languages, on the ſame ſubject and under the ſame exiſting circumſtances?</p>
               <p>But it is not with the legiſlative rights alone that this doctrine interferes. The rights of the judiciary may be equally invaded. For it is clear that if a right declared by the conſtitution to be legiſlative, and actually veſted by it in the legiſlature, leaves, notwithſtanding a ſimilar right in the executive whenever a caſe for exerciſing it occurs, <hi>in the courſe of its functions</hi>; a right declared to be judiciary and veſted in that department may, on the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030734_0018_0FE8CEB8A3824D30"/>ſame principle, be aſſumed and exerciſed by the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>in the courſe of its functions</hi>; and it is evident that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and pretexts for the latter interference may be as frequent as for the former. So again the judiciary department may find equal occaſions in the execution of <hi>its</hi> functions, for uſurping the authorities of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive; and the legiſlature for ſtepping into the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of both. And thus all the powers of government, of which a partition is ſo carefully made among the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral branches, would be thrown into abſolute hotchpot, and expoſed to a general ſcramble.</p>
               <p>It is time however for the writer himſelf to be heard, in defence of his text. His comment is in the words following: "If the legiſlature have a right to make war on the one hand, it is on the other the duty of the executive to preſerve peace, till war is declared; and in fulfilling that duty, it muſt neceſſarily poſſeſs a right of judging what is the nature of the obligations which the treaties of the country impoſe, on the government; and when in purſuance of this right it has concluded that there is nothing inconſiſtent with a ſtate of neutrality, it becomes both its province and its duty to enforce the laws inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to that ſtate of the nation.

               </p>
               <p>And what if it ſhould conclude that there is ſomething inconſiſtent? Is it or is it not the province and duty of the executive to enferce the ſame laws? Say it is, you deſtroy the right to judge. Say it is not, you cancel the duty to obey.</p>
               <p>Take this ſentence in connection with the proced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the contradictions are multiplied. Take it by itſelf, and it makes the right to judge and conclude whether war be obligatory, abſolute, and operative, and the duty to preſerve peace, ſubordinate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>
               <p>It will have been remarked by the attentive reader that the term <hi>peace</hi> in the firſt clauſe has been ſilently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed in the preſent one, for the term <hi>neutrality.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing however is gained by ſhifting the terms. Neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity means peace, with an alluſion to the circumſtance of other nations being at war. The term has no refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the exiſtence or non-exiſtence of treaties or alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances between the nation at peace and the nations at war. The laws incident to a ſtate of neutrality, are the laws incident to a ſtate of peace, with ſuch circumſtantial modifications only as are required by the new relation of the nations at war: Until war thercfore be duly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed by the United States they are as <hi>actually</hi> neutral when other nations are at war, as they are at peace (if ſuch a diſtinction in the terms is to be kept up) when other nations are not at war. The exiſtence of <hi>eventual</hi> engagements which can only take effect on the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the legiſlature, cannot, without that declaration, change the <hi>actual</hi> ſtate of the country, any more in the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030734_0020_0FE8CEC0F4B03C48"/>eye of the executive than in the eye of the judiciary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment. The laws to be the guide of both, remain the ſame to each, and the ſame to both.</p>
               <p>Nor would more be gained by allowing the writer to define than to ſhift the term neutrality. For fuppoſe, if you pleaſe, the exiſtence of obligations to join in war to be inconſiſtens with neutrality, the queſtion returns upon him, what laws are to be inforced by the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive until effect ſhall be given to thoſe obligations by the declaration of the legiſlature? Are they to be the laws incident to thoſe obligations, that is incident to war? However ſtrongly the doctrines or deductions of the writer may tend to this point, it will not be avowed. Are the laws to be enforced by the executive, then, in ſuch a ſtate of things, to be the <hi>ſame</hi> as if no ſuch obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations exiſted? Admit this, which you muſt admit if you reject the other alternative, and the argument lands preciſely were it embarked—in the poſition, that it is the abſolute duty of the executive in all caſes to preſerve peace till war is declared, not that it is "<hi>to become</hi> the province and duty of the executive" after it has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that there is nothing in thoſe obligations inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with a ſtate of peace and neutrality. The right to judge and conclude therefore ſo ſolemnly maintained in the text is loſt in the comment.</p>
               <p>We thall ſee whether it can be reinſtated by what follows—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The executive is charged with the execution of all laws, the laws of nations as well as the municipal law which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizes and adopts thoſe laws. It is conſequently bound, by faithfully exccuting the laws of neutrality when that is the ſtate of the nation, to avoid giving cauſe of war to foreign powers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt ſentence is a truth, but nothing to the point in queſtion. The laſt is <hi>partly true</hi> in its proper meaning, but <hi>totally untrue</hi> in the meaning of the writer. That the execurive is bound faithfully to execute the laws of neutrality, whilſt thoſe laws continue unaltered by the competent authority, is true; but not for the reaſon here given, to wit; to avoid giving cauſe of war to foreign powers. It is bound to the faithful execution of theſe
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030734_0021_0FE8CEC3DF2FC7A8"/>as of all other laws internal and external, by the natura of its truſt and the ſanction of its oath, even if turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent citizens ſhould confider its ſo doing as a cauſe of war at home, or unfriendly nations ſnould conſider its ſo doing, as a cauſe of war abroad. The duty of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceutive to preſerve external peace, can no more ſuſpend the force of external laws, than its duty to preſerve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal peace can ſuſpend the force of municipal laws.</p>
               <p>It is certain that a faithful execution of the laws of neutrality may tend as much in ſome caſes, to incur war from one quarter, as in others to avoid war from other quarters. The executive muſt nevertheleſs exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the laws of neutrality whilſt in ſorce, and leave it to the legiſiature to decide whether they ought to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered or not. The executive has no other diſcretion than to convene and give intormation to the legiſlature on oceaſions that may demand it; and whilſt this diſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is duly exerciſed the truſt of the executive is ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and that department is not reſponſible for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. It could not be made reſponſible for them without veſting it with the legiſlative as well as with the executive truſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe remarks are obvious and concluſive, on the ſuppoſition that the expreſſion "laws of meutrality" means ſimely what the words import, and what alone they can mean, to give force or colour to the i-ference of the writer from his own premiſes. As the inference itſelf however in its proper meaning, does not approach towards his avowed object, which is to work out a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative for the executive to judge, in common with the legiſlature, whether there be cauſe of war or not in a public obligation, it is to be preſumed that "in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executing the laws of neutrality" an exerciſe of that prerogative was meant to be included. On this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition the inference, as will have been ſeen, does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from his own premiſes, and has been alneady ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply diſcuſſed, and, it is conceived, ſo clearly diſproved, that not a word more can be neceſſary on this branch of his argument.</p>

               <p>IN order to give colour to a right in the Executive to exerciſe the Legiſlative power of judging, whether there be a cauſe of war in a public ſtipulation— two other arguments are ſubjoined by the writer to that laſt examined.</p>
               <p>The firſt is ſimply this, "It is the right and duty of the Executive to judge of and interpret thoſe articles of our treaties which give to France particular privileges, <hi>in order to the enforcement of thoſe privileges,</hi>" from which it is ſtated as a neceſſary conſequence, that the Executive has certain other rights, among which is the right in queſtion.</p>
               <p>This argument is anſwered by a very obvious diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The firſt right is eſſential to the execution of the treaty <hi>as a law in operation,</hi> and interferes with no right inveſted in another Department. The ſecond is not eſſential to the execution of the treaty or any other law; on the contrary the article to which the right is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, cannot as has been ſhewn, from the very nature of it be <hi>in operation</hi> as a law without a previous declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Legiſlature; and all the laws to be enforced by the Executive remain in the mean time precifely the ſame, whatever be the diſpoſition or judgment of the Executive. This ſecond right would alſo interfere with a right acknowledged to be in the Legiſlative Depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:030734_0023_0FE8CECDB3F427D8"/>
               <p>If nothing elſe could ſuggeſt this diſtinction to the write, he ought to have been reminded of it by his own words "in order to the enforcement of thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges" —Was it in order to <hi>the enforcement</hi> of the article of guaranty, that the right is aſcribed to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive?</p>
               <p>The other of the two arguments reduces itſelf into the following form: The Executive has the right to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive public Miniſters; this right includes the right of deciding, in the caſe of a revolution, whether the new government ſending the Miniſter, ought to be recognized or not; and this again, the right to give or refuſe opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to pre-exiſting treaties.</p>
               <p>The power of the Legiſlature to declare war and judge of the cauſes for declaring it, is one of the moſt expreſs and explicit parts of the Conſtitution. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to abridge or <hi>affect it</hi> by ſtrained inferences, and by hypothetical or ſingular occurrences, naturally waras the reader of ſome lurking fallacy.</p>
               <p>The words of the Conſtitution are "he (the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) ſhall receive Ambaſſadors, other public Miniſters and Conſuls." I ſhall not undertake to examine what would be the preciſe extent and effect of this function in various caſes which fancy may ſuggeſt, or which time may produce. It will be more proper to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in general, and every candid reader will ſecond the obſervation, that little if any thing more was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the clauſe, than to provide for a particular mode of communication, <hi>almoſt</hi> grown into a right among mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern nations; by pointing out the department of the government, moſt proper for the ceremony of admitting public Miniſters, of examining their credentials, and of authenticating their title to the privileges annexed to their character by the law of nations. This being the apparent deſign of the Conſtitution, it would be highly improper to magnify the function into an important pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, even where no rights of other departments could be affected by it.</p>
               <p>To ſhew that the view here given of the clauſe is not a new conſtruction, invented or ſtrained for a particular occaſion—I will take the liberty of recurring to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030734_0024_0FE8CED5906EE0F0"/>work already quoted, which contains the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and original gloſs put on this part of the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by its friends and advocates.</p>
               <p>The preſident is alſo to be authoriſed to receive Ambaſſadors and other public Miniſters. This, though it has been a rich theme of declamation, is more a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>

                  </hi> than of: <hi>authority.</hi> It is a circumſtance, that will be <hi>without conſequence</hi> in the adminiſtration of the government, and it is far more convenient that it ſhould be arranged in this manner, than that there ſhould be a neceſſity for convening the Legiſlature or one of its branches upon every arrival of a foreign Miniſter, though it were merely to take the place of a departed predeceſſor. Fed. Vol. II. p. 237.</p>
               <p>Had it been foretold in the year 1788 when this work was publiſhed, that before the end of the year 1793, a writer, aſſuming the merit of being a friend to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, would appear, and gravely maintain, that this function, which was to be <hi>without conſequence</hi> in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the government, might have the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of deciding on the validity of revolutions in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of liberty, "of putting the United States in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to become an aſſociate in war,"—nay "of laying the <hi>legiſlature</hi> under an <hi>obligation</hi> of <hi>declaring</hi> war," what would have been thought and ſaid of ſo viſionary a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet?</p>
               <p>The moderate opponents of the Conſtitution would probably have diſowned his extravagance. By the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates of the Conſtitution, his prediction muſt have been treated as "an experiment on public credulity, dictated either by a deliberate intention to deceive, or by the overflowings of a zeal too intemperate to be ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous."</p>
               <p>But how does it follow from the function to receive Ambaſſadors and other public Miniſters that ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential a prerogative may be exerciſed by the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive? When a foreign Miniſter preſents himſelf, two queſtions immediately ariſe? Are his credentials from the exiſting and acting government of his country? Are they properly authenticated? Theſe queſtions belong of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030734_0025_0FE8CED7840D3370"/>to the Executive; but they involve no cognizance of the queſtion, whether thoſe exerciſing the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have the right along with the poſſeſſion. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the nation, and to the nation alone, on whom the government operates. The queſtions before the Executive are merely queſtions of fact; and the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive would have preciſely the ſame right, or rather be under the ſame neceſſity of deciding them, if its functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ſimply to receive <hi>without any diſcretion to reject</hi> public Miniſters. It is evident, therefore, that if the Executive has a right to reject a public Miniſter it muſt be founded on ſome other conſideration than a change in the government or the newneſs of the government; and conſequently a right to refuſe to acknowledge a new go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment cannot be implied by the right to refuſe a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Miniſter.</p>
               <p>It is not denied that there may be caſes in which a reſpect to the general principles of liberty, the effential rights of the people, or the over-ruling ſentiments of humanity, might require a government, whether new or old, to be treated as an illegitimate deſpotiſm. Such are in fact diſcuſſed and admitted by the moſt approved authorities. But they are great and extraordinary caſes, by no means ſubmitted to ſo limited an organ of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional will as the Executive of the United States; and certainly not to be brought, by any torture of words, within the right to receive Ambaſſadors.</p>
               <p>That the authority of the Executive does not extend to queſtion, whether an exiſting government ought to be recognized or not, will ſtill more clearly appear from an examination of the next inference of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to wit, that the Executive has a right to give or refuſe activity and operation to pre-exiſting treaties.</p>
               <p>If there be a principle that ought not to be queſtioned within the United States, it is, that every nation has a right to aboliſh an old government and eſtabliſh a new one. This principle is not only recorded in every public archive, written in every American heart, and ſealed with the blood of a hoſt of American martyrs; but is the only lawful tenure by which the United States hold their exiſtence as a nation.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:030734_0026_0FE8CEDF1D4DD8A8"/>
               <p>It is a principle incorporated with the above, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments are eſtabliſhed for the national good and are organs of the national will.</p>
               <p>From theſe two principles reſults a third, that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties formed by the government, are treaties of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unleſs otherwiſe expreſſed in the treaties.</p>
               <p>Another conſequence is that a nation, by exerciſing the right of changing the organ of its will, can neither diſengage itſelf from the obligations, nor forfeit the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of its treaties. This is a truth of vaſt importance, and happily reſts with ſufficient firmneſs on its own anthority. To ſilence or prevent cavil, I inſert however, the following extracts: <q>Since then ſuch a treaty (a treaty not <hi>perſonal</hi> to the ſovereign) directly relates to the body of the State, it ſubſiſts though the form of the republic happens to be changed, and though it ſhould be even transformed into a monarchy—For the State and the nation are always the ſame whatever changes are made in the form of the government—and the treaty concluded with the nation, remains in force as long as the nation exiſts." Vattel, B. II. § 85.— It follows that as a treaty, notwithſtanding the change of a democratic government into a monarchy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in force with the new King, in like manner; if a <hi>monarchy</hi> becomes a <hi>republie,</hi> the treaty made with the King does not expire on that account, unleſs it was manifeſtly perſonal. <bibl>Burlam. part IV. c. IX, § 16, ¶ 6.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>As a change of government then makes no change in the obligations or rights of the party to a treaty, it is clear that the Executive can have no more right to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend or prevent the operation of a treaty, on account of the change, than to ſuſpend or prevent the operation, where no ſuch change has happened. Nor can it have any more right to ſuſpend the operation of a treaty in force as a law, than to ſuſpend the operation of any other law.</p>
               <p>The logic employed by the writer on this occaſion, will be beſt underſtood by accommodating to it the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a proclamation, founded on the prerogative and policy of ſuſpending the treaty with France.</p>

Secondly, becauſe the judiciary, being an independent department, and acting under an oath to purſue the law of treaties as the ſupreme law of the land, might nor readily follow the executive example, and a <hi>right</hi> in <hi>one expoſitor</hi> of treaties, to conſider them as <hi>not in force,</hi> whilſt it would be the <hi>duty</hi> of <hi>another expoſitor</hi> to conſider them as <hi>in force,</hi> would be a phaenomenon not ſo eaſy to be explained. Indeed as the doctrine ſtands qualified, it leaves the executive the right of ſuſpending the law of treaties in relation to rights of one deſcription, without exempting it from the duty of enforcing it in relation to rights of another deſcription.</p>
               <p>But the writer is embarked in ſo unſound an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he does not ſave the reſt of his inference by this ſacrifice of one half of it. It is not true, that <hi>all public rights</hi> are of courſe ſuſpended by a refuſal to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the government, or even by a ſuſpenſion of the government. And in the next place, the right in queſtion does not follow from the neceſſary ſuſpenſion of public rights, in conſequence of a refulſal to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the government.</p>
               <p>Public rights are of two ſorts; thoſe which require the agency of government; thoſe which may be carried into effect without that agency.</p>
               <p>As public rights are the rights of the nation, not of the government, it is clear that wherever they can be made good to the nation, without the office of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are not ſuſpended by the want of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged government, or even by the want of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting government; and that there are important rights of this deſcription, will be illuſtrated by the following caſe: Suppoſe, that after the coucluſion of the treaty of alliance between the United States and France, a party
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030734_0030_0FE8CEE9EBFA4918"/>of the enemy had ſurpriſed and put to death every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of congreſs; that the occaſion had been uſed by the people of America for changing the old confederacy into ſuch a government as now exiſts, and that in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of this revolution, an interregnum had happened. Suppoſe further, that during this interval, the ſtates of South-Carolina and Georgia, or any other parts of the United States, had been attacked, and been put into evident and imminent danger of being irrecoverably loft, without the interpoſition of the French arms; is it not manifeſt, that as the Treaty is the Treaty of the United States, not of their government, the people of the United States, could not forfeit their right to the guarantee of their territory by the accidental ſuſpenſion of their government; and that any attempt, on the part of France, to evade the obligations of the Treaty, by pleading the ſuſpenſion of government, or by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to acknowledge it, would juſtly have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with univerſal indignation, as an ignominious perfidy?</p>
               <p>With reſpect to public rights that cannot take effect in favour of a nation without the agency of its govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is admitted that they are ſuſpended of courſe where there is no government in exiſtence, and alſo by a refuſal to acknowledge an exiſting government. But no inference in favour of <hi>a right</hi> to ſuſpend the operation of Treaties, can be drawn from either caſe. Where the exiſtence of the government is ſuſpended, it is a caſe of neceſſity; it would be a caſe happening without the act of the executive, and conſequently could prove nothing for or againſt the right.</p>
               <p>In the other caſe, to wit, of a refuſal by the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to recogniſe an <hi>exiſting government,</hi> however certain it may be, that a ſuſpenſion of ſome of the public rights might enſue; yet it is equally certain, that the refuſal would be without right or authority; and that no right or authority could be implied or produced by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>authoriſed act. If a right to do whatever might bear an analogy to the neceſſary conſequence of what was done without right, could be inferred from the analogy, there would be no other limit to power than the limit to its ingenuity.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:030734_0031_0FE8CEF25BE75750"/>
               <p>It is no anſwer to ſay, that it may be doubtful whether a government does or does not exiſt; or doubtful which may be the exiſting and acting government. The caſe ſtated by the writer is, that there are exiſting rulers; that there is an acting government; but that they are <hi>new</hi> rulers; and that it is a <hi>new</hi> government. The full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, however, is to repeat what has been already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; that queſtions of this ſort are mere queſtions of fact; that as ſuch only, they belong to the executive; that they would equally belong to the executive, if it was tied down to the reception of public miniſters, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſcretion to receive or reject them; that where the fact appears to be, that no government exiſts, the conſequential ſuſpenſion is independent of the executive; that where the fact appears to be, that the government does exiſt, the executive muſt be governed by the fact, and can have no right or diſcretion, on account of the date or form of the government, to refuſe to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, either by rejecting its public miniſter, or by any other ſtep taken on that account. If it does refuſe on that account, the refuſal is a wrongful act, and can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prove nor illuſtrate a rightful power.</p>
               <p>I have ſpent more time on this part of the diſcuſſion than may appear to ſome, to have been requiſite. But it was conſidered as a proper opportunity for preſenting ſome important ideas, connected with the general ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and it may be of uſe in ſhewing how very ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially, as well as erroneouſly, the writer has treated it.</p>
               <p>In other reſpects ſo particular an inveſtigation was leſs neceſſary. For allowing it to be, as contended, that a ſuſpenſion of treaties might happen from a <hi>conſequential</hi> operation of a right to receive public miniſters, which is an <hi>expreſs right</hi> veſted by the conſtitution; it could be no proof, that the ſame or a <hi>ſimilar</hi> effect could be produced by the <hi>direct</hi> operation of a <hi>conſtructive power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence the embarraſſments and groſs contradictions of the writer in defining, and applying his ultimate infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from the operation of the executive power with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to public miniſters.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:030734_0032_0FE8CEF40C5E36C8"/>
               <p>As firſt it exhibits an "impertant inſtance of the right of the executive to decide the obligation of the nation: with regard to foreign nations."</p>
               <p>Riſing from that, it confers on the executive, a right "to put the United States in a condition to become an aſſociate in war."</p>
               <p>And, at its full height authoriſes the executive "to lay the legiſlature under <hi>an obligation</hi> of declaring war."</p>
               <p>From this towering prerogative, it ſuddenly brings down the executive to the right of "<hi>conſequentially affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the proper or improper exerciſe of the power of the legiſlature to declare war.</p>
               <p>And then, by a caprice as unexpected as it is ſudden, it eſpouſes the cauſe of the legiſlature; reſcues it from the executive right "to lay it under an <hi>obligation</hi> of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring war"; and aſſerts it to be "free to perform its <hi>own</hi> duties, according to its <hi>own</hi> ſenſe of them," without any other controul than what it is liable to, in every other legiſlative act.</p>
               <p>The point at which it finally ſeems to reſt, is, that "the executive in the exerciſe of its <hi>conſtitutional powers,</hi> may eſtabluh an antecedent ſtate of things, which ought to <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> in the <hi>legiſlative deciſions;</hi>" a prerogative which will import a great deal, or nothing, according to the handle by which you take it; and which, at the ſame time, you can take by no handle that does not claſh with ſome inference preceding.</p>
               <p>If "by weighing in the legiſlative deciſions" be meant having <hi>an influence</hi> on the <hi>expediency</hi> of this or that deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the <hi>opinion</hi> of the legiſlature; this is no more than what every antecedent ſtate of things ought to have, from whatever cauſe proceeding; whether from the uſe or abuſe of conſtitutional powers, or from the exerciſe of conſtitutional or aſſumed powers. In this ſenſe the power to eſtabliſh an antecedent ſtate of things is not conſtituted. But then it is of no uſe to the writer, and is alſo in direct contradiction to the inference, that the executive may "lay the <hi>legiſlature</hi> under an <hi>obligation</hi> to decide in favour of <hi>war.</hi>"</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:030734_0033_0FE8CEFBA12CD410"/>
               <p>If the meaning be as is implied by the force of the terms "conſtitutional powers," that the antecedent ſtate of things produced by the executive, ought to have a <hi>conſtitutional weight</hi> with the legiſlature: or, in plainer words, impoſes a <hi>conſtitutional obligation</hi> on the <hi>legiſlative deciſions,</hi> the writer will not only have to combat the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments by which ſuch a prerogative has been diſproved: but to reconcile it with his laſt conceſſion, that "the legiſlature is <hi>free</hi> to perform its duties according to its <hi>own</hi> ſenſe of them." He muſt ſhew that the legiſlature is, at the ſame time, <hi>conſtitutionally free</hi> to purſue its <hi>own judgment</hi> and <hi>conſtitutionally bound</hi> by the <hi>judgment of the executive.</hi>

               <p>THE laſt papers compleated the view propoſed to be taken of the arguments in ſupport of the new and aſpiring doctrine, which aſcribes to the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive the prerogative of judging and decidiag whether there be cauſes of war or not, in the obligations of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; notwithſtanding the expreſs proviſion in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution by which the legiſlature is made the organ of the national will, on queſtions whether there be or be not a cauſe for declaring war. If the anſwer to theſe arguments has imparted the conviction which dictated
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030734_0034_0FE8CEFD34D44AC0"/>it, the reader will have pronounced, that they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuperficial, abounding in contradictions, never in the leaſt degree concluſive to the main point, and not unfrequently concluſive againſt the writer himſelf: whilſt the doctrine—that the powers of treaty and war, are in their nature executive powers—which forms the baſis of thoſe arguments, is as indefenſible and as danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as the particular doctrine to which they are appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>But it is not to be forgotten that theſe doctrines, though ever ſo clearly diſproved, or ever ſo weakly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, remain before the public a ſtriking monument of the principles and views which are entertained and propagated in the community.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be remembered, that however the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences flowing from ſuch premiſes, may be diſavow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this time or by this individual, we are to regard it as morally certain, that in proportion as the doctrines make their way into the creed of the government, and the acquieſcence of the public, every power that can be deduced from them, will be deduced, and exerciſed ſooner or later by thoſe who may have an intereſt in ſo doing: The character of human nature gives this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary warning to every ſober and reflecting mind. And the hiſtory of government, in all its forms and in every period of time, ratifies the danger. A people therefore, who are ſo happy as to poſſeſs the ineſtimable bleſſing of a free and defined conſtitution, cannot be too watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful againſt the introduction, nor too critical in tracing the conſequences, of new principles and new conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that may remove the land marks of power.</p>
               <p>Should the prerogative which has been examined, be allowed in its moſt limited ſenſe, to uſurp the public countenance, the interval would probably be very ſhort, before it would be heard from ſome quarter or other, that the prerogative either amounts to nothing, or means a right to judge and conclude that the obligations of treaty impoſe war, as well as that they permit peace. That it is fair reaſoning, to ſay, that if the prerogative exiſts at all, an <hi>operative</hi> rather than an <hi>inert</hi> character ought to be given to it.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:030734_0035_0FE8CF05249C3528"/>
               <p>In ſupport of this concluſion, there would be enough to echo, "that the prerogative in this active ſenſe, is connected with the executive in various capacities—as the organ of intercourſe between the nation and foreign nations—as the interpreter of national treaties" (a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of which may be a cauſe of war) "as that power which is charged with the execution of the laws of which treaties make a part—as that power, which is charged with <hi>the command and application of the public force."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With additional force, it might be ſaid, that the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive is as much the <hi>executor</hi> as the <hi>interpreter</hi> of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: that if by virtue of the <hi>firſt</hi> character, it is to judge of the <hi>obligations</hi> of treaties, it is by virtue of the <hi>ſecond,</hi> equally authoriſed to carry thoſe obligations <hi>into effect.</hi> Should there occur for example, a <hi>caſus federis,</hi> claiming a military co-operation of the United States and a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary force ſhould happen to be under the command of the executive, it muſt have the ſame right, as <hi>executor of public treaties</hi> to <hi>employ</hi> the public force, as it has in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>interproier of public treaties</hi> to decide whether it ought to be <hi>employed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The caſe of a treaty of peace would be an auxiliary to comments of this ſort: It is a condition annexed to every treaty that an infraction even of an important ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, on one ſide, extinguiſhes the obligations on the other: and the immediate conſequence of a diſſolution of a treaty of peace is a reſtoration of a ſtate of war. If the executive is "to decide on the obligation of the nation with regard to foreign nations"—"to pronounce the <hi>exiſting condition</hi> (in the ſenſe annexed by the writer) of the nation with regard to them; and to admoniſh the citizens of their obligations and duties as founded upon <hi>that condition</hi> of things."—"to judge what are the <hi>recibrocal rights</hi> and obligations of the United States, and of all and each of the powers at war:"—add, that if the executive moreover poſſeſſes all powers relating to war <hi>not ſtrictly</hi> within the power <hi>to declare war,</hi> which any pupil of political caſuiſtry, could diſtinguiſh from a mere <hi>relapſe</hi> into a war, that <hi>had been declared</hi>: With this ſtore of materials and the example given of the uſe
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030734_0036_0FE8A786D426B8D0"/>to be made of them, would it be difficult to fabricate a power in the executive to plunge the nation into war, whenever a treaty of peace might happen to be infring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</p>
               <p>But if any difficulty ſhould ariſe, there is another mode chalked out by which the end might clearly be brought about, even without the violation of the treaty of peace; eſpecially if the other party ſhould happen to change its government at the criſis. The executive, in that caſe, could <hi>ſuſpend</hi> the treaty of peace <hi>by refuſing to receive an ambaſſador</hi> from the <hi>new</hi> government, and the ſtate of war <hi>emerges of courſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a ſample of the uſe to which the extraordinary publication we are reviewing, might be turned. Some of the inferences could not be repelled at all. And the leaſt regular of them muſt go ſmoothly down with thoſe, who had ſwallowed the groſs ſophiſtry which wrapped up the original doſe.</p>
               <p>Every juſt view that can be taken of this ſubject, admoniſhes the public, of the neceſſity of a rigid adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the ſimple, the received and the fundamental doctrine of the conſtitution, that the power to declare war including the power of judging of the cauſes of war is <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>excluſively</hi> veſted in the legiſlature; that the executive has no right, in any caſe to decide the queſtion, whether there is or is not cauſe for declaring war: that the right of convening and informing Congreſs, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſuch a queſtion ſeems to call for a deciſion, is all the right which the conſtitution has deemed requiſite or proper; and that for ſuch, more than for any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency, this right was ſpecially given to the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>In no part of the conſtitution is more wiſdom to be ſound than in the clauſe which conſides the queſtion of war or peace to the legiſlature, and not to the executive department. Beſide the objection to ſuch a mixture of heterogeneous powers; the truſt and the temptation would be too great for any one man: not ſuch as nature may offer as the prodigy of many centuries, but ſuch as may be expected in the ordinary ſucceſſions of magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. War is in fact the true nurſe of executive aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizement.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030734_0037_0FE8CF0E61BFE480"/>In war a phyſical force is to be created, and it is the executive will which is to direct it. In war the public treaſures are to be unlocked, and it is the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive hand which is to diſpenſe them. In war the honors and emoluments of office are to be multiplied; and it is the executive patronage under which they are to be enjoyed. It is in war, finally, that laurels are to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and it is the executive brow they are to encircle. The ſtrongeſt paſſions, and moſt dangerous weakneſſes of the human breaſt; ambition, avarice, vanity, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable or venial love of fame, are all in conſpiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the deſire and duty of peace.</p>
               <p>Hence it has grown into an axiom that the executive is the department of power moſt diſtinguiſhed by its propenſity to war: hence it is the practice of all ſtates, in proportion as they are free, to diſarm this propenſity of its influence.</p>
               <p>As the beſt praiſe then that can be pronounced on an executive magiſtrate, is, that he is the friend of peace; a praiſe that riſes in its value, as there may be a known capacity to ſhine in war: ſo it muſt be one of the moſt ſacred duties of a free people, to mark the firſt omen in the ſociety, of principles that may ſtimulate the hopes of other magiſtrates of another propenſity, to intrude into queſtions on which its gratification depends. If a free people be a wiſe people alſo, they will not forget that the danger of ſurpriſe can never be ſo great, as when the advocates for the prerogative of war, can ſheathe it in a ſymbol of peace.</p>
               <p>The conſtitution has manifeſted a ſimilar prudence in refuſing to the executive the <hi>ſole</hi> power of making peace. The truſt in this inſtance alſo, would be too great for the wiſdom, and the temptations too ſtrong for the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, of a ſingle citizen. The principal reaſons on which the conſtitution proceeded in its regulation of the power of treatics, including treaties of peace, are ſo aptly furniſhed by the work already quoted more than once, that I ſhall borrow another comment from that ſource.</p>
               <p>"However proper or ſafe it may be in a government where the executive magiſtrate is an hereditary monarch to commit to him the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> power of making treaties,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030734_0038_0FE8CF1062F62648"/>it would be utterly unſafe and improper to entruſt that power to an elective magiſtrate of four years duration. It has been remarked upon another occaſion, and the remark is unqueſtionably juſt, that an hereditary mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, though often the oppreſſor of his people, has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally too much at ſtake in the government to be in any material danger of being corrupted by foreign powers. But that a man raiſed from the ſtation of a private citizen to the rank of chief magiſtrate, poſſeſſed of but a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or ſlender fortune, and looking forward to a period not very remote, when he may probably be obliged to return to the ſtation from which he was taken, might ſometimes be under temptations to ſacrifice his duty to his intereſt, which it would require ſuperlative virtue to withſtand. An avaricious man might be tempted to betray the intereſts of the ſtate to the acquiſition of wealth. An ambitious man might make his own ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandizement, by the aid of a foreign power, the price of his treachery to his conſtituents—The hiſtory of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of human virtue, which would make it wiſe in a nation, to commit intereſts of ſo delicate and momentous a kind as <hi>thoſe which concern its intercourſe</hi> with the reſt of the world, to the <hi>ſole</hi> diſpoſal of a magiſtrate, created and circumſtanced, as would be a Preſident of the United States."</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this paper and this branch of the ſubject, with two reflections, which naturally ariſe from this view of the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that as the perſonal intereſt of an heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary monarch in the government, is the <hi>only</hi> ſecurity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the temptation incident to a commitment of the delicate and momentous intereſts of the nation which concern its intercourſe with the reſt of the world, to the diſpoſal of a ſingle magiſtrate, it is a plain conſequence, that every addition that may be made to the <hi>ſole</hi> agency and influence of the executive, in the intercourſe of the nation with foreign nations, is an increaſe of the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous temptation to which an <hi>elective and temporary</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is expoſed; and an <hi>argument</hi> and <hi>advance</hi> towards
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030734_0028_0FE8CDEA12EB71E0"/>the ſecurity afforded by the perſonal intereſts of an <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary</hi> magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As the conſtitution has not permitted the executive <hi>ſingly</hi> to conclude or judge that peace ought to be made, it might be inferred from that circumſtance alone, that it never meant to give it authority, <hi>ſingly,</hi> to judge and conclude that war ought not to be made. The truſt would be preciſely ſimilar and equivalent in the two caſes. The right to ſay that war ought not to go on, would be no greater than the right to ſay that war ought to begin. Every danger of error or corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, incident to ſuch a prerogative in one caſe, is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to it in the other. If the Conſtitution therefore has deemed it unſafe or improper in the one caſe, it muſt be deemed equally ſo in the other caſe</p>

               <head>No. V.</head>
               <p>HAVING ſeen that the executive has no conſtitutional right to interfere in any queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be or be not a cauſe of war, and the extenſive conſequences flowing from the doctrines on which a claim has been aſſerted, it remains to be enquired whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the writer is better warranted in the fact which he aſſumes, namely that the proclamation of the executive has undertaken to decide the queſtion, whether there be a cauſe of war or not, in the article of guaranty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the United States and France, and, in ſo doing has exerciſed the right which is claimed for that depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed to the examination of this point, it may not be amiſs to advert to the novelty of the phraſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology, as well as of the doctrines, expounded by this writer. The ſource from which the former is evidently borrowed, may enlighten our conjectures with regard to the ſource of the latter. It is a juſt obſervation alſo that words have often a gradual influence on ideas, and when uſed in an improper ſenſe, may cover fallacies which would not otherwiſe eſcape detection.</p>
               <p>I allude panicularly to his application of the term <hi>government</hi> to the <hi>executive authority alone.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation is "a manifeſtation of the ſenſe of the <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi>" why did not the <hi>government</hi> wait, &amp;c.— "The policy on the part of the <hi>government</hi> of removing

                  </note> "It was of great importance that our citizens ſhould underſtand as early as poſſible the opinion entertained by the <hi>government,</hi> &amp;c." If in addition to the reſt, the early manifeſtation of <hi>the views</hi> of the <hi>government,</hi> had any effect <hi>in fixing the public opinion,</hi> &amp;c. the reader will probably be ſtruck with the reflection, that if the Proclamation really poſſeſed the character, and was to have the effects, here <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to it, ſomething more than the authority of <hi>the government,</hi> in the writer's ſenſe of government, would have been a neceſſary ſanction to the act, and if the term "government" be removed, and that of "Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent" ſubſtituted, in the ſentences quoted, the juſtice of the reflection will be felt with peculiar force. But I remark only, on the ſingularity of the ſtile adopted by the writer, as ſhewing either that the phraſeology of a foreign government is more familiar to him than the phraſeology proper to our own, or that he wiſhes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate a familiarity of the former in preference to the latter. I do not know what degree of diſapprobation others may think due to this innovation of language, but I conſider it as far above a trivial criticiſm, to obſerve that it is by no means unworthy of attention, whether viewed with an eye to its probable cauſe, or its apparent tendency. "The government," unqueſtionably means in the United States the whole government, not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive part, either excluſively, or <hi>pre-eminently</hi>; as it may do in a monarchy, where the ſplendor of preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive eclipſes, and the machinary of influence, directs, every other part of the government.—In the former and proper ſenſe, the term has hitherto been uſed in official proceedings, in public diſcuſſions, and in private diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. It is as ſhort and as eaſy, and leſs liable to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſion, to ſay, the Executive or the Preſident, as to ſay the government. In a word the new dialect could not proceed either from neceſſity, conveniency, proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or perſpicuity; and being in oppoſition to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſage, ſo marked a fondneſs for it, juſtifies the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030734_0041_0FE8CF218F4076F8"/>notice here taken of it. It ſhall no longer detain me, however, from the more important ſubject of the preſent paper.</p>
               <p>I proceed therefore to obſerve that as a "Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion," in its <hi>ordinary</hi> uſe, is an ad reſs to citizens or ſubjects only; as it is always underſtood to relate to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> law <hi>actually in operation,</hi> and to be an act <hi>purely</hi> and <hi>excluſively</hi> executive; there can be no implication in the <hi>name</hi> or the <hi>form</hi> of ſuch an inſtrument, that it was meant <hi>principally,</hi> for the information of foreign nations; far leſs that it related to an <hi>eventual ſtipulation</hi> on a ſubject, <hi>acknowledged</hi> to be within the <hi>legiſlative pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the writer therefore undertook to engraſt his new prerogative on the Proclamation, by aſcribing to it ſo unuſual, and unimplied a meaning, it was evidently incumbent on him to ſhew, that the <hi>text</hi> of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could not be ſatisfied by any other conſtruction than his own. Has he done this? No. What has be done? He has called the Proclamation a Proclamation of neutrality; he has put his own arbitrary meaning on that phraſe, and has then proceeded in his arguments and his inferences, with as much confidence, as if no queſtion was ever to be aſked, whether the term "neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality" be in the Proclamation; or whether, if there, it could juſtify the uſe he makes of it.</p>
               <p>It has appeared from obſervations already made, that if the term "neutrality" was in the Proclamation, it could not avail the writer, in the preſent diſcuſſion; but the fact is no ſuch term is to be found in it, nor any other term, of a meaning equivalent to that, in which the term neutrality is uſed by him.</p>
               <p>There is the leſs pretext, in the preſent caſe, for hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after any latent or extraordinary object becauſe an obvious and legal one, is at band, to ſatisfy the occaſion on which the Proclamation iſſued. The exiſtence of war among ſeveral nations with which the United States have an extenſive intercourſe; the duty of the executive to preſerve peace by enforcing its laws, whilſt thoſe laws continued in force; the danger that indiſcreet citizens might be tempted or ſurpriſed by the criſis, into unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful proceedings, tending to involve the United States in
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030734_0042_0FE8CF2321A2D700"/>a war, which the competent authority might decide them to be at liberty to avoid, and which, if they ſhould be judged not at liberty to avoid, the other party to the <hi>eventual contract,</hi> might not be willing to impoſe on them; there ſurely might have been ſufficient grounds for the meaſure purſued by the executive, and being le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and rational grounds, it would be wrong, if there be no neceſſity, to look beyond them.</p>
               <p>If there be any thing in the Proclamation of which the writer could have made a handle, it is the part which declares, the <hi>diſpoſition,</hi> the <hi>duty</hi> and the <hi>intereſt</hi> of the United States, in relation to the war exiſting in Europe. As the Legiſlature is the only competent and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional organ of the will of the nation; that is, of its diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, its <hi>duty</hi> and its intereſt, in relation to a commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of war, in like manner as the Preſident and Senate <hi>jointly,</hi> not the Preſident <hi>alone,</hi> are in relation to peace, after war has been commenced—I will not diſſemble my wiſh that a language leſs expoſed to criticiſm had been prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but taking the expreſſions, in the ſente of the writer himſelf; as analogous to the language which might be proper, on the reception of a public Miniſter, or any ſimilar occaſion, it is evident, that his conſtruction can derive no ſuccour, even from this reſource.</p>
               <p>If the Proclamation then does not <hi>require</hi> the conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which this writer has taken the liberty of putting on it; I leave it to be decided whether the following conſiderations do not forbid us to ſuppoſe, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident could have intended, by that act, to embrace and prejudge the Legiſlative queſtion whether there was, or was not, under the circumſtances of the caſe, a cauſe of war in the article of guaranty.</p>
               <p>It has been ſhewn that ſuch an intention would have uſurped a prerogative not veſted in the executive, and even <hi>confeſſedly</hi> veſted in another department.</p>
               <p>In exerciſing the Conſtitutional power of deciding a queſtion of war, the Legiſlature ought to be as free to decide, according to its own ſenſe of the public good, on one ſide as on the other ſide. Had the Proclamation prejudged the queſtion on either ſide, and <hi>proclaimed its deciſion to the world</hi>; the Legiſlature inſtead of being as free as it ought, might be thrown under the dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030734_0043_0FE8CF2B80F3E580"/>of either ſacrificing its judgment to that of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive; or by oppoſing the executive judgment, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a relation between the two departments, extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delicate among ourſelves, and of the worſt influence on the national character and intereſts abroad; a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this nature, it will readily be perceived, would be very different from a want of conformity to the <hi>mere recommendations</hi> of the executive, in the meaſures adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Legiſlature.</p>
               <p>It does not appear that ſuch a Proclamation could have even pleaded any call, from either of the parties at war with France, for an explanation of the light in which the guaranty was viewed—whilſt, indeed, no poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive indication whatever was given of hoſtile purpoſes, it is not conceived, that any power could have decently made ſuch an application—or if they had, that a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, would have been either a ſatisfactory, or an honorable anſwer. It could not have been ſatisfactory, if ſerious apprehenſions were entertained, becauſe it would not have proceeded from that authority which alone could definitely pronounce the will of the United States on the ſubject. It would not have been honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe a private diplomatic anſwer only is due to a private diplomatic application; and to have done ſo much more, would have marked a puſilanimity and want of dignity in the Executive Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>But whether the executive was or was not applied to, or whatever weight be allowed to that circumſtance, it ought never to be preſumed, that the executive would ſo abruptly, ſo publicly, and ſo ſolemnly, proceed to diſclaim a ſenſe of the contract, which the other party might conſider and wiſh to ſupport by diſcuſſion as its true and reaſonable import. It is aſked, indeed, in a tone that ſufficiently diſplays the ſpirit in which the writer conſtrues both the Proclamation and the treaty, "Did the executive ſtand in need of the logic of a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign agent to enlighten it as to the duties or the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the nation; or was it bound to aſk his conſent to a ſtep which appeared to itſelf conſiſtent with the former, and conducive to the latter? The ſenſe of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties was to be learnt from the treaties themſelves." Had he conſulted his Vattel, inſtead of his animoſity to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030734_0044_0FE8CF2D161E9130"/>France, he would have diſcovered that however humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating it might be to wait for a foreign logic, to aſſiſt the interpretation of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Neither of them can have a right more than the other, to ſay what a particular article means; and where there is equality without a judge, conſultation is as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with dignity as it is conducive to harmony and friendſhip; let Vattel however be heard on the ſubject. <q>The third general maxim, or principle, on the ſubject of interpretation [of Treaties] is: "<hi>that neither the one nor the other of the intereſted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting powers has a right to interpret the act or treaty at us pleaſure.</hi> For if you are at liberty to give my promiſe what ſenſe you pleaſe, you will have the power of obliging me to do whatever you have a mind, contrary to my intention, and beyond my real engagement: and reciprocally, <hi>If I am allowed to explain my promiſes as I pleaſe, I may render them vain and illuſive, by giving them a ſenſe quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that in which they were preſented to you, and in which you muſt have taken them in accepting them.</hi>

               <p>The writer ought to have been particularly ſenſible of the improbability that a precipitate and <hi>exparte</hi> deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the queſtion ariſing under the guaranty, could have been intended by the proclamation. He had but juſt gone through his undertaking, to prove that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of guaranty like the reſt of the treaty is defenſive, not offenſive. He had examined his books and retailed his quotations, to ſhew that the criterion between the two kinds of war is the circumſtance of priority in the attack. He could not therefore but know, that according to his own principles, the queſtion whether the United States, were under an obligation or not to take part in the war, was a <hi>queſtion of fact</hi> whether the firſt attack was made by France or her enemies. And to decide a queſtion of fact, as well as of principle, without waiting
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030734_0045_0FE8CF33ACA31BD8"/>for ſuch repreſentations and proofs, as the abſent and intereſted party might have to prudence, would have been a proceeding contrary to the ordinary maxims of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and requiring circumſtances of a very peculiar na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to warrant it, towards any nation. Towards a nation which could verify her claim to more than bare juſtice by our own reiterated and formal acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and which muſt in her preſent ſingular and intereſting ſituation have a peculiar ſenſibility to marks of our friendſhip or alienation, the impropriety of ſuch a proceeding would be infinitely increaſed, and in the fame proportion the improbability of its having taken place.</p>
               <p>There are reaſons of another ſort which would have been a bar to ſuch a proceeding. It would have been as impolitic as it would have been unfair and unkind.</p>
               <p>If France meant not to inſiſt on the guaranty, the meaſure, without giving any preſent advantage, would have deprived the United States of a future claim which may be of importance to their ſafety. It would have inſpired France with jealouſies of a ſecret bias in this country toward ſome of her enemies, which might have left in her breaſt a ſpirit of contempt and revenge of which the effects might be felt in various ways. It muſt in particular have tended to inſpire her with a diſincli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to ſeed our commerce with thoſe important ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which it already enjoys, and thoſe more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ones, which it anxiouſly contemplates. The nation that conſumes more of the fruits of our ſoil than any other nation in the world, and ſupplies the only foreign raw material of extenſive uſe in the United States would not be unneceſſarily provoked by thoſe who underſtand the public intereſt, and make it their ſtudy, as it is their intereſt to advance it.</p>
               <p>I am aware that the common-place remark will be interpoſed, that, "commercial privileges are not worth having, when not ſecured by mutual intereſt; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver worth purchaſing becauſe they will grow of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of a mutual intereſt." Prudent men, who do not ſuffer their reaſon to be miſled by their prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will view the ſubject in a juſter light. They will reflect, that if commercial privileges are not worth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing, they are worth having without purchaſe; that
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030734_0046_0FE8CF36E7887008"/>in the commerce of a great nation, there are valuable privileges which may be granted or not granted, or granted either to this or that country, without any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible influence on the intereſt of the nation itſelf; that the friendly or unfriendly diſpoſition of a country, is always an article of moment in the calculations of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive intereſt: that ſome ſacrifices of intereſt will be made to other motives: by nations as well as by individuals, though not with the ſame frequency, or in the ſame proportions, that more of a diſintereſted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct or of a conduct founded on liberal views of intereſt, prevails in ſome nations than in others, that as far as can be ſeen of the influence of the revolution on the genius and the policy of France, particularly with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the United States, every thing is to be hoped by the latter on this ſubject, which one country can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably hope from another. In this point of view a greater <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> could not have been committed than in a ſtep, that might have turned the preſent diſpoſition of France to open her commerce to us as far as a liberal calculation of her intereſt would permit, and her friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip towards us, and confidence in our friendſhip to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her. could prompt, into a diſpoſition to ſhut it as cloſely againſt us as the united motives of intereſt, of diſtruſt, and of ill-will, could urge her.</p>
               <p>On the ſuppoſition that France might intend to claim the guaranty, a haſty and harſh refuſal before we were aſked. on a ground that accuſed her of being the aggreſſor in the war againſt every power in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of her enemies, and in a criſis when all her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility muſt be alive towards the United States, would have given every poſſible irritation to a diſappointment which every motive that one nation could feel towards another and towards itſelf, required to be alleviated by all the circumſpection and delicacy that could be applied to the occaſion.</p>
               <p>The ſilence of the Executive ſince the acceſſion of Spain and Portugal to the war againſt France throws great light on the preſent diſcuſſion. Had the procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation been iſſued in the ſenſe, and for the purpoſes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to it, that is to ſay, as a declaration of neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, another would have follouted, on that event.

The opinion of the Executive with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to a conſiſtency or inconſiſtency of neutrality with treaties in the <hi>latter caſe</hi> could not be <hi>inſerred</hi> from the proclamation in the former, becauſe the <hi>circumſtances might be different.</hi> Taking the proclamation in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe, as reminding all concerned, that as the United States were at peace (that ſtate not being affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by foreign wars, and only to be changed by the legiſlative authority of the country) the laws of peace were ſtill obligatory and would be enforced, and the inference is ſo obvious and ſo applicable to all other caſes <hi>whatever circumſtances</hi> may diſtinguiſh them, that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proclamation would be unneceſſary. Here is a new aſpect of the whole ſubject, admoniſhing us in the moſt ſtriking manner at once of the danger of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative contended for, and the abſurdity of the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and arguments employed in its favour. It would be as impoſſible in practice, as it is in theory, to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the power of judging and concluding, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of a treaty do not impoſe war from that of judging and concluding that the obligations <hi>do impoſe war.</hi> In certain caſes, ſilence would proclaim the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concluſion, as intelligibly as words could do the former. The writer indeed has himſelf abandoned the diſtinction in his VIIth paper, by declaring expreſsly that the object of the proclamation would have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated "by leaving it uncertain whether the Executive did or <hi>did not</hi> believe a ſtate of neutrality to be conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with our treaties".</p>
