            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE BY THE AUTHOR.</head>
            <p>THIS piece is a continuation of my "Virgin of the Sun." My worthy friend, Mr. Schroeder, has made several slight al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in it, upon which I, relying on his secrecy<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> might safely hold my peace; but which I shall now gratefully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; partly, because I am not ashamed to take instruction from such a man as Schroeder; partly, because otherwise some ill-tempered critic may, as heretofore, upon the applause which the piece receives, rush forward, like an envious blood-hound, to lessen my share of merit with the public. The alterations are such as Mr. Schroeder made himself, or such as I have made by his advice.</p>
            <p>To the first of these belongs, in preference, the expunging a scene of Diego's, which, without having any connection with the interest of the whole, interrupted, by untimely jests, the progress of the first act. Further, the suppression of a finale, and an air which Elvira, very unseasonably, sung to the guitar. Further, the circumstance, that Pizarro only guessed at Elvira's design upon his life, which, before this alteration, Rolla, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hesitation, discovered to him; and thereby, perhaps, cast an appearance of ungenerous conduct upon his character. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the mitigating Pizarro's baseness, where he, in violation of his promise, seeks to get Rolla again in his power.</p>
            <p>I have myself, at his desire, metamorphosed Valverde the priest, into a private secretary; because, wicked priests can be tolerated only on the great theatre of the world, and not upon the stage of a play-house. But I designed this alteration only for the stage; and, that the press should restore this wretch again to his historical character. At present I have neither time nor inclination to attend farther to him.</p>
            <p>Unquestionably, the alteration which has been most service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the piece is, the ennobling of Elvira's character, which I undertook by his advice, and for which I sincerely thank him.</p>
            <p>Other alterations, which Mr. Schroeder thought proper to recommend, in compliance with the spirit of the times, I have not made. I see, for example, no reason why we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:037757_0003_100ED4C8B99C2F28"/>
from saying, that the Pope, by his bull, made a present of America to the Spaniards; that, by another bull, he declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Indians to be men and not apes; that thirteen Indians were crucified by the Spaniards to the honor of Christ and the twelve apostles. Why must that be suppressed on the stage, which history has so loudly proclaimed?</p>
            <p>I take this opportunity of saying a few words concerning two other of my pieces. A certain Mr. Schutze has confidently asserted, in his History of the Hamburg Theatre, that Mr. Schroeder had made great alterations in "Count Benyowsky," to which that piece owed its success. This, with his permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, is not true. Mr. Schroeder altered nothing in "Count Benyowsky;" and Mr. Schutze will do well, in future, to seek better information.</p>
            <p>The "Literary Gazette" has had the goodness to judge of my Sultan Wampum <note n="*" place="bottom">A very pleasant farce, which I hope to present to the public. <bibl>TRANSLATOR.</bibl>
               </note>, (a hasty composition, upon which I do not set a very great value) with more kindness than I, perhaps, should have done myself; although it has formerly, in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the public applause, condemned and trampled in the dust some performances of mine whose merit is far superior.</p>
            <p>For this kindness I am grateful, and will here make known, that some of the censured, and truly censurable, verses do not belong to me, having been altered, probably to suit the fancy of the composer, without my knowledge; and remaining so, because I was too far from the place of publication to superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the press.</p>

                     <p>What a frightful echo! Battle! Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heavens! against whom? Against a king who but yet a few days past stretched out to you the hand of friendship and of peace. Against a people who never wronged the living being their creator formed. A people, who, children of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence! received you with hospitality and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Generously and freely did they share with you their comforts, their treasures and their homes: you repaid them by fraud, oppression and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor. These eyes have witnessed all I speakâ€” as gods you were received; as fiends have you acted.</p>

                     <p>They are men. Hear me Pizarro! Hear me ye chieftains! And thou all-powerful! whose thunders can rive the adamantive rock, and whose light and warmth can melt the icy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain into refreshing rivuletsâ€”Oh! let thy power give effect to thy servant's words, as the conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of right gives courage to his will! Do not, I implore you, countrymenâ€”do not renew the foul barbarities which your insatiate avarice has inflicted on this wretched, unoffending race. The scenes which I have seen and could describe, would force tears from the eyes of tygers.â€”Hush my sighs â€”drops of bitterness! choak not my utterance!â€”</p>

I curse the bond of blood by which you are united. May fell division, infamy, and rout, defeat your purpose and rebuke your hopes. I leave you, and forever! No longer will I be the witness of these horrors. In caves and forests will I hide myself. With tygers and with savage beasts commune.

If the smallest spark of life remains, he will know the voice of his Cora, open for a moment his unshrouded eyes, and bless me with a last look; but if we find him notâ€”Oh! then, my boy, we will to the Spanish camp.â€”That look of thine, will win me passage through a thousand swordsâ€” they too are men. Is there a heart that could drive back a wife that seeks her bleeding husband; or the innocent babe that cries for his imprisoned father? No, no, my child, every where we shall be safe.

Fall, fall, ye few reluctant drops of weaknessâ€”the last these eyes shall ever shed. How a woman can love, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarro, thou hast known too wellâ€”how she can hate, thou hast yet to learn. Yes, thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted! Thou, whom yet no mortal hazard has appalled! Thou, who on Panama's brow didst make alliance with the raging elements, that tore the silence of that horrid nightâ€”when thou didst follow, as thy pioneer, the crashing thunder's drift, and stalking o'er the trembling earth, didst plant thy banner by the red volcano's mouth! Thou, who, when battling on the sea, and thy brave ship was blown to splinters, wast seenâ€”as thou didst bestride a fragment of the smoking wreckâ€”to wave thy glittering sword above thy headâ€”as thou wouldst defy the world in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity!â€”Come fearless manâ€”now meet the last and fellest peril of thy lifeâ€”meet! and surviveâ€” an injured woman's fury, if thou canst.

No, Alonzo, date not thy life, which thou hast run, by the mean reckoning of the hours and days which thou hast breathed: a life spent worthily, should be measured by a nobler lineâ€”by deeds of usefulness and hours of bliss.â€”Deeds which have made a nation happy, and hours enriched by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's loveâ€”Cora!â€”Ah, there I draw upon the cord that binds me to the world!â€”My wife! my child! â€”Here the tears of love hold me, and there the smiles of innocence. Yes, Cassius, thou wast not a husband! Seneca, thou wast not a father! Loud cries the voice of nature, "Live"â€”and my heart re-echoes the tone.â€”Yes!â€”Lord of my destiny! I wish to live!</p>

               <p>You are right. Who would plant cedars in a marsh? Let us converse rationally on this subject. Fame is an irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional thing. It is mere smoke, and does not warm us. But advantageâ€”What think you, Pizarro? How if by generosity, which costs us nothing, we could purchase a dear victory?</p>

               <p>Alonzo must seal the doctrine of Las Casas:â€”whether by an heroic death, which is of little advantage to us, or by a folly, which may aid us much, depends on you.</p>

               <p>Let us catch the enthusiast with his own phantoms. That nothing, called by mortals virtue, is his idol. Go to him,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:037757_0083_100F02EE14FBE708"/>
and say, "Alonzo, thou hast injured me. I forgive thee. Thou art at liberty." The boy will sink into your arms, and gratefully betray to you the throne of Quito.</p>

               <p>If the artifice be too difficult for you alone, I will assist you. Whom does the power of love more easily persuade to good or evil than the enthusiast? I am possessed of beauty, and of sense; and well can I accommodate myself to all the humours of your sex. You know, Pizarro, thousands obey you, the heroâ€”You me, the woman.</p>

               <p>Not another word, for time is precious. I go to Alonzo. Have I not already won his heart as a young man? How then will he feel when I appear before him as a woman, when I press his hand in mine, and rest my supplicating looks upon him; when virtue's airy precepts flow from my lips with soft persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?â€”Think you he can resist all this?</p>

               <p>Poor mother, I cannot help you. Alas! I am but a king.</p>

               <speaker>Co.</speaker>
               <p>You cannot! Who, then, can? To whom have the gods entrusted our existence? Was it not you who led the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruvians to battle? Did not my Alonzo fight for you? Do you refuse me the only recompence for all his valorâ€”the life of a child, who will hereafter fight for you?</p>

Tyrant, whom my prayers and anguish cannot move, has not blood enough yet flowed to satisfy thy rank ambition? Look! on each of thy diamonds hangs a drop of blood. Art thou not satisfied without tearing infants from their mother's breast, and casting them to beasts of prey?â€” What is thy diadem to me? What cares a mother for the throne of Quito? Hasten hither, all ye, whom this victory has robbed of children! Help me to curse this foul barbarian, and let our misery rise with his shouts of joy to heaven. Oh, if he may but feel forever the distresses of one hapless mother, his punishment will be sufficient.

Alonzo, my breast is painful. Reach me the child.
<stage>(Exhausted.)</stage>
Alonzo, you are cruel; you see that I am dying, and will not let me once more feel the rapture of beholding my child.</p>
