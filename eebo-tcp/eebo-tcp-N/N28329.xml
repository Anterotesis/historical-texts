            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE BY THE AUTHOR.</head>
            <p>THIS piece is a continuation of my "Virgin of the Sun." My worthy friend, Mr. Schroeder, has made several slight al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in it, upon which I, relying on his secrecy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might safely hold my peace; but which I shall now gratefully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; partly, because I am not ashamed to take instruction from such a man as Schroeder; partly, because otherwise some ill-tempered critic may, as heretofore, upon the applause which the piece receives, rush forward, like an envious blood-hound, to lessen my share of merit with the public. The alterations are such as Mr. Schroeder made himself, or such as I have made by his advice.</p>
            <p>To the first of these belongs, in preference, the expunging a scene of Diego's, which, without having any connection with the interest of the whole, interrupted, by untimely jests, the progress of the first act. Further, the suppression of a finale, and an air which Elvira, very unseasonably, sung to the guitar. Further, the circumstance, that Pizarro only guessed at Elvira's design upon his life, which, before this alteration, Rolla, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hesitation, discovered to him; and thereby, perhaps, cast an appearance of ungenerous conduct upon his character. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the mitigating Pizarro's baseness, where he, in violation of his promise, seeks to get Rolla again in his power.</p>
            <p>I have myself, at his desire, metamorphosed Valverde the priest, into a private secretary; because, wicked priests can be tolerated only on the great theatre of the world, and not upon the stage of a play-house. But I designed this alteration only for the stage; and, that the press should restore this wretch again to his historical character. At present I have neither time nor inclination to attend farther to him.</p>
            <p>Unquestionably, the alteration which has been most service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the piece is, the ennobling of Elvira's character, which I undertook by his advice, and for which I sincerely thank him.</p>
            <p>Other alterations, which Mr. Schroeder thought proper to recommend, in compliance with the spirit of the times, I have not made. I see, for example, no reason why we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:037757_0003_100ED4C8B99C2F28"/>
from saying, that the Pope, by his bull, made a present of America to the Spaniards; that, by another bull, he declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Indians to be men and not apes; that thirteen Indians were crucified by the Spaniards to the honor of Christ and the twelve apostles. Why must that be suppressed on the stage, which history has so loudly proclaimed?</p>
            <p>I take this opportunity of saying a few words concerning two other of my pieces. A certain Mr. Schutze has confidently asserted, in his History of the Hamburg Theatre, that Mr. Schroeder had made great alterations in "Count Benyowsky," to which that piece owed its success. This, with his permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, is not true. Mr. Schroeder altered nothing in "Count Benyowsky;" and Mr. Schutze will do well, in future, to seek better information.</p>
            <p>The "Literary Gazette" has had the goodness to judge of my Sultan Wampum <note n="*" place="bottom">A very pleasant farce, which I hope to present to the public. <bibl>TRANSLATOR.</bibl>
               </note>, (a hasty composition, upon which I do not set a very great value) with more kindness than I, perhaps, should have done myself; although it has formerly, in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the public applause, condemned and trampled in the dust some performances of mine whose merit is far superior.</p>
            <p>For this kindness I am grateful, and will here make known, that some of the censured, and truly censurable, verses do not belong to me, having been altered, probably to suit the fancy of the composer, without my knowledge; and remaining so, because I was too far from the place of publication to superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the press.</p>

But when upon the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle island <hi>Gallo,</hi> he drew a line with his sword in the sand, and permitted all to abandon him who chose to pass that line; when only thirteen trusty men swore to follow, and he at their head dedicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself to death, my heart cried aloud, "A hero!"</p>

                     <p>Smooth-tongued Las Casas.

                     <p>What a frightful echo! Battle! Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heavens! against whom? Against a king who but yet a few days past stretched out to you the hand of friendship and of peace. Against a people who never wronged the living being their creator formed. A people, who, children of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence! received you with hospitality and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Generously and freely did they share with you their comforts, their treasures and their homes: you repaid them by fraud, oppression and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor. These eyes have witnessed all I speak— as gods you were received; as fiends have you acted.</p>

                     <p>They are men. Hear me Pizarro! Hear me ye chieftains! And thou all-powerful! whose thunders can rive the adamantive rock, and whose light and warmth can melt the icy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain into refreshing rivulets—Oh! let thy power give effect to thy servant's words, as the conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of right gives courage to his will! Do not, I implore you, countrymen—do not renew the foul barbarities which your insatiate avarice has inflicted on this wretched, unoffending race. The scenes which I have seen and could describe, would force tears from the eyes of tygers.—Hush my sighs —drops of bitterness! choak not my utterance!—</p>

I curse the bond of blood by which you are united. May fell division, infamy, and rout, defeat your purpose and rebuke your hopes. I leave you, and forever! No longer will I be the witness of these horrors. In caves and forests will I hide myself. With tygers and with savage beasts commune. And, when we meet before him whose mild doctrines you have this day renounced, tremble at the sight of your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser!

Now go we to fulfil the first, the most sacred duty which belongs to victory—to dry the widowed and the orphaned tear of those whose brave protectors have perished in their country's cause.</p>

Seeking, however by death disfigured, the sweet smile of my Alonzo.—With fearful cries will I shriek out his name, till my veins snap! If the smallest spark of life remains, he will know the voice of his Cora, open for a moment his unshrouded eyes, and bless me with a last look; but if we find him not—Oh! then, my boy, we will to the Spanish camp.—That look of thine, will win me passage through a thousand swords— they too are men. Is there a heart that could drive back a wife that seeks her bleeding husband; or the innocent babe that cries for his imprisoned father? No, no, my child, every where we shall be safe. A wretched mother, bearing a poor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan in her arms, has nature's passport through the world. Yes, yes, my son, we'll go and seek thy father.

But mark me—thou hast here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore had cause, 'tis true, to doubt my resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however offended—but mark me now—the lips which, cold and jeering, barbing revenge with rancorous mockery, can insult a fallen enemy, shall never more receive the pledge of love; the arm unshaken by its bloody purpose, which shall assign to needless torture the victim who avows his heart; never more shall press the hand of faith! —Pizarro, scorn not my words—beware you slight them not!—I feel how noble are the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which now animate my thoughts—who <hi>could</hi> not feel as I do, I condemn—who, feeling so, yet would not act as I <hi>shall,</hi> I despise!</p>

                     <p>'Tis well! 'tis just I should be humbled— I had forgot myself, and in the cause of innocence assumed the tone of virtue. 'Twas fit I should be rebuked—and by Pizarro. Fall, fall, ye few reluctant drops of weakness—the last these eyes shall ever shed. How a woman can love, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarro, thou hast known too well—how she can hate, thou hast yet to learn. Yes, thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted! Thou, whom yet no mortal hazard has appalled! Thou, who on Panama's brow didst make alliance with the raging elements, that tore the silence of that horrid night—when thou didst follow, as thy pioneer, the crashing thunder's drift, and stalking o'er the trembling earth, didst plant thy banner by the red volcano's mouth! Thou, who, when battling on the sea, and thy brave ship was blown to splinters, wast seen—as thou didst bestride a fragment of the smoking wreck—to wave thy glittering sword above thy head—as thou wouldst defy the world in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity!—Come fearless man—now meet the last and fellest peril of thy life—meet! and survive— an injured woman's fury, if thou canst.

And shall a christian trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?—The vigorous youth struggles against a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature death—a death in the morning of life. No, Alonzo, date not thy life, which thou hast run, by the mean reckoning of the hours and days which thou hast breathed: a life spent worthily, should be measured by a nobler line—by deeds of usefulness and hours of bliss.—Deeds which have made a nation happy, and hours enriched by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's love—Cora!—Ah, there I draw upon the cord that binds me to the world!—My wife! my child! —Here the tears of love hold me, and there the smiles of innocence. Yes, Cassius, thou wast not a husband! Seneca, thou wast not a father! Loud cries the voice of nature, "Live"—and my heart re-echoes the tone.—Yes!—Lord of my destiny! I wish to live!</p>

Yet, first—for thee, Rolla, accept my forgiveness: even had I been the victim of thy nobleness of heart, I should have admired thee for it. But 'twas myself provoked my doom—thou wouldst have shielded me. Let not thy contempt follow me to the grave. Didst thou but know the spell-like arts, by which this hypocrite first undermined the virtue of a guiltless heart! how, even in the pious sanctuary wherein I dwelt, by corruption and fraud, he practised upon those in whom I most confided—till my distempered fancy led me, step by step, into the abyss of guilt—</p>

O, my child! were I assured thy father breathes no more, how quickly would I lay me down by thy dear side; but down, down forever.

Now will you look at him as he sleeps; or shall I bring him waking, with his full blue laughing eyes to welcome you at once?— Yes—yes—stand thou there—I'll snatch him from his rosy slumber, blushing like the perfumed morn.</p>
