            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>§. 1.</head>
               <p>THE firſt ten pages of the following FRAGMENTS will, probably, be thought the moſt intereſting part of this little work. They exhibit a rude and imperfect ſketch of the <hi>Natural Hiſtory-Picture</hi> in the neighbourhood of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia: a picture which, if it were drawn by an able hand, could not fail to prove intereſting to the lovers of ſcience, in every part of the world. Each of theſe pages is divided into five columns. The firſt reſpects the day of the month when the birds mentioned in the ſecond column arrived, or were <hi>firſt ſeen,</hi> in the vicinity of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. In the ſecond column, I have given what may be called the ſcientific Latin name of each bird. In this part of my ſubject, I have always preferred the name of Linnaeus, when I could diſcover that the bird had been deſcribed by this great naturaliſt. But ſeveral of the birds, which are here mentioned, were not known to Linnaeus: at leaſt, I do not find that they have a place in any of the editions of his immortal work, the <hi>Syſtema Naturae.</hi> I have, therefore, been obliged to adopt other names, and, in a few inſtances, to impoſe them myſelf. I have often adopted the names of Profeſſor Gmelin, the laborious, and often ſucceſsful, editor of the new edition of the <hi>Syſtema Naturae.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Printed at Leipſie, in 1788.</note> When this is the caſe, I have affixed to the ſcientific name, the letter G, thus (G.) I have in this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn, ſometimes made uſe of the ſcientific names of my ingenious and good friend, Mr. William Bartram, a gentleman who has contributed much to our knowledge of the natural productions of North-America. To the names which I myſelf have impoſed, I have affixed the word (mihi.) But I by no means pretend to aſſert, that all the birds thus marked are new, or have not been deſcribed by naturaliſts.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
               <head>§. II.</head>
               <p>In the third column, I have given the Engliſh ſcientific and the Engliſh provincial names. The former are chiefly taken from the <hi>Arctic Zoology</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">The ſecond edition. London: 1792.</note> of my excellent friend Mr. Pennant, becauſe this is a work of ſuch extenſive merit, that I preſume it is in the hands of almoſt every naturaliſt; and becauſe the names impoſed by this gentleman are, with a very few exceptions, juſt and ſignificant. By the Engliſh provincial names, I mean the names by which theſe birds are beſt known in Pennſylvania, and in various other parts of the United-States. Theſe provincial names are always encloſed within a parentheſis, as in the inſtances (Pewe), (Turtle-Dove), &amp;c. They are deſignated in the ſame manner in the liſt of Reſident Birds, &amp;c. in Section III. The greater number of theſe names are uſed in Pennſylvania.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="section">
               <head>§. III.</head>
               <p>The fourth column relates to the "Progreſs Vegetation." The greater number of the vegetables which I have here enumerated are natives of Pennſylvania. Some, which are not natives of this ſtate, are natives of other parts of the United-States; whilſt others have not, hitherto, been found to grow ſpontaneouſly in any part of America. In general, the plants are deſignated by their Linnaean names. In a few inſtances, I have adopted the names of the late Mr. Aiton, in his <hi>Hortus Kewenſis;</hi> thoſe of Marſhall, and other botaniſts. All the plants which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned are found, either wild, or growing in gardens, in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, where the remarks on the time of their flowering and leaſing have been made.</p>

            <div n="4" type="section">
               <head>§. IV.</head>
               <p>The fifth and laſt column contains "Miſcellaneous Obſervations." In this part of my Sketches, I have done but very little. Want of time has prevented me from throwing into this column, many intereſting facts, ſome of which will be preſented, perhaps to greater advantage, to the public, in my future publications. The few Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometrical
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:035159_0005_10012A6899289CE0"/>and Barometrical obſervations, which occur under this head, are given on the authority of my ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venerated maternal uncle, the late David Rittenhouſe, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Theſe obſervations were made in Philadelphia.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="section">
               <head>§. V.</head>
               <p>It muſt not be imagined, that I communicate theſe ſketches to the public as exhibiting even the names of <hi>all</hi> the migratory birds of Pennſylvania. I am perſuaded, that <hi>many</hi> of theſe birds have eſcaped my notice. This is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, eſpecially the caſe with the birds of the genera Anas, Tringa, and of the extenſive order of Paſſeres, &amp;c. which I ſuſpect are conſtant in their migrations from the north to the ſouth, and from the ſouth to the north. A good many of the birds which are mentioned by Mr. Pennant as natives of New-York have not hitherto, to my knowledge, been obſerved in Pennſylvania: but it can hardly be ſuppoſed that thoſe ſpecies which are <hi>common</hi> in New-York (if we except ſuch as delight in the vicinity of the ſea-coaſt) are <hi>uncommon,</hi> or never ſeen, in Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania. Here, however, I muſt obſerve, that I cannot but ſuſpect, that Mr. Pennant, Mr. Latham, and other able ornithologiſts, have ſometimes deſcribed as diſtinct ſpecies, birds which merely differ in ſex, or in age, and in their colouring, for which theſe animals, at different ſeaſons of the year, are ſo remarkable.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="section">
               <head>§. VI.</head>
               <p>Beſides the conſtant migratory birds, there are others, which may be denominated <hi>occaſional</hi> migratory, or viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, birds of Pennſylvania. Such, not to mention ſeveral others, are the Columba paſſerina, or Ground-Pigeon, the Fringilla bicolor, or Bahama-Finch, and a ſpecies of Pſittacus, or Parrot.</p>

               <head>§. VII.</head>
               <p>The two firſt of theſe birds were ſeen in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, between thirty and forty years ago. The Pſittacus, moſt probably the Pſittacus pertinax, Illinois Parrot, or the Pſittacus carolinenſis, Carolina Parrot, has been occaſionally obſerved in Shareman's Valley, on Shareman's Creek, a branch of the river Suſquehanna, within twenty miles of the town of Carliſle.<note n="*" place="bottom">A friend of mine has informed me, that the Parakeet ſeen in this valley is the ſame ſpecies which is frequently met with in the neighbourhood of the river Ohio.

I may add, that a very large flight of parakeets, which came from the weſtward, was ſeen, a few years ago, about twenty-five miles to the north-weſt of Albany, in the ſtate of New-York.

               <head>§. VIII.</head>
               <p>I ſuſpect it will be found, that, in general, our ſouthern birds migrate farther north in the tract of country weſt than in that eaſt of the great ranges of our mountains. With reſpect to the birds, I hazard this merely as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture:
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:035159_0006_10012A6A39FE09F0"/>but it is a conjecture which derives ſupport from many intereſting facts which I have collected, and which will be mentioned and explained in my <hi>Geographical View of the Trees and Shrubs of North-America.</hi> In that work, I ſhall ſhow, that the ſouthern trees and ſhrubs (that is, thoſe vegetables which attain to their greateſt perfection in the ſouthern climates of our continent, particularly of the United-States) are, in general, found much farther north in the weſtern than they are in the eaſtern parts of our country. This fact ſeems to ſhow, and the point is put beyond any manner of doubt, by thermometrical obſervations, that the weſtern climate, in the ſame lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, is more temperate than the eaſtern. Of courſe, it were natural to ſuppoſe, that the ſouthern birds, to whom heat is ſo genial, would often be ſolicited farther north in the weſtern than in the eaſtern diſtrict. This, with reſpect to ſome birds, is actually the caſe. Mr. Jefferſon has obſerved, that "Perroquets even winter on the Sioto, in the 39th degree of latitude."<note n="*" place="bottom">Notes on the State of Virginia. Page 139.

               <p>Birds, in migrating, are fond of following the courſes of rivers, and other large ſtreams of water. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in my opinion, partly explains the reaſon, why ſome of the birds of the ſouthern parts of the United-States, and alſo ſome of the South-American birds, which have never, or very rarely, been diſcovered in the Atlantic coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of North-America, are not uncommon in the countries weſt of the Alleghaney-Mountains. Theſe ſouthern birds, following the courſes of the Miſſiſſippi, and its branches (the Ohio, the Illinois, &amp;c.) are ſpread or diſperſed through the rich and extenſive territories that are waſhed by theſe waters. Whether or not this explanation be admitted, the fact is certainly as I have ſtated; and to the naturaliſt it cannot but appear intereſting. The Pſittacus pertinax is one of the birds of Braſil; and the Muſcicapa Tyrannus, which is held in ſo much eſteem by the Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doweſſies, and other weſtern Indian tribes, is a native of Surinam, and of the country bordering on th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is, I think, in general, a juſt obſervation, that our Spring and Summer birds of paſſage continue with us about ſix months, and are abſent for the ſame length of time. Accordingly, thoſe birds which arrive early in the ſpring diſappear early in the autumn, and thoſe which arrive late in the ſpring do not diſappear until late in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn.

It has lately been aſcertained, that the Ampelis Garrulus, or Prib-Chatterer (Cedar-Bird) does breed in Pennſylvania; and I doubt not, that the ſame will, in time, be diſcovered to be the caſe with the Emberiza Oryzivora (Rice-Bird, Reed-Bird), and others whoſe neſts have not hitherto been ſeen in Pennſylvania. It is not unlikely, however, that ſome of theſe birds of paſſage continue their migration farther northward, to New-York, New-England, Vermont, &amp;c. and there breed and raiſe their young, returning ſouthward, through Pennſylvania, in the fall.</p>

               <p>It is an intereſting fact, for which we are indebted to Mr. William Bartram, that very few of our birds of paſſage from the ſouth "build or rear their young in the ſouth or maritime parts of Virginia and Carolina, Georgia and

Page 287.</note> This circumſtance leads to a ſuſpicion, that the principal cauſe (I will not, out of complaiſance to any one, call it a neceſſary inſtinct) which leads or impels theſe birds to migrate to the northward, is that they may make choice of a proper climate, abounding in their favourite food, to perform their amours, to build their neſts, and to rear their young. Much light might be thrown upon this curious ſubject, if natural hiſtory were cultivated in the United-States, with a portion of that innocent and uſeful zeal with which it is cultivated in Europe: with only a ſmall portion of that ardent zeal which ſo ſtrongly characterizes the Americans in their purſuit of gain. But, as yet, little attention is paid to the ſtudy of nature in the United-States. In our colleges, it is not taught as an indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable branch of polite or uſeful knowledge, but is obliged to yield its laurels to languages which are withered or dead, and to ſtudies which are uſeleſs or ignoble.<note n="†" place="bottom">I ever have been a friend to the ſtudy of the two ancient languages, the Greek and the Latin, which are taught in our ſchools. They are abſolutely neceſſary to the complete attainment of ſome ſciences, ſuch as natural hiſtory (including botany), and medicine; and I think with Eraſmus, that a phyſician ſhould he aſhamed not to know them. But too much time is diſſipated in the acquiſition of theſe languages. If I do not greatly miſtake, this truth begins to be acknowledged among us. <hi>Video mediora.</hi> If only one-ſixth part of the time which is conſumed in acquiring the Greek and Latin languages (particularly the former), were appropriated to the ſtudy of natural hiſtory, in leſs than twenty years, the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral productions of the United-States would be pretty well inveſtigated.

               <p>It has been ſuppoſed, that many of the birds which I have enumerated, paſs, on their return to the ſouth, during the autumnal months, through the countries which are ſituated to the weſt of the great ranges of our mountains. That this is ſometimes the caſe, I do not doubt: but it is not the general order of the migration of our birds. My opinion, indeed, is oppoſed by the authority of ſome very reſpectable naturaliſts, whoſe ſentiments deſerve to be mentioned in this place. "The birds (ſays the late Mr. George Edwards), which paſs through the country north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the ſpring, being never obſerved to return the ſame way, Mr. Bartram ſuppoſes that they go to the ſouthward in autumn by ſome other paſſage beyond their inland mountains."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Gleanings of Natural Hiſtory, Part II.

This is, certainly, a miſtake. Our ſwallows, which are migratory birds, as I think I have rendered very probable in the Appendix,<note n="‖" place="bottom">See Page 16.</note> are generally ſeen on their return ſouthward, in the autumn, far to the eaſt of the firſt ranges of our mountains. But independently of the ſwallows, the ſame may be ſaid of many other ſpecies of birds. Indeed, I believe it may confidently be ſaid, that moſt of the paſſenger-birds, which paſs by us, in the ſpring, return, in the autumn, ſouthward, the ſame way they went. This obſervation certainly applies to the Anas canadenſis (Wild-Gooſe), the Columba migratoria (Wild-Pigeon), the Fringilla triſtis (Yellow-Bird), Motacilla Sialis (Blue-Bird), Loxia Curviroſtra (Croſsbill), Fringilla — (Hemp-Bird), and at leaſt fifty others, which are <hi>conſtantly</hi> obſerved on their migrations ſouthward, in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia.

               <p>It muſt not be imagined, that the birds which I have enumerated arrive uniformly, every year, at the times which are prefixed to their names, in the firſt column.

The atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I have paid to this curious ſubject in Pennſylvania, has convinced me, that my ſuſpicion was well founded. The migration of birds is not a "determinate inſtinct,<note n="¶" place="bottom">Dr. Adam Ferguſon.</note> but an act of volition, or will. Hence, the ſeaſons and
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:035159_0008_10012A73E3E98AE0"/>other circumſtances will greatly regulate the arrival of birds in, and their flight or removal from, a particular country. Sometimes, there is a difference of three weeks or a month between the arrival, or appearance, of the ſame ſpecies, in two different years. This will appear from the following inſtances, which are ſelected from many others.</p>

               <p>From an inſpection of theſe Tables, it will appear, that the Alauda alpeſtris, or Shore-Lark, the Alauda rubra, or Red-Lark, the Fringilla triſtis, or Golden Finch, and ſome others, were not obſerved, in the vicinity of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, earlier than the twelfth of March, 1791: whereas the ſame birds were ſeen, in the ſame neighbourhood, as early as the twenty-eighth of February, the following year, on their paſſage northward.</p>
               <p>I have placed the Anas canadenſis (Wild-Gooſe) between the 15th and the 18th of April, 1791, but in the year 1794, theſe birds were obſerved, on their migration from the ſouth, as early as the 3d of March. In the firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned year the Ardea Herodias, or Great Heron, was not obſerved before the 15th or 16th of April; but in the latter year, numbers of theſe birds were ſeen as early as the 1ſt of April.

               <p>How much the movements of birds from one country to another depend upon the ſtate of the ſeaſons, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from different parts of this little work; particularly from the Third Section.

This was the caſe in the winter of 1792—1793, when immenſe flocks of theſe birds continued about the city, and did not migrate farther ſouthward, until the weather became more ſevere in the month of January. The winter of 1792—1793, was one of the mildeſt that had ever been remembered in Pennſylvania. It is a common obſervation in ſome parts of this ſtate, that when the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons continue with us all the winter, we ſhall have a ſickly ſummer and autumn. There is, perhaps, ſome foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for this notion. Large bodies<note n="†" place="bottom">I ſay "large bodies," for I believe individuals of thoſe birds continue with us almoſt every winter.</note> of theſe birds ſeldom do winter among us unleſs the winter be very mild; and the experience of ſome years has taught us, that ſuch winters are often followed by malignant epidemics. The mild winter of 1792—1793, was ſucceeded by a dreadful malignant fever, which deſtroyed between four and five thouſand people in Philadelphia; and I am aſſured, that the ſame fever in 1762 was preceded by an extremely open winter, during which the pigeons remained about Philadelphia, and in other parts of the ſtate. In the hands of a poet, a Lucretius, or a Virgil, this coincidence between the accidental hiemation of the pigeons and the appearance of the yellow-fever might be wrought up into a ſyſtem of beautiful extravagance.</p>

               <p>If birds, in their migration from one country to another, were impelled by a "determinate," or neceſſary inſtinct, the periods of their arrival and departure would be more uniform and fixed. But we have ſeen, that there is a conſiderable difference in theſe reſpects, even in two years immediately in ſucceſſion. Such great regularity in the migrations of theſe animals by no means accords with thoſe accommodating habits, which the naturaliſt diſcovers in his inveſtigation of the manners of all animals; thoſe habits which have been given to them, as to us, by a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator

               <p>It is highly probable, that the periods of the migrations of birds will be found to be more or leſs uniform in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as the climates of the countries to which they migrate are more or leſs variable in their temperature. It is perhaps, upon this principle, that we are to explain the difference of the times of the arrival and departure of the birds of Pennſylvania, and other parts of North-America. The climates of theſe countries are extremely variable; I ſuppoſe more ſo that moſt other countries that are known to us. If, as has been ſuppoſed by many writers, the hand of man, by clearing and by cultivating the ſurface of the earth, contributes eſſentially to the greater uniformity in the temperature of climates, it is reaſonable to conjecture, that the time will come, when the periods of the migrations of our birds will be more conſtant and fixed. For in North-America, eſpecially the United-States, the progreſs of population, and of clearing and cultivating the earth, is more rapid and immenſe than in any other portion of the world.</p>

               <p>It is well known, that the ancients were of opinion, that the arrival of certain birds of paſſage afforded one of the beſt and ſafeſt directions for the planting of different kinds of vegetables, and for other agricultural purpoſes. Thus Virgil, who was at once a naturaliſt and poet, tells us, that the beſt time for planting vineyards (in Italy) is when the White bird, or Storck, appears:
<q>
                     <l>Optima vinetis ſatio, cum vere rubenti</l>
                     <l>Candida venit avis longis inviſa colubrit.</l>

                     </bibl>
                  </q>
I could point out, in the happy compoſitions of this great poet, other inſtances of a ſimilar kind. The following is too beautiful to be omitted. The poet of Mantua is here deſcribing the method and the time for killing a ſteer for the purpoſe of obtaining from its putrid gore a ſtock of bees, as was practiſed by the ancient Egyptians.<note n="‡" place="bottom">It appears to have been a very general opinion among the ancients, that Bees were produced from the putrid bodies of animals. A very curious paſſage in the 14th chapter of the book of Judges ſhows the high antiquity of this notion. After Sampſon had killed the young Lion, "he turned aſide to ſee the carcaſe of the lion: and behold there was a ſwarm of Bees and honey in the carcaſe of the lion." The Greeks believed, that theſe inſects aroſe from putrid bullocks, and hence they gave them a name expreſſive of this ſuppoſed origin. According to Archelaus, bees proceed from bullocks, and waſps from horſes. So rude were the opinions of the ancients reſpecting the origin of theſe inſects. It is certain, however, that putrid carcaſes are often viſited by bees, and it is not unlikely that from theſe carcaſes, they may be able to procure honey. It was, doubtleſs, from obſerving, that ſwarms of bees frequent the dead bodies of animals, that the ancient Egyptians had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſuch bodies for the purpoſe of repairing the total loſs of their honey-making inſects. The manner of doing this is beautifully related by Virgil, who traces back the practice to its firſt ſource. <hi>See Georgi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Although in Pennſylvania, and many other parts of the United-States, the arrival of our birds does not appear to be as uniform as it is in many of the countries of the old world; <note n="§" place="bottom">See Page 10.</note> the arrival of ſeveral ſpecies is, nevertheleſs, ſo regular, that it may be conſidered as the ſignal for commencing certain agricultural operations. Thus, the Muſcicapa fuſca, which we call Pewe, is one of the earlieſt Spring birds of paſſage, viſiting the neighbourhood of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia about the middle of March. We have ſeldom hard froſts after the arrival of this bird, which ſeems to give a pretty confident aſſurance to the farmer, that he may very ſoon begin to open the ground and plant. It is an old ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in Pennſylvania, that when the Whip-poor-will (Caprimulgus virginianus) arrives, it is time to go bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed; that is, the ſpring ſeaſon is pretty far advanced, and ſufficiently warm to admit of laying aſide the uſe of ſhoes, without much inconvenience. This adage originated in the days of greater ſimplicity than the preſent. Some of our Indians believe, that this bird is a meſſenger ſent to call their attention to the planting of the ground. Accordingly upon the arrival of the Whip-poor-will, they ſay to one another, "the <hi>Weecolis</hi>

               <p>Some ingenious gentlemen, with whom I have converſed on the ſubject, are even of opinion, that but a very few of our birds are, ſtrictly ſpeaking, birds of paſſage. They imagine, that ſome of theſe birds, at the coming on of cold weather, paſs into a torpid ſtate, whilſt others merely take ſhelter from the inclemency of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in cloſe thickets, in the hollows of trees, rocks, &amp;c. without becoming torpid. This opinion may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by plauſible arguments. Some ſpecies of Swallows have occaſionally been found in a torpid ſtate. In mild winters, ſeveral of thoſe birds which are thought to be commonly migratory, are ſeen among us; and even after the diſappearance of ſome ſpecies, ſuch as the Motacilla Sialis, or Blue-Bird, one or two warm days in the winter time will bring them back again. This notion is likewiſe favoured by the torpid ſtate into which ſo many of our ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals paſs, and continue, during the winter ſeaſon; ſuch as different ſpecies of Lizards, Tortoiſes, Frogs, Serpents, and Inſects. Nor is it merely the animals with cold blood <hi>(Sanguis frigidus)</hi> that become torpid. Some of our quadrupeds fall into a ſimilar ſtate. Such are the Arctomys Monax, or Maryland Marmot (beſt known in the United-States by the names of Ground-Hog, and Wood-chuck), and ſome of the ſmaller animals of the order <hi>Glires,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſome ſpecies of Dipus, or Jerboa. Other ſpecies, again, that do not become torpid, keep themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in cloſe quarters, during the greater part of the winter-ſeaſon. Such are ſome of the ſpecies of Squirrel, the Didelphis Opoſſum (Opoſſum), and others.</p>

The complete diſcloſure of the fact, that the ſerpents, frogs, ſome quadrupeds, &amp;c. become torpid, is rather an argument againſt the torpid ſtate of our birds. Why ſhould it be ſo much more difficult to diſcover the <hi>latter</hi> than the former in a torpid ſtate, if <hi>they</hi> actually went into this ſtate? Ten thouſand ſerpents may be found in the torpid ſtate as readily as a ſingle Swallow, or Humming.

If all theſe birds continued among us, <hi>many</hi> of them would be found. The labours of one century, or more, in cutting down the timber of the foreſt, in blowing rocks, in draining mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds, and marſhes, would furniſh more than five or ſix inſtances (and they not always quite ſo well authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated as we could wiſh) of Swallows, &amp;c. being found during the winter-ſeaſon, in a benumbed ſtate.</p>

               <p>The argument derived from the torpid ſtate into which ſo many of our animals are obſerved to fall upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of winter, is of leſs weight than may, at firſt ſight, be imagined. Theſe animals are much leſs capable of migrating than the birds. If they were capable of making long journies to more favourable climates, I do not doubt they would make them. For I am perſuaded, by a variety of experiments and obſervations which I have made, and may, perhaps, be induced to communicate to the public at ſome future period, that moſt of our hybernating ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals go with reluctance into this ſtate. I am even of opinion, that the ſtate of torpidity of <hi>many</hi> animals is a ſtate of pain and ſufferance. This obſervation, at leaſt, ſeems to hold good with reſpect to thoſe animals (and I believe they conſtitute the greater number of the hybernating animals) which divide the winter between ſleeping and wak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: which, in other words, under the influence of cold and other cauſes, fall into a kind of profound ſleep, during which the functions of the heart and the lungs are conſtantly performed; and even that of the ſtomach and inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, in ſome meaſure, goes on: and during all which time, ſuch animals are ſenſible to the influence of mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical and other ſtimuli. This claſs of hybernating quadrupeds often, during the courſe of the winter, ſpontaneouſly awake from their ſlumber, take food, and fall into ſlumber, again. I do not, however, imagine, that animals, which are ſo torpid as to be incapable of being rouſed by the application of the moſt powerful ſtimuli, can be ſaid to be in a ſtate of pain and ſufferance. But I believe, that the number of theſe <hi>continual</hi> ſleepers is very ſmall, even in the coldeſt climates.</p>

               <p>We are certain, that the torpid ſtate of many animals is altogether an accidental circumſtance: that is, it is not neceſſary to the ſpecies. I will not aſſert, with my learned and ingenious friend, Mr. Fabricius, that it is not natural to, nor coeval with, the ſpecies. It would be difficult to prove this poſition: but the poſition which I have advanced may be maintained. Animals of the ſame ſpecies have often a very extenſive range over the world. Thus, the Urſus Lotor, or Raccoon, extends from Lake-Superior to the Weſt-India-Iſlands, and the warm parts of South-America. The Opoſſum has a range not much leſs extenſive. I trace the Rattle-Snake (Crotalus horridus) as far north as the Bay of Saguena, on Lake-Huron, and it is known in the country of Braſil. In ſuch extenſive tracts of country, theſe animals are expoſed to very different degrees of temperature: on the one hand, to a great alternation of heat and cold; on the other hand, to a perpetual ſpring and ſummer. We ought not, therefore, to expect to find any of them torpid in the whole of this extenſive range. In fact, ſeveral of thoſe animals which become torpid in the northern parts of our country do not fall into this ſtate in the ſouthern and warmer climates.<note n="*" place="bottom">See my account of the Dipus Americanus, or American Jerbos, in the 4th volume of the Tranſactions of the American Philoſophical Society.</note> As cold, however, is not the only cauſe of the torpidity of animals, we muſt not be ſurprized to find inſtances of animals becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing torpid in climates that are warm. Extreme heat, like extreme cold, ſeems to prediſpoſe the animal ſyſtem to this ſtate, particularly, perhaps, when there is a deficiency of food.</p>

               <p>We ſee that quadrupeds and ſome other animals do occaſionally, during ſevere winters, migrate to more ſouthern climates. I am aſſured, that the Bears migrate, in great numbers, every autumn, acroſs the Miſſiſſippi, going ſouth (perhaps to the mountains of New-Mexico), in ſearch of a milder climate. In the ſpring, they return again by
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:035159_0013_1001080D0257CEC8"/>ſame rout. This migration of the bears is particularly obſerved at Manchac, on the Miſſiſſippi, about the latitude of —. Many other quadrupeds perform ſimilar migrations, both in the old and in the new world.</p>

               <head>§. XXX.</head>
               <p>Nothing ſeems more improbable than that a claſs of animals, ſuch as the greater number of birds, which are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of rapid and immenſe flights, ſhould continue in a country in which the winter's cold is generally very intenſe, and in which, at the ſame time, the principal articles of their food are not to be procured. But I am far from deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſome birds do paſs their winters with us, either in a torpid ſtate, or otherwiſe. Some ſpecies continue with us pretty regularly: and individuals of many ſpecies do occaſionally continue with us. I have already obſerved, that "during our mild winters, ſeveral of thoſe ſpecies of birds which, in general, are undoubtedly migratory, continue the winter through in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia."<note n="*" place="bottom">See page ix. § XVI.</note> It muſt be evident, therefore, that extreme cold is the great cauſe which compels theſe animals to retire ſouth. But it is not the only cauſe. A deficiency of their proper food is another, not much leſs extenſive. The greater number of our birds of the order of paſſeres feed upon inſects, and the ſeeds and berries of vegetables. Theſe, particularly the former, are not to be procured in the winter-ſeaſon, in quantity ſufficient to anſwer the demands of the immenſe number of birds which viſit us at other ſeaſons of the year. If our climate were more moderate than it is, and if an abundance of food were at all times to be procured, the number of our Reſident Birds would, doubtleſs, be much greater than it is. It is evident, that a failure of their food is one of the great cauſes of the migrations of birds. Thus no ſooner has the Zizania aquatica (Reed), which is one of the principal foods of the Rice-Birds, ſhed its ſeed, than theſe birds diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, returning ſouthwards.<note n="†" place="bottom">See the Tables.

               <p>Independent on the mildneſs of the ſeaſon, and the continuance of an abundance of their favourite kinds of food, individuals (and in ſome inſtances large flocks) of many different kinds of migratory birds paſs their winters with us. Dr. Darwin obſerves, that "thoſe ſwallows that have been hatched too late in the year to acquire their full ſtrength of pinion, or that have been maimed by accident or diſeaſe, have been frequently found in the hollows of rocks on the ſea coaſts, and even under water in" a "torpid ſtate, from which they have been revived by the warmth of a fire."<note n="†" place="bottom">Zoonomia, VOL.

But it is highly probable, that the circumſtances which he mentions are ſome of the cauſe which compel theſe and many other kinds of birds to paſs their winters in climates, and in ſituations, very different from thoſe in which the ſpecies at large, are, at ſuch times, found.</p>

               <p>Birds, in migrating, often loſe themſelves, particularly, perhaps, when they get into the currents of ſtrong winds, to which they muſt ſometimes be obedient. The large flight of Parakeets,<note n="§" place="bottom">See Page vi. §. VII.</note> which viſited the neighbourhood of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany, in the winter of 1780, was no doubt carried thither by a ſtrong weſterly wind. Such wanderers, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, often go into a torpid ſtate. It is ſaid, that great numbers of Parakeets (I ſuppoſe the Pſittacus carolinenſis) are ſometimes, in the winter-ſeaſon, found torpid in the hollows of trees, in North-Carolina. Admitting the fact, is it not likely, that theſe birds have been wanderers, like the New-York flock juſt mentioned? Accidents of this kind are more frequent than is perhaps imagined. And I do not doubt that to ſuch accidents we muſt aſcribe <hi>ſome</hi> of the inſtances of ſwallows and other birds being found, in the winter-ſeaſon, in a ſtate of hybernation. It will be ſaid, that this idea favours the notion, that birds are capable of entering into this ſtate according to their ſituation. I do really ſuppoſe ſo. Perhaps all birds, all quadrupeds, in ſhort all animals, are capable of this ſtate. Nor are vegetables exempted from it. Thoſe aquatic plants which, at the approach of winter, withdraw themſelves to the bottom of the water, and, on the opening of the ſpring, emerge from their watery bed, may be denominated HYBER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NATING
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:035159_0014_10012A90A759E5F8"/>VEGETABLES. Perhaps this name might likewiſe be applied to thoſe vegetables, which are natives of warm, ſouthern countries, but gradually accommodate themſelves to the rigorous winters of northern climates. I think, it was the late Mr. John Hunter who firſt ventured to conjecture, that man himſelf is not incapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming torpid. Profeſſor Fabricius is of the ſame opinion.<note n="*" place="bottom">I am ſorry, that I have not now an opportunity of examining Mr. Fabricius's memoir.

               <p>It it important for our purpoſe, in the diſcuſſion of the queſtion of the diſappearance of birds, that many of thoſe ſpecies which are believed to be migratory are annually ſeen on their paſſage; in the ſpring from the ſouth to the north, and in the autumn from the north to the ſouth. Some of theſe paſſengers migrate in immenſe flocks, whilſt others go and return more individually. Mr. Bartram has ſeen, in the autumn, large flocks of all our four ſpecies of Swallows, on their return ſouthward from Pennſylvania, through Carolina, Florida, &amp;c. and in the ſpring on their return to the northward again.<note n="†" place="bottom">See Appendix I. P. 16.</note> The immenſe migrations of the Paſſenger-Pigeons are well known to every body in this country.

It is curious, however, that in their return, they do not move in the ſame form in which they came. They now form two or three circles interſecting each other, often changing the figure of the body, and forming again, as they are joined by other ſquadrons.

               <p>I fear, I ſhall be thought to have taken up too much time in endeavouring to prove, that the greater number of our birds which diſappear on the approach of winter, retire to ſouthern and milder climates. Indeed, I am of opinion, that the migration of our birds is a fact ſo well eſtabliſhed in the natural hiſtory of theſe animals, that it will not, in general, be doubted, except by thoſe perſons who are propenſe to doubt on every ſubject. In Aſia, in Africa, and in Europe, where obſervations on this ſubject have long been made, the migration of many ſpecies has been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely eſtabliſhed. In our own times, it has been particularly obſerved that many ſpecies viſit different countries of Europe in the ſpring, and leave them in the autumn, in the ſame manner as other ſpecies viſit and leave us at the ſame ſeaſons of the year.</p>

               <p>But it is ſaid, we are unable to determine to what particular country theſe American birds of paſſage emigrate. This, which reſpect to many ſpecies, is ſtrictly true. The obſervation, however, does not apply to all the migratory birds which I have mentioned.</p>

               <p>It is pretty certain, that ſome of our migratory birds do not remove to a very great diſtance. Of this number are thoſe ſpecies which even in the depth of winter make their appearance among us when we have a few days of warm and open weather. The Blue-Bird is one of theſe birds.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Section III. Page 12.</note> It is probable that it does not often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move far. Perhaps, it goes to the ſea-coaſt, where the temperature is more equable. Perhaps, however, theſe birds might, with more propriety, be conſidered as Reſidents. They, certainly, ſometimes continue with us the whole winter. They may eaſily find a ſecure retreat from the winter's cold in the neighbourhood of the ſea, and in cloſe thickets of wood. Poſſibly, thoſe ſpecies which are ſeen among us in mild winters, do not commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire as far ſouth as the others. But this is only conjecture. We are certain that the Turdus Polyglottos, the Ardea Herodias, and ſeveral others, which <hi>occaſionally</hi> winter in Pennſylvania, do not <hi>always</hi> winter in the ſouthern ſtates.</p>

               <p>The greater number of our migratory birds ſeem to remove to a very conſiderable diſtance from us. It is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that they paſs their winters in the Carolinas, Georgia, the Floridas, Mexico, Surinam, Braſil, and all the warm parts of South-America, and the Weſt-India-Iſlands. That, in general, they remove farther ſouth than the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts of the United-States may ſafely be inferred from the very ſmall number of our birds that is known to hiemate in this part of the country. Thus, the Swallows are no more obſerved to winter in the ſouthern ſtates than they are in Pennſylvania. And my friend Mr. Bartram aſſures me, that he does not know more than three of the Spring Birds of Paſſage that regularly winter in that part of the Union. Theſe are the Muſcicapa carolinenſis (Cat-Bird), Columba carolinenſis (Turtle-Dove), and the Turdus minor, or Little Thruſh. They winter as far north as Cape-Fear, in North-Carolina. I do not ſuppoſe, however, that this is the whole liſt of the paſſenger-birds of Pennſylvania that continue the winter through in the ſouthern ſtates. Some have, probably, eſcaped Mr. Bartram's obſervation. At any rate, it will not be doubted, that during very mild winters many ſpecies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in theſe ſtates, ſince, during ſuch winters, ſeveral ſpecies remain in Pennſylvania. I am aſſured, that the Rice-Birds often paſs the whole winter in South-Carolina; and ſome gentlemen, with whom I have converſed on the ſubject, are even of opinion, that the ſpecies regularly hiemate in that ſtate. This, however, I preſume is a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. Mr. Cateſby ſays the Mocking Bird hiemates in Carolina. That it does ſo occaſionally, there can be little doubt: but it is pretty certain, that, in general, it is a migratory bird.<note n="†" place="bottom">Arctic Zoology. VOL. II. page 16. It is a curious fact, that previous to the cold winter of 1779—1780, or 1783—1784 (I am not poſitive which), the Mocking-Bird more commonly remained in the vicinity of Philadelphia and other parts of Pennſylvania, during the winter-ſeaſon, than it has done ſince that time. I am inclined to think, that the extreme ſeverity of the ſeaſon I allude to has frightened theſe birds away. I am ſenſible, however, that this mode of explaining the fact will not appear ſatisfactory to thoſe naturaliſts who believe, that the inſtinct of animals is a <hi>vis impellent,</hi> a "determinate" ſomething; and that they never acquire any knowledge by experience. Very different is my opinion, as I ſhall fully ſhow in a work on the Inſtinct of animals, in which I have been, for ſome time, engaged.</note> I ſuſpect that, beſides the three ſpecies men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Mr. Bartram, the following birds pretty regularly hiemate in ſome of the ſouthern ſtates, particularly South-Carolina, and Georgia, and in the country of Florida: Oriolus phoeniceus, Gracula Quiſcula, Picus auratus, Picus erythrocephalus, Fringilla pecoris, Alauda alpeſtris, Charadrius vociferus, Rallus virginianus, Scolopax Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linago, and a good many of the <hi>Anſeres.</hi>

Thoſe which are deſignated with an aſteriſk are not known in Pennſylvania. Mr. Pennant (<hi>Arctic Zoology.</hi> VOL. II. P. 107.) mentions the Motacilla Guira as a native of New-York.—The Emberiza Ciris has never (that I can learn) been ſeen farther north than Cape-Fear in North-Carolina, and not more than one mile from the ſalt water. The Spoon-Bill is ſometimes (though rarely) ſeen about the mouth of Cape-Fear-River. They are common about St. Aguſtine, in Eaſt-Florida, and even as far north as the Savanna-River. Mr. William Bartram.</note> This circumſtance renders it very probable, that many of our migratory birds paſs their winters in theſe ſouthern climates. How much is it to be wiſhed, that ſome intelligent naturaliſts would furniſh us with a liſt of the migratory birds of Mexico, Braſil, the Weſt-India-Iſlands, &amp;c. noting down, with care, the times of their diſappearance from thoſe countries, and the periods of their return to them. This would throw great light upon the difficult queſtion which I am examining. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, I have little doubt it will be found, that ſeveral of theſe birds viſit us about the time they leave the warm countries juſt mentioned. Some of the birds which I have mentioned, in the above liſt, are known to migrate from and to Mexico, Braſil, and the Weſt-Indies.</p>

               <p>My learned and candid friend Mr. Pennant (whoſe name I never mention but with pleaſure and with gratitude; whoſe works have contributed much to my information, and whoſe example has ſtimulated me to the ſtudy of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural hiſtory) thinks there is the "greateſt probability," that numbers of the birds of Kamtſchatka are common to North-America, "and that they paſs there the ſeaſons of migration."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Arctic Zoology. VOL. II. P. 314.</note> I may obſerve, on the other hand, that it is likely that many of the North-American ſpecies paſs into Aſia and Europe, making between theſe continents and the new-world regular migrations. I think (for I write from memory) that it is Profeſſor Biſeke who has lately ſhown, that ſeveral of the North-American birds annually viſit the neighbourhood of Mittau, in Courland. Among others, I particularly recollect that this writer mentions the Loxia Cardinalis, or Cardinal Groſbeak. In the farther inveſtigation of the ſubject of the migration of birds, we ſhall diſcover, that many ſpecies (many more than is generally imagined) are common to the old and to the new-world; and that ſeveral ſpecies are occaſionally paſſing into countries which before they had not viſited. I am not afraid, that genuine naturaliſts will ſuppoſe, that the regularity of migration, which I have mentioned, between the two continents, is altogether imaginary. I certainly do not carry my birds as far, in ſearch of food, of reſting places, and of better climes, as did Cotton Mather, of New-England, who fancied that the Wild-Pigeons, on leaving us, repaired "to ſome undiſcovered Satellite, accompanying the Earth at a near Diſtance."<note n="¶" place="bottom">See the Philoſophical Tranſactions, Abridg'd, &amp;c.

            <p>The following TABLES are divided into two Sections. The firſt ſection contains an enumeration of the SPRING and SUMMER Birds of Paſſage. All theſe, with the exception of a very few, which may be called RESIDENT BIRDS, come from the ſouth. The greater part of them are known to build and breed in Pennſylvania. At the cloſe of the ſummer and in the autumn, they retire again to the ſouth, and viſit us in the Spring.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſection is devoted to the AUTUMNAL and WINTER Birds of Paſſage. Theſe paſſengers may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two claſſes: viz. I. The Spring and Summer Birds of Paſſage, which are now on their return to the ſouth. In ſtrict propriety, theſe ought not to be conſidered as Autumnal and Winter Paſſengers: for they leave us in cold weather, either becauſe they are incapable of ſupporting the ſeverity of the winter-ſeaſon, or becauſe they cannot, during this ſeaſon, procure a ſufficiency of their proper and favourite food. Perhaps, for both theſe cauſes. II. The ſecond claſs comprehends the real Autumnal and Winter Birds of Paſſage. Theſe, compared with the Spring and Summer Birds of Paſſage, are very few in number. They all come from the north, and either winter with us or in the ſouthern ſtates. In the ſpring (frequently very early in the ſpring), they retire northerly, where they build, breed, and rear their young.</p>

            <p>By the <hi>RESIDENT BIRDS,</hi> I mean thoſe birds which, in general, continue in Pennſylvania the whole year; which build their neſts, rear their young, and are commonly thought to continue, near the diſtrict in which they themſelves were reared. I ſhall enumerate theſe birds in the order of the Linnaean arrangement.</p>
            <div type="list_of_birds">
               <head>ACCIPITRES. RAPACIOUS.</head>
               <p>Falco Leucocephalus. White-Headed Eagle. (Bald-Eagle.) This, in the opinion of ſome perſons, is the ſame bird as the next ſpecies. But I cannot adopt this notion.</p>
               <p>Falco regalis of Bartram. <hi>Travels.</hi> Great Grey Eagle. This is our largeſt Eagle.</p>
               <p>Falco aquilinus of Bartram. <hi>Travels.</hi> Great Red-Tailed Hawk. This is the largeſt ſpecies of Hawk hitherto diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in Pennſylvania. The tail is of a red brick colour.</p>
               <p>Falco columbarius. Pigeon-Hawk.</p>
               <p>Falce glaucus of Bartram. <hi>Travels.</hi> Bluiſh Hawk. A beautiful ſpecies. Colour a pale ſky-blue. Tips of the wings black. Feeds upon its prey, as it flies along with it.</p>
               <p>Strix virginiana. Great Horned Owl.</p>
               <p>Strix Aſlo. Red Owl, Little Owl. (Screech-Owl.)</p>
               <p>Strix varius of Bartram. MS. Hen Owl. This is a large ſpecies without ears. It is next in ſize to the Strix virginiana, or Great Horned Owl. Of a clay or dirt colour, ſpotted with darker brown.</p>
               <p>Lanius Excubitor. Great Shrike. (Guſt Bird? Nine-Killer.) For ſome intereſting information concerning this bird, ſee <hi>Tranſactions of the American Philoſophical Society.</hi> VOL. IV.</p>
               <p>Lanius Collurio? Red-Backed Shrike. This ſpecies comes to us from the northward, in October or November. In very mild winters, ſtays in the vicinity of Philadelphia. Is always with us in the ſpring, on its return to the north. Does not breed with us: does not ſing in the autumn, but does in the ſpring.</p>

               <p>* Picus erythrocephalus. Red-Headed-Woodpecker. Continues about Philadelphia, in mild winters. In very cold winters, it goes farther ſouthward.</p>
               <p>* Picus auratus. Golden-Wing-Woodpecker. Some few of theſe birds are ſeen among us, in the warmer or milder winters. In general, they migrate farther ſouthward.</p>

               <p>Certhia fuſca of Bartram. MS. Brown-Creeper. I believe this ſpecies is not deſcribed. The general colour is a nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brown: ſpeckled with black or deep duſky: ſome white ſpots on the firſt coverts. Edwards (<hi>Nat. Hiſt.</hi> vol.

               <head>NOTE.</head>
               <p>In ſtrict language, there are very few of our birds entitled to the name of RESIDENTS. Pennſylvania, like every other portion of the United-States, is ſubject to great extremes of heat and cold; and theſe extremes are known to have a decided inſluence upon the diſpoſitions of animals. During our coldeſt winters, therefore, many of thoſe birds, which I have conſidered as reſidents, migrate to the ſouth. This was the caſe in the ever-memorable winter of 1779 and 1780, when very few of the uſually reſident birds continued with us: and many of thoſe, which did continue, periſhed with the ſeverity of the cold.</p>

               <head>OCCASIONAL, OR ACCIDENTAL, RESIDENTS.</head>
               <p>There is a propriety in the diviſion of the Reſident Birds, into ſuch as commonly continue in the country the whole year through, and ſuch as only occaſionally continue. The latter may be called OCCASIONAL, or ACCIDENTAL, RESIDENTS. They ſeldom continue with us except in open, mild winters. Theſe, in the preceding liſt, are marked with an aſteriſk.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> I have had the leſs heſitation in blending them together, becauſe it is highly probable, that in a tract of country ſo extenſive and various as the ſtate of Pennſylvania, ſome of the birds, which about Philadelphia are only occaſionally reſident, may be more generally ſo in other parts of the country.</p>

               <head>OCCASIONAL VISITANTS.</head>
               <p>Some of the birds which are obſerved in Pennſylvania may, with propriety, be thrown into a ſection called OCCA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIONAL VISITANTS. Of theſe I have already made mention in the Introduction to theſe Fragments. Theſe Occaſional Viſitants are ſuch birds as occaſionally come to Pennſylvania, either from the more northern or from the more ſouthern parts of North-America. With <hi>all</hi> the cauſes which induce them to viſit us, I am not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently acquainted to ſpeak on the ſubject, with confidence. The following, however, are certainly ſome of theſe cauſes, viz. ſeverity of cold, ſcarcity of food, and intenſity of heat.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The birds which are driven by the ſeverity of cold all come to us from the northward. Theſe occaſional viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants are pretty numerous, during our very ſevere winters, when ſome of the birds of Canada and Labrador are ſeen among us. The two following ſpecies of Strix deſerve to be mentioned under this head, viz. the Great White Owl (Strix Nyctea?). This ſpecies is never ſeen in the vicinity of Philadelphia, except in thoſe winters which are very ſevere, long, and cloſe. This and the following ſpecies (See the Tables) were ſeen about Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, at the cloſe of the winter of 1791-92, which was one of our ſevereſt winters. The Tawney-Faced Owl (Strix ſtridula?) is a very beautiful ſpecies. It makes its appearance, in the day-time, near houſes and barns, watching for mice, or for thoſe weakly birds which have been compelled by the ſeverity of the cold to take ſhelter there.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It may readily be imagined, that a ſcarcity of food, particularly of their favourite food, is one of the cauſes which induce birds to make occaſional viſits to other countries than their own. I am even of opinion, that this has been the original cauſe of ſome of thoſe migrations which are now regular and extenſive.</p>
               <p n="3">III. I have mentioned intenſity of heat, or very warm weather, as one of the cauſes which ſometimes impel or induce birds to migrate to us. It is probable, however, that this cauſe more frequently operates in a ſecondary manner; that is, by producing a ſcarcity of food. All the Occaſional Viſitants that fall under this ſection come from the ſouthward. See the Introduction, where I have mentioned ſome of theſe viſitants.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035159_0033_10012AE0291209C0"/>know that the Gracula Quiſcula has ever been ſeen immediately about Philadelphia. It is commonly ſeen on or near the fea-coaſt, and not often twenty miles diſtant from it. It loves the neighbourhood of the ſea, and of brackiſh water. The Gracula which I mention, in the Tables, is very common about Philadelphia, where it aſſociates with the Red-Wing Oriole, or Oriolus phoeniceus, and with Crows (Corvus Corone), committing great depredations on the mays in the fields; and in the Southern States, on the rice that is ſtacked in the barn yards. Builds on trees, pretty high up, and ſeems, for this purpoſe, to give a preference to the evergreens, ſuch as tall Pine-trees, &amp;c. Our Gracula is either the Gracula Barrita, Boat-Tail-Grakle, or very nearly allied to it.</p>
            <p>* Fringilla pecoris. This bird certainly belongs to the ſame genus as the Oriolus phoeniceus, whether that be Emberiza or Fringilla. It follows cows and horſes, pulling aſunder their excrements, in order to get at the feeds. It alights on their backs, eating flies and other inſects from them. In ſome parts of Pennſylvania, it is beſt known by the name of Cow-Bird. It is the Sturnus ſtercorarius of Bartram. <hi>Travels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>* Motacilla Sialis. This is one of our earlieſt ſinging birds. Its note is highly agreeable. It is the <hi>Tſchi-boa-pe-ke-lis</hi> of the Delawares. See P. 12. Sect. III.</p>
            <p>* Scolopax Gallinago. Scolopax americana rufa of Bartram. <hi>Travels.</hi> It is the <hi>Me-me-u</hi> of the Delaware-Indians.</p>
            <p>* Charadrius vociferus. This ſpecies is obſerved to increaſe in proportion as the country becomes cleared. Is very ſeldom ſeen remote from the habitations of man.</p>
            <p>* Scolopax minor. Scolopax minor arvenſis of Bartram. <hi>Travels. Pi-ſi-co-lis?</hi> of the Delaware-Indians.</p>
            <p>* Hirundo purpurea. <hi>Pons-pau-cloo-mooſc,</hi> or "the bird that never reſts," of the Mohegan-Indians. I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that this and the three other ſpecies of Swallow, which I have mentioned, are migratory birds. I am not ignorant, that an oppoſite opinion is gaining ground among us. See Dr. Belknap's <hi>Hiſtory of New Hampſhire,</hi> Vol. III. p. 174. My friend, Mr. William Bartram, aſſures me, "that he has ſeen, in the ſpring, large flocks of all our Swallows, upon their paſſage from the ſouth, and in the autumn, on their return ſouthward from Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, through Carolina, to Florida, where, however, neither of them winter; but continue farther on ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward" <hi>MS. penes me.</hi> I cannot but conſider the teſtimony of this gentleman, in matters of this kind, as of high value. Indeed, all my enquiries convince me, that our ſwallows are migratory birds. I am, however, far from denying, that ſwallows have <hi>occaſionally</hi> been found in the hollows of decayed trees, in different parts of our country, during that very ſeaſon, when it ſuppoſed theſe birds are in a more ſouthern climate. I will not even deny, that they have been found under the mud of rivers, &amp;c. Theſe, however, muſt be conſidered as <hi>extraordinary</hi> inſtances, which very rarely occur. They only ſerve to ſhow the accommodating powers of birds, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times continue in a country the whole year through, and in other times migrate from theſe countries. It is not difficult to account for ſome of the inſtances of Swallows being found in trees, &amp;c. In theſe inſtances, I preſume, the birds have been compelled to take up their habitations here, after their return from the ſouth, having been ſurprized by very cold weather. The Swallows are, certainly, very impatient of cold.<note n="†" place="bottom">My very reſpectable and learned friend Dr. John Walker, Profeſſor of Natural Hiſtory in the Univerſity of Edinburgh, uſed to inform his claſs, that he "Once knew a cold night (in Scotland) to overtake the Martin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>), and the Swallows (Hirundo ruſtica), which benumbed them to ſuch a degree, that they ſeemed dead, but when they were brought into a warm room, they recovered, and after the ſun roſe, they all took to the wing. Not one of them was deſtroyed by the cold."</note> No wonder, therefore, that in a climate ſo variable as that of Pennſylvania, theſe birds ſhould ſometimes retire into trees, &amp;c. to ſeek ſhelter. I have obſerved, that ſeveral weeks after the firſt appearance of the Swallows in the ſpring, the coming on of a cold day, has occaſioned in them great diſtreſs. The following fact will ſtrikingly illuſtrate what I am ſaying. The beginning of the month of April, 1773, was unuſually warm. In the vicinity of Philadelphia, the clover, in ſome of the fields, was five or ſix inches high. The Martins (Hirundo purpurea) were ſeen about the city: at this time, there came on ſuddenly a very ſevere ſpell of cold weather. It deſtroyed many of theſe birds, ſeveral of which were ſeen to drop down, benumbed or dead, among the clover.</p>
            <p>If any ſpecies of our ſwallows continues with us the whole year, I think it moſt likely to be the Hirundo—, or Little Bank-Martin. I have been informed, that in ſeveral inſtances, this ſpecies has been found in a torpid
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035159_0034_10012AE402EF3C68"/>ſtate, in the holes of banks. I am alſo told, that above thirty years ago, a number of theſe birds were found in a Gum-tree (Nyſſa ſylvatica<note n="†" place="bottom">Of Marſhall: Nyſſa integriſolia of Aiton.</note>), about four miles from the town of Lancaſter. This was in the depth of winter. They were all torpid, but ſome of them, upon the application of heat, recovered.</p>
            <p>Of the four ſpecies of Pennſylvania ſwallows, (viz. Hirundo purpurea, the Hirundo ruſtica? the Hirundo—, and the Hirundo pelaſgia) the firſt, or Purple Martin, is the one which commonly viſits us the earlieſt, viz. at the end of March, or beginning of April. The Houſe-Swallow and the Little Bank-Martin come next, and the Chimney-Bird laſt of all. This, at leaſt, is the general order of the appearance of the four ſpecies.</p>
            <p>* Hirundo ruſtica? This is not the Hirundo ruſtica of Europe. It wants a name. It may be called Hirundo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reorum, from its ſo generally frequenting our barns to build its neſt. But this name is liable to objections. I do not know any of our <hi>Indian</hi> names for this ſpecies. One of <hi>theſe</hi> (if not too long) would be the beſt ſpecific name we could give to it.</p>
            <p>* Hirundo—. Little Bank-Martin. This is not the Hirundo riparia of Linnaeus. It has, however, very much the manners or habits of that bird. I have never ſeen the Hirundo riparia in any part of America. Kalm, Pennant, Gmelin, and other writers aſſert that it is a native of this continent. Dr. Belknap (P. 173) mentions the Hirundo riparia in his liſt of the birds of New-Hampſhire: but I do not doubt that he means our Little Bank-Martin. I know (without any particular alluſion to my excellent deceaſed friend) how the nomenclature of natural hiſtory has been conducted in America.</p>
            <p>* Falco piſcatorius. This is Cateſby's and Bartram's name. It is the <hi>Ni-me-nees</hi> of the Delaware-Indians.</p>
            <p>* Certhia Pinus.</p>
            <p>* Fringilla graminea. This is the Paſſer campeſtris of Bartram. MS.</p>
            <p>* Motacilla caerulea. Perhaps, this bird is more properly a ſpecies of the genus Parus. It forms a very curious neſt of the moſs which grows upon rocks, trees, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>* Ardea Herodias. See Section III. p. 12.</p>
            <p>* Alcedo Alcyon. <hi>Tis-ke-man-nis?</hi> of the Delaware-Indians.</p>
            <p>* Colymbus ſeptentrionalis. Flocks of theſe birds frequent our large rivers, diving for fiſh. Their voice is muſical, eſpecially when a ſoutherly wind blows ſtrong. This is the Colymbus muſicus of Bartram. <hi>Travels.</hi> It is as large as a gooſe.</p>
            <p>* Colymbus migratorius of Bartram. This is near the ſize of a gooſe. Colour black. Bill red. Their principal food is eels and other fiſh. They viſit the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, when the froſts are paſſed. They ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally fly in companies of two, three, or four together, and but a little above the ſurface of the water.</p>
            <p>* Colymbus Podiceps. This is ſometimes called the Water-Witch.</p>
            <p>* Anas ſponſa. This beautiful ſpecies is the <hi>Gi-gi-tſchi-mu-is</hi> of the Delaware-Indians. It builds its neſt in the holes of trees. Attempts have been made to domeſticate it. but hitherto, they have not, I believe, been ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>* Columba carolinenſis. See Section III. P. 12. It is the <hi>Me-med-ba-cke-mo</hi> of the Delaware-Indians.</p>
            <p>* Columba migratoria. Theſe birds commonly paſs the winter-ſeaſon in the foreſts of Carolina, Georgia, and the two Floridas; and paſs over the Gulph of Mexico to the Bahama-Iſlands. Upon their return ſouthward in the autumn, they ſometimes ſtay with us a conſiderable time, and they have been known, during our mild winters, to continue with us, as I have already obſerved. See Section III. P. 12. and Introduction. P. ix. § XVI.</p>

* Turdus rufus. Builds its neſt of looſe ſticks, uſing no cement. In this reſpect, it agrees with the Turdus Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glottos, or Mocking-Bird, but differs from the Turdus migratorius, or Robin. This laſt uſes a kind of mud or mortar, in making its neſt.</p>

            </p>

This is the Motacilla paluſtris, or Regulus minor, of Bartram. <hi>Travels.</hi> In many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, this little bird agrees with the Motacilla Troglodytes of Linnaeus: the Wren of the Engliſh. I am not quite certain, whether they are not both the ſame ſpecies; but, I believe, they are different. Our bird conſtruct, a very curious neſt, reſembling in ſhape a bottle, or pitcher. The materials which it makes uſe of are dry graſs, among the living graſs of meadows. The Motacilla Troglodytes? of which I am ſpeaking, is a ſpecies of Certhia, or Creeper. It certainly belongs to the ſame genus as the Certhia familiaris mentioned below, and the Certhia floridana, afterwards taken notice of.</p>
            <p>* Ardea vireſcens. Commonly called S—e-Poke.</p>
            <p>* Certhia familiaris (mihi). I now ſuſpect, that this is no other than the Certhia familiaris of Linnaeus, the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean Creeper of Pennant; Le Grimpereau of Buffon. Mr. Pennant mentions this as an inhabitant of North-America, and tells us, that it is found in Sweden, "and never quits the country."<note n="†" place="bottom">Arctic Zoology. VOL. I. P. 334</note> This to the American na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt, is an intereſting fact; for the Creeper is with us undoubtedly a bird of paſſage: a bird of paſſage, in a much milder climate than that in which it is a continual reſident!! But many facts like this will be diſcovered in the progreſs of natural ſcience.</p>

            <p>* Caprimulgus virginianus. This is the <hi>We-coo-lis</hi> of the Delaware-Indians. Although it feeds entirely upon inſects, its fleſh is ſaid to be delicious. I have been informed, that ſome of theſe birds have been found in a torpid ſtate, in hollow trees, in Jerſey. But I cannot entirely depend upon the fact; and I have little heſitation in ſaying, that this bird, as well as the Swallows, to which it is allied, is a bird of paſſage.

            <p>* Lanius Tyrannus. This I rather conſider as a ſpecies of Muſcicapa. It may be called Muſcicapa rex. It eats both infects and fruit. Is very deſtructive to bees, and to grapes.</p>
            <p>* Oriolus Baltimore. As far as I know, this is the only Pennſylvania bird that builds a penſile or hanging neſt. Mr. Pennant is miſtaken in ſaying that the Oriolus phoeniceus, or Red-Wing Oriole, which I have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, builds ſuch a neſt. "The Red-Winged Orioles, (ſays he) build their neſts in buſhes, and among the reeds, in retired ſwamps, in form of a hang-neſt; leaving it ſuſpended at ſo judicious a height, and by ſo wondrous an inſtinct, that the higheſt floods never reach to deſtroy it."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Arctic Zoology.

            </p>
            <p>* Trochilus Colubris. I have not been able to learn that the Humming-Bird winters in any, not even in the warmeſt, parts of the United-States. I cannot heſitate to conſider it as a bird of paſſage. A gentleman, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035159_0036_10012AE68F9BB270"/>(whoſe name I do not recollect) wrote a little paper to prove, that theſe birds continue with us all the winter: why? becauſe one of them was one froſty day, in the month of October, found a good deal benumbed in a church, in ſome part of New-England; I think in Connecticut.</p>
            <p>* Turdus Trichas. This bird is moſt improperly arranged by Linnaeus under his genus of Turdus.</p>
            <p>* Picus erythrocephalus. This is the <hi>Me-ma-koch-cus</hi> of the Delaware-Indians. See Section III. P. 11.</p>
            <p>* Motacilla aurocapilla. This is very properly conſidered as a ſpecies of Turdus, or Thruſh, both by Edwards and by Pennant. It is the Turdus minimus, vertice aurio, of Bartram. <hi>Travels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>* Tanagra rubra. This and the Summer-Red-Bird of Cateſby (VOL. I. P. 56.) both belong to the ſame genus. Their note and their manners are the ſame. They both eat the ſame food, viz. fruit and inſects.</p>
            <p>* Muſcicapa olivacea. I do not think, with Mr. Pennant,<note n="†" place="bottom">Arctic Zoology. V. II. P. 79.</note> that this is the ſame bird as the Whip-Tom-Kelly of the Weſt-Indies. Our bird has no ſuch note; but a great variety of ſoft, tender, and agreeable notes. It inhabits foreſts, and does not, like the Weſt-India bird, build a "pendulous neſt."</p>

            <p>* Muſcicapa viridis. This is a bird of very ſingular form, manners, and language. I am not ſatisfied as to its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus. It ſeems to be allied to the Manakin of Edwards and Briſſon.</p>
            <p>* Falco ſparverius. In the month of March, it builds its neſt in hollow trees, and feeds its young with mice, frogs, and ſmall birds.</p>
            <p>* Tanagra cyanea. This is ſometimes called in Pennſylvania, Indigo-Bird. It is the Linaria cyanea of Bartram. <hi>Travels.</hi>

            <p>* Motacilla petechia. Mr. Pennant is miſtaken in ſaying that this pretty ſpecies does not breed in Pennſylvania.</p>
            <p>* Muſcicapa rapax of Bartram. I take this to be the Leſſer Creſted Fly-Catcher of Mr. Pennant: the Muſcicapa acadica of Gmelin. It is a very uſeful little bird, deſtroying numbers of the common houſe-fly and other trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome inſects. It continues with us until late in September, when it retires ſoutherly to paſs the winter.</p>
            <p>* Ardea cinerea.</p>
            <p>* Rallus virginianus. This is the bird which is ſo well known in Pennſylvania by the name of Rail. It is a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion much diſputed among our ſportſmen, whether this be a bird of paſſage, or whether it continues among us. I have no doubt, that it is a bird of paſſage. It is well known in Carolina and Florida, where it commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues late, devouring the ſeed of the Zizania, Rice, and other aquatic plants. Whether it hiemates in theſe countries, or goes ſtill farther to the ſouth, I do not know.</p>
            <p>* Ardea parva of Bartram. I cannot find that this ſpecies is deſcribed. It builds its neſt in the graſs of meadows. It is the ſmalleſt ſpecies of the genus that is known to me.</p>
            <p>* Alauda Calandra. This is the Calandra pratenſis of Bartram. <hi>Travels.</hi> The Calandra floralia of the ſame gentleman.</p>

* Motacilla vermivora. Mr. Pennant is miſtaken when he aſſerts, that this bird "does not appear in Pennſylvania till July, in its paſſage northward."<note n="†" place="bottom">Arctic Zoology. Vol. II. P. 100.—See Introduction. P. viii.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Certhia floridana (mihi). This bird I do not find figured or deſcribed. It is mentioned by Mr. Bartram <hi>(Travels),</hi> under the name of Motacilla coroliniana, or Regulus magnus. It is nearly twice the ſize of the Houſe-Wren, or Certhia familiaris? Like it, its voice is loud and muſical. The upper ſide of the Certhia floridana is of a nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brown colour, delicately marked with tranſverſe waved lines, of a darker colour. The throat, breaſt, and belly are of a yellowiſh clay colour. A line of the ſame colour paſſes, in form of an arch, over each eye. The bill is long, and a little bent downwards. This is a common bird in Carolina and Florida. It only occaſionally viſits Pennſylvania, viz. in long and warm ſummers. Is much more common in the Jerſeys.</p>
            <p>Vultur Aura. This bird rears its young in the ſouthern ſtates, before its arrival among us. I cannot learn, that it ever breeds in Pennſylvania. I have been informed, that theſe birds have occaſionally been found, in the winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſon, in the hollows of trees, and in the crevices of rocks, in different parts of the United-States, even to the north of Philadelphia. It is the <hi>Wi-nan-go-u</hi> and <hi>A-ma-tſchi-pu-is</hi> of the Delawares, <hi>Sot-ſeh-tah</hi> of the Wyandots, and <hi>Guſ-ſoo</hi> of the Mohegans.</p>
            <p>* Ardea alba. Ardea immaculata of Bartram. <hi>Travels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ardea aequinoctialis. Ardea alba minor of Bartram. <hi>Travels.</hi> It is Pennant's Red-Billed Egret.</p>
            <p>Emberiza oryzivora. If I do not miſtake, this bird in Connecticut is called the Strawberry-bird. On the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Mr. Cateſby, it has been believed by the moſt reſpectable naturaliſts (Pennant and others), that the male and female Rice-Birds migrate ſeparately, at different ſeaſons. Thus, it is imagined, that the males make their appearance in the vicinity of Philadelphia in the ſpring, and the females in the autumn, or the cloſe of ſummer. Some facts which have come under my notice induce me to ſuſpect, that this is a vulgar error: one of the many miſtakes with which natural hiſtory is crouded and deformed. But, at preſent, I can only throw out the ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>* Parus bicolor. This is the Parus criſtatus of Bartram. <hi>Travels.</hi> This ſpecies feeds both upon inſects and upon ſeeds, picking the kernel out of the huſk. In Pennſylvania, it is called Tom-tit.</p>
            <p>* Parus virginianus. Parus cedrus of Bartram. This bird feeds upon feeds and berries, particularly upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinous berries of the Juniperus virginiana, or Red-Cedar. Commonly comes to us, from the northward, about the time theſe berries are ripe,<note n="†" place="bottom">See the Tables. P. 7.</note> and ſeems peculiarly fond of harbouring itſelf among theſe trees. Generally continues with us as long as the berries and inſects (upon which alſo it feeds) laſt, and then goes northerly. Sometimes, however, it continues with us all winter.</p>
            <p>* Ampelis Garrulus. In ſome parts of New-England, this ſpecies is called Cherry-Bird. Like the Parus virginia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, it is very fond of the ripe berries of the Red-cedar. It is alſo very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ond of the ripe fruit of the Dioſpyros virginiana, or Perſimmon. Builds its neſt in trees of a moderate ſize, about the end of May, or the beginning of June.</p>
            <p>Fringilla cannabina? I am not quite certain whether this be the Fringilla cannabina of Linnaeus. It is certainly very nearly allied to this ſpecies. Large flocks of theſe birds viſit us towards the end of the fall, or the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the winter. They often fly at very great heights in the air: ſo high that they cannot readily be ſeen, though their noiſe is diſtinctly heard. Either this ſpecies or one very nearly allied to it is found as far ſouth as the country of the Cheerake-Indians, who call it <hi>O-na-clo-nei-ta.</hi> If this be the Fringilla cannabina, it has an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive range in North-America, for it is found in the northern parts of this continent. It is one of the ſpecies which is common to the old and new world. It is not improbable, that it performs regular migrations from the one continent to the other.</p>
            <p>* Scolopax Gallinago. I have already mentioned this ſpecies,<note n="§" place="bottom">See Appendix I. P 16.</note> and have taken notice of the regularity of its arrival among us.<note n="‖" place="bottom">See Introduction. P. xi.</note> It is, certainly, a bird of paſſage. This ſeems to be the ſame ſpecies which is ſo common in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035159_0038_100129EF694FD610"/>and in other parts of Europe, and concerning whoſe diſappearance the learned have ſo much diſputed. There are pretty good reaſons for believing, that theſe birds perform regular migrations between Europe and America. It is remarkable, that they are more numerous on the weſtern than on the eaſtern ſhore of Britain. They are ſtill more numerous in the weſt of Ireland than in the weſt of Scotland. "For one Wood-Cock on the eaſt-coaſt of Scotland there are twelve in the weſt, and for one in the weſt of Scotland there are twelve in Ireland."<note n="*" place="bottom">Reverend Dr Walker, of Edinburgh.</note> Lord Kenmor, about the laſt of September, ſailed from Liſbon to Falmouth, in England, and for ten or twelve days was becalmed on the coaſt of France. Every day, he ſaw from ten to twenty Wood-cocks paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the weſt towards the land. Theſe it was imagined, came from the continent of America. But I do not ſuppoſe that all our Wood-cocks thus migrate to Europe. It is pretty certain, that theſe birds when they viſit us in the ſpring come from the ſouth, and in the autumn they return to the ſouth again. How far ſouth they proceed, I am unable to determine. They are known in Florida, where it is not improbable, that many of them paſs the winter-ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Fringilla pinus (mihi). This is one of our ſpring birds of paſſage, and I think is not deſcribed. It commonly continues with us until the middle or the end of April, at which time the Apple and the Pear trees are in bloom. Theſe bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, during ſome particular ſeaſons, are remarkably infeſted by a ſpecies of Chermes, which proves very deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the fruit. By feeding on theſe devouring inſects, the Fringilla pinus is one of the moſt uſeful of our birds. This bird, the Fringilla triſtis, my Fringilla exilis, and the Fringilla cannabina? together with the Fringilla Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duelis of the old world, all belong to the ſame natural genus, or family. They ſeem, in ſome reſpects, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a genus diſtinct from the Fringilla.</p>
            <p>AS theſe FRAGMENTS profeſs to contain ſome <hi>uſeful</hi> obſervations,<note n="†" place="bottom">See the motto, in the Title-Page.</note> I think this a proper place to obſerve, that many of the birds of Pennſylvania, and other parts of the United-States, are ſo extremely uſeful to man, by deſtroying inſects and reptiles of various kinds, that they ought ſtudiouſly to be preſerved, if not by the LAWS, at leaſt by the GOOD-SENSE, of the country. It would require many obſervations to give a complete liſt and hiſtory of theſe USEFUL BIRDS. I am not in poſſeſſion of a ſufficient quantity of facts for this purpoſe: but ſome obſervations I can offer, as materials for future inquirers.</p>
            <p>It may, in the firſt place, be obſerved, that inſects appear to be the firſt food of almoſt all the birds of our country. The more I have inquired, the more I have been convinced, that almoſt all birds live, in ſome meaſure, upon inſects. Even thoſe ſpecies which conſume conſiderable quantities of feeds, berries, and fruit, alſo conſume large quantities of inſects: and there are reaſons to believe, that others whoſe principal food is the nectar of plants alſo live partly upon theſe inſects. Thus Mr. Brandis<note n="‡" place="bottom">See the article Trochilus in Ginelin's edition of the Syſtema Natr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The greater number of our ſmaller birds of the order of <hi>Paſſeres,</hi> ſeem to demand our attention and protection. Some of them feed pretty entirely upon inſects, and others upon a mixed food, that is, inſects and the vegetable feeds, &amp;c. Many of them contribute much to our pleaſure by the melody of their notes. I believe the injury they do us is but ſmall compared to the good they render us. I ſhall mention, under ſix different heads, a few of the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful birds of this and ſome other orders.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Muſcicapa acadica of Gmelin? This is the Leſſer Creſted Flycatcher of Pennant. It is called in Pennſylvania the Leſſer or Wood-Pewe. This little bird builds in woods and in foreſts. After the young have left the neſts, the parents conduct them to the gardens and habitations of men. Here the whole brood dwells in trees near the houſes, where they are fed with the common houſe-fly, and other inſects, that are caught by the old birds. The young ones are ſoon capable of obtaining their food in the ſame way. This ſpecies of Muſcicapa viſits us in the ſpring, and commonly continues with us until late in September, when it retires ſoutherly to winter.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Motacilla Sialis, or Blue-Bird, feeds principally, if not entirely, upon inſects, both ſuch as are flying and and ſuch as are reptile. It is ſaid they eat currants.</p>

III. Moſt of our ſpecies of Picus, or Woodpecker, appear to me to be very uſeful in deſtroying inſects, particularly thoſe which injure our foreſt and orchard-trees. It is true, theſe birds are ſometimes injurious to us, by eating ſome of our fineſt fruits, particularly our cherries, and therefore pains are taken to expell them from our gardens. But they devour vaſt numbers of inſects, particularly ſome of thoſe ſpecies which prove ſo deſtructive to the trunk of the trees, ſuch as the coleopterous inſects, which, perhaps, do as much miſchief as the caterpillars.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. As a devourer of pernicious inſects, one of the moſt uſeful birds with which I am acquainted, is the Houſe-Wren, or Certhia familiaris?<note n="*" place="bottom">In the Tables, it is called Certhia familiaris <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>.</note> This little bird ſeems peculiarly fond of the ſociety of man, and it muſt be confeſſed, that it is often protected by his intereſted care. From obſerving the uſefulneſs of this bird in deſtroying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, it has long been a cuſtom, in many parts of our country, to ſix a ſmall box at the end of a long pole in gardens, about houſes, &amp;c. as a place for it to build in. In theſe boxes they build and hatch their young. When the young are hatched, the parent birds feed them with a variety of different inſects, particularly ſuch as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious in gardens.

                  </gap>hem, in Pennſylvania.</note> was at the trouble to obſerve the number of times that a pair of theſe birds came from their box, and returned with inſects for their young. He found that they did this from forty to ſixty times in an hour; and in one particular hour the birds carried food to their young, ſeventy-one times. In this buſineſs, they were engaged the greater part of the day; ſay twelve hours. Taking the medium, therefore, of fifty times an hour, it appeared that a ſingle pair of theſe birds took from the cabbage, ſallad, beans, peas, and other vegetables in the garden, at leaſt ſix hundred inſects in the courſe of one day. This calculation proceeds upon the ſuppoſition, that the two birds took each only a ſingle inſect each time. But it is highly probable they often took ſeveral at a time.</p>
            <p>The ſpecies of Certhia of which I am ſpeaking generally hatches twice during the courſe of the ſummer. They are very numerous about Philadelphia, and in other parts of the United-States.</p>
            <p>The fact juſt related is well calculated to ſhow the importance of attending to the preſervation of ſome of our native birds. The eſculent vegetables of a whole garden may, perhaps, be preſerved from the depredations of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſpecies of inſects by ten or fifteen pair of theſe ſmall birds: and independently of this eſſential ſervice, they are an extremely agreeable companion to man: for their note is pleaſing. A gentleman, in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, thinks he has already reaped much advantage from the ſervices of theſe Wrens. About his fruit-trees, he has placed a number of boxes for their neſts. In theſe boxes, they very readily breed, and feed themſelves and their young with the inſects, which are ſo deſtructive to the various kinds of fruit-trees, and other vegetables.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The ſervices of the Ibis in devouring the reptiles of Egypt are well known. They procured to this bird a venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and regard which form an intereſting fact in its hiſtory, and in the hiſtory of human ſuperſtitions. The Storks are, perhaps, not leſs uſeful. Pliny tells us, that theſe birds were ſo much regarded for deſtroying ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, that in Theſſaly, in his age, it was a capital crime to kill them, and that the puniſhment was the ſame as that for murder. Virgil hints at the uſefulneſs of the ſtork when he deſcribes it as "longis inviſa colubris." In Holland, even in our times, they go wild, protected by the government, from a ſenſe of their uſefulneſs in the way I have mentioned.</p>
            <p>In Britain, if it were not for the Herons, and ſome other birds of this tribe, the frogs, the toads, and other rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, would increaſe to ſo great a degree, as to prove a real nuiſance. North-America abounds with birds of this order; and we even have ſome ſpecies of Ibis, very nearly allied to the Ibis of Egypt, ſuch as the Tantalus Loculator, or Wood-Pelecan;<note n="‡" place="bottom">Wood Ibis of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

VI. Some of the birds of the Vultur-kind are extremely uſeful to man, by deſtroying immenſe quantities of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, which ſerve to vitiate the air, and perhaps in ſome inſtances to give riſe to malignant epidemics. The Vultur Aura, or Turkey-Buzzard of our country, is one of the moſt uſeful of theſe birds. In Virginia it is protected by a law of that ſtate. The Abbé Clavigero ſpeaks of the uſefulneſs of the <hi>Cozcaquauhtli,</hi> or King of the Zopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, the Vultur Papa of Linnaeus. "The Zopilot, ſays this writer, is a moſt uſeful bird to that country (Mexico), for they not only clear the fields, but attend the crocodiles and deſtroy the eggs which the females of thoſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful amphibious animals leave in the ſand to be hatched by the heat of the ſun. The deſtruction of ſuch a bird ought to be prohibited under ſevere penalties."<note n="*" place="bottom">The Hiſtory of Mexico. Vol. 1. P 48.</note>

            <p>I am ſenſible, that theſe few facts, which are thrown together without any regard to order, can be of little uſe except in as far as they may turn the attention of other perſons, who poſſeſs more leiſure and information than myſelf, to the ſubject, which is at once curious and important. It appears to to me be a ſubject peculiarly intereſting to my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen. Perhaps, few parts of the world are more infeſted with noxious inſects than the United-States. The greater number of theſe inſects are, I believe, natives of the country, though our partiality to the ſoil which gave us birth has not always allowed us to acknowledge this truth. Thus we give to the Heſſians the honour of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing among us that moſt pernicious inſect, the Heſſian-Fly, which, for ſeveral years, has committed, and ſtill commits, ſuch alarming ravages on ſome of our moſt valuable grains, particularly the Wheat and the Rye. But this inſect is, undoubtedly, a native of America. How it came to be, for ſo long a time, overlooked, will probably be mentioned in a memoir, concerning this and other noxious inſects, which I hope to publiſh.</p>
            <p>Many of the pernicious inſects of the United-States ſeem to be increaſing, inſtead of diminiſhing. Some of theſe inſects which originally confined their ravages to the native or wild vegetables, have ſince begun their depredations upon the foreign vegetables, which are often more agreeable to their palates. Thus the Bruchus Piſi, or Pea-Fly, is a native, and ſeems originally to have fed, in a great meaſure unnoticed, upon the indigenous vegetables which are allied to the Pea: but ſince the introduction of this laſt<note n="†" place="bottom">Piſum ſativum.</note> among us, it is the principal, if not the only, vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table which ſuffers from the ravages of this inſect. The Heſſian-Fly could not originally have inhabited the Wheat, the Rye, and other ſimilar gramina of this kind, for theſe vegetables are not natives of America. It is now more formidable to us than would be an army of twenty thouſand Heſſians, or of any other twenty thouſand hirelings, ſupplied with all the implements of war. The caterpillar, which has begun its ravages upon the leaves of the Lombardy Poplar,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Populus dilat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It prefers this fine foreigner to the leſs palatable leaves upon which it has been formerly accuſtomed to feed. Other inſtances of this kind might be mentioned. They ſhow how very neceſſary it is to watch the migrations of inſects from the native to the introduced vegetables; and they teach us a truth, not I think ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently attended to by naturaliſts, that different kinds of inſects are much leſs confined to vegetables of the ſame ſpecies, or to ſpecies of the ſame genus, than has been commonly imagined. It is certain, that the ſame ſpecies of inſects, in America, often feeds indiſcriminately, and in ſucceſſion, upon plants of very oppoſite genera, and even of very different natural orders.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, too little progreſs has been made among us in the diſcovery of remedies for the great miſchiefs occaſioned by inſects. The ſubject has not been examined with ſufficient attention. It has given place to diſcuſſions and inquiries of very inferior utility; and I fear it will not claim all that induſtrious attention which it ſo well merits, until the evil ſhall have ſpread ſtill farther. It is, doubtleſs, difficult, but it is by no means impoſſible, to prevent the ravages of noxious inſects. In this important buſineſs, ſomething has already been done in our country. We have diſcovered a method of diminiſhing the depredations of the little bug, called Cucumber-Fly, which proves ſo deſtructive to the cucurbitaceous vines, particularly thoſe of the Cucumber, and Muſk-melon.<note n="§" place="bottom">See the Tables. Page 4.</note> By manuring our wheat-lands, and thereby increaſing the ſtrength and vigour of the wheat, we have leſſened the evil of the Heſſian-Fly. By ſuſpending to our young apple and other trees pieces of tow, impregnated with a mixture of brimſtone and train-oil, we have learned how to frighten away the periodical Locuſts (Cicada
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035159_0041_100129FCA9E28CA8"/>ſeptem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decim of Linnaeus), which often do ſo much injury to our orchards.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is only the female Cicada ſeptemdecim that does miſchief to our orchards, &amp;c. This ſhe does by making inciſions into the tender branches, to depoſit her eggs. In conſequence of this operation, the leaves periſh. The inſect does no miſchief "by devouring the leaves," as has been aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Page xxii.</note> The American Philoſophical Society, by calling the attention of the public to the decay of our Peach-trees, has brought us to a better acquaintance with the cauſes of this decay, and with the means of preventing it. Inſects are no doubt one of theſe cauſes.<note n="†" place="bottom">The peach-inſect (It is an Ichn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Perhaps the beſt remedy againſt the miſchief of this inſect is to dig up the ground about the roots in the ſpring-ſeaſon, and to take out the larva or worm. This may be done without much difficulty, and the operation does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the tree. Do not the peach-trees ſuffer more from our late night-froſts than from inſects? Theſe night-froſts, eſpecially after rainy whether, in the months of February and March, when the ſap is aſcending, are certainly very pernicious. They occaſion the bark to crack ſo that the ſap is permitted to run out. I ſuſpect that this is one of the principal cauſes of the decay of our peach-trees.</note> We have made ſome progreſs in preventing the miſchief of the Bruchus Piſi, or Pea-Fly, which proves ſo deſtructive to one of the fineſt eſculent vegetables. But all that has yet been done is very little compared to that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be done. The ſubject is as new as it is important.</p>
            <p>I am very far from imagining, that the preſervation of ſome of thoſe ſpecies of birds which I have mentioned would be the <hi>only</hi> means of guarding againſt, or of limiting, the depredations of <hi>any</hi> of our noxious inſects. In a ſyſtem ſo complex, and ſo difficult, as this, many agents muſt be employed. Moſt of them have a neceſſary connection with the induſtry of man, which is an implement that gives him an immenſe, an almoſt unlimited, command over all the living objects of this earth. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> is in his power to increaſe or diminiſh the number of animals and vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables about him; and even to deſtroy <hi>whole ſpecies.</hi> Some of theſe means muſt be ſuggeſted, if they cannot be put into immediate practice, by the ingenuity of philoſophers, or obſervers. Their ſpeculations will ſometimes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be trivial, and uſeleſs.

            <p>The few facts which I have mentioned will be ſufficient to ſhow, that ſome good in the prevention of miſchievous inſects, may be expected from different ſpecies of birds. Every American farmer's experience will furniſh him with ſome additional fact in ſupport of this notion. If careful obſervations on this ſubject are made, we ſhall ſoon know which are our friends, and which are our enemies: which deſerve to be cheriſhed and preſerved, and which it will be our intereſt to baniſh or deſtroy.</p>

            <p>THE preceding "fragmentary rubbiſh" (to uſe the words of Donne) is thrown upon the public with ſome degree of confidence: —with confidence, merely becauſe it regards a country, the natural hiſtory of which has hitherto been ſo little attended to. I muſt obſerve, though perhaps the reader will not believe me, that I could render theſe pages more worthy of his notice. But I want leiſure. It is this want of leiſure that has prevented me from publiſhing a number of tracts, relative to the natural hiſtory of North-America, which have long lain in my cloſet, in a ſtate nearly as imperfect as theſe very imperfect FRAGMENTS. Whether they will ever be publiſhed, will depend, in ſome meaſure, upon the reception given to the preſent work.</p>
            <p>I aſk, I look for, no ſlattering reception. All I aſk, all I require, is to be informed, by thoſe who love and ſtudy nature, that my preſent labours are not altogether uſeleſs, and unentertaining. Until there ſhall ariſe among us ſome happy genius, qualified by that union of talents, of leiſure, and enthuſiaſtic ardour, which is neceſſary to form the character of a genuine naturaliſt, every collection of facts, every individual fact, that will tend to illuſtrate the natural hiſtory of the United-States, <hi>ought</hi> to be received with candour, and indulgence.</p>
            <p>I have entitled theſe Fragments, "Part Firſt," becauſe if this is favourably received, I ſhall publiſh, in the courſe of the next year, two other parts, relative to other ſubjects of the natural hiſtory of our State. I have made conſiderable progreſs in an extenſive work on the Vegetables of Pennſylvania, and ſome of the adjoining States. But this will appear in a ſeparate form: —I will not ſay when. For who does not know, that "the promiſes of authors are like the promiſes of lovers?"</p>
