            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN EPITOME OF THE <hi>LIFE &amp; CHARACTER</hi> OF THOMAS JEFFERSON.</head>
            <p>THOMAS JEFFERSON was born in the year 1743, in the county of Albemarle in Virginia, where he now reſides. His father was a reputable land-holder of that county, and gave this, his eldeſt ſon, a college education at the univerſity of William and Mary, in the city of Williamſburg. After paſſing his degrees, being deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the bar, Mr. Jefferſon commenced a ſtudent at law, under the guidance of George Wythe, now the venerable judge and ſolo chancellor of Virginia.</p>
            <p>In 1766, Mr. Jefferſon came to the bar of the ſupreme court of his native ſtate, and continued to practiſe therein with great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and reputation, until the commencement of the American re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution in 1775, and the conſequent occluſion of the courts of jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: during this period of active practice, the induſtrious mind of Jefferſon found time to digeſt the firſt volume of reports of adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed caſes in the ſupreme courts of Virginia, which were ever exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited in that ſtate, and which to this day are admitted authority in thoſe courts; remaining a monument of his early labors and uſeful talents.</p>
            <p>In 1774, when all America were rouſed into action by the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated wrongs of the Britiſh government, Mr. Jefferſon ſtepped forward a bold and able champion of his country's rights, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his much admired pamphlet, <hi>"Summary View of the Rights of British America,"</hi> addreſſed to the King, which brought forth againſt the author threats of proſecution for treaſon, by lord Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, then governor of Virginia; threats which produced no other effect on the independent mind of Jefferſon, than publicly to avow himſelf the author, prepared to meet all conſequences.</p>
            <p>About this time Mr. Jefferſon married the daughter of Mr. Wayles, an eminent counſellor at law, and continued to enjoy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted domeſtic felicity in the ſociety of one of the moſt amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of women, until the year 1780, when by her death he became the mourner of her virtues and the guardian of their two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:036921_0002_100B5E24FB43C4A8"/>and ſurviving iſſue, to whoſe education and ſettlement in life, and the ſervice of his country, he has ever ſince faithfully devoted himſelf, ſtill remaining a widower.</p>
            <p>In the year 1775, Mr. Jefferſon was elected a member of the Virginia convention, and on the 4th of Auguſt, in the ſame year, one of the members to repreſent the ſtate, then colony, of Virginia in congreſs.</p>
            <p>In that memorable year, 1776, the natal year of American e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancipation from Britiſh tyranny, and of the independence and ſovereignty of the United States, Mr. Jefferſon was one of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of five, to wit, Thomas Jefferſon, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and R. R. Livingſton; appointed by Congreſs to draught the Declaration of Independence; and it was from the pen and enlightened mind of Jefferſon, firſt named of the committee, that that glorious inſtrument proceeded, which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the committee, and unanimouſly adopted by Congreſs, entitled, "<hi>The Declaration of Independence,</hi> &amp;c." An inſtrument which, ſo long as the records of time ſhall endure, will perpetuato the fame of its author; and preſerve in the American mind, <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> and <hi>inseparable,</hi> the names of <hi>Independence</hi> and <hi>Jefferson.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſame year, 1776, the ardent mind of Jefferſon, eagerly purſuing the glorious principles of the revolution, and foreſeeing that ſo long as the corruptions of Britiſh ſyſtems exiſted, we were independent in name not in fact, produced for the adoption of the legiſlature of his native ſtate the four following important acts, to wit:—
<list>
                  <item>1. An act for eſtabliſhing religious freedom.</item>
                  <item>2. An act to regulate deſcents, to prevent eſtates entail, and the rights of primogeniture.</item>
                  <item>3. An act for the apportionment of crimes and puniſhments.</item>
                  <item>4. An act to eſtabliſh public ſchools.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The influence of theſe acts upon the relative principles they embrace, will be univerſally ſeen and felt by thoſe who prize civil liberty as a primary bleſſing, and regard the preſervation of it as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the firſt beheſts of God to man—whilſt ſyſtems of univerſal toleration in matters of religion; for an equal diſtribution of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; and in ſubverſion of the ariſtocratic and unnatural principle of entail and primogeniture right; for ameliorating the ſanguinary code of criminal law; and for extending to the pooreſt claſs of our citizens, the benefits of education at public expenſe, will be viewed as the emanations of a great and good mind, zealouſly endeavoring to promote the happineſs and improve the condition of his fellow-beings.</p>
            <p>Equally evincive of watchful regard to the rights of his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, was the ſcheme and ſuggeſtion made by Mr. Jefferſon, for the formation and adoption of the conſtitution of Virginia, in the ſame
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:036921_0003_100B5E7019E16590"/>year, and for prefixing thereto "A Bill of Rights, declaratory of the natural and unalienable rights of man," which was accordingly done.</p>
            <p>In the year 1778, Mr. Jefferſon being then a member of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia legiſlature, preſented to that body the act to "prevent the importation of ſlaves," which was enacted into a law in the month of October in the ſame year, and was ſhortly after followed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther act "to authorize manumiſſions," being the commencement of a ſyſtem of gradual emancipation, alſo propoſed by him.</p>
            <p>In the year 1779, Mr. Jefferſon, at the age of 36, was choſen governor of Virginia, and continued in that office until June 1781 —during which time the ſtate experienced three invaſions, and was alſo brought into a critical ſtate of colliſion reſpecting its boundary lines, with two neighboring ſtates, North-Carolina and Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia. His conduct in that ſtation, amidſt the jarring conflicts and trying difficulties of foreign invaſion and domeſtic diſquietude, was ſuch as ſecured to him, ſix months after he left the office, and upon the fulleſt public enquiry, the <hi>unanimous</hi> vote of thanks of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, conſiſting of 180 members, "for his attentive adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the powers of the executive whilſt in office."</p>
            <p>It was during the ſame year, 1781, amidſt the cares of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſcenes of private affliction, that Mr. Jefferſon prepared his celebrated work, afterwards publiſhed in France, and which he modeſtly ſtiled <hi>"Notes on Virginia."</hi> In this work, ſo juſtly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by all the learned world, for its philoſophical reſearch, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious theory, and able diſquiſition, equally evidencing an enlarged, liberal, and pious mind, the author, in a ſuperior ſtyle of eloquence, boldly attacks and fully refutes the fallacious theories of M. Buffon and the Abbe Raynal, which tend to diſparage the animal ſpecies, both man and beaſt, of the American world, and reduce them to a ſcale ſmaller than thoſe of Europe; vindicating with truth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence the equal diſtribution of nature's bleſſings to America.</p>
            <p>In the year 1783, Mr. Jefferſon was again appointed to a ſeat in Congreſs from his native ſtate, and in the following year, on the 7th of May, was nominated by that honorable body miniſter pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiary of the United States to the court of France, as the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of our illuſtrious Franklin, whither he embarked early in the ſame year, and remained abſent from the United States, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the duties of that important truſt, until the month of October 1789, when he returned home by permiſſion of the then preſident, Waſhington, who upon being elected to the chief magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy of the federal government, immediately deſtined Mr. Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſtill the next moſt honorable and confidential ſtation in the executive government, near his own perſon.</p>
            <p>During his miſſion to France, Mr. Jefferſon, with that peculiar addreſs, intelligence, and attention to promote the eſſential inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:036921_0004_100B5E2977C20470"/>of the United States, which directs all his conduct, obtained from the French king an arrete, highly beneficial to the American commerce, for the free admiſſion, exempt from the cuſtomary fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign duties, of oil, fiſh, and whalebone, the product of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can fiſheries, into certain ports, and for the ſale of American built ſhips in all the ports of France—benefits which our eaſtern brethren continued to reap the peculiar advantage of, until the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the revolutionary convulſions which have agitated that nation.</p>
            <p>About the ſame period alſo, Mr. Jefferſon, in conjunction with our immortal Franklin, negociated with a miniſter from the court of Pruſſia, then at the Hague, that celebrated treaty known by the name of the <hi>"Prussian Treaty,"</hi> in which an aſtoniſhed world has, for the firſt time, ſeen a public avowal and poſitive proviſion by treaty, between two ſovereign and independent nations, for the eſtabliſhment of thoſe two great and glorious principles, promotive of univerſal peace and happineſs, to wit, 1ſt, <hi>"That free ships shall make free goods;"</hi> and 2d, <hi>"That privateering in time of war be abolished"</hi>—principles which it were to be wiſhed could be render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed univerſal and eternal. Mr. Adams, now Preſident of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, was one of the commiſſion for negociating this treaty, and on its completion it was ſent over to London, where Mr. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams then reſided as miniſter of the United States, for his ſignature. It is greatly to be regretted that Mr. Adams could not be content to retain to himſelf a ſhare of the glory which reflects on the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this celebrated treaty. But, unhappily for our country, ſince he became Preſident of the United States, we have ſeen him nominate his ſon, John Quincy Adams, as miniſter to the court of Pruſſia, for the expreſs purpoſe, as declared, of renewing the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with that nation, which having been limited to continue in force for ten years only, had expired. Accordingly, another trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has been made by his ſon with Pruſſia, which has been approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a majority of the Senate, and ratified by the Preſident; but which, inſtead of renewing and continuing the old treaty, is in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a new one, expreſsly abandoning and renouncing the two ines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timable principles, 1ſt, <hi>"That free ships make free goods,"</hi> and 2d, <hi>"That privateering in time af war be abolished;"</hi>—principles which, it appears, from the correſpondence accompanying the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation laid before the Senate of the United States by the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the wiſe and enlightened miniſters of the Pruſſian monarch were brought with great difficulty and reluctance to abandon, on the earneſt ſolicitation and reiterated demand of the American negociator, under the ſuggeſtion that the maritime powers, <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Great-Britain,</hi> would never ſanction or permit them.</p>
            <p>In the year 1789, Mr. Jefferſon being returned to the United States, and appointed by Preſident Waſhington, ſecretary to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:036921_0005_100B5E725E3BF1C8"/>of ſtate, immediately entered on the arduous duties of that important ſtation, having previouſly ſtipulated with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, that in conſideration of the many years abſence from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and eſtate, he might be permitted at the expiration of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional term for which the preſident was elected, to retire from the public ſervice.</p>
            <p>The firſt reſult of the labours of Mr. Jefferſon in the department of ſtate, were exhibited to congreſs in the following reports, viz.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1ſt. A report on the fiſheries of the United States.</item>
               <item>2d. A report, on coins, weights and meaſures.</item>
               <item>3d. A report, on the waſte and unappropriated lands of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States.</item>
               <item>4th. A report on the privileges and reſtrictions on the commerce of the United States in foreign countries.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Each of theſe reports diſplayed the uſual accuracy, information, and intelligence of the writer.</p>
            <p>But it was reſerved for a more critical and delicate period in the affairs of the United States, that the pre-eminent talents of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſecretary ſhould become more conſpicuous, and intereſtingly uſeful to his country: The non-execution of the treaty of peace with the United States, on the part of Great Britain, her detention of our Weſtern Poſts, and the attendant ſpoliations on our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, both by Great Britain and France, then at war with each other, added to the intrigues of the miniſter of the latter, Genet, all conduced to a ſituation difficult and perplexing. Beſides which, Spain continued to withhold from us the free navigation of the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſippi, ſo eſſential to all Weſtern America. In this ſtate of things, the juſt confidence which the diſcriminating mind of Waſhington had repoſed in Mr. Jefferſon, was amply repaid by that promptneſs, zeal, and ability with which the American ſecretary contributed by his labours to relieve the executive from embarraſſment. Thro' a ſeries of maſterly and unequalled diplomatique correſpondence, which he maintained at the ſame time, with the reſpective miniſters of Great Britain and France—namely Hammond and Genet, he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed and rebutted their reſpective cauſes of charge and complaint againſt the United States, and having fully proved the various ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions and infractions of treaty on the part of their reſpective governments, pointed to the means of preſerving the honor and maintaining the rights of his own country; whilſt alike ſuperior to the intrigues of Great Britain or of France, he fully manifeſted that he held no particular attachment to any foreign nation, but was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually prepared, with the deciſion, firmneſs, and intelligence of a True American, to oppoſe and reſiſt the aggreſſions of all. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal of Genet, and appointment of his ſucceſſor, with the ſubſequent proceedings between the United States and France, the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mr. Jay, his treaty with Great Britain and the recal of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036921_0006_100B5E2E3AB76AF8"/>Mr. Hammond, appointment of Mr. Liſton, and ſubſequent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings with Great Britain, are all well known. In reſpect to Spain, the labours of Mr. Jefferſon were more immediately effective and complete. Having poſſeſſed the commiſſioners of the United States then at Madrid, negociating a treaty with the court of Spain; with the moſt ample and pointed inſtructions, and alſo of the form and proviſions of a treaty predicated on the baſis of the free navigation of the Miſſiſſippi, it remained only for Mr. T. Pinckney, the minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the United States at London, under ſpecial inſtruction from the Preſident, and appointed envoy for that purpoſe, to repair to Madrid, and ſeizing the favorable moment for effecting it, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh this deſirable work. This was accordingly done, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual promptneſs and deciſion on his part, and jointly to that, and the labours of the American ſecretary in the cabinet, are the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States indebted for the moſt liberal, honorable, and beneficial treaty, they have ever yet entered into with a foreign nation.</p>
            <p>About this time, having, at the preſſing entreaty of the then Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident Waſhington, remained one year longer at the head of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of ſtate, than he had before ſtipulated to do, he reſigned his office, and retired with the warmeſt thanks and regret of the Preſident, Waſhington, to his eſtate at Monticello, in Albermarle County, Virginia, where he continued for upwards of two years uninterruptedly to enjoy the ſweets of domeſtic eaſe, and a reſpite from the fatigues of public life, following with avidity his favorite purſuits of philoſophical reſearch and agricultural improvement, until the voice of his country again ſummoned him to the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſcenes of public duty, and placed him in nomination for the preſidential chair, as the ſucceſſor of Waſhington. The iſſue of that election is well known, and but for a falſe return in one ſtate, and the ſuppreſſion of a return in another, Mr. Jefferſon would have been declared Preſident; as the return however ſtood before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, it appeared that he had 68 votes, and Mr. Adams 71, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the latter was declared Preſident, and the former Vice Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of the United States.</p>
            <p>In the month of January, 1797, Mr. Jefferſon was elected Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the American Philoſophical Society, held at Philadelphia, as ſucceſſor of the great and virtuous Rittenhouſe, who was the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſucceſſor of our immortal Franklin, the founder of that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>for the second time,</hi> the voice of his country has pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Mr. Jefferſon in nomination for the <hi>Presidential chair.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Fellow-Citizens of the United States,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The foregoing character of Mr. Jefferſon, is drawn not by the partial hand of a friend, nor under the influence of political or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty prejudicies; there is no need of fabrication, falſehood or decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036921_0007_100B5E749C26A658"/>You ſee it in the faithful and unerring record of his many great and virtuous deeds; in the public uſefulneſs and eminent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of a well ſpent life; in the numerous teſtimonials of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's approbation, and by the univerſal ſuffrage of the foreign world, in their acknowledged tributes of reſpect and eſteem for the talents of his head and the virtues of his heart. Its leading features pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to you a man of pure, ardent and affected piety; of ſincere and genuine virtue; of an enlightened mind and ſuperior wiſdom; the adorer of our God; the patriot of his country; and the friend and benefactor of the whole human race.</p>
            <p>And ſuch, fellow-citizens, is the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real</hi> character of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Jefferson,</hi> unaided by artificial colourings of the falſe varniſh of deceptive flattery.</p>

            <p>The Preſſes, Pulpits, Benches, and Theatres, under the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate direction or intermediate control of government or its agents, have long teemed with the vileſt abuſe, detraction, and falſhood, reſpecting the character of Mr. JEFFERSON. They have repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him as a Deiſt, diſbelieving the Chriſtian Religion; as an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt, denying the being of a God; as a Traitor, ſtriving to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject his country to foreign domination; and as an Anarchiſt, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſubvert all government and order.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and a number of other charges equally falſe and abſurd, have been echoed and re-echoed, till thoſe with whom they origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted have, by their own ingenuity, almoſt brought themſelves to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what at firſt they knew to be falſe. And numbers whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions were laudable, but whoſe means of information were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, deceived and miſled by theſe organs of envy, error, and perverſion, now actually conſider him as a man unworthy public confidence or private eſteem.</p>
            <p>Could merit or uſefulneſs procure an exemption from calumny, Jefferſon would have remained uncalumniated. For no man ever ſtrove with more ability and ſucceſs to ſubſerve the intereſts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and his country. Unfortunately, however, his virtue and talents have ſubjected him to the moſt unqualified abuſe and detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becauſe, while he retained the affections of the people he was an inſuperable barrier to the ſchemes of ambition, avarice, and aggrandizement, which had been planned by men amongſt us deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of patriotiſm, virtue and honor.</p>
            <p>Anxious to give to you the means of repelling and refuting theſe <hi>"false, scandalous, malicious,"</hi> and unfounded charges, which are made for no other purpoſe but to <hi>"bring unto contempt and disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute"</hi> the MAN OF THE PEOPLE, we have preſented you
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036921_0008_100B5E321FD0AB28"/>with an Epitome of his Life and Character, extracted from a pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, the author of which is unknown. The calm, dignified, and diſpaſſionate manner in which the writer of this Epitome has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf, beſpeak a heart uninfluenced by party, and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminated by the ſtile and language too prevalent in political wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the preſent day: while the preciſion and perſpicuity with which he has narrated facts, declare him to be accurately acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſubject of his addreſs. From both theſe cauſes he is eminently entitled to your confidence and belief.</p>
            <p>When the clouds of miſrepreſentation and falſhood with which the enemies of republicaniſm and liberty have enveloped the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Mr. Jefferſon, ſhall be diſpelled by the penetrating ways of reaſon and truth, you will ſee him as he is—<hi>The brightest lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of the western world.</hi>
