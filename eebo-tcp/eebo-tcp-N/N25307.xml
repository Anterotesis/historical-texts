            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>AS</hi> an unexpected and pleaſing circumſtance has recently taken place in the annals of the <hi>NEW JERUSALEM CHURCH,</hi> in this city, by the conviction and addition of a few members, amongst whom are the learned, the pious, and reverend. And as this ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar event has promoted a laudible ſpirit of inquiry amongst different ſects and denominations of chriſtians, who are earneſt inquirers after truth; ſo that more applications have been made to many members of that Church, here, for the loan of books on their peculiar doctrines, than they were able to grant.—It was judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a duty, at a meeting of the repreſentatives of ſaid Church, to cauſe a number of copies of the following pamphlet to be printed, that thoſe perſons who wiſh to ſee and read a brief but fair ſtatement of the leading doctrines which are taught in that Church might have an opportunity of being gratified.</p>
            <p>We have thought proper, however, to prefix to this little work a brief account of the honorable herald of this new diſpenſation, (as <hi>WE</hi> believe it to be) in a letter written by himſelf to, and at the ſpecial requeſt of a reverend and learned friend.</p>
            <p>A compendious view of the particular doctrines which are maintained through his voluminous writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, are next ſubmitted to conſideration: and thirdly, the moſt leading and principal of theſe doctrines are attempted to be defended. Should the public look with ſuitable approbation on this firſt little offering, we ſhall proceed by a ſecond and immediate attempt to purſue the ſubject, and ſtrew ſome ſcientific and pleaſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions amongst our more ſerious diſquiſitions, as a rich ſupply is now in the poſſeſſion of</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>IF it be an allowed maxim, (as, we believe, few will deny,) that <hi>an error in judgment will occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion an error in practice,</hi> then it is a duty incumbent on every perſon profeſſing the chriſtian name, to examine well thoſe principles which have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled into him from infancy, and ſee how far they are conſiſtent, or inconſiſtent, with the true ſenſe of the holy word, and the dictates of ſound reaſon.</p>
            <p>But when is this inveſtigation to commence? and what are the preliminary conditions of ſetting it on foot? We anſwer, Now is the time; <hi>now it is allowable</hi> for every man to exerciſe his rational faculties, and no longer ſuffer himſelf to be hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winked or enſlaved, either by the prejudice of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or the ſhackles of a blind faith. And we conceive no other preliminary is neceſſary, ſave this, That we admit we <hi>may</hi> heretofore have been educated in falſe principles, and are now reſolved to ſeek truth for the ſake of truth.</p>
            <p>As to the objection which ſome may make againſt the doctrines of the New Church, viz. <hi>that they are new,</hi> we have only to remark, that it is a matter of ſmall moment, whether a thing be <hi>new</hi> or <hi>old:</hi> the great queſtion with us is, Whether they be <hi>true</hi> or not? And we truſt, every reader will join with us in opinion, that a thing once diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:033549_0005_0FF78814314A1E48"/>
to be <hi>true in itſelf,</hi> ought never to be rejected merely on account of it's novelty. But what if theſe ſame doctrines of the New Church ſhall be proved to be the invariable language both of the Old and New Teſtament, when underſtood in their true and proper ſenſe? Will thoſe, who object to <hi>novelty,</hi> in this caſe ſubmit to the authority of <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity?</hi> If ſo, our endeavors ſhall not be wanting to confirm the truths of the New Jeruſalem, by a fair appeal to that teſtimony which every chriſtian is ſuppoſed to admit.</p>

                  <p>I TAKE pleaſure in the friendſhip you expreſs for me in your letter, and return you thanks for the ſame; but as to the praiſes therein, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them as belonging to the truths contained in my writings, and ſo refer them to the Lord our Saviour as his due, who is in himſelf the fountain of all truth. It is the concluding part of your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that chiefly engages my attention, where you ſay as follows: <q>As, after your departure from England, diſputes may ariſe on the ſubject of your writings, and ſo give occaſion to defend their author againſt ſuch falſe reports and aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as they who are no friends to truth may invent to the prejudice of his reputation, may it not be of uſe, in order to repel any calumnies of that kind, that you leave behind you ſome ſhort account of yourſelf, as concerning, for example, your degrees in the univerſity, the offices you have borne, your family, and connections, the honors which I am told have been conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and ſuch other particulars as may ſerve to the vindication of your character, if attacked, that ſo any ill-grounded prejudices may be obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated or removed; for where the honour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of truth are concerned, it certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves us to employ all lawful methods in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and ſupport.</q> After reflecting on the foregoing paſſage, I was induced to comply with
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:033549_0007_0FF78819A0AF33E8"/>
your friendly advice, by briefly communicating the following circumſtances of my life.</p>
                  <p>I was born at Stockholm in the year of our Lord 1689, January 29. My father's name was Jeſper Swedberg, who was Biſhop of Weſt-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia, and of a celebrated character in his time: He was alſo a member of the Society for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Goſpel, formed on the model of that in England, and appointed Preſident of the Swediſh Churches in Pennſylvania, and London, by Charles XII. In the year 1710, I began my travels, firſt into England, and afterwards into Holland, France, and Germany, and returned home in 1714. In the year 1716, and afterwards, I frequently converſed with Charles XII. King of Sweden, who was pleaſed to beſtow on me a large ſhare of his favour, and in that year appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to the office of Aſſeſſor in the Metallic College, in which office I continued from that time till the year 1747, when I quitted the office, but ſtill retain the ſalary annexed to it as an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment for life. The reaſon of my withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the buſineſs of that employment was, that I might be more at liberty to apply myſelf to that new function to which the Lord had called me. About this time a place of higher dignity in the ſtate was offered me, which I declined to accept, leſt it ſhould prove a ſnare to me. In 1719, I was ennobled by Queen Ulrica Eleonora, and named Swedenborg, from which time I have taken my ſeat with the Nobles of the Equeſtrian order, in the Triennial Aſſemblies of the States. I am a Fellow, by invitation, of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm, but have never deſired to be of any other community, as I belong to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:033549_0008_0FF7881B63B167C8"/>
of Angels, in which things ſpiritual and heavenly are the only ſubjects of diſcourſe and entertainment; whereas in our literary ſocieties, the attention is wholly taken up with things relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the body and this world. In the year 1734, I publiſhed the <hi>Regnum Minerale,</hi> at Lepſie, in Three Volumes, Folio; and in 1738, I took a journey into Italy, and ſtaid a year at Venice and Rome.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to my family connections: I had four ſiſters; one of them was married to Eric Benzelius, afterwards made Archbiſhop of Upſal; and thus I became related to the two ſucceeding Archbiſhops of that ſee, both named Benzelius, and younger brothers of the former. Another of my ſiſters was married to Lars Benzelſtierna, who was promoted to a provincial government; but theſe are both dead: however, two biſhops who are related to me, are ſtill living; one of them is named Filenius, Biſhop of Oſtrogothia, who now officiates as Preſident of the Eccleſiaſtical or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the General Aſſembly at Stockholm, in the room of the Archbiſhop who is infirm: he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the daughter of my ſiſter: the other, who is called Benzelſtierna, Biſhop of Weſtmannia and Dalecarnia, is the ſon of my ſecond ſiſter; not to mention others of my family who are dignified. I converſe freely, and am in friendſhip with all the Biſhops of my country, who are ten in number, and alſo with the ſixteen Senators, and the reſt of the grandees, who love and honor me, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I am in fellowſhip with Angels. The King and Queen themſelves, as alſo the three Princes their ſons, ſhew me all kind countenance, and I was once invited to eat with the King and
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:033549_0009_0FF7881F35AC0D20"/>
Queen at their table, (an honor granted only to the Peers of the realm,) and likewiſe ſince that with the Hereditary Prince.<note n="†" place="bottom">The preſent King of Sweden.</note> All in my own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try wiſh for my return home, ſo far am I from the leaſt danger of perſecution there, as you ſeem to apprehend, and are alſo ſo kindly ſolicitous to provide againſt; and ſhould any thing of that kind befal me elſewhere, it will give me no concern.</p>
                  <p>Whatever of worldly honor and advantage may appear to be in the things before-mentioned, I hold them but as matters of low eſtimation, when compared to the honor of that holy office to which the Lord himſelf hath called me, who was graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf to me his unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſervant, in a perſonal appearance, in the year 1743, to open me a ſight of the Spiritual World, and to enable me to converſe with Spirits and Angels, and this privilege hath continued with me to this day.

            <p>It is eaſy to ſee what different judgments will be formed by different perſons concerning the above letter, particularly that part of it, where he opens his ſpiritual commiſſion, and declares himſelf the Apoſtle of a new Diſpenſation. The atheiſt and infidel will regard the things contained in it as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, and will inſtantly reject it under that idea: the wit and the minute philoſopher will ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule it as extravagant, and pronounce it the mere effect of a warm and deluded imagination: even the ſerious and well-diſpoſed chriſtian will have his doubts concerning it's reality, and will ſuſpect the fact, though he will not diſpute it's poſſibility. Supernatural events, in all ages of the world, have thus divided the ſentiments of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, nor is it to be expected that in our own age we ſhall be better agreed touching the truth of a relation ſo marvellous and miraculous, ſupported only by the teſtimony of a ſingle witneſs. Caution likewiſe, on ſuch occaſions has always been deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed expedient by the truly good and enlightened, leſt giving too haſty an aſſent to things extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, they ſhould encourage impoſture, and put it in the power of weak or ill-diſpoſed perſons to eſtabliſh an authority over the minds of others, grounded only in the infirmities or depravities of their own.</p>
            <p>But as an indiſcriminate reception of every ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:033549_0011_0FF78824D023D600"/>
relation is dangerous, ſo an indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate rejection is no leſs ſo, and is therefore equally to be avoided by all wiſe men. Candour to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and judgment to diſtinguiſh between truth and error, between realities and appearances, have for this reaſon at all times been accounted eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble virtues; whereby the upright and ſincere might be preſerved from the miſchiefs attending a blind credulity on the one ſide, and a perverſe incredulity on the other.</p>
            <p>We beg leave therefore to ſuggeſt, with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the ſentiments of others, that it is the duty of every candid chriſtian ſo examine well the credibility of the above teſtimony, and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality and without prejudice, inaſmuch as the general intereſts of truth, which ought to be dear to every one, may be greatly affected by ſuch an examination. And as the tenor of Baron Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denborg's life, dated from the above event, to his death, together with his writings and the doctrines therein contained, muſt needs have great and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved weight in the determination of an impartial judgment; it appears, farther, to be the duty of every ſincere inquirer after the truth, not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce any ſentence, till he has faithfully and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently weighed the ſeveral circumſtances reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the latter period of our author's life, as well as the nature and tendency of the books written by him during that period.</p>
            <p>It is well known that Baron Swedenborg, after the above extraordinary call to be an inſtructor of mankind, dedicated himſelf entirely to the great work which was aſſigned him. The future part of his life was ſpent, agreeably to the high commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had received, in ſtudying diligently the
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:033549_0012_0FF7882685C376C0"/>
Word of God, in opening and elucidating the great truths therein contained, and in publiſhing them to his fellow-creatures, together with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant information made known to him concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another world. For this purpoſe he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left his native country to viſit diſtant cities, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly London and Amſterdam, where all his Theological works were printed by him at a great expence, and with little proſpect or probability of a reimburſement. Wherever he reſided on his travels, (according to the teſtimony of a late writer, who was perſonally acquainted with him) he was a mere ſolitary, and almoſt inacceſſible, through in his own country of a free and open behaviour. He affected no honor, but declined it; purſued no worldly intereſt, but ſpent his time in travelling and printing, in order to communicate inſtruction and benefit to mankind. He had nothing of the preciſian in his manner, nothing of melancholy in his temper, and nothing in the leaſt bordering on enthuſiaſm in his converſation or writings. To this may be added, that he affected no ſingularities, neither was he elated by reaſon of his extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gifts, ſo as to aim at any preheminence in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, or to ſet himſelf up as the head of a party. Far from the ſpirit of a ſectarian, he loved good men wherever he found them, and approved the truth by whomſoever it was taught; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he was bold and free to cenſure vice under all it's forms, and amongſt all its adherents; and to point out errors, howſoever reſpectable the names which gave them authority. In ſhort, his whole life, from the date of the above memorable event, appears to have been that of a man called to emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and extraordinary ſervices; being orderly,
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:033549_0013_0FF78829472C9FC8"/>
prudent, pure, humble, and beneficent, ſuitable to the heavenly intercourſe to which he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>He died at London, in the year 1772; and, after lying in ſtate, was interred at the Swediſh Church, near Ratcliff-Highway.</p>

            <head>A Compendious <hi>VIEW</hi> of the principal <hi>DOCTRINES</hi> of the <hi>NEW CHURCH,</hi> otherwiſe called the <hi>NEW JERUSALEM.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT being the avowed purpoſe of this Publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to furniſh the reader with an abſtract of a new, but rational ſyſtem of divinity, it becomes us to ſtate, in a fair and candid manner, thoſe principles which we conceive to be founded in truth, and which, we truſt, will meet the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of every intelligent and impartial reader.</p>
            <p>The New Church is ſo called, becauſe it is that ſignified by the New Jeruſalem in the Revelation of John.</p>
            <p>Emanuel Swedenborg, the founder of this New Church, whoſe tenets are peculiarly diſtinct from every other ſyſtem of divinity in Chriſtendom, draws all his doctrines from the holy ſcriptures, which appear at the ſame time to be grounded in true philoſophy. The author points out an intire new and ſingular way of reconciling the apparent contradictions in ſcripture, by having recourſe to two kinds of truth, which he diſtinguiſhes into ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine and apparent. He maintains, that the holy ſcripture, as well as every thing in nature, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvable into one or the other of theſe two kinds
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:033549_0014_0FF7882CCA2D7030"/>
of truth. Thus when it is ſaid, that the ſun riſes or ſets, this is only an apparent truth, as the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine truth is, that the earth revolves round its own axis, and cauſes that appearance: yet there is no impropriety in ſpeaking according to appearances; nay, it would be a manifeſt abſurdity, in the above inſtance, to ſpeak in common converſation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the genuine truth. Juſt ſo it is with the ſcriptures, which are written in a ſtyle adapted to the comprehenſion of the ſimple, and in many parts are not genuine, but apparent truths. Thus when it is ſaid, that God is angry and revengeful, that he puniſhes and caſts into hell, we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that it is man who is angry with God, and that it is man who brings puniſhment upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and caſts himſelf into hell. So in numberleſs other paſſages to the ſame purpoſe; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the New Teſtament, where the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, are mentioned apparently as three diſtinct perſons, (which by many is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into the idea of three Gods,) whereas the genuine truth is, that there is only one God in one perſon.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and a variety of other points, equally new and intereſting, are treated very copiouſly by the author in his theological works. But as they are voluminous, and many of our readers may not have had an opportunity of conſulting them, we ſhall here ſtate the principal doctrines of the New Church, which have been collected with great care from the whole of his writings, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the following ſummary.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Contrary to Unitarians, who deny, and to Trinitarians, who hold a Trinity of Perſons in the Godhead, they maintain that there is a Divine Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:033549_0015_0FF7882E67C3B3E8"/>
in the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, conſiſting of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, juſt like the human Trinity in every individual man, of ſoul, body, and operation; and that as the latter Trinity conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes one man, ſo the former Trinity conſtitutes one Jehovah God, who is at once the Creator, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and Regenerator.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Jehovah God himſelf came down from Heaven, and aſſumed human nature for the purpoſe of removing hell from man, of reſtoring the heavens to order, and of preparing the way for a new church upon earth; and that herein conſiſts the true nature of redemption, which was effected ſolely by the omnipotence of the Lord's divine hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They hold the notion of pardon obtained by a vicarious ſacrifice or atonement, as a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and fatal error; but that repentance is the foundation of the church in man, that it conſiſts in a man's abſtaining from all evils, becauſe they are ſins againſt God, &amp;c. that it is productive of regeneration, which is not an inſtantaneous, but a gradual work, effected by the Lord alone, through charity and faith, during man's co-operation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That man has free will in ſpiritual things, whereby he may join himſelf by reciprocration with the Lord.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the imputation of the merits and righteouſneſs of Chriſt is a thing as abſurd and impoſſible, as it would be to impute to any man the work of creation; for the merits and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt conſiſt in redemption, which is as much the work of a divine and omnipotent Being, as creation itſelf. They maintain, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that the imputation, which really takes place,
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:033549_0016_0FF78830116863F0"/>
is an imputation of good and evil; and that this is according to a man's life.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That the doctrine of predeſtination and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification by faith alone, is contrary to the true ſenſe of holy Scripture, which every where points out the neceſſity of conjoining a good life with a living faith in the Lord.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That the two ſacraments of baptiſm and the holy ſupper are eſſential inſtitutions in the New Church, the genuine and rational uſes of which are now diſcovered, together with the ſpiritual ſenſe of the Holy Word.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That the Holy Word of ſacred Scripture contains a threefold ſenſe, namely, celeſtial, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and natural, which are united by correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies; and that in each ſenſe it is divine truth, accommodated reſpectively to the angels of the three heavens, and alſo to men on earth.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That the books of the Word are all thoſe which have the internal ſenſe, and are as follows; the five books of Moſes, (Geneſis, Exodus, Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy,) the books of Joſhua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, the Pſalms, and all the Prophets; alſo, the four Evangeliſts, and the Revelation: and that the other books, not having the internal ſenſe, are not emphatically the Word.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That in the ſpiritual world there is a ſun diſtinct from that of the natural world, the eſſence of which is pure love from Jehovah God, who is in the midſt thereof; that the heat alſo proceeding from that ſun is in it's eſſence love, and the light thence proceeding is in it's eſſence wiſdom; and that by the inſtrumentality of that ſun all things were created, and continue to ſubſiſt, both in the ſpiritual and in the natural world.</p>
            <p n="11">
               <pb n="xviii" facs="unknown:033549_0017_0FF78831C1271AE0"/>11. They maintain, that there is not in the univerſal heaven a ſingle angel that was created ſuch at firſt, nor a ſingle devil in all hell, that had been created an angel of light, and was afterwards caſt out of heaven; but that all both in heaven and hell are of the human race, in heaven ſuch as had lived in the world in heavenly love and faith, and in hell ſuch as had lived in helliſh love and faith.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That the material body never riſes again; but that man, immediately on his departure from this life, riſes again as to his ſpiritual or ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al body, (which was incloſed in his material body, and formed from his predominant love, whether it be good or evil, wherein he continues to live as a man, in a perfect human form, in all reſpects as before, ſave only the groſs material body, which he puts off by death, and which is of no further uſe.</p>
            <p n="13">13. That the ſtate and condition of man after death is according to his paſt life in this world; and that the predominant love, which he takes with him into the ſpiritual world, continues with him for ever, and can never be changed to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; conſequently if it be good, he abides in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to all eternity; but if evil, he abides in hell to all eternity.</p>
            <p n="14">14. That true conjugal love, which can only ſubſiſt between one huſband and one wife, is a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary characteriſtic of the New Church, being grounded in the marriage of goodneſs and truth, and correſponding with the marriage of the Lord and his Church; and therefore it is more celeſtial, ſpiritual, holy, pure, and clean, than any other love in angels or men.</p>
            <p n="15">
               <pb facs="unknown:033549_0018_0FF78835C30D24A8"/>15. That the ſcience of correſpondences which have been loſt for ſome thouſands of years, but is now revived in the theological works to the Hon. Emanuel Swedenborg,) is the only key of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual or internal ſenſe of the holy word, every page of which is written by correſpondences, that is, by ſuch things in the natural world as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond unto and ſignify things in the ſpiritual world.</p>
            <p n="16">16. That all thoſe paſſages in ſcripture, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuppoſed to ſignify the deſtruction of the world by fire, &amp;c. commonly called the laſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, muſt be underſtood according to the above ſcience, which teaches, that by the end of the world, or conſummation of the age, is not ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the deſtruction or end of the world, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction or end of the preſent Chriſtian church, both among Roman Catholics and Proteſtants of every deſcription; and that this laſt judgment actually took place in the ſpiritual world in the year 1757.</p>
            <p n="17">17. That the ſecond advent of the Lord, which is a coming, not in perſon, but in the ſpiritual or internal ſenſe of his holy Word, has already com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced; that it is effected by means of his ſervant Emanuel Swedenborg, before whom he hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted himſelf in perſon, and whom he hath fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his ſpirit, to teach the doctrines of the new church by the word from him; and that this is what is meant in the Revelation by the new hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and new earth, and the New Jeruſalem thence deſcending.</p>
            <p>Such are the general outlines of the doctrines of the New Jeruſalem Church, which we have taken
<pb n="xx" facs="unknown:033549_0019_0FF788383767C6E0"/>
ſome pains to collect, and on the merits of which we ſhall leave to the judgment of our readers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide. We ſhall, however, occaſionally take one or another of the above ſubjects, and place them in ſuch a light, as we truſt will leave little or no room for doubts concerning their truth and importance.</p>

         <div type="doctrine">
            <head>The <hi>DOCTRINE</hi> of the <hi>TRINITY</hi> clearly ſtated and explained.</head>
            <p>IT has long been a mortifying reflection, that the doctrines of the Chriſtian religion, as they are too generally inculcated, cannot be ſupported by a fair and candid appeal to ſound rationality, and to the common ſenſe of mankind, but that in many inſtances the moſt orthodox theologians are compelled to ſubmit their underſtandings to a blind faith, and acquieſce in doctrines that are not only above the comprehenſion of man, but plainly and abſolutely contradictory to ſound reaſon. Where is the divine, for inſtance, who can look the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received doctrine of the Trinity in the face, without (tacitly at leaſt) acknowledging it's abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, although he may perhaps have bound himſelf down to profeſs it as the leading article of his faith? If a Pagan, or Mahometan, gravely repeats the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of his belief, we ſmile at his credulity, and wonder how a rational being can receive, as the ground work of his religion, ſuch incredible tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. Yet Chriſtians in their turn equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſubjects of ridicule among Mahometans and Pagans, for their ſtrange and unaccountable acknowledgment of <hi>Three Divine Perſons</hi> in the
<pb n="xxi" facs="unknown:033549_0020_0FF78839D42BFC78"/>
Godhead; which is ſo plain and palpable a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the exiſtence of <hi>Three Gods,</hi> that no ſubtlety of reaſoning can poſſibly elude the charge.</p>
            <p>This, however, is not the fault of Chriſtianity, but of it's profeſſors, who have unfortunately miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken it's moſt eſſential characters, and repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as a religion that prohibits man the free uſe of his underſtanding: and in no article is this more conſpicuous than in that of the Trinity. But that true Chriſtianity is perfectly conſiſtent with ſound reaſon, that the underſtanding of man ought freely to be exerciſed in all matters of faith whatever, and that the Word of God requires no one blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to believe what he cannot in ſome meaſure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, ſhall, we truſt, be fully demonſtrated in the courſe of this work. At preſent we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine ourſelves to that great article of the Chriſtian faith, viz. the <hi>Divine Trinity,</hi> and ſhew that it is ſo far from being an inexplicable, incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble myſtery, that it is perhaps the plaineſt, ſimpleſt, and moſt intelligible doctrine in the whole ſyſtem of theology. But this we cannot do better than in the words of Baron Swedenborg, who in his admirable work, entitled <hi>True Chriſtian Religion,</hi> treats the ſubject in the following manner:</p>
            <div type="explanation">
               <head>
                  <hi>EXPLANATION</hi> of the <hi>TRINITY.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THERE are general, and alſo particular eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of every one thing, which altogether conſtitute one eſſence. The general eſſentials of every one man are, his ſoul, body, and operation; and that theſe conſtitute one eſſence, is evident from this circumſtance, that one exiſteth by derivation from the other, and for the ſake of the other, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="xxii" facs="unknown:033549_0021_0FF7883B9BF4B148"/>
ſeries; for man hath his beginning from the ſoul, which is the very eſſence of the ſeed, and which is not only the initiating, but alſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing cauſe of all the parts of the body in their reſpective order, and afterwards of all acts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the ſoul and body united, which are called operations; wherefore, from this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the production of one from another, and their conſequent inſertion and conjunction one with another, it is evident, that theſe three are of one eſſence, and therefore they are called three eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials.</p>
               <p>That theſe three eſſentials, viz. ſoul, body and operation, did, and do exiſt in the Lord God the Saviour, is univerſally acknowledged. That his ſoul was from Jehovah the Father, can only be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by Antichriſt, for in the Word of both the Old and New Teſtament he is called the Son of Jehovah, the Son of the Moſt High God, the On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-begotten; wherefore the divinity of the Father, anſwering to the ſoul in man, is his firſt eſſential. That the Son, who was born of the mother Mary, is the body of that divine ſoul, is a conſequence of that birth, inaſmuch as nothing is provided in the womb of the mother except a body, conceived in her, and derived from the ſoul; this, therefore, is a ſecond eſſential. That operation conſtitue a third eſſential, is a conſequence of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſoul and body together; for the things that proceed are of the ſame eſſence with the things from whence they proceed. That the three eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, which are Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, are One in the Lord, like ſoul, body, and operation in man, is evident from the words of the Lord, declaring that He and the Father are One, and
<pb n="xxiii" facs="unknown:033549_0022_0FF788407AB69BF0"/>
that the Father is in Him, and He in the Father; and that in like manner He and the Holy Ghoſt are One, inaſmuch as the Holy Ghoſt is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine proceeding out of the Lord from the Father.</p>
               <p>When it is ſaid that Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt are three eſſentials of one God, it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to human reaſon as if thoſe three eſſentials were three diſtinct perſons, which yet cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be true; but when it is underſtood that the divinity of the Father, which conſtituteth the ſoul, and the divinity of the Son, which conſtituteth the Body, and the divinity of the Holy Ghoſt, or the divine-proceeding, which conſtituteth Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are three eſſentials of one God, this the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding can apprehend. For there is a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar divinity of nature in God the Father, in the Son derived from the Father, and in the Holy Ghoſt proceeding from both, which being of the ſame eſſence, and the ſame mind, conſtitute toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one God. But if thoſe three divine natures are called perſons, and have each of them their particular attributes allotted them, as when impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is aſcribed to the Father, mediation to the Son, and operation to the Holy Ghoſt, in this caſe the Divine Eſſence is divided, which yet is One and Individual, and thus none of the Three is God in perfect fullneſs, but each in ſubtriplicate power, which is a conceit that every ſober and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible man muſt of neceſſity reject.</p>
               <p>How plain therefore is it to diſcern a Trinity in the Lord by a Trinity diſcernible in every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual man! For in every individual man there is a ſoul, a body, and operation; and ſo it is alſo with reſpect to the Lord, inaſmuch as in Him, as Paul ſaith, <hi>"dwelleth all the fullneſs of the Godhead bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,"</hi>
                  <pb n="xxiv" facs="unknown:033549_0023_0FF788421659DCE0"/>
Coloſſ. ii. 9. Wherefore the Trinity in the Lord is divine, but in man it is human.</p>
               <p>It is a fundamental doctrine of the preſent Chriſtian Church, on which depends every other in the whole ſyſtem of modern theology, that there is a Trinity of Three Divine Perſons exiſting from eternity; but how plain is it to ſee, that in this myſtery, repreſenting Three Divine Perſons, and yet but One God, and this One God not as One Perſon, reaſon hath nothing to do, but is lulled to ſleep, ſtill compelling the mouth to ſpeak like a parrot without meaning! and when reaſon is laid aſleep, what are the words of the mouth but life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and inanimate things? Or when the mouth ſpeaketh what the reaſon contradicteth, what are ſuch words but the offspring of folly and infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>That a Trinity of Divine Perſons exiſting from eternity, is a Trinity of Gods, appears evidently from theſe paſſages in the Athanaſian Creed,— <hi>"There is one Perſon of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Ghoſt; the Father is God and Lord, the Son is God and Lord, and the Holy Ghoſt is God and Lord; nevertheleſs, there are not three Gods, or three Lords, but one God, and one Lord; for as we are compelled by the Chriſtian Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to</hi> ACKNOWLEDGE <hi>every Perſon</hi> BY HIMSELF <hi>to be God and Lord, ſo are we forbidden by the Catholic Religion to</hi> SAY <hi>there be three Gods or three Lords"</hi> This creed is received by the whole chriſtian church, and from it is derived all that at this day is known and acknowledged concerning God. Every one who readeth this creed with his eyes open may perceive, that a Trinity of Gods was the only Trinity thought of by thoſe who compoſed
<pb n="xxv" facs="unknown:033549_0024_0FF78843C29EAF50"/>
the Council of Nice, whence this creed, as a poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humous birth, was introduced into the church. That a Trinity of Gods was not only thought of by the members of the Nicene Council, but that the ſame Trinity is ſtill received throughout all Chriſtendom, is a neceſſary conſequence of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that creed the ſtandard of knowledge reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, to which every one pays an implicit obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. From the words of this generally receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed doctrine concerning God, it is as clear and tranſparent to the ſight, as water in a cup of cryſtal, that there are three Perſons, each whereof is Lord and God; and alſo, that according to Chriſtian Verity, men ought to confeſs, or acknowledge, each Perſon ſingly to be God and Lord, but that Religion, or the Catholic or Chriſtian Faith for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids to ſay, and make mention of three Gods and three Lords; and thus that verity and religion, or truth and faith, are not one and the ſame thing, but two different things in a ſtate of contrariety to each other. It is aſſerted indeed, that there are not three Gods, and three Lords, but one God, and one Lord; but this aſſertion was plainly add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obviate the cenſures of mankind, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their being expoſed to the deriſion of the whole world; for who can forbear deriſion on hearing of three Gods? And who doth not ſee a manifeſt contradiction in this palliating aſſertion, that although there are three Lords and three Gods, yet they are not three but one? Whereas had they ſaid, that Divine Eſſence belongeth to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghoſt, and yet there are not three Divine Eſſences, but only one individual Eſſence, the myſtery in this caſe would have been eaſily explained, whilſt by
<pb n="xxvi" facs="unknown:033549_0025_0FF78847A9814A38"/>
the Father men had underſtood the all-begetting Divinity, by the Son the Divine Humanity thence originating, and by the Holy Ghoſt the Divine Proceeding, which three are conſtituent of one God; or if the divinity of the Father had been conſidered as the ſoul of man, the Divine Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as the body of that ſoul, and the Holy Ghoſt as the operation proceeding from both; in this caſe three eſſentials are underſtood as belonging to one and the ſame Perſon, and therefore as conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting together one ſingle individual Eſſence.</p>

            <head>On the <hi>DOCTRINE</hi> of the <hi>ATONEMENT.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE popular opinion reſpecting this doctrine is, "That the ſacrifice and atonement made unto God for the ſins of mankind, by Jeſus Chriſt, is the moſt eſſential doctrine of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion."</p>
            <p>This the members of the New Jeruſalem Church flatly and poſitively deny, and that for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſons:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the doctrine of Chriſt's atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment neceſſarily implies a plurality of perſons in the Godhead, which has already been proved to be an irrational, blind, and abſurd fiction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe it further implies, that Jeſus Chriſt is not the <hi>only</hi> God, but that there is a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtinct from, and ſuperior to him, who breathes out vengeance againſt the whole human race, and cannot be reconciled to them without the unmerited ſufferings and cruel death of an innocent perſon, even of his own Son. This we
<pb n="xxvii" facs="unknown:033549_0026_0FF7884A71EB2108"/>
will be bold to ſay is repreſenting the God of mercy and compaſſion as worſe than Moloch himſelf, who was content with the ſacrifice which his devotees made of their children, without having recource to the offspring of his own loins to gratify his inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate luſt of blood. Yet (horrid thought!) ſuch is the God that modern Chriſtians worſhip, and ſuch the grand principle of their falſe theology.</p>
            <p>A <hi>third</hi> reaſon why we deny, that faith in the ſacrifice and atonement of Chriſt is the great prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the Chriſtian religion, is, becauſe it is no where aſſerted to be ſo in the Word of God; but on the contrary, it is the plain doctrine of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that chriſtianity is founded on an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of one God, on faith in Jeſus Chriſt as that one God, and on repentance or a life accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his commandments. Theſe are the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental conſtituents of the chriſtian religion, into which the idea of vicarious ſacrifice and atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as generally underſtood, cannot poſſibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and with which it cannot by any means be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. For if it be once admitted, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption conſiſts merely in the ſacrifice and atonement of Chriſt, as a mean whereby the wrath of the Father was appeaſed; and if, in order to be juſtified and ſaved, man needs only to have faith in the merits and righteouſneſs of the Son of God; how natural is it to conclude, that actual repentance is a vain, unneceſſary, if not a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous work; ſeeing that redemption is already fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed by the paſſion of the croſs, and man's ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion already accompliſhed, without the neceſſity of his co-operation! The danger that naturally ariſes from ſuch a doctrine as this, is too evident to need pointing out to any perſon of ſober reflection; for
<pb n="xxviii" facs="unknown:033549_0027_0FF7884C2F0C24C8"/>
thus all the precepts in the Word, relating to love and charity, to newneſs of life, repentance, and regeneration, would be of no more real uſe to man than ſo many pages of blank paper.</p>
            <p>"But," our objector will ſay, <q>what then is meant by the ſufferings and death of Jeſus Chriſt? If they were not to ſatisfy the vindic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive juſtice of the Father, by bearing in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the puniſhment due to our offences: what was their end and deſign?</q> To this we anſwer, His ſufferings and death were the neceſſary means of effecting the work of redemption, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, not in any atonement for the offences of others, for it is neither agreeable to the laws of God or man that the innocent ſhould ſuffer for the crimes of the guilty: nor in the appeaſing of any wrath which God the Father entertained againſt the human race, for no ſuch wrath ever exiſted: but in a real ſubjection of the powers of darkneſs, thoſe evils ſpirits of hell which began to predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate over the whole univerſe. Wherefore it became abſolutely neceſſary, in order to preſerve all things in their ſtate of purity and happineſs, and to deliver the church on earth from the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of hell, for Jehovah God himſelf to come down among men, to clothe himſelf with human nature, and in his own divine perſon work out re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. This he effected by permitting the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, which he received from the Virgin Mary, to be aſſaulted with temptations from evil ſpirits, in which he fought againſt them, and by his own power conquered and put them to flight. Every external ſuffering in his body correſponded with ſome internal temptation from hell, and was in fact a conſequence thereof; for all the ſtripes, buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
<pb n="xxix" facs="unknown:033549_0028_0FF77BF0DE9204F0"/>
and contempt he endured, and which were inflicted upon him by the Jews, did not ſolely ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginate with them, but they treated him in that manner in conſequence of being inſtigated thereto by evil ſpirits, with whom they were in ſpirit aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated. Hence we find him ſometimes rebuking the devils, and ſometimes their aſſociates the Jews.</p>
            <p>But the manner of fighting in ſpirit, is different from the mode practiſed by men in the natural world. When our Lord was buffetted, he did not return a <hi>ſimilar</hi> aſſault, and in <hi>that manner</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer; but he with patience ſubmitted, either holding his peace, or ſimply ſaying, "Why ſmiteſt thou me?" Yet even this ſubmiſſion in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal correſponded to a complete victory in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal; and while a ſingle Jew apparently trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed in the fleſh, in the ſpirit a whole legion of devils was put to flight. So at the time of his crucifixion, inſtead of delivering himſelf by the weapons of this world, or miraculouſly coming down from the croſs, he only ſays, "Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, for they know not what they do." Yet even then his patient ſubmiſſion to the death of the croſs, correſponded to his complete victory over all the powers of darkneſs; and (what is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to contemplate, but incredible to the merely natural man!) the moment in which the Jewiſh nation vainly triumphed in the death of our Lord's <hi>material</hi> body, that very moment he glorified his Humanity, vanquiſhed all the hoſts of hell, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted his triumph over every ſpiritual enemy, and reſtored to the church on earth, as well as to the univerſal world of ſpirits, that liberty of which they had heretofore been deprived.</p>

               <pb n="xxx" facs="unknown:033549_0029_0FF788519D04CD70"/>Such then was the end and deſign of all our Lord's ſufferings and death, and ſuch the nature of redemption, which was effected by Jehovah him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whoſe eſſential Divinity is called the Father, whoſe Humanity is called the Son, and whoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful operation is the Holy Spirit.</p>

            <head>On the word <hi>ADVOCATE.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>JESUS CHRIST is ſaid to be an <hi>advocate</hi> with the Father for the whole human race, becauſe divine truth ſignified by the Son, which proceeds from divine good ſignified by the Father, is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly medium of ſalvation, and, as it were, <hi>pleades, intercedes,</hi> and <hi>mediates</hi> for man. Mediation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, and <hi>advocateſhip,</hi> are predicated of the Divine Humanity of the Lord, becauſe the Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is the <hi>medium</hi> of conjunction with the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, juſt as the body of a man is the <hi>medium</hi> whereby his ſoul may be approached.</p>
            <p>They who believe that the divine eſſence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of three perſons, which all together make up one God, form to themſelves, while reading the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral ſenſe of the Word, no other idea of mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and interceſſion, than as if the Lord ſat at the right hand of his Father, and converſed with him as one man converſes with another; and as if he made ſupplication to the Father on behalf of men, and thus became their <hi>advocate,</hi> pleading his own merits in ſuffering the death of the croſs, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he would on theſe conſiderations have mercy upon them, and pardon them. Such is the idea which every ſimple perſon firſt forms to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="xxxi" facs="unknown:033549_0030_0FF788548083D218"/>
from the literal ſenſe of the Word, concerning the Lord's interceſſion and mediation. But it is to be obſerved, that the literal ſenſe of the Word is accommodated to the comprehenſion of the ſimple, in order thereby gradually to introduce them into genuine interior truths; for the ſimple have no other idea of the heavenly kingdom, than as of an earthly kingdom; nor of the Father, than as of an earthly king; nor of the Lord, than as of the king's ſon, who is heir to the crown and kingdom. That ſuch is the idea of the ſimple, is very evident from the notions which the apoſtles themſelves entertained of the Lord's kingdom; for they at firſt ſuppoſed, like the reſt of the Jews, that the Lord, as being the Meſſiah, would be the greateſt king upon earth, and that he would exalt them above all the nations and kingdoms of the whole world. But when they heard from the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that his kingdom was not of this world, but in heaven, then they could not but imagine, that his kingdom in heaven was like an earthly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; wherefore two of his diſciples, James and John, requeſted as a favor, that they might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſit, the one at his right hand, and the other at his left. On which occaſion the reſt of the diſciples, who were alſo deſirous of being great in that kingdom, began to be diſpleaſed with their two brethren, and they contended among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves which ſhould be the greateſt. Now as this idea of worldly glory was rooted in their minds, and could not be ſuddenly extirpated, therefore the Lord anſwered them according to their ſtates, and told them that they ſhould ſit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael; but they knew not what the Lord meant by twelve
<pb n="xxxii" facs="unknown:033549_0031_0FF788561A269C50"/>
thrones, nor what by the twelve tribes of Iſrael. See Mark x. 37, 41. Luke xxii. 24, 30. Matt. xix. 28. From all which it is eaſy to ſee what idea the diſciples entertained of the Lord's mediation and interceſſion with the Father, and whence they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it. But the man whoſe ſpiritual eyes are opened to diſcern the interior things of the Word, has a very different view of the Lord's mediation and interceſſion, conſidering it not like that of a Son with his Father the king, but like the Lord of the univerſe <hi>accommodating himſelf</hi> to the wants and neceſſities of his ſinful creatures; for He and the Father are not two but one, as he himſelf teaches in John xiv. 8 to 11. The reaſon why he is called a Mediator, Interceſſor, and <hi>Advocate,</hi> is, becauſe by the Son is meant Divine Truth, and by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Divine Good; and Mediation is effected by Divine Truth, as thereby acceſs is obtained to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Good; for Divine Good cannot be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately approached, being in it's nature like the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe fire of the ſun: Divine truth, however, may be approached, this being like the light proceeding from the ſun, which is the medium of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation between it and man. This then is the true meaning of mediation and interceſſion.</p>
            <p>But as this is a ſubject of the greateſt importance to be clearly underſtood, we ſhall take this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of explaining more fully why the Lord, who is eſſential Divine Good, and the real ſun of heaven, is called a Mediator, Interceſſor, and <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate</hi> with the Father. When the Lord was in the world, previous to his complete glorification, he was Divine Truth; wherefore he was then a Mediator, and interceded with the Father, that is, with the eſſential Divine Good; John xiv. 16, 17.
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="unknown:033549_0032_0FF788580043C790"/>
Chap. xvii. 9, 15, 17. But after his Humanity was fully glorified, then he is called a Mediator and Interceſſor on this account, namely, becauſe no one can form an idea of the eſſential Divinity, except under the form of a Divine Man; much leſs can any one be conjoined to the Divinity, except by ſuch an idea. Whoever thinks of the Divinity without having the idea of a Divine Man, thinks indeterminately; and an indeterminate idea, or an idea that has no object or form whereon to fall and be terminated, cannot with propriety be called an idea; it is a mere vague notion, that ultimately falls into nature, and becomes like nothing, and conſequently has no power of effecting conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Divinity either by faith or love: for all conjunction neceſſarily requires an object wherewith to be conjoined; and according to the nature and quality of the object, ſuch is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction. Hence it is that the Lord, as to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity Humanity, is called a Mediator, Interceſſor, and <hi>Advocate;</hi> but then it is to be underſtood, that he mediates, intercedes, and as it were pleads with himſelf for mankind, and not with any Father diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from himſelf: for he and the Father are one perſon, like the ſoul and body in Man.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Mediation</hi> ſignifies, that the Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the medium by which man may come to God the Father, and God the Father to man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be his teacher and guide unto ſalvation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son of God, by whom is meant the Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of God the Father, is called Saviour, and on earth Jeſus, that is, Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Interceſſion</hi> ſignifies perpetual mediation; for true love, whence mercy, clemency, and grace proceed, perpetually intercedeth, that is, mediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="unknown:033549_0033_0FF78982050A6BA8"/>
for thoſe who do his commandments, and who are thereby the objects of his love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Expiation</hi> ſignifies the removal of ſins, into which man would ruſh headlong, if he approached the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Jehovah uncloathed with the Humanity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propitiation</hi> ſignifies the operation of clemency and grace, to prevent man from falling into dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by ſin, and at the ſame time to be a ſecurity againſt the prophanation of holineſs, which was ſignified by the propitiatory, or mercy-ſeat, over the ark in the tabernacle.</p>
            <p>It is generally acknowledged, that God ſpake in his Word according to appearances, as when it is ſaid that he is angry, that he avengeth, that he tempteth, that he puniſheth, that he caſteth into hell, that he condemneth, yea, that he doth evil; when the truth is, that God is never angry with any one, that he never avengeth, tempteth, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, caſteth into hell, or condemneth; ſuch things are as far from God as hell is from heaven, and infinitely farther: wherefore they are exppreſſions uſed only to ſignify appearances: and ſo alſo are the terms <hi>expiation, propitiation, interceſſion,</hi> and <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation</hi> uſed, but yet in a different ſenſe, to expreſs the ways of approaching unto God, and of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace from God, by means of his Humanity: which terms being miſunderſtood, men have divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God into three, and upon that diviſion have grounded all the doctrines of the church, and thereby have falſified the Word: hence cometh <hi>the abomination of deſolation,</hi> foretold by the Lord in Daniel, and again in Matthew, chapter xxiv.</p>

               <l>No empty dream, or ſtill more empty ſhade;</l>
               <l>Remains the ſubſtance, but the form decay'd:</l>
               <l>Sees what he ſaw, knows what before was known,</l>
               <l>The ſame ideas, but more perfect grown.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Where parted ſouls with kindred ſpirits meet,</l>
               <l>Rapt to the bloom of beauty, all complete,</l>
               <l>In that celeſtial, vaſt, unbounded ſphere,</l>
               <l>Nought there exiſts but has it's image here!</l>
               <l>All there is MIND!—that intellectual flame,</l>
               <l>From whoſe vaſt depth Platonic viſions came,</l>
               <l>In which creation ended and began—</l>
               <l>Flows to this abject world, and beams on man.</l>
