            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>If it had not been the Lord who was on our Side, when Men roſe up againſt us; then they had ſwallowed us up quick, when their Wrath was kindled againſt us.</hi>—<hi>Bleſſed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a Prey to their Teeth.</hi>

            <p>IT is a buſineſs entertaining and uſeful, to recount the dealings and diſpenſations of divine providence towards a people. Such an employ has a tendency to raiſe our wonder and admiration, and excite our gratitude. To be inſenſible of and unaffected with divine diſpenſations, is an evidence of the baſeneſs and wretched depravity of human nature. Mercies and afflictions oftentimes produce the moſt valuable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. God draws his people with cords of a man, with bands of love, Hoſ. xi. 4. tho divine beneficenes having ſuch an effect upon creatures capable of love, and ſuſceptible of gratitude, that the prophet calls them cords of a man. Adverſe and afflictive providences an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer various important ends and purpoſes. The pious Pſalmiſt ſays, before I was afflicted I went aſtray; but now have I kept thy word, Pſal. cxix. 67. They are of uſe to alarm the ſecure,—to humble the proud,—to reclaim the wandering,—to heighten the worth of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and excite the gratitude of thoſe for whom provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has wrought ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Thus we find good men in all ages have, after mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſignal deliverances, made their returns of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and praiſe. Iſrael did thus after their wonderful and miraculous deliverance from the cruel hand of the Egyptians: when they ſaw that great work which the Lord did upon Egypt, they feared the Lord, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Lord, and his ſervant Moſes. Then Moſes and the children of Iſrael ſong a ſong unto the Lord, as in the 15th of Exod. This was an argument Moſes often made uſe of to excite the obedience and gratitude
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:016509_0002_0FAFE8F0AA217A08"/>
of the people of Iſrael. Samuel, that he might effect the ſame deſign, gives Iſrael a brief retroſpect of the great things God had done for their fathers, eſpecially in their deliverance from Egypt, with a mighty hand and an outſtretched arm, and planting them in a land flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all lands. And afterwards, when they fold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> into the hands of their enemies, he raiſed up for them deliverers, whereby they were reſcued out of the hand of their enemies on every ſide:—To ſum up the matter, he tells them to fear the Lord, and to ſerve him in truth, with all the heart, and to conſider the great things G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> had done for them, 1 Sam. xii. 6. David reminds them of former kindneſſes, to awaken their gratitude and engage their obedience. We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told, what work thou didſt in their days, in times of old, Pſal. xliv. nor is he leſs mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the freſher inſtances of the divine goodneſs:—O! that men would praiſe the Lord, for his goodneſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures for ever.</p>
            <p>The pſalm, in which the words of our text is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, celebrates the divine goodneſs to the church. It is ſuppoſed to be compoſed by David, in the name and for the uſe of the church and people of Iſrael, as a thankſgiving for their deliverance from ſome imminent danger or dangers, from proud and powerful enemies. Many ſuch they had in David's time, but which of them are here intended, is hard to determine, nor is it neceſſary for us to enquire.</p>
            <p>The words of our text ſuppoſe the people of Iſrael in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in ſome very great diſtreſſes, which were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by ſome very powerful enemy, who had threatened and attempted their ruin and overthrow, and from whoſe malicious deſigns they were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to deliver themſelves. Their wrath was cruel, and their fury burned with irreſiſtible vengeance, ſo that they muſt have been ſwallowed up by them, had not the Lord of hoſts, the God of the armies of Iſrael, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to vindicate their righteous cauſe, and ſave them from threatened ruin. They were ſenſible of their weak and defenceleſs condition, that their deliverance was not
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:016509_0002_0FAFE8F0AA217A08"/>
of themſelves, their own arm did not ſave them, but the right hand and mighty arm of God;—therefore they ſay, had not the Lord been on their ſide, they had been ſwallowed up quick. They return a tribute of praiſe to him who rideth in the heavens for their help, whoſe excellency is in the ſkies; bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</p>
            <p>The words may, without any force or ſtrain, be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the ſtate and circumſtances of the people of this land. Our diſtreſſes have been great, but our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances have ſurpaſſed them. With the Pſalmiſt, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the name of Iſrael, we may ſay, many times turned he his anger, and did not ſtir up all his wrath, Pſal. 1xx viii. 38. And with Nehemiah, ix. 28, many times didſt thou deliver them, becauſe of thy mercies. For his name ſake he has deferred his anger, and for his promiſe has he refrained for us, that he hath not cut us off, Iſa. xIviii. 9. He hath done great things for his people, for which they have reaſon to rejoice and be glad. Our fathers truſted in thee, they truſted in thee, and were delivered.</p>
            <p>That we may ſee wherein God has appeared for the help of the people in this land, let us take a brief view of the innumerable diſtreſſes and difficulties they have been called to encounter, out of which a wiſe and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God has marvelouſly delivered them. They got not the land by their own ſword, neither did their own arm ſave them, but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe thou haſt a favour unto them, Iſa. xliv. 3. That they have not ſtood by their own might, but that God has been on their ſide, is evident, if we conſider their weakneſs and inability to encounter the many and great difficulties that lay in their way.</p>
            <p>In the reign of James the firſt of England, 1602, there were a number of godly perſons in the ſeveral towns and villages in Nottinghamſhire, Lancaſhire and Yorkſhire, in the north of England, who were zealous for reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not only teſtifying againſt human inventions and additions, in the worſhip of God, but carefully attending to the poſitive and practical <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

entered into an agreement for the ſupport of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ordinances of God, according to the primitive pattern. And finding by experience that they could not enjoy their liberties and privileges without offence, in their own country, they determined to remove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and families into the Netherlands, which they after ſome difficulty accompliſhed; and arriving in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, they ſettled themſelves in the city of Leyden, 1610; here, under the States, they quietly enjoyed their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties about ten years, Mr. Prince ſays eleven: But think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Holland not the moſt advantageous place for them and their poſterity, they, after ſerious delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, determined to remove to America—Matters being prepared, they ſat ſail Auguſt 20, and arrived at Cape Cod the 11th day of November, 1620: After recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noitering the ſhores, they landed December 25, at a place they called, after the name of the company under whoſe patronage they came, Plymouth. Here they found themſelves in a wild inhoſpitable wilderneſs, without friends, and ſurrounded with enemies, in an inclement ſeaſon, without an houſe to ſhelter them, or fortreſs to ſecure them from the rage of a ſavage foe, or ſufficient proviſion to relieve the returns of hunger; few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (about an hundred) yea very few, and ſtrangers in a land unknown. Of their ſmall number one half died before the opening of the ſpring, by reaſon of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips they had undergone, which produced ſcurveys, &amp;c. that awfully diminiſhed their numbers; and many more, if not all, muſt have periſhed with famine, had not God provided for them the fiſh of the ſea, and the treaſures hid in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Such was the care of God for them, that they neither periſhed by famine, nor were deſtroyed by the bow or ſword of the wilderneſs. Their neceſſities God ſupplied out of his inexhauſted treaſure, and their ſafety he guarded by the ſtrength of his arm. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

and ſeveral of their ſachems ſoon deſired and ſought their protection. Such was the beginning of New England.</p>
            <p>It was not long after that new adventurers arrived from time to time, ſo that in the ſpace of a few years theſe four governments were conſiderably peopled.</p>
            <p>The natives being alarmed at their rapid increaſe, combined to cut them off, and in ſeveral engagements they ſucceeded in their enterprizes, eſpecially under Philip, the renowned Indian warrior. But under the kind ſmiles of heaven our feeble tribes prevented them, and diſpoſſeſſed them of their territories. For many years they made inroads and depredations upon our frontiers, by burning, captivating and deſtroying, in a ſurprizing manner; the tender mother, with the infant babe, did not eſcape their helliſh rage, malice and cruelty. But God, in his abundant goodneſs, was pleaſed to preſerve his people, and protected the vine his own right hand had planted, when men roſe up againſt it; he has prevented them from being ſwallowed up; he has made them to encreaſe and multiply, and driven out the heathen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, ſo that they are become a great and mighty people. From the ſmall beginning of ſcarce fifty, that remained after the great mortality that prevailed among them, their numbers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> grown to about half a million, that we might ſet up our Ebenezer, and ſay, hitherto the Lord hath helped us. The Lord hath comforted Zion, even all her waſte places, made her wilderneſs like Eden, and her deſert like the garden of the Lord; joy and gladneſs hath been found therein, thankſgiving, and the voice of melody, Iſa. li. 3.</p>
            <p>It would be too tedious, at this time, to take even a brief notice of the many ſignal inſtances of the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of divine providence in favour of his people in this land. There were many inſtances when they were on the brink of ruin, when every appearance was dark and gloomy. Even then ſome unforeſeen deliverance and ſalvation was deſigned, and conferred upon them. Their ſtruggles and diſtreſſes were great, but God had mercy for them, and remembered them in their low eſtate, and redeemed them from the hand of their enemies,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016509_0004_0FAFE8F204C72118"/>
Pſal. lxxvi. 23, 24. In how many bloody and cruel wars were they engaged with the ſavages of the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; their land made an aceldama, a field of blood? What deſolations were there made upon them? Towns laid in aſhes, their inhabitants moſt inhumanly butchered, without diſtinction of age or ſex.</p>
            <p>And when the ſcene of affairs ſeemed to have been happily changed, and we were ready to flatter ourſelves with halcyon days, days of peace and tranquility, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the concluſion of the laſt war, in 1763, Canada being ſubdued, and the ſavages brought into ſubjection; ſoon after peace was reſtored between the contending powers, a new ſtorm began to gather, heaven lowered with vengeance, an unthought of enemy appeared to be riſing up, both for our chaſtiſement and profit, to humble us for manifold crying ſins, and to open a way for our greater enlargement, and more free enjoyment of the natural rights of mankind.</p>
            <p>Though Great-Britain had been ſmiled upon in a very uncommon manner, in the proſecution of the war ſhe had been engaged in with France and Spain, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a peace to the enlargement of the Britiſh empire in America; and though in the conteſt the Americans had been much engaged, and afforded ſupplies, both with reſpect to men and money, much beyond their due proportion, the king and parliament themſelves being Judges, for they freely refunded large ſums in requital; yet their reſtleſs, ambitious, domineering tempers would not permit them to be eaſy and quiet, when it was much their intereſt to be ſo: Therefore, no ſooner were they releaſed from the calamities of a war with foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than they were meditating the moſt unnatural and impoveriſhing one; that is, thoſe meaſures, which it was foreſeen muſt terminate in civil diſſentions, and violent hoſtilities.</p>
            <p>The meaſures adopted by the king, and his venal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, were ſuch as impoſing duties for the purpoſe of raiſing a revenue in America, and extending the powers of courts of admiralty beyond their antient limits, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving the American ſubjects of trials by jury, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the judges certificate to indemnify the proſecutor from damages that he might otherwiſe be liable to, &amp;c.</p>

Not content with theſe amazing ſtrides, the next year an act was paſſed, known by the name of the ſtamp-act. This gave a moſt terrible alarm through this extenſive continent, and rouzed every ſoul with zeal to ſtand forth and aſſert their rights. The union and firmneſs of the people, by the bleſſing of God, proved the happy means of their reſcue from threatened vaſſalage. This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious act was the next ſeſſions of Parliament repealed, to the very great joy of the inhabitants of America. Though this act was cruel and unjuſt, yet its repeal was not becauſe it was an unreaſonable claim, but becauſe, as its preamble ſays, the continuance thereof would be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with many inconveniences, and might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of conſequences greatly detrimental to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial intereſts of Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>There were ſeveral ſubſequent acts made, which might have reaſonably alarmed the Americans; ſuch as, that his Majeſty in Parliament of right had power to bind the people of America by ſtatute, in all caſes whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And in the following year (1767) an act paſſed, enabling his Majeſty to put the cuſtoms and other duties in America under the management of commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, &amp;c. Thereupon he erected the then exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive board of commiſſioners, for the expreſs purpoſe of carrying into execution the ſeveral acts relating to the revenue and trade of America.</p>
            <p>Upon the repeal of the ſtamp-act, the people of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica moſt gratefully acknowledged the favour and kind providence of God, whoſe government is over all.</p>
            <p>And as they had received ſuch a token for good, they did not diſquiet themſelves, or others, in relation to the other unjuſt claims, but flattered themſelves with hopes of a more extenſive change of meaſures, and that every grievance might in due time be removed out of the way. But adminiſtration, ever reſtleſs for effecting their purpoſes, did, by a ſtatute called the glaſs, paper, and tea act, made ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

of civil government, and defence of the king's domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions on this continent.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch like acts, made and paſſed, revived the apprehenſions and diſcontents which had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſubſided, by the repeal of the ſtamp-act. Thus they went on to irritate the inhabitants of this continent. To fix the chains they had prepared, the miniſtry agreed with the Eaſt-India company to ſend over to America large quantities of tea, that they might have an opportunity of carrying their meaſures into execution.</p>
            <p>Various methods were projected to avoid the blow. That which was ſent to Carolina was ſtored, and as effectually <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t to the company as though it had been burnt. That which was ſent to New-York was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. And that which was ſent to Boſton, was, by reaſon of the Governor's refuſing to give a permit for its being ſent back, thrown into the ſea. Whereupon the charter of the province was vacated, the town blocked up with ſhips of war, a ſtanding army kept to awe the inhabitants into ſubjection, and all trade entirely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; every ſource for ſupport was dried up, and thouſands ſuffering for the neceſſaries of life.</p>
            <p>Theſe things began to awaken the attention of all the inhabitants of this land, though comparatively lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle preparation was made to repel force by force, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we were unwilling to break with a people with whom we had long been connected; and therefore were trying, by the moſt humble petitions and remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, to prevent the threatened vengeance. But all was vain, our cries could not be heard, or our petitions regarded, but ſhut out as unworthy of the leaſt notice; rather inſulted were we in our moſt ſervent ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. While thus begging and imploring royal favour and clemency, a few provincial or county ſtores being collected at Concord, General Gage detached a party of about 1000 men, under the command of Colonel Smith, who in the evening preceding the 19th of April, 1775, ſecretly ſat out with a deſign of taking and deſtroying the above mentioned ſtores. Coming to Lexington, they found a number of inoffenſive peaſants together, upon
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016509_0005_0FAFE8F2C26B4B10"/>
whom they fired, killed and wounded 17 (8 killed and 9 wounded.) They then puſhed on for Concord; by the time they could reach the deſtined place, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants in that vicinity were alarmed, collected together, and proceeded to the bridge, when the king's troops firſt fired upon them, which was returned with a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial bravery and intrepidity, which obliged thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terans to retreat with precipitation, and though reinforced by Lord Percy with 1400 men, they were glad to find themſelves once more ſecure in Boſton, while all the way thither they were falling by their purſuers. This was the firſt commencement of hoſtilities.</p>
            <p>Here let us reflect upon the goodneſs of God to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: They were attacked ſecretly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by an enemy ſkilled in the art of war, who had been often fluſhed with victory, equipped with arms, and every accoutrement of war; an army regularly officered and diſciplined.—While we, on our part, were without officers, without men, arms or ammunition, in all reſpects unprepared for the field; yet weak and defenceleſs as we were, our enemy was made to flee before us. Surely we cannot aſcribe it to our ſkill in war, or preparation for the field, but muſt ſay it was becauſe the Lord was on our ſide, who has the hearts of all in his hands, and can eaſily intimidate them, and ſtrike them with ſuch a panic that they cannot face their oppoſers. Muſt not we aſcribe the glory to him, who is the Lord of hoſts, the God of armies, when a company of raw, undiſciplined and irregular men, are able to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and put to flight an equal if not ſuperior number of troops, under experienced officers, and who had been trained up to the uſe of arms? Had we been to judge of things, according to the common influence of cauſes and effects, we could have expected nothing ſhort of a moſt terrible carnage.—And had General Gage at that ſeaſon drawn out his whole force, what terrible waſte and deſtruction might he have made, eſpecially for a ſeaſon? Seven or eight thouſand regular troops, with a fine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, might have laid waſte, to a conſiderable extent, a fertile pleaſant land. But heaven reſtrained their madneſs, till there was time to form ſome more regular means to oppoſe them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:016509_0006_0FAFE8F382994C68"/>
Their defeated ſcattered legions with haſty ſteps return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Boſton, where, with their whole army, they were ſhut up, and ſtrongly fortified.</p>
            <p>Theſe acts of hoſtility ſo alarmed the country, that there was very ſoon an army of Provincials raiſed in the Maſſachuſetts and neighbouring Colonies, with a view to prevent any further excurſions of our common enemy. It is here worthy of notice, that though a conſiderable body of men were raiſed, there was no one man that had the command of the whole: Though there was a firſt in every Colony, there was no one that could claim a right of ſuperintending the different diviſions of the different Colonies; which greatly prevented the order and regularity of the army, and rendered them leſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, and more expoſed by any attack their enemy might make upon them. This diſadvantage was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, by ſome of their beſt officers, and afterwards experienced much to their diſadvantage, eſpecially in the affair of Bunker Hill.</p>
            <p>Amidſt every diſadvantage, they conducted with as much decorum as their ſituation would admit of, and a ſpirit and bravery that their circumſtances required. That they were endowed with a true martial ſpirit, they gave the beſt evidence of on the 17th of June, 1775, when near 2000 of them began an entrenchment on Bunker-Hill, which the royal army perceiving, ſent out double, if not treble their numbers, to diſpoſſeſs them of the ground, which brought on a moſt obſtinate and bloody engagement; when near 1000, ſome ſay 1500, of our enemy were killed and wounded: Though, being overpowered by numbers, we retreated to Cambridge, with a loſs comparatively inconſiderable (about 100 killed and died of their wounds.)</p>
            <p>Perhaps the event of this engagement had been much more favourable, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> there been a proper officer, whoſe authority had been more extenſive: For where there is a timidity, as is natural in a ſituation of danger, men will be very apt to indulge it, where they imagine there is a want of right or authority to challenge their ſervices.</p>
            <p>The difficulty referred to was happily remedied, by the appointment of Continental officers, and the arrival
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016509_0006_0FAFE8F382994C68"/>
of the Commander in Chief of all the forces of the United States of America, his Excellency General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington; under whoſe conſummate wiſdom our military affairs have been conducted; whoſe name is dear and highly venerated, and whoſe memory will, I truſt, be ever precious in the eſteem of every friend of America. This celebrated officer took the command of our troops at Cambridge on the 2d day of July, 1775.</p>
            <p>Although this attempt did not ſucceed, as was deſired and hoped, yet it anſwered important ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; it ſhewed us that our help was not in ourſelves, and that the providence of God was eminently concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the preſervation of this detached party, that they were not cut off by much ſuperior numbers. It alſo afforded matter of conviction to our enemies that we were in earneſt, and would contend even to blood, in the defence of our rights and privileges: Beſides it weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and diſpirited our enemies, ſo that they thought it beſt to confine themſelves afterwards to their ſtrong ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s, and content themſelves with throwing their ſhot and ſhells at ſo great a diſtance as gave little proſpect of ſucceſs. And thus the remaining part of that year was principally ſpent, and until the month of March fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, when, by the beſt accounts we were able to collect, they were meditating an attack upon our army; being provoked thereto by our taking poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the heights of Dorcheſter.</p>
            <p>The day the important attempt was to have been made, God, who commands the winds and ſeas, ſent ſuch a terrible tempeſt, that the waters were impaſſable, and their purpoſe fruſtrated. Thus he is able to turn the counſels of the wiſe into fooliſhneſs, and make their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of none effect. He is glorious in holineſs, fearful in praiſe, doing wonders. How much reaſon have we to admire the conduct of divine providence, in reſtraining the wrath and diſappointing the purpoſes of our enemies, and more ſo, if we take into conſideration our unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredneſs to oppoſe our enemies? We were without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular army, unſkilled in arms, undiſciplined, and in a meaſure unarmed. In this our defenceleſs condition, our enemies might have taken the advantage; but they
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016509_0007_0FAFE8F442E879F0"/>
were reſtrained, which gave us an opportunity of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting forces, and the various neceſſaries for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.—Kind providence diſappointing the deſigns of our enemies, and finding their ſituation unſafe while our forces occupied the above mentioned heights, they, like men ſeized with a panic, haſtily ſhip themſelves, that they may eſcape the danger, March 18, 1776. May we not then adopt the words of the pious Pſalmiſt, and ſay, had not the Lord been on our ſide, when men roſe up againſt us, they had ſwallowed us up quick?</p>
            <p>But to ſhew their rancour and malice upon their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, they left fire in a number of houſes, in ſuch a poſition that it might ſoon be communicated, and produce a moſt fearful deſolation through every ſtreet and lane in the town: But kind providence directed the inhabitants to a timely diſcovery of the horrid mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious plot; and thereby the moſt calamitous conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, intended and threatened that once opulent and flouriſhing town, was prevented.</p>
            <p>Bleſs the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. Our ſoul is eſcaped as a bird out of the ſnare of the fowler; the ſnare is broken, and we are eſcaped; our help is the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were going on, our force in the north was not idle: Ticonderoga was taken by ſurprize the 9th day of May. This opened a way for our forces to Canada, which for a ſeaſon was improved to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; Chamblee was ſoon taken, and St. John's, after a ſiege of ſix weeks, November 2, 1775. Our ſucceſs ſoon reached Montreal, and extended to the gates of Quebec. This was an object that commanded the attention of our officers: Accordingly a regiment of men was voluntarily engaged in a rout by way of Kennebec, through the wilderneſs, into the heart of Canada, to co-operate with the forces that ſhould be ſent by the way of the lakes. This rout, though attended with amazing difficulty and hardſhip, was performed by two parts of the whole, the other returning, by reaſon of the ſcarcity of proviſions. Some time after their arrival, they were joined by a party
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016509_0007_0FAFE8F442E879F0"/>
under the command of General Montgomery, who, after ſummoning the city to ſurrender, and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, attempted to force it, December 31ſt, in which hazardous enterprize he was ſlain, and the attempt was defeated. Thus fell that gallant officer, whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is ſtill venerated, and will be perpetuated in the annals of America. About 370 of our troops were made priſoners.</p>
            <p>Though providence did not deſign <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s ſo great a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as the acquiſition of that important place, or the continuance of a life ſo good and great, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs we have reaſon to acknowledge the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, the wiſe governor of the world, in the preſervation of ſo many of our forces, in the moſt criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſituation, and teaching us that wiſdom and ſtrength are with God; that we might be taken off from truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an arm of fleſh, and never go forth in our own ſtrength, but in the name and ſtrength of him who is the God of the armies of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>But to return, our enemy evacuating Boſton, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring to Halifax, gave us a further opportunity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting, and forming a more regular army; which we may ever conſider as a ſmile of divine providence, which not only favoured us with an opportunity of doing ſomething for recruiting and forming an army, but alſo for recruiting and augmenting our ſtores. As we had been deficient in military ſtores, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of them attended with difficulty and great riſque, it was neceſſary that we ſhould, if poſſible, do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for that purpoſe among ourſelves. We therefore ſoon found we could in a good meaſure ſupply ourſelves with cannon and gunpowder, far beyond the moſt ſanguine expectations. The art of making ſalt-petre ſoon roſe to great perfection; a buſineſs that had been little thought of, and leſs practiſed, and upon the bare ſuggeſtion of it, many thought it could not be accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>If it were found that there was a deficiency in our manufactory, that deficiency we could ſupply from abroad, without the difficulty and riſque of the whole. And beſides, we made captures upon the high ſeas that were no ſmall advantage.—Theſe things we are ready
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016509_0008_0FAFE8F505D57050"/>
to aſcribe to ourſelves, our wiſdom and ſagacity, though we are as much indebted to the providence of God for them, as we are for the bread we eat for our nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the clothes we put on.</p>
            <p>If we had but a ſhort reſpite from the immediate view and excurſions of our enemy, it was that we might prepare for more formidable and vigorous attacks. The rod was continually held over us, and we were threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with every diſtreſs that was in the power of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain to inflict: Formidable fleets and armies were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring in Great-Britain, with foreign mercenaries to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this continent to obedience in all caſes whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Accordingly hoſtilities were again committed. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore Sir Peter Parker, with his fleet, in conjunction with the army under Generals Cornwallis and Clinton, made a moſt vigorous attack upon Sullivan's-Iſland, in South-Carolina, the 28th of June, 1776. While the ſhips drawn up againſt the fortreſs, with amazing fury and dreadful roar of cannon pour in their ſhot, attempting its demolition, their army three ſeveral times attempted to land, but were repulſed. Such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and bravery animated both officers and ſoldiers, that General Lee obſerved there was no need to ſay any thing to them, to inſpire their ambition, or emulate their activity. Far from being in the leaſt diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by fatigue, they ruſhed on in one continued blaze of fire, with thick columns of ſmoke, for the ſpace of twelve hours, when their enemy was glad to retire, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cover of the night, though ſo diſabled that it was with difficulty they were able to make their retreat. Their ſhips were much ſhattered, and many of their officers and men ſlain and wounded; thus they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded their enterprize. Who was it that taught their hands to war, and their fingers to fight? Who that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired them with that noble ardour and fixed reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that procured them victory? Might they not ſay with David, thou, O Lord, haſt girded me with ſtrength to the battle? bleſſed be the Lord, my ſtrength, Pſal. cxli.</p>
            <p>The Britiſh monarch with his minions, highly incenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and burning with choler at the diſappointment his
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016509_0008_0FAFE8F505D57050"/>
troops had met with, being unable to ſubjugate the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he had devoted to his wrath, endeavoured to ſtir up all the powers of the eaſt, to enable him to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>compliſh his wicked deſigns. Fleets and armies were prepared, that their vengeance might be hurled on the devoted Americans. Their deſigns and preparations were not unnoticed, or diſregarded. If we dreaded the effects of their wrath, we had no deſponding fears of their ſucceſs. We were not unapprized that it was in their power to deſolate our ſea-ports, and they had given us inſtances of this kind of ſavage inhumanity; let Charles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, Norfolk, Falmouth, &amp;c. witneſs.</p>
            <p>By this time the people of America had felt enough of the cruelty and inhumanity of Great-Britain, and more they had reaſon to expect, it therefore became neceſſary to think of ſome method whereby they might ſecure themſelves againſt threatened deſtruction, and tranſmit their rights and privileges to poſterity. An expedient preſented, which in its conſequences was the moſt favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of any that could be thought of, and promiſed the moſt laſting benefits and bleſſings, namely, throwing off all connection with Great-Britain; and accordingly the fourth day of July, 1776, is one of the moſt memorable aeras that ever took place in America. Then, to the almoſt univerſal joy of the inhabitants of this country, we were declared free and independent States. If we are indebted to any man, or any number of men, for going into this method for our help, it muſt be to the Britiſh king and his miniſters. I preſume I may ſay, that it was not ſo much as the wiſh or deſire of ſcarce a man on the continent, before their diſtreſſes had driven them to meditate ſuch an expedient: No, not until after they found that the Britiſh king was forming al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances, and ſeeking aſſiſtance from foreign powers. We were ſenſible, that while we were in connection with Great-Britain, it would not be in our power to procure any foreign alliance or aſſiſtance, ſhould our diſtreſſes be ever ſo great; we were therefore neceſſitated by Britain herſelf, upon the principles of ſelf preſervation, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our independency. Divine providence made uſe of them as the very means of this (to them) ſo unpleaſing
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:016509_0009_0FAFE8F5C64F5758"/>
an event. Our enemies have repeatedly thrown out, that it was the object we ever aimed at, which is as far from truth as falſhood itſelf can be. If this had been the caſe, why did we delay the matter ſo long? Why did we remonſtrate and petition from time to time, in the moſt humble and affectionate manner, by ſeparate Aſſemblies, and by Delegates in Congreſs, for redreſs of grievances <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then we ſhould much rather have been heard, and reverted back to the ſtate we were in in the year 1763—But we could not be heard, but were ſpurned from the throne with threats and inſults. After every du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful method tried in vain, with long waiting, there was no other alternative by which we could entertain the leaſt hope. Heaven ſeems to have pointed out our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in this way. A ſeries of providences conſpired to bring about this glorious event, and at a juncture when it ſeemed to be the moſt ſit and neceſſary.—That it ſhould be accompliſhed with ſuch unanimity and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs among the members of Congreſs, and ſo prolifical in its conſequences, is a peculiar ſmile of heaven, and ſhould be acknowledged to the glory of that God whoſe kingdom is over all, and who diſpoſeth the hearts of men as he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>But we will proceed to take notice of our danger, and our deliverance. About the beginning of July, 1776. General Howe, with his fleet of men of war and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, hove in ſight of New-York, and ſoon after landed an army of more than 30,000 men. While his army was airing and recruiting their health and vigour, he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſet on foot an accommodation, to which Congreſs ſo far liſtened as to appoint a committee of their body to hear the terms to be propoſed. The matter being looked into, it was found but an amuſement, as there were no powers committed to him and his aſſociates that could operate to any advantage. Thus ended the treaty, if worthy the name.—About the 20th of Auguſt his men were again ſhipped, fell down the Narrows, landed near Graveſend, and marched through the town of New-Utrecht, in their way to Flat-Buſh, about 5 miles from the city, near which they encamped; but were much harraſſed by our rifle-men. Scouting parties were ſent
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:016509_0009_0FAFE8F5C64F5758"/>
from our army to the adjoining woods, but their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were inſufficient. The Britiſh forces, in three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, take three different roads, and under cover of he night almoſt ſurround the whole of our parties, who, though encircled with more than treble their number, bravely fought their way through the enemy (Auguſt 27) killing great numbers of them, and carrying off many priſoners. As it was the principal of the Britiſh force that was engaged againſt only a diviſion of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican army, who were ſtationed upon the weſt end of Long-Iſland, oppoſite to New-York, they found themſelves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nſufficient to ſuſtain a vigorous attack, yet they were enabled to break the ſnare and eſcape, though many were ſlain, and numbers captivated. Their ordnance and ſtores they retreated with to New-York, before the enemy were apprized of their deſign.—Whatever gloom may be thrown over the mind by the recital of ſuch a cataſtrophe, yet there will, upon a review of the matter, appear mercy in the midſt of judgment. We ſhould acknowledge it to the glory of divine goodneſs and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that the whole diviſion was not made a ſacrifice, when their enemy were ſo numerous, and that we were able to make ſo favourable a retreat.</p>
            <p>The ſeveral ſkirmiſhes which preceded the more general attack ſerved to weaken the enemy, perhaps, in proportion to any diſadvantage we ſuffered. Theſe out-works and fortreſſes were principally deſigned for temporary uſe; they delayed the progreſs of the enemy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

               </gap> an important end in view. That which they attained in ground, they loſt in time, they being retarded in their motions, and their loſs of time was no doubt our advantage.</p>
            <p>However, it gave the enemy the advantage of a more eaſy acceſs to the city and iſland of New-York. This our Generals ſaw and provided againſt, by removing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was moſt valuable out of the way. On the 15th day of September they landed, under a heavy fire of cannon from their ſhipping, at or near the town of Harlem, and while they entered the city one way, our forces retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the other. Being now on a ſmall iſland, they could not get along without ſome contention; a ſmart action

               </gap>, and diſconcerted their enemy. The motion of our enemy gave evidence that it was their intention to get beyond our army, and prevent their retreat from the iſland; but the caution and watchfulneſs of our Commander in Chief eluded their deſign, by moving towards the north part of the iſland, that he might at any time ſecure himſelf a retreat.</p>
            <p>October 15th, General Mercer, with a party, made an excurſion upon Staten-Iſland, where there was a party of the enemy; but they being apprized of our approach, fled with precipitation; a few were taken, with a number of arms, and ſome baggage.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time was the great movement of the enemy up the weſtern found, and their landing in large bodies at Frog Point: This was a movement of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Howe's for making a bold puſh, to hem in and at one blow cut off our army. It was the opinion of the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, that the ſituation of the army of the States was yet too confined, and that it was unſafe to continue as they were, or hazard the important cauſe, in which, if they ſhould not ſucceed, the army might be loſt, as a retreat would be impracticable. It was therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to counteract the enemy, by a more general movement. It ſeems our whole force was to be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the northward of Kingſbridge, that we might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the enemy in their operations. This movement was calculated to prevent the enemy from ravaging the country, ſurrounding our army, and to lead them from the cover of their ſhipping. This deſign was ſo far ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, that all the road from Kingſbridge to Eaſt Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was open to the enemy, even from New-York, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Fort-Waſhington<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a few guards, and a regiment at Kingſbridge, who were ordered, in caſe of diſtreſs, to retreat to Fort-Waſhington.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were doing, the enemy were not idle; having collected their forces, they ranged their ſhips and troops along the ſhore as far as Eaſt-Cheſter.</p>
            <p>On the 18th day of October they began a heavy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonading. Their motions being narrowly watched, an ambuſcade was laid for them, which had in a good

meaſure its deſired effect; they were put to ſlight, with conſiderable loſs, and ſome captivated (36.) On the 23d day there was a warm engagement between a party of our army and the enemy, when they were beaten, and 13 Heſſians left dead on the field. On the 27th the enemy attacked our lines at Harlem, when they were repulſed three ſeveral times ſucceſſively, and went off in confuſion, with conſiderable loſs: And on the 28th the whole body of the enemy was perceived to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing. This gave an alarm to the army of the States, and large advance guards were kept out, towards which the enemy ſoon appeared advancing in ſolid columns, and attempted to collect upon every ſide. The enemy began their fire, which was very heavy, and was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with the greateſt vigour. Our numbers engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being vaſtly inferior, they retreated before the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which gave them an opportunity of advancing near our lines, where, from a neighbouring hill, they play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their cannon with amazing fury for a while, then ceaſed. Our loſs was not great, nor equal to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger we ſeemed to be in, and by the beſt accounts not equal to the loſs of the enemy.</p>

            <p>October 3<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi>, our General perceived the enemy had compleated 4 or 5 batteries upon the neighbouring hills, which overlooked the plains where our army lay, ſo that it could not be ſafe keeping that ſtation; according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the army was moved to the hills above the plains.—The enemy advanced to the plains, and were riſing the hills, when they were ſaluted by a number of our can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and ſoon retired.</p>
            <p>General Howe here brings to mind the caſe of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadad, the Syrian, who warred againſt Iſrael with ill ſucceſs; his miniſters, in a council of war, delivered their advice in theſe terms: Their Gods are the Gods of the hills, and therefore they were ſtronger than we; but let us fight againſt them in the plain, and ſurely we ſhall be ſtronger than they.—He hearkened to their

voice, but how to put it into execution was the queſtion; for they being aſſailants, the Iſraelites were maſters of the ground, and there was no other way of bringing them into the plains, but by beating them from the hills.—Afterwards they were placed in the plains, and there convinced, by woful experience, that Iſrael's God was God of the vallies as well as of the hills, Kings xx.</p>

Our men fought to their honor, but being overpowered by numbers, they were obliged to retreat to the fort.—Soon after, they were ſummoned to ſurrender, and finding themſelves unable to defend it, they ſubmitted, and were made priſoners of war, to the number of about 2000. This ſeemed to be the greateſt misfortune which had attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that campaign.</p>

            <p>The next object our enemy ſeemed to have in view was Fort Lee, upon the oppoſite ſhore. Their motions being carefully watched, their deſign was manifeſt; accordingly a conſiderable party of our army were led over to ſupport General Greene, who commanded at that fort.</p>

The enemy on the 20th day of November paſſed the river, and landed 7 or 8 miles above the fort, which General Greene gaining knowledge of, he determined to leave it, being unequal to the ſupport of it.

They retreated to Newark, the enemy purſuing them.—They continued to retreat in the greateſt order, carrying their whole baggage and ſtores with them, as Iſrael of old before the Egyptians, near a hundred miles, calling upon the militia in every place to join them; they were purſued till they paſſed the Delaware, where they had the advantage of putting a check upon the enemy's purſuit, by deſtroying or putting out of the way every boat and veſſel far and near. They encamped within about half a mile of the banks of the river. The enemy, unable to proſecute their purpoſes, as by experience they were taught when attempting to paſs the river, were repulſed by our artillery.—The enemy were now at Trenton, and places adjacent, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a favourable opportunity for paſſing the river, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating our army, and perhaps reaching Philadelphia.—But how mortifying the diſappointment!—On the morning of the 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This gave an effectual check to the enemy, and put a ſtop to their career.</p>
            <p>General Waſhington having defeated the enemy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired with his booty, and the laurels of victory, to camp, where he gave himſelf and his army time to recruit after the fatigues of his enterprize.

            <p>Should we now turn our thoughts and meditations to the northward, we are preſented with little that tends to adminiſter conſolation and comfort. For want of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of men and ſtores, General Arnold was obliged to leave Quebec (May the 7th.)—At the Cedars we were defeated, with the loſs of 500 men (May 20.) General Thompſon alſo, near Sorelle (June 8) with the loſs of about 200.—General Arnold defeated on the Lake, with the loſs of about 100 men (October 11.)</p>
            <p>Theſe and like inſtances ſerve to ſhew us, that the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong; that it is not in man that walks to direct his ſters, that there is not any evil in the city, and the Lord hath not done it; and that pride might be hid from man, and the Lord alone exalted.</p>
            <p>During the winter, while General Howe lay at Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, and the army of the United States not far from

            <p>About the 20th of June the royal army, like men afraid, and filled with terror, ſecretly decamped and ſtole away towards Amboy, ſhip, and return to New-York.—Some time after they re-ſhip, and put out to ſea, and for ſome time are not heard of, nor was their deſign known till they were diſcovered in Cheſapeak Bay; ſoon after they land at Elk-Creek, aiming to reach Philadelphia. To attain this they muſt paſs the Brandywine, which they might do at two or three fords; at theſe paſſages the army of the States determined to diſpute their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>g. To do this to advantage, they laboured under this difficulty; their army muſt be in ſeveral diviſions, while the enemy might keep themſelves together. As it could not be determined which of the fords the enemy would take, we could not ſtrengthen one more than another, leſt we ſhould miſs the object we aimed at. By this means their whole force was levelled againſt but a part of ours, when being overborne by numbers, they were obliged to give way to their enemy. The loſs on our ſide was not conſiderable, perhaps not more if equal to the enemy's: Nor did General Howe eſteem it any great or important atchievement; if he had, he would not have miſſed of making another attempt the next day. This happened September 11.</p>
            <p>General Howe's next manoeuvre ſeemed to be to get and keep the army of the States hemmed in, that they might not be able to obtain ſupplies, and be reduced to obedience: But his plans were not beyond the ken of our officers, nor was it attended with difficulty to evade them.</p>
            <p>General Howe is permitted to enter and poſſeſs the city of Philadelphia, with his army, and to occupy German<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town. Here they were attacked on the 4th day of October by General Waſhington, with ſuch ſpirit, that they were put to ſlight with the greateſt precipitation; but by reaſon of ſome unhappy miſtake, we loſt our prize, after they had eſcaped the town, where there were many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable

effects, and a ſine train of artillery, to which the enemy afterwards returned, and took poſſeſſion of.</p>
            <p>Theſe events are worthy of our notice and attentive regard. They ſhew us that our truſt is not in an arm of fleſh, that human ſkill and wiſdom, nor the greateſt martial powers cannot ſecure us ſucoeſs and that the bleſſing of the God of armies can ſecure us againſt diſappointment; that diſappointment is not our ruin, but the delay of mercy; that delays weaken and debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate our enemies, and render them leſs capable of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing their wicked purpoſes and deſigns. We may not, we cannot ſay, God has forſaken us, while he reſtrains the rage of our foes, and confines them within the narrow compaſs of a city and its ſuburbs; but we may ſay, his time is the beſt, and with patience wait in the vigorous uſe of every means in our power for that ſalvation he is giving us the agreeable proſpect of. Though for the preſent dark clouds interpoſe, and hide from our ſight the wiſhed for day, yet a durable truſt in the righteouſneſs of our cauſe, and the power and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the God of armies, encourages our hope; though caſt down, we are not forſaken.</p>
            <p>Doth not there ſeem to be mercy in reſerve, when none of the attempts of the enemy anſwer the end and deſign for which they were ſent, but only to weaken and impoveriſh them? With what great expence of men and money did they gain a paſſage to the city of Philadelphia?—Red. Bank and Mud-Iſland coſt them infinitely more in blood and treaſure, than the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary advantages they could reap by them. Though the ground to us was loſt, and the poſſeſſion of them, while they were in the city, of ſmall importance, the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to them was of little avail; by no means a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation equal to the expence.

He arrived at Quebec May 6, 1776. This army, with a very ſtrong fleet, arrived at Crown-Point about the beginning of July, 1777. Soon after their arrival, parties were ſent out to reconnoitre the ſituation of our forts and army at Ticonderoga. Our forts there were ſaid to be in the beſt condition; our army conſiſted of about 3 or 4000 men, ſaid to be in high ſpirits. The Commander in Chief, General St. Clair, gaining intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the ſtrength of the enemy, called a council of war, when it was judged that they ſhould not be able to hold the fort, with the lines; accordingly orders were immediately given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Their whole works were abandoned; and moſt of their ſtores left for the enemy, who ſoon took poſſeſſion of them, and purſued the garriſon with the greateſt vigour and ſpirit. Our garriſon retreat to Fort-Ann, then to Fort-Edward, and from thence to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratoga and Still water. The tidings of this unexpected retreat of our forces ſtruck every face with paleneſs, and every heart with trembling. Thouſands of curſes, imprecations and haſty cenſures, were thrown out againſt the officer who commanded in that department. What fearful conſequences were meditated? With old Jacob we were ready to ſay, theſe things are againſt us. But alas, how little do we know how ſhort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted are our views? We can ſee only one link in the chain of providence, and as we ſee, we cenſure; where as, were we able to take a view of the whole, we ſhould ſee reaſon for different ſentiments, and ground for ſaving our cenſures. Things viewed in their ſeparate ſeveral parts, will appear very different than when they are viewed collectively and together. Such a providential diſpenſation we often ſay is not beſt, or any thing that befalls us, when we do not look ſo far as to conſider it
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:016509_0014_0FAFE8FEC1530CE0"/>
as ſuch, it cannot be for the beſt. We ſay ſo, becauſe perhaps we think ſo; and we think ſo only becauſe we view the matter ſeparately. Such were our ſentiments relative to the evacuation of our fortreſſes on the Lake; but when we have been led to ſee a little further, we have changed our ſentiments, and have been convinced that thoſe things we thought were againſt us, were all for our advantage. The effect and conſequence have made it manifeſt.</p>
            <p>General Burgoyne, ſluſhed with a train of ſucceſſes, until he had got as far as Fort Edward, was ready to flatter himſelf that all would come in and bow to his ſtandard. With this view he publiſhed his manifeſto, promiſing royal protection, &amp;c. He had previouſly ſent out a party by the way of Oſwego, to attack Fort Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, near the Oneida Lake, and reduce to ſubjection the county of Tryon; but here he was ſadly diſappointed. His party was defeated, many killed and made priſoners, in all 300, chiefly Indians, when the brave General Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kemer loſt his life. This was on Auguſt 6. The Britiſh General having gained the knowledge of ſome ſtores at Bennington, in the State of Vermont, detached Col.

            <p>Thus we ſee a train of happy events take place, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the evacuation of Ticonderoga and its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies. We feared and trembled when we ſaw and heard of the triumphs of our enemy; but how ſoon was that ſaying verified, the triumphing of the wicked is ſhort?—We may here adopt the words of our text, and ſay, if the Lord had not been on our ſide when men roſe up againſt us, they had ſwallowed us up quick.—Bleſſed be the Lord. Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty, juſt and true are thy ways, thou king of ſaints; who ſhall not fear thee! Let us ſing of the mercies of the Lord forever, and with our mouths make known his faithfulneſs to all generations, Pſal. lxxxix.</p>
            <p>I. And as in the 18th pſalm, I have purſued mine enemies and overtaken them, neither did I turn again till they were conſumed. I have wounded them that they were not able to riſe; they are fallen under my feet. For thou had girded me with ſtrength unto battle; thou haſt ſubdued thoſe that roſe up againſt me. Thou haſt alſo given me the neck of mine enemies, that I might deſtroy them that hate me. O clap your hands all ye people, ſhout to God with the voice of triumph; for the Lord moſt high is terrible, he is a great King over all the earth; he ſubdueth the people under us:—Sing praiſes to God, ſing praiſes: Sing praiſes unto our King, ſing praiſes. See alſo Ezek. xxxix. 1—5.</p>
            <p>We left General Howe in the city of Philadelphia, where he peaceably ſpent the winter, when nothing of any great importance took place, either on one ſide or the other. But a moſt important event took place about the beginning of this year, on the 6th of February, when by the indefatigable ſervices of the Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries of the United States of America, Meſſieurs Franklin and Dean, a treaty of alliance and commerce was acceded to by the King of France, and in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof an Ambaſſador was ſent to attend the Congreſs of theſe United States. Thus we have ſeen
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:016509_0015_0FAFE8FF820F2D08"/>
that God, whoſe kingdom is over all, and in whoſe hand are the hearts of the kings of the earth, which he can turn as the rivers of water, hath diſpoſed one of the moſt powerful monarchs in Europe to own and eſpouſe the cauſe of his injured people in this country. And while we ſee theſe things actually accompliſhed, the king's repreſentative at our court, his ſhips on our coaſts for our defence and protection, I ſay, while theſe things are to the view of every one indiſputable, we have good reaſon to hope and expect that other European powers will follow the laudable example, and which to all appearance is at the very door. The conduct of France relative to America is a tremendous blow to Great-Britain, and has brought on ſuch a contention as will not be eaſily removed. By this means the Britiſh monarch may find other ſervice for his ſhips and armies, than to burn, deſtroy and butcher his unoffending well-wiſhers in America. Such I truſt we may be ſtiled, though we have been inhumanly and ſavagely treated; yet as we make a profeſſion of chriſtianity, benevolence muſt mark our character.</p>
            <p>The wiſe and righteous Governor of the world is cutting out other work for Britain than that ſhe has been employing herſelf about theſe three years paſt. It has been a matter of ſpeculation with ſome, that the Americans ſhould be fond of forming an alliance with France, on account of her religious ſentiments, being in general Roman Catholics; and doubtleſs every one that is an enemy to this alliance will make this the ground of their objections, even though they were Catholics themſelves, or equally ſuperſtitious, and not a whit better.</p>
            <p>Upon which I would obſerve, that ſuch an alliance is not unexampled; England has been in alliance with Portugal, the inhabitants of which are almoſt if not wholly Roman Catholics; and France with Holland, yet the Hollanders are chiefly Preſbyterians. The king of England has been in alliance with the king of Pruſſia, where Lutheraniſm chiefly prevails. And it is not long ſince we were threatened with an alliance and aſſiſtance which Great-Britain fought after with Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>

In that caſe their different ſentiments in religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were no bar in the way. Differences in religion have no operation in the political ſyſtem, and commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial intereſt of nations and people; but yet advantage may ariſe by ſuch an alliance, in a moral or religious view, though not by deſign and immediately, yet in its operation and influence it may have this happy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The Proteſtants in France are not an inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of the nation, who have always been kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and much out of ſight, ever ſince the repeal of the edict of Nantz. Now this alliance may have a good ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to cure the nation of their bigotry, root out their ſanguinary notions, and introduce an univerſal toleration. They have already granted a toleration for traders and factors, or any that ſhall ſettle among them from Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. This beginning may have a happy and glorious end; and if it ſhould terminate as there is ſome ground to hope it may, the now unhappy Proteſtants of that country would feel the moſt grateful ſenſe of divine kindneſs, and bleſs God that ſuch an alliance had been formed. Theſe things duly conſidered are ſufficient to remove thoſe difficulties that have perplexed the minds of ſome, who may have thought ſuch a thing unprecedented.—May it not be conſidered as a ſmile of divine providence, and one of the methods that God is taking for our help and deliverance from preſent trouble?</p>
            <p>Perhaps this may have been one reaſon that the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh troops evacuated the city of Philadelphia (June 18) that their force might be more united, and that they might be able to ſecure New-York, in caſe any attempt ſhould, by the aſſiſtance of France, be made againſt it. But be that as it may, let the reaſons remain with themſelves. It was enough for us to know they had evacuated the city, and that we might prevent as much of their miſchief as poſſible, our army were ſoon in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of them. They were overtaken at Monmouth, the 28th day of June, 1773, when a very warm engagement enſued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Britiſh forces, after twelve hours exertion, gave way, and left the field, with their dead unburied, to the number of 300, and 1250 wounded. Of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans, 7 officers and 52 rank and file were killed, and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:016509_0016_0FAFE900412559A8"/>
170 wounded. In the dead of the night with precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation they fled, that they might avoid their purſuers. Their ſlight was not known in our camp until next morning, and the ſultrineſs of the ſeaſon rendered it impracticable to purſue them to advantage; nor did they make any delay until they arrived within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of New-York.</p>
            <p>In this inſtance, as in many others, we may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the manifold goodneſs of God, in the protection and ſucceſs of our troops; and that they are made a terror to their enemy. Now ſhould our tongues talk of thy righteouſneſs all the day long; for they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, they are brought to ſhame that ſeek our hurt.</p>
            <p>I might here take occaſion juſt to mention ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtance of ſucceſs, in an action with our enemies upon Rhode-Iſland, where, in an open field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fight, after ſome hours engagement, the enemy were forced to flee, and leave the field to our troops (Auguſt 28.) By the beſt accounts their numbers were ſuperior. It is true that this expedition did not ſucceed according to the wiſhes of every friend to his country, yet it is as true, that our forces behaved with a bravery becoming Americans. The failure of the expedition did not take its riſe from any defect in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralſhip, or want of valour in officers or ſoldiers; but merely from a diſappointment of providence. It was well known, previous to the undertaking, that unleſs the harbour was blocked up, there would be little or no hope of ſucceding, and while that was effected, all hope among our enemies was gone, therefore they burnt and ſunk their veſſels, to the number of nine, which in the whole carried 206 guns, and employed their ſeamen in aſſiſting to defend the garriſon againſt our forces. The French fleet being detained at ſea by a violent gale of wind, were ſome of them diſinaſted, and obliged to repair to Boſton to refit. This gave an opportunity to the enemy to throw in ſuccours from New-York, which diſappointed, us of obtaining the prize we had in view; not with ſtanding kind provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſo far ſmiled upon our arms as to vanquiſh our enemy in the field, and thereby gave a ſafe retreat off
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:016509_0017_0FB0E544EB7C1098"/>
the iſland, with whatever was convenient and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be brought off.</p>
            <p>And now ſhould we not make the Pſalmiſt's enquiry, and ſay, what ſhall we render to the Lord for all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits?</p>
            <p>We are brought now to a period, when we have far leſs to fear from them then we ever had ſince they beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>mmand the attention of Britain, and draw her forces from our ſhores. This we ſee is already the happy effect of our treaty of amity and commerce. But were we alone, we ſhould have no reaſon to fear only from ourſelves, for would we not be our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers, it would not be in the power of our enemies to do it. They might diſtreſs us, but they could not deſtroy us: They might vex and diſtrub us, but they could not prevail againſt us. If we could ſupport our virtue, there would be no doubt but we could ſupport our cauſe. If God be on our ſide, we need not fear what man can do unto us.</p>
            <p>That God has appeared for us, amidſt all the correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have met with, is beyond a doubt; it will not admit of the leaſt heſitation: That he has chaſtiſed us many ways, and by many diſappointments, is very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt; and it is as evident, that he has not forſaken us. He has given us many tokens for good. That God has from the beginning been engaged in behalf of the United States, is evident from this one conſideration, namely, his reſtraining our enemies. He ſuffered them to diſtreſs us, firſt, when we were moſt unprepared; even then they were put to flight. And all along, from time to time, he has ſuffered them to proceed in the ſame proportion that we have in our preparations and expertneſs in war. Had our enemies taken advantage of our weakneſs and unſkilfulneſs, what carnage might they have made? What horror and deſolation might they have ſpread through the land? But as God ſaith to the raging waves of the ſea, ſo he ſaith to the fierce and headſtrong paſſions of men, hitherto ſhall ye go, and no further. And when we ſee ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:016509_0017_0FB0E544EB7C1098"/>
marks of the divine hand, not only in correction but mercy, can we do leſs than recount his works, and make the moſt grateful returns for his favour? And when we ſing his praiſes, let us be careful we never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his works. With the Pſalmiſt we ſhould ſay, not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name be all the glory. We have deſerved nothing but correction, yea, nothing ſhort of being cut off, and deprived of all our privileges. It is not for our ſakes, but for his great name ſake, that we are yet a people ſaved of the Lord, who is the ſhield of our help, and the ſword of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency. Bleſſed be the Lord.</p>
            <p>While we acknowledge the kindneſs and care of God, the all wiſe governor of the world, towards his church and people, may we fear to offend him—Let us not abuſe his patience and goodneſs, by turning his grace into wantonneſs, and the indulgence of thoſe ſins that incur his anger and wrath.—Let us guard againſt a ſelfiſh, covetous and oppreſſive temper, with every abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that through the depravity of nature we are prompted to; for if our ways pleaſe God, then he will aſſuredly make our enemies at peace with us.</p>
            <p>Finally, has God, in his good providence, hitherto led and preſerved the feeble tribes of his people? have they not the greateſt reaſon, the higheſt encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to truſt in him, who hath ſtiled himſelf the God of the armies of Iſrael? He who hath done ſo much for this people, and in ſo many inſtances ſo manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for their help and deliverance, will accompliſh his own work in their ſalvation, if they, by their ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and folly, do not provoke him to change the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his providences. May his unerring wiſdom guide us—his all powerful arm protect us—his grace and goodneſs ever accompany us, that we may be kept through faith to ſalvation. Amen.</p>
