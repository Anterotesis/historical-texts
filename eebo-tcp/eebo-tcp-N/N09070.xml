            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A ſhort Narrative of the horrid Maſſacre in <hi>Boſton,</hi> perpetrated in the Evening of the
<date>Fifth Day of <hi>March,</hi> 1770,</date>
by Soldiers of the XXIX<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment; which with the XIV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were then quartered there: with ſome Obſervations on the State of Things prior to that Cataſtrophe.</head>
            <p>IT may be a proper introduction to this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, briefly to repreſent the ſtate of things for ſome time previous to the ſaid maſſacre: And this ſeems neceſſary in order to the forming a juſt idea of the cauſes of it.</p>
            <p>At the end of the late war, in which this Province bore ſo diſtinguiſhed a part, a happy union ſubſiſted between Great-Britain and the Colonies. This was unfortunately interrupted by the Stamp-Act: but it was in ſome meaſure reſtored by the Repeal of it. It was again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by other acts of parliament for taxing America; and by the appointment of a Board of Commiſſioners, in purſuance of an act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which by the face of it was made for the relief and encouragement of commerce, but which in it's operation, it was apprehended, would have, and it has in fact had, a contrary effect. By the ſaid act the ſaid Commiſſioners were "to be reſident
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011580_0006_0F8745A9999DE450"/>
in ſome convenient part of his Majeſty's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions in America".—This muſt be underſtood to be in ſome part convenient for the whole— But it does not appear, that in fixing the place of their reſidence, the convenience of the whole was at all conſulted, for Boſton being very far from the centre of the colonies, could not be the place moſt convenient for the whole.— Judging by the act, it may ſeem this town was intended to be favoured, by the Commiſſioners being appointed to reſide here; and that the conſequence of that reſidence would be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and encouragement of commerce: but the reverſe has been the conſtant and uniform effect of it: So that the commerce of the town, from the embaraſſments in which it has been latety involved, is greatly reduced. For the particulars on this head, ſee the ſtate of the trade not long ſince drawn up and tranſmitted to England by a committee of the merchants of Boſton.</p>
            <p>The reſidence of the Commiſſioners here, has been detrimental not only to the commerce, but to the political intereſts of the town and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; and not only ſo, but we can trace from it the cauſes of the late horrid maſſacre. Soon after their arrival here in November 1767, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of confining themſelves to the proper buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their office, they became partizans of Governor Bernard in his political ſchemes; and had the weakneſs and temerity to infringe upon one of the moſt eſſential rights of the houſe of commons of this province—that of giving
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011580_0007_0F8745A9A6694C38"/>
their votes with freedom, and not being accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table therefor but to their conſtituents. One of the members of that houſe Capt. Timothy Folgier, having voted in ſome affair contrary to the mind of the ſaid Commiſſioners, was for ſo doing diſmiſſed from the office he held under them.</p>
            <p>Theſe proceedings of theirs, the difficulty of acceſs to them on office-buſineſs, and a ſuperci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious behaviour, rendered them diſguſtful to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general, who in conſequence thereof treated them with neglect. This probably ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated them to reſent it: and to make their reſentment felt, they and their coadjutor Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Bernard, made ſuch repreſentations to his Majeſty's miniſters as they thought beſt calculated to bring the diſpleaſure of the nation upon the town and province: and in order that thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations might have the more weight, they are ſaid to have contrived, and executed plans for exciting diſturbances and tumults, which otherwiſe would probably never have exiſted; and when excited, to have tranſmitted to the miniſtry the moſt exaggerated accounts of them.</p>
            <p>Theſe particulars of their conduct his Majeſty's Council of this province have fully laid open in their proceeding in council, and in their addreſs to General Gage, in July and October 1768; and in their letter to Lord Hillſborough of the 15th of April 1769.—Unfortunately for us, they have been too ſucceſsful in their ſaid repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, which in conjunction with Governor Bernard's, have occaſioned his Majeſty's faithful
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011580_0008_0F8745AA659DDE18"/>
ſubjects of this town and province to be treated as enemies and rebels, by an invaſion of the town by ſea and land: to which the approaches were made with all the circumſpection, uſual where a vigorous oppoſition is expected. While the town was ſurrounded by a conſiderable number of his Majeſty's ſhips of war, two regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments landed and took poſſeſſion of it; and to ſupport theſe, two other regiments arrived ſome time after from Ireland: one of which landed at Caſtle Iſland, and the other the town.</p>
            <p>Thus were we, in aggravation of our other embarraſſments, embarraſſed with troops, forced upon us contrary to our inclination —contrary to the ſpirit of Magna Charta,— contrary to the very letter of the Bill of Rights, in which it is declared, that the raiſing or keeping a ſtanding army within the kingdom in time of peace, unleſs it be with the conſent of parliament, is againſt law—and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the deſire of the civil magiſtrates, to aid whom was the pretence for ſending the troops hither: who were quartered in the town in direct violation of an act of parliament for quartering troops in America: and all this in conſequence of the repreſentations of the ſaid Commiſſioners and the ſaid Governor, as appears by their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials and letters lately publiſhed.</p>
            <p>As they were the procuring cauſe of troops being ſent hither, they muſt therefore be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and a blameable cauſe of all the diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and bloodſhed that have taken place in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of that Meaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:011580_0009_0F8745AB1EEBD908"/>But we ſhall leave them to their own reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, after obſerving, that as they had ſome months before the arrival of the troops, under pretence of ſafety to their perſons, retired from town to the Caſtle, ſo after the arrival of the troops, and their being quartered in the town, they thought proper to return: having anſwered, as they doubtleſs thought, the purpoſe of their voluntary flight.</p>
            <p>We ſhall next attend to the conduct of the troops, and to ſome circumſtances relative to them.—Governor Bernard without conſulting the Council, having given up the State-houſe to the troops at their landing, they took poſſeſſion of the chambers, where the repreſentatives of the province and the courts of law held their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and (except the council-chamber) of all other parts of that houſe: in which they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a conſiderable time, to the great annoyance of thoſe courts while they ſat, and of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and gentlemen of the town, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made the lower floor of it their exchange. They had a right ſo to do, as the property of it was in the town: but they were deprived of that right by meer power.—The ſaid Governor ſoon after, by every ſtratagem and by every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, but a forcible entry, endeavored to get poſſeſſion of the manufactory-houſe, to make a barrack of it for the troops: and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe cauſed it to be beſieged by the troops, and the people in it to be uſed very cruelly; which extraordinary proceedings created univerſal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs,

ariſing from the apprehenſion; that the troops under the influence of ſuch a man would be employed to effect the moſt dangerous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes: but failing of that other houſes were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, in which, contrary to act of parliament, he cauſed the troops to be quartered. After their quarters were ſettled, the main guard was poſted at one of the ſaid houſes, directly oppoſite to, and not twelve yards from, the State-houſe, (where the General Court, and all the Law Courts for the County were held) with two field pieces pointed to the State-houſe. This ſituation of the main guard and field pieces ſeemed to indicate an attack upon the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a defiance of law; and to be intended to affront the legiſlative and executive authority of the province.</p>
            <p>The General Court, at the firſt Seſſion after the arrival of the troops, viewed it in this light, and applied to Governor Bernard to cauſe ſuch a nuſance to be removed; but to no purpoſe. Diſguſted at ſuch an indignity, and at the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of being under dureſſe, they refuſed to do buſineſs in ſuch circumſtances; and in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof were adjourned to Cambridge, to the great inconvenience of the members.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, the challenging the inhabitants by centinels poſted in all parts of the town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the lodgings of officers, which (for about ſix months, while it laſted) occaſioned many quarrels and great uneaſineſs—</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:011580_0011_0F8745ACB2FB0E50"/>Capt. Wilſon's, of the 59th, exciting the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes of the town to take away their maſters lives and property, and repair to the army for protection, which was fully proved againſt him. —The attack of a party of ſoldiers on ſome of the magiſtrates of the town—the repeated reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cues of ſoldiers from peace officers—the firing of a loaded muſket in a public ſtreet, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering a great number of peaceable inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants—the frequent wounding of perſons by their bayonets and cutlaſſas, and the numerous inſtances of bad behaviour in the ſoldiery made us early ſenſible, that the troops were not ſent here for any benefit to the town or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and that we had no good to expect from ſuch conſervators of the peace.<note n="*" place="bottom">The inhabitants, inſtead of making application to the military officers on theſe occaſions, choſe rather to oppoſe the civil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and the laws of the land to ſuch offenders; and had not the ſoldiery found means to evade legal puniſhments, it is more than probable their inſolence would have received a check and ſome of the moſt melancholy effects of it been prevented.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It was not expected however, that ſuch an outrage and maſſacre, as happened here on the evening of the fifth inſtant, would have been perpetrated. There were then killed and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by a diſcharge of muſquetry, eleven of his Majeſty's ſubjects, viz.</p>
            <p>Mr. Samuel Gray, killed on the ſpot by a ball entering his head.</p>
            <p>Criſpus Attucks, a molatto, killed on the ſpot, two balls entering his breaſt.</p>
            <p>Mr. James Caldwell, killed on the ſpot, by two balls entering his back.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:011580_0012_0F8745AD5D8D2B98"/>Mr. Samuel Maverick, a youth of ſeventeen years of age, mortally wounded: he died the next morning.</p>
            <p>Mr. Patrick Carr mortally wounded: he died the 14th inſtant.</p>
            <p>Chriſtopher Monk and John Clark, youths about ſeventeen years of age, dangerouſly wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is apprehended they will die.</p>
            <p>Mr. Edward Payne, merchant, ſtanding at his door: wounded.</p>
            <p>Meſſi'rs John Green, Robert Patterſon and David Parker: all dangerouſly wounded.</p>
            <p>The actors in this dreadful tragedy were a party of ſoldiers commanded by Capt. Preſton of the 29th regiment: This party, including the Captain, conſiſted of eight, who are all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to goal.</p>
            <p>There are depoſitions in this affair which mention, that ſeveral guns were fired at the ſame time from the Cuſtom-Houſe; before which this ſhocking ſcene was exhibited. Into this matter inquiſition is now making.—In the mean time it may be proper to inſert here the ſubſtance of ſome of thoſe depoſitions.</p>
            <p>Benjamin Frizell, on the evening of the 5th of March, having taken his ſtation near the weſt corner of the Cuſtom-Houſe in Kingſtreet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and at the time of the ſoldiers firing their guns, declares (among other things) that the firſt diſcharge was only of one gun, the next of two guns, upon which he the deponent thinks he ſaw a man ſtumble: the third diſcharge was
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011580_0013_0F8745AF0A4BE128"/>
of three guns, upon which he thinks he ſaw two men fall, and immediately after were diſcharged five guns, two of which were by ſoldiers on his right hand, <hi>the other three, as appeared to the deponent, were diſcharged from the balcony, or the chamber window of the</hi> CUSTOM-HOUSE, <hi>the flaſhes appearing on the left hand, and higher than the right hand flaſhes appeared to be, and of which the deponent was very ſenſible,</hi> altho' his eyes were much turned to the ſoldiers, who were all on his right hand.</p>
            <p>Gillam Baſs, being in King-ſtreet at the ſame time, declares that they (the party of ſoldiers from the main guard) poſted themſelves between the cuſtom-houſe door, and the weſt corner of it; and in a few minutes began to fire upon the people: <hi>Two or three of the flaſhes ſo high above the reſt, that he the deponent verily believes they muſt have come from the</hi> CUSTOM-HOUSE <hi>windows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Jeremiah Allen declares, that in the evening of the 5th day of March current, being at about nine o'clock in the front chamber in the houſe occupied by Col. Ingerſoll in King-ſtreet, he heard ſome guns fired, which occaſioned his going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the balcony of the ſaid houſe.—That when he was in the ſaid balcony in company with Mr. William Molineux jun'r. and John Simpſon, he heard the diſcharge of four or five guns, the flaſhes of which appeared to be to the weſtward of the centry box, and immediately after, he the deponent <hi>heard two or three more guns and ſaw
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011580_0014_0F8745B063F8C168"/>
the flaſhes thereof from out of the houſe, now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the</hi> CUSTOM-HOUSE, <hi>as they evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him,</hi> and which he the ſaid deponent at the ſame time declared to the aforeſaid Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux and Simpſon being then near him, <hi>ſaying to them,</hi> (at the ſame time pointing his hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cuſtom-houſe) <hi>there they are out of the cuſtom-houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>George Coſter being in King-ſtreet at the time above mentioned, declares that in five or ſix mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes after he ſtopped, he heard the word of command given to the ſoldiers <hi>fire,</hi> upon which one gun was fired, which did no execution, as the deponent obſerved, about half a minute after two guns, one of which killed one Samuel Gray a ropemaker, the other a molatto man, between which two men the deponent ſtood, after this the deponent heard the diſcharge of four or five guns more, by the ſoldiers; immediately after which <hi>the deponent heard the diſcharge of two guns or piſtols, from an open window of the middle ſtory of the</hi> CUSTOM-HOUSE, near to the place where the centry box is placed, and being but a ſmall diſtance from the window, he heard the people from within ſpeak and laugh, and ſoon after ſaw the caſement lowered down; after which the deponent aſſiſted others in carrying off one of the corps.</p>
            <p>Cato, a Negro man, ſervant to Tuthill Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> declares, that on Monday evening the fifth of March current, on hearing the cry of fire, he ran into Kingſtreet, where he ſaw a number
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011580_0015_0F8745B12D891EA8"/>
of people aſſembled before the Cuſtom-Houſe, that he ſtood near the centry-box and ſaw the ſoldiers fire on the people, who ſtood in the middle of ſaid ſtreet; directly after which <hi>he ſaw two flaſhes of guns, one quick upon the other, from the chamber window of the</hi> CUSTOM-HOUSE; and that after the firing was all over, while the people were carrying away the dead and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>he ſaw the Cuſtom-Houſe door opened, and ſeveral ſoldiers (one of whom had a cutlaſs) go into the Cuſtom-Houſe</hi> and ſhut the door after them.</p>
            <p>Benjamin Andrews declares, that being deſired by the committee of enquiry to take the ranges of the holes made by muſquet balls, in two houſes near oppoſite to the Cuſtom-Houſe, he finds the bullet hole in the entry door poſt of Mr. Payne's houſe (and which graz'd the edge of the door, before it enter'd the poſt, where it lodged, two and a half inches deep) <hi>ranges juſt under the ſtool of the weſternmoſt lower chamber window of the</hi> CUSTOM-HOUSE.</p>
            <p>Samuel Drowne, towards the end of his depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition (which contains a pretty full account of the proceedings of the ſoldiers on the evening of the 5th inſtant) declares, that <hi>he ſaw the flaſhes of two guns fired from the</hi> CUSTOM-HOUSE, <hi>one of which was out of a window of the chamber weſtward of the balcony, and the other from the balcony; the gun (which he clearly diſcerned) being pointed through the balliſters, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who held the gun, in a ſtooping poſture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011580_0016_0F8745B1E1C270D8"/>
himſelf into the houſe, having a handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief or ſome kind of cloth over his face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe depoſitions ſhew clearly that a number of guns were fired from the Cuſtom-Houſe.— As this affair is now enquiring into, all the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice we ſhall take of it is, that it diſtinguiſhes the actors in it into Street-Actors and Houſe-Actors; which is neceſſary to be obſerved.</p>
            <p>What gave occaſion to the melancholy event of that evening ſeems to have been this. A difference having happened near Mr. Gray's ropewalk, between a ſoldier and a man belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, the ſoldier challenged the ropemakers to a boxing match. The challenge was accepted by one of them, and the ſoldier worſted. He ran to the barrack in the neighbourhood, and returned with ſeveral of his companions. The fray was renewed, and the ſoldiers were driven off. They ſoon returned with recruits and were again worſted. This happened ſeveral times, till at length a conſiderable body of ſoldiers was collected, and they alſo were driven off, the ropemakers having been joined by their brethren of the contiguous ropewalks. By this time Mr. Gray being alarmed interpoſed, and with the aſſiſtance of ſome gentlemen prevented any further diſturbance. To ſatisfy the ſoldiers and puniſh the man who had been the occaſion of the firſt difference, and as an example to the reſt, he turned him out of his ſervice; and waited on Col. Dalrymple, the commanding officer of the troops, and with him concerted meaſures for
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011580_0017_0F8745B343AE0C10"/>
preventing further miſchief. Though this affair ended thus, it made a ſtrong impreſſion on the minds of the ſoldiers in general, who thought the honor of the regiment concerned to revenge thoſe repeated repulſes. For this purpoſe they ſeem to have formed a combination to commit ſome outrage upon the inhabitants of the town indiſcriminately; and this was to be done on the evening of the 5th inſtant or ſoon after: as appears by the depoſitions of the following per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, viz.</p>
            <p>William Newhall declares, that on Thurſday night the firſt of March inſtant, he met four ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the 29th regiment, and that he heard them ſay <hi>there were a great many that would eat their dinners on Monday next, that ſhould not eat any on Tueſday.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Daniel Calfe declares, that on Saturday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 3d of March a camp-woman, wife to James McDeed a grenadier of the 29th, came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his father's ſhop, and the people talking about the affrays at the rope-walks, and blaming the ſoldiers for the part they had acted in it, the woman ſaid, the ſoldiers were in the right; add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>that before Tueſday or Wedneſday night they would wet their ſwords or bayonets in New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland people's blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mary Brailsford declares, that on Sabbath evening the 4th March inſtant a Soldier came to the houſe of Mr. Amos Thayer where ſhe then was. He deſiring to ſpeak with Mr. Thayer was told by Mrs. Mary Thayer, that her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011580_0018_0F8745B3627E3B10"/>
was engaged, and could not be ſpoke with. He ſaid, your brother as you call him, is a man I have a great regard for, and I came on purpoſe to tell him to keep in his houſe, for <hi>before Tueſday night next at Twelve o'clock, there will be a great deal of bloodſhed, and a great many lives loſt:</hi> and added, that he came out of a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to her brother to adviſe him to keep in his houſe, for then he would be out of harm's way. He ſaid, your brother knows me very well: my name is Charles Malone. He then went away.— Of the ſame import, and in confirmation of this declaration, are the depoſitions of Mary Thayer and Aſa Copeland, who both live with the ſaid Mr. Thayer, and heard what the ſoldier ſaid as abovementioned. It is alſo confirmed by the depoſition of Nicholas Ferriter.</p>
            <p>Jane Uſher declares, that about 9 o'clock on monday morning the 5th of March current, from a window ſhe ſaw two perſons in the habit of ſoldiers, one of whom being on horſe back appeared to be an officer's ſervant. The perſon on the horſe firſt ſpoke to the other, but what he ſaid, ſhe is not able to ſay, though the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow was open, and ſhe not more than twenty feet diſtant: the other replied, <hi>He hoped he ſhould ſee blood enough ſpilt before morning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Matthew Adams declares, that on monday evening the 5th of March inſtant between the hours of 7 and 8 o'clock, he went to the houſe of corporal Perſhall of the 29th regiment, near Quaker-lane, where he ſaw the corporal and his
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011580_0019_0F8745B41EF53390"/>
wife, with one of the fifers of ſaid regiment. When he had got what he went for, and was coming away, the corporal called him back, and deſired him with great earneſtneſs to go home to his maſter's houſe as ſoon as buſineſs was over, and not to be abroad on any account that night in particular, for <hi>the ſoldiers were determined to be revenged on the ropewalk people; and that much miſchief would be done.</hi> Upon which the fifer (about 18 or 19 years of age) ſaid, <hi>he hoped in God they would burn the town down.</hi> On this he left the houſe, and the ſaid corporal called after him again, and begged he would mind what he ſaid to him.</p>
            <p>Caleb Swan declares, that on monday night the 5th of March inſtant, at the time of the bells ringing for fire, he heard a woman's voice whom he knew to be the ſuppoſed wife of one Montgomery, a grenadier of the 29th regiment, ſtanding at her door, <hi>and heard her ſay, it was not fire; the town was too haughty and too proud; and that many of their arſes would be laid low before the morning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Margaret Swanſborough declares, that a free woman named Black Peg, who has kept much with the ſoldiers, on hearing the diſturbance on monday evening the 5th inſtant ſaid, <hi>the ſoldiers were not to be trod upon by the inhabitants, but would know before morning, whether they or the inhabitants were to be maſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Joſeph Hooton, junr. declares, that coming from the South-end of Boſton on monday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011580_0020_0F8745B53B8F3140"/>
the 5th of March inſtant, againſt Dr. Sewall's meeting he heard a great noiſe and tumult, with the cry of murder often repeated. Proceeding towards the town-houſe he was paſſed by ſeveral ſoldiers running that way, with naked cutlaſſes and bayonets in their hands. He aſked one of them what was the matter, and was anſwered by him, by God you ſhall all know what is the matter ſoon. Between 9 and 10 o'clock he went into King-ſtreet, and was preſent at the tragical ſcene exhibited near the Cuſtom-houſe; as particularly ſet forth in his depoſition.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Mary Ruſſell declares, that John Brails<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a private ſoldier of the <hi>fourteenth</hi> regiment, who had frequently been employed by her (when he was ordered with his company to the Caſtle, in conſequence of the murders committed by the ſoldiers on the evening of the 5th of March) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the deponent's houſe declared, that THEIR <hi>regiment were</hi> ORDERED <hi>to hold themſelves in readineſs, and accordingly was ready</hi> THAT EVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NING, <hi>upon the inhabitants firing on the ſoldiery, to come to the aſſiſtance of the ſoldiery.</hi> On which ſhe aſked him, if he would have fired upon any of the inhabitants of this town. To which he replied, yes, if he had orders: but that if he ſaw Mr. Ruſſell he would have fired wide of him. He alſo ſaid, <hi>it's well there was no gun fired by the Inhabitants, for had there been,</hi> WE <hi>ſhould have come to the ſoldiers aſſiſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the foregoing depoſitions it appears very clearly, there was a general combination among
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011580_0021_0F8745B59D73CB80"/>
the ſoldiers of the 29th regiment at leaſt, to commit ſome extraordinary act of violence upon the town; that if the inhabitants attempted to repel it by firing even one gun upon thoſe ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, the 14th regiment were ordered to be in readineſs to aſſiſt them; and that on the late butchery in King-ſtreet they actually were ready for that purpoſe, had a ſingle gun been fired on the perpetrators of it.</p>
            <p>It appears by a variety of depoſitions, that on the ſame evening between the hours of ſix and half after nine (at which time the firing began) many perſons, without the leaſt provocation, were in various parts of the town, inſulted and abuſed by parties of armed ſoldiers patroling the ſtreets: particularly—</p>
            <p>Mr. Robert Pierpont declares, that between the hours of 7 &amp; 8 in the ſame evening, 3 armed ſoldiers paſſing him, one of them who had a bayonet gave him a back-handed ſtroke with it, on complaint of this treatment he ſaid the deponent ſhould ſoon hear more of it, and threatned him very hard.</p>
            <p>Mr. Henry Baſs declares, that at 9 o'clock a party of ſoldiers came out of Draper's alley lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to and from Murray's barracks, and they being armed with large naked cutlaſſes, made at every body coming in their way, cutting and ſlaſhing, and that he himſelf very narrowly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped receiving a cut from the foremoſt of them, who purſued him.</p>
            <p>Samuel Atwood, declares, that 10 or 12 ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers armed with drawn cutlaſſes, bolted out of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011580_0022_0F8745B820CB91A0"/>
the alley leading from Murray's barracks into dock-ſquare, and met the deponent, who aſked them if they intended to murder people? they anſwered, yes, by God, root and branch; ſaying here is one of them; with that one of them ſtruck the deponent with a club, which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by another: the deponent being unarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed turned to go off, and he received a wound on the left ſhoulder, which reached the bone, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled him and gave him much pain. Having gone a few ſteps the deponent met <hi>two officers,</hi> and aſked them, gentlemen, what is the matter? <hi>they anſwered, you will ſee by and by</hi>; and as he paſſed by Col. Jackſon's he heard the cry, turn out the guards.</p>
            <p>Capt. James Kirkwood, declares, that about nine of the clock in the evening of the fifth day of March current, he was going by Murray's barracks: hearing a noiſe he ſtopt at Mr. Rhoads's Door, oppoſite the ſaid barracks, where ſaid Rhoads was ſtanding, and ſtood ſome time and ſaw the ſoldiers coming out of the yard from the barracks, armed with cutlaſſes and bayonets, and ruſhing thro' Boylſtone's alley into cornhill, two officers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viz. Lieuts. Minchin and Dickſon came out of the meſs houſe, and ſaid to the ſoldiers, my lads come into the barracks and don't hurt the inhabitants, and then retir'd into the meſs houſe. Soon after they came to the door again, and found the ſoldiers in the yard; and directly upon it, <hi>Enſign Mall</hi> came to the gate of the barrack yard and <hi>ſaid to the ſoldiers, turn
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011580_0023_0F8745B89E29A630"/>
out and I will ſtand by you;</hi> this he repeated frequently, adding, <hi>kill them! ſtick them; knock them down, run your bayonets thro' them,</hi> with a great deal of language of like import. Upon which a great number of ſoldiers came out of the barracks, with naked cutlaſſes <hi>headed by ſaid Mall,</hi> and went thro' the aforeſaid alley, that ſome offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers came &amp; got the ſoldiers into their barracks, and that <hi>Mall with his ſword or cutlaſs drawn in his hand, as often had them out again,</hi> but were at laſt drove into their barracks by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Minchin and Dickſon.</p>
            <p>Mr. Henry Rhoads's declaration agrees with Capt. Kirkwood's.</p>
            <p>Mr. Matthias King of Halifax in Nova Scotia, declares, that in the evening of the fifth day of March inſtant about nine of the clock, he was at his lodgings at Mrs. Torrey's near the town pump, and heard the bells ring and the cry of fire; upon which he went to the door and ſaw ſeveral ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers come round the ſouth ſide of the town houſe, armed with bayonets, and ſomething which he took to be broad ſwords; that one of thoſe people came up almoſt to him and Mr. Bartholomew Kneeland; and that they had but juſt time to ſhut the door upon him; otherwiſe he is well aſſured they muſt have fell victims to their boundleſs cruelty. He afterwards went into the upper chamber of the ſaid houſe, and was looking out of the window <hi>when the drum and the guard went to the barrack,</hi> and he ſaw one of the guards kneel and preſent his piece
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011580_0024_0F8745B968294000"/>
with a bayonet fixed, and heard him ſwear he would fire upon a parcel of boys who were then in the ſtreet, but he did not: He further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that <hi>when the body of troops was drawn up before the guard houſe (which was preſently after the maſſacre) he heard an officer ſay to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that this was fine work, and juſt what he wanted;</hi> but in the hurry he could not ſee him, ſo as to know him again.</p>
            <p>Robert Polley declares, that on monday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 5th inſtant, as he was going home, he obſerved about ten perſons ſtanding near Mr. Taylor's door, after ſtanding there a ſmall ſpace of time he went with them towards Boylſton's alley oppoſite to Murray's barracks; we met in the alley about eight or nine arm'd ſoldiers, they aſſaulted us, and gave us a great deal of abuſive language, we then drove them back to the barracks with ſticks only; we looked for ſtones or bricks, but could find none, the ground being covered with ſnow; ſome of the lads diſperſed, and he the ſaid Polley with a few others were returning peaceably home, when we met about nine or ten other ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers armed: one of them ſaid, "Where are the ſons of bitches": They ſtruck at ſeveral perſons in the ſtreet, and went towards the head of the alley. Two officers came and endeavored to get them into their barracks; one of the lads propoſed to ring the bell; the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers went thro' the alley, and the boys huzza'd and ſaid they were gone thro' royal exchange lane into Kingſtreet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:011580_0025_0F8745BA8C59C228"/>Samuel Drowne declares, that about nine of the clock of the evening of the fifth of March current, ſtanding at his own door in Cornhill, he ſaw about 14 or 15 ſoldiers of the 29th re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, who came from Murray's barracks arm'd with naked cutlaſſes, ſwords, &amp;c. and came upon the inhabitants of the town, then ſtanding or walking in Cornhill, and abuſed ſome, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently aſſaulted others as they met them; moſt of whom were without ſo much as a ſtick in their hand to defend themſelves, as he very clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could diſcern, it being moon light, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being one of the aſſaulted perſons. All or moſt of the ſaid ſoldiers he ſaw go into King-ſtreet, (ſome of them through Royal Exchange lane) and there followed them, and ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered them to be quarrelling and fighting with the people whom they ſaw there, which he thinks were not more than a dozen, when the ſoldiers came there firſt, armed as aforeſaid. Of thoſe dozen people, the moſt of them were gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, ſtanding together a little below the Town-Houſe, upon the exchange. At the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of thoſe ſoldiers ſo arm'd, the moſt of the twelve perſons went off, ſome of them being firſt aſſaulted.</p>
            <p>The violent proceedings of this party, and their going into King-ſtreet, "quarrelling and fighting with the people whom they ſaw there" (mentioned in Mr. Drowne's depoſition) was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately introductory to the grand cataſtrophe.</p>
            <p>Theſe aſſailants, who iſſued from Murray's

barracks (ſo called) after attacking and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers perſons in Cornhill, as above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, being armed, proceeded (moſt of them) up the Royal Exchange lane, into King-ſtreet; where making a ſhort ſtop, and after aſſaulting and driving away the few they met there, they brandiſhed their arms, and cried out, where are the Boogers! where are the Cowards. At this time there were very few perſons in the ſtreet beſide themſelves.—This party in proceeding from Exchange lane into King-ſtreet muſt paſs the centry poſted at the weſterly corner of the Cuſtom Houſe, which butts on that lane and fronts on that ſtreet. This is needful to be mentioned, as near that ſpot and in that ſtreet the bloody tragedy was acted, and the ſtreet-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in it were ſtationed: Their ſtation being but a few feet from the front ſide of the ſaid Cuſtom Houſe.—The outrageous behavior and the threats of the ſaid party occaſioned the ringing of the meeting houſe bell near the head of King-ſtreet: which bell ringing quick as for fire, it preſently brought out a number of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who being ſoon ſenſible of the occaſion of it, were naturally led to King-ſtreet, where the ſaid party had made a ſtop but a little while before: and where their ſtopping had drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a number of boys, round the centry at the Cuſtom-Houſe. Whether the boys miſtook the centry for one of the ſaid party, and thence took occaſion to differ with him, or whether he firſt affronted them, which is affirmed in ſeveral depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011580_0027_0F8745BC5D4BE0C0"/>
—however that may be, there was much foul language between them: and ſome of them in conſequence of his puſhing at them with his bayonet, threw ſnow balls at him:<note n="*" place="bottom">Since writing this narrative, ſeveral depoſitions have appeared, which make it clear, that the centry was firſt in fault.—He overheard a barber's boy, ſaying that a captain of the 14th (who had juſt paſſed by) was ſo mean a fellow as not to pay his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for ſhaving him; upon this the centry left his poſt and followed the boy into the middle of the ſtreet, where he told him to ſhew his face; the boy pertly reply'd, I am not aſham'd to ſhew my face to any man: Upon this the centry gave him a ſweeping ſtroke on the head with his muſket, which made him reel and ſtagger and cry much. A fellow apprentice aſked the centry what he meant by this abuſe? He reply'd, damn your blood, if you do not get out of the way I will give you ſomething; and then fixed his bayonet and puſhed at the lads, who both run out of his way. This diſpute collected a few perſons about the boy near the cuſtom houſe. Preſently after this, the party above-mentioned came into kingſtreet, which was a further occaſion of drawing people thither, as above related. (See depoſition of Benj<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. Broaders and others.)</note> which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned him to knock haſtily at the door of the Cuſtom-Houſe. From hence two perſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon proceeded immediately to the main guard, which was poſted (oppoſite to the State-houſe) at a ſmall diſtance near the head of the ſaid ſtreet. The officer on guard was Capt. Preſton, who with ſeven or eight ſoldiers with fire arms, and charged bayonets, iſſued from the guard houſe, and in great haſte poſted himſelf and his ſoldiers in the front of the Cuſtom Houſe near the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aforeſaid. In paſſing to this ſtation the ſoldiers puſhed ſeveral perſons with their bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onets, driving through the people in ſo rough a manner that it appeared they intended to create a diſturbance. This occaſioned ſome
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011580_0028_0F8745BD20E013A0"/>
ſnow balls to be thrown at them: which ſeems to have been the only provocation that was given. Mr. Knox (between whom and Capt. Preſton there was ſome converſation on the ſpot) declares, that while he was talking with Capt. Preſton, the ſoldiers of his detachment had attacked the people with their bayonets; and that there was not the leaſt provocation given to Capt. Preſton, or his party: the backs of the people being towards them when the people were attacked. He alſo declares, that Captain Preſton ſeemed to be in great haſte and much agitated; and that according to his opinion there were not then preſent in Kingſtreet above ſeventy or eighty perſons at the extent.</p>
            <p>The ſaid party was formed into a half circle, and, within a ſhort time after they had been poſted at the Cuſtom-Houſe, began to fire upon the people.</p>
            <p>Capt. Preſton is ſaid to have ordered them to fire, and to have repeated that order. One gun was fired firſt: then others in ſucceſſion, and with deliberation, till ten or a dozen guns were fired; or till that number of diſcharges were made from the guns that were fired. By which means eleven perſons were killed, and wounded, as above repreſented.</p>
            <p>Theſe facts with divers circumſtances attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, are ſupported by the depoſitions of a conſiderable number of perſons: and among others, of the following viz. Meſſir's. Henry Baſs Samuel Atwood, Samuel Drowne, James Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011580_0029_0F8745BDDCCC7B78"/>
Robert Polley, Samuel Condon, Daniel Uſher, Joſiah Simpſon, Henry Knox, Gillam Baſs, John Hickling, Richard Palmes, Benjamin Frizzel, and others; whoſe depoſitions are in the appendix.</p>
            <p>Soon after the firing, a drum with a party from the main guard went to Murray's and the other barracks, beating an alarm as they went, which with the firing had the effect of a ſignal for action. Whereupon all the ſoldiers of the 29th regiment, or the main body of them, appeared in Kingſtreet under arms; and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bent on a further maſſacre of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, which was with great difficulty prevented. They were drawn up between the State Houſe and main guard: their lines extending acroſs the ſtreet and facing down Kingſtreet, where the town-people were aſſembled. The firſt line kneeled; and the whole of the firſt plattoon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented their guns ready to fire, as ſoon as the word ſhould be given. They continued in that poſture a conſiderable time. But by the good Providence of God, they were reſtained from firing.</p>
            <p>That they then went into Kingſtreet with ſuch a diſpoſition will appear probable by the two following depoſitions.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Mary Gardner, living in Atkinſon ſtreet, declares, that on Monday evening the 5th of March current, and before the guns fired in Kingſtreet, there were a number of ſoldiers aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled from Green's barracks towards the ſtreet, and oppoſite to her gate; that they ſtood very
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011580_0030_0F8745C05B056778"/>
ſtill until the guns were fired in Kingſtreet, then they clapped their hands and gave a cheer, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>this is all that we want.</hi> They ran to their barrack, and came out again in a few minutes, all with their arms, and ran towards Kingſtreet.</p>
            <p>William Fallaſs declares, that (after the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Kingſtreet) on the evening of the 5th inſtant, upon his return home he had occaſion to ſtop oppoſite to the lane leading to Green's barracks, and while he ſtood there, the ſoldiers ruſhed by him with their arms, towards King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, ſaying, <hi>this is our time or chance:</hi> and that he never ſaw men or dogs ſo greedy for their prey as thoſe ſoldiers ſeemed to be, and the ſergeants could hardly keep them in their ranks.</p>
            <p>Theſe circumſtances with thoſe already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, amount to a clear proof of a combination among them to commit ſome outrage upon the town on that evening; and that after the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous one committed in Kingſtreet, they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to add to the horrors of that night by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a further ſlaughter.</p>
            <p>At the time Capt. Preſton's party iſſued from the main guard, there were in Kingſtreet about two hundred perſons, and thoſe were collected there by the ringing of the bell in conſequence of the violences of another party, that had been there a very little while before. When Captain Preſton had got to the Cuſtom-houſe, ſo great a part of the people diſperſed at ſight of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that not more than twenty or thirty then remained in Kingſtreet, as Mr. Drowne declares,<note n="*" place="bottom">See his Depoſition.</note>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:011580_0031_0F8745C0E6BC7930"/>
and at the time of the firing not ſeventy, as Mr. Palmes thinks.<note n="*" place="bottom">See his Depoſition.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But after the firing, and when the ſlaughter was known, which occaſioned the ringing of all the bells of the town, a large body of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants ſoon aſſembled in Kingſtreet, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued there the whole time the 29th regiment was there under arms, and would not retire till that regiment and all the ſoldiers that appeared, were ordered, and actually went, to their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks: after which, having been aſſured by the Lieutenant Governor, and a number of the civil magiſtrates preſent, that every legal ſtep ſhould be taken to bring the criminals to juſtice, they gradually diſperſed. For ſome time the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of things was diſmal. The ſoldiers out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous on the one hand, and the inhabitants juſtly incenſed againſt them on the other: both parties ſeeming diſpoſed to come to action. In this caſe the conſequences would have been ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible. But by the interpoſition of his Honor, ſome of his Majeſty's council, a number of civil magiſtrates, and other gentlemen of weight and influence, who all endeavoured to calm and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify the people, and by the two principal officers interpoſing their authority with regard to the ſoldiers, there was happily no further bloodſhed enſued; and by two o'clock the town was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to a tolerable ſtate of quiet. About that time, Capt. Preſton, and a few hours after, the party that had fired, were committed to ſafe cuſtody.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:011580_0032_0F8745C1AC92EF38"/>One happy effect has ariſen from this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly affair, and it is the general voice of the town and province it may be a laſting one—All the troops are removed from the town.—They are quartered for the preſent in the barracks at Caſtle-Iſland; from whence it is hoped they will have a ſpeedy order to remove intirely out of the province, together with thoſe perſons who were the occaſion of their coming hither.</p>
            <p>In what manner this was effected, it is not fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign from the ſubject of this narrative to relate.</p>
            <p>The morning after the maſſacre, a town-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was held; at which attended a very great number of the freeholders and other inhabitants of the town. They were deeply impreſſed and affected by the tragedy of the preceding night, and were unanimouſly of opinion, it was incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with their ſafety that the troops ſhould remain any longer in the town. In conſequence thereof they choſe a committee of fifteen gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to wait upon his Honor the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, to requeſt of him to iſſue his orders for the immediate removal of the troops.</p>
            <p>The meſſage was in theſe words:
<q>That it is the unanimous opinion of this meeting that the inhabitants and ſoldiery can no longer live together in ſafety; that nothing can ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally be expected to reſtore the peace of the town and prevent further blood and carnage, but the immediate removal of the troops; and that we therefore moſt fervently pray his Honor, that his power and influence may be exerted for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant removal.</q>

                     <p>I am extremely ſorry for the unhappy differences between the inhabitants and troops, and eſpecially for the action of the laſt evening, and I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted myſelf upon that occaſion, that a due enquiry may be made, and that the law may have its courſe. I have in council conſulted with the commanding officers of the two regiments who are in the town. They have their orders from the General at New York. It is not in my power to countermand thoſe orders. The Council have deſired that the two regiments may be removed to the Caſtle. From the particular concern which the <hi>29</hi>th regiment has had in your differences, Col. Dalrymple, who is the commanding officer of the troops, has ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that that regiment ſhall without delay be placed in the barracks at the caſtle, until he can ſend to the General and receive his further orders concerning both the regiments, and that the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard ſhall be removed, and the <hi>14</hi>th regiment ſo diſpoſed, and laid under ſuch reſtraint, that all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of future diſturbances may be prevented.</p>

               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:011580_0034_0F8745C31D256D00"/>A reſpectable committee was then appointed to wait on his Honor the Lieutenant Governor, and inform him, <hi>that it is the unanimous opinion of this meeting, that the reply made to a vote of the inhabitants preſented his Honor in the morning, is by no means ſatisfactory; and that nothing leſs will ſatisfy, than a total and immediate removal of all the troops.</hi>

            <p>☞IN the concluding Paragraph of the foregoing Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative it is ſaid, that the Town-Meeting was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved after the meaſures were taken for the ſecurity of the Town in the night, by a ſtrong military watch.</p>
            <p>Our implacable enemies, in purſuance of their plan of miſrepreſentation, have taken pains to miſrepreſent this moſt neceſſary meaſure, by declaring it to have been contrary to the mind of the Commander in Chief, and againſt Law.</p>
            <p>This matter will be judged of, by ſtating the fact, and producing the Law.</p>
            <p>When the Committee, who had waited on the Lieutenant Governor, had reported to the Town, that the Troops would be removed to Caſtle-Iſland, (at which time it was near night) it was thought neceſſary for the ſafety of the Town, and for preventing a reſcue of the perſons committed to goal for firing upon, and killing a number of, his Majeſty's ſubjects, that there ſhould be a military watch: and divers Gentlemen were deſired to take the needful ſteps for that purpoſe. It being then night, it was impoſſible a regular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification ſhould iſſue from the officers of the militia: a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of reſpectable perſons therefore offered themſelves voluntiers, and did the duty of a military watch under the direction of the Lieutenant-Colonel, who attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſervice with the approbation of the chief Colonel of the Boſton regiment. The next day, with two of the Select<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Town, the chief Colonel went to the Lieutenant-Governor, &amp; they informed him it was apprehended abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary for the ſafety of the Town, there ſhould be a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary watch kept; and that the Colonel then waited upon him to receive his orders. The Lieutenant Governor declined giving any orders concerning it, but ſaid the Law was clear, that the Colonel, as chief officer of the regiment, might order a military watch; and that he might do about it as he thought fit. In conſequence of this, and knowing the Law gave him ſuch a power, the Colonel iſſued his orders for that purpoſe, &amp; a regular watch was kept the following night. The
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011580_0037_0F8745C8A3BFDB00"/>
next day the Lieutenant Governor ſent for the Colonel, and let him know, that he was in doubt about the legality of the appointment of the military watch: and recommended to the Colonel to take good advice, whether he had a right by Law to order ſuch a watch.</p>
            <p>This being quite unexpected, occaſioned the Colonel to expreſs himſelf with ſome fervor. He alſo ſaid, he had already taken advice, and had no doubt of his own power; but had the preceeding day waited upon his Honor as Commander in Chief to receive his orders: which as his Honor had declined giving, and left the matter with himſelf, he had appointed a military watch: and judged it a neceſſary meaſure to quiet the fears and apprehenſions of the town. The interview ended with the Lieut. Governor's recommending again, that the Colonel would take care to proceed according to law; and without his forbidding a military watch.</p>
            <p>This military watch was continued every night, till Col. Dalrymple had cauſed the two Regiments under his command to be removed to the barracks at Caſtle-Iſland. During the continuance of the watch, the Juſtices of the Peace in their turns attended every night: and the utmoſt order and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity took place through the whole of it.</p>
            <p>This is the ſtate of the fact, upon which every one is left to make his own obſervations.</p>
            <p>Now for the Law: with reſpect to which nothing more is neceſſary than juſt to recite it. It runs thus, "That there be military watches appointed and kept in every town, at ſuch times, in ſuch places, and in ſuch numbers, and under ſuch regulation, as the chief military officers of each town ſhall appoint, or as they may receive orders from the chief officer of the regiment."<note n="*" place="bottom">See a Law of the Province for regulating the Militia. made in the 5th year of William and Mary, Chap. 7. Sect. 10.</note>—This needs no comment. It clearly authorizes the chief officer of the regiment to appoint military watches. The late military watch in Boſton being founded on ſuch an appointment was therefore according to Law.</p>

I immediately got up and went to the door, and found them returning from the ropewalks to the barracks. Whence they again very ſpeedily re-appeared, now increaſed to the number of thirty or forty, armed with clubs and other weapons. In this latter company was a tall negro drummer, to whom I called, you black raſcal, what have you to do with white peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's quarrels? He anſwered, I ſuppoſe I may look on, and went forward. <hi>I went out directly and commanded the peace, telling them I was in commiſſion; but they not regarding me, knock'd down a ropemaker in my preſence, and two or three of them beating him with clubs, I endeavoured to relieve him; but on approaching the fellows who were mauling him, one of them with a great club ſtruck at me with ſuch violence, that had I not happily avoided it might have been fatal to me.</hi> The party laſt mentioned ruſhed in towards the rope-walks, and attacked the rope-makers nigh the tar-kettle, but were ſoon beat off, drove out of the paſſage-way by which they entered, and were followed by the rope-makers, whom I perſuaded to go back, and they readily obeyed.

Carr, and his officers had enter'd my rope-walk, open'd the windows, doors, &amp;c. giving out that they were ſearching for a dead ſerjeant of their regiment; this put me upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately waiting upon Col.

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011580_0043_0F8745CF26B36CC8"/>
what I underſtood had paſſed at the rope-walk days before, he reply'd it was much the ſame as he had heard from his people; but ſays he, "your man was the aggreſſor in affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of my people, by aſking him if he wanted to work, and then telling him to clean his little-houſe." For this expreſſion I diſmiſſed my journeyman on the Monday morning following; and further ſaid, I would do all in my power to prevent my peoples giving them any affront in future. He then aſſur'd me, he had, and ſhould do every thing in his power to keep his ſoldiers in order, and prevent their any more entering my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure. Preſently after, Col. Carr came in, and aſked Col. Dalrymple what they ſhould do, for they were daily loſing their men; that three of his grenadiers paſſing quietly by the rope-walks were greatly abus'd, and one of them ſo much beat that he would die. He then ſaid he had been ſearching for a ſerjeant who had been murder'd; upon which, I ſaid, Yes Colonel, I hear you have been ſearching for him in my rope-walks; and aſked him, whether that ſerjeant had been in the affray there on the Friday; he reply'd, no: for he was ſeen on the Saturday. I then aſked him, how he could think of looking for him in my walks; and that had he apply'd to me, I would have waited on him, and opened every apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I had for his ſatisfaction.</p>

The reply was, there is no officer here. Several of the ſoldiers came out of the guard houſe, and the deponent told them if
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011580_0056_0F8745DBCB494C28"/>
there was not a party ſent down there would be bloodſhed: Juſt as the deponent ſpoke theſe words he was attacked by two ſoldiers <hi>with drawn cutlaſſes</hi> ſuppoſed of the party from Murray's barracks, <hi>one at his breaſt and the other over his head.</hi> One of the guards ſaid this is an officer, meaning the deponent, I believe a Conſtable; on which the two aſſailants retired and put up their cutlaſſes, and further ſaith not.</p>

               <p>I John Coburn of lawful age teſtify and ſay, that on the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the 5th of March inſtant being alarmed by the cry of fire, and ringing of bells, ran out of my houſe with my bags and buckets; upon going to Mr. Payne's door, he told me it was not fire it was a riot, I ſent my buckets home again, and went to Mr. Amory's corner with Mr. Payne, and Mr. Walker the builder came along and ſaid the ſoldiers were in the ſtreet in Cornhill and dock-ſquare, with their <hi>drawn cutlaſſes, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſlaſhing every body in their way,</hi> and the inhabitants wanted help, and ſaid, pray gentlemen run, or words to that purpoſe. I returned again to my houſe, and a few minutes after, at the head of royal exchange lane, in the ſtreet, I ſaw a few, <hi>not exceeding fifteen or twenty perſons,</hi> ſtop, as I ſuppoſed talking what had happened. I went to Mr. Payne's door and ſtood in his entry with him, I believe, about ten or fifteen minutes, and heard ſome words with the people and the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel, ſuch as, Do fire if you dare, but no further than words, not ſo much as to touch him, as I ſaw, neither did I ſee more than <hi>five or ſix</hi> that had ſo much as ſticks in their hands, <hi>all entirely unarmed, without any weapons.</hi> Mr. Harriſon Gray, jun. came into the entry to us, and upon this immediately came an officer with a party of ſix or ſeven men with their guns breaſt-high and clear'd the way, and by their behaviour I did not know but they would fire, I ſaid it was not prudent to tarry there, went directly into my own houſe and called all my family in. To the beſt of my judgment, there was not more than <hi>fifty or ſixty people</hi> in the ſtreet when the party came
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011580_0057_0F8745DC535CAE28"/>
and I believe it was not exceeding two minutes from the time that I left Mr. Payne to the firing of the guns and farther your deponent ſaith not.</p>

Said Daniel's aſked Edward Garrick, fellow-apprentice to the deponent, if he knew where he could get a ſtick that would bear a good ſtroke? Garrick replied, you muſt look for one. And the deponent further ſaith, that about eight o'clock on Monday evening he went down King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet &amp; met twelve of the Town's people with clubs, who ſaid that they had been attack'd by the ſoldiers; that he followed the town's people to the conduit, and then returned home.

The depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent aſked what he was ſtruck for; he anſwered for nothing. he then aſked the centinel what he meant by thus abuſing the people. He reply'd, damn'd your blood, if you do not get out of the way, I will give you ſomething; he then fixt his bayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, and puſh'd at them, &amp; they both run—then one Richard Ward, another fellow-apprentice, aſked the one ſtruck, what it was for, and endeavoured to get his ſtick to ſtrike the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel, but he told him not to, &amp; came away; then he heard a huzza or two, and as he got up Silſby's alley, up came a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of grenadiers, as he tho't about ten, with clubs, cutlaſſes and bayonets, crying out, where are the damn'd Yankeys. He reply'd, what is the matter—they anſwer'd, we will let you know.—He then run into his maſter's entry, &amp; as running in, ſaw near twenty other ſoldiers with bayonets, &amp;c. flouriſhing coming from the guard houſe as he tho't; immediately after, he heard the bells ring, and then as he took it, the ſame party with a ſerjeant at their head, came running by, knocking down and ſlaſhing all the town's people they met with; then he heard people who were running, aſk where the fire was. He told them it was no fire, but the ſoldiers near Juſtice Quincey's were fighting with the inhabitants.—He then went towards Juſtice Quincey's, and found the ſoldiers had retired to their barracks, when 3 cheers were given by the inhabitants—He then went down to Kingſtreet, and heard the people talking of the abuſe his fellow-apprentices had received from the centinel, but ſaw no inſult offered the centinel, the people being in the middle of the ſtreet.—One came up with a cane, appeared a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ſpoke to the centinel, and then went away; then the centinel went up the ſteps of the cuſtom-houſe and pointed his gun; ſome of the inhabitants then ſaid he is going to fire —then he took down his gun and loaded it, while he was loading, one Thomas Greenwood a waiter went into the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom houſe door, and it was ſhut immediately; and then Mr. Green's ſon John ſaid the centinel was a going to fire; but he ſaw no abuſe offered him, or any danger he was in.

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011580_0066_0F8745E59E803A40"/>
to them and ſpoke to the fourth man from the corner, who ſtood in the gutter, and aſked him if the ſoldiers were loaded, he reply'd Yes! I then aſked (addreſſing myſelf to the whole) if they intended to <hi>fire,</hi> was anſwered poſitively, <hi>Yes, by the Eternal God.</hi> I then look'd round to ſee what number of inhabitants were in the ſtreet, and computed them to be about <hi>fifty, who were then going off as faſt as poſſible</hi>; at the ſame time I obſerved a tall man ſtanding on my left-hand, who ſeemed not apprehenſive of the danger he was in, and before I had time to ſpeak to him I heard the word <hi>Fire!</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the report followed, the man on my left hand dropt, I aſked him if he was hurt, but received no anſwer, I then ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down and ſaw him gaſping and ſtruggling with death.—I then ſaw another man laying dead on my right-hand, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advanced up the ſtreet. I then ſaw the ſoldiers loading again, and I ran up the ſtreet to get ſome aſſiſtance to carry off the dead and wounded. Doctor Joſ. Gardner and David Bradley came down with me to the corps, and as we were ſtooping to take them up, the ſoldiers preſented at us again; I then ſaw an officer paſſing buſily behind them.—We carried off the dead without regarding the ſoldiers. I then ſaw an officer paſs before the ſoldiers and hove up their arms, and ſaid ſtop firing, don't fire any more, upon which they ſhouldered. —I then went cloſe up to them, and addreſſing myſelf to the whole, told them I came to ſee ſome faces that I might be able to ſwear to another day—Capt. Preſton, who was the officer, turned round and anſwered (in a melancholy tone) perhaps you may. After taking a view of each man's face I left them. They ſoon after ran up to the main guard houſe. I have nothing farther to ſay.</p>

Dr. Cooper's meeting-houſe, I went thro' the alley, I there ſaw a number of ſoldiers about the barracks, ſome with muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, others without, I ſaw a number of officers at the door of the meſs-houſe, almoſt fronting the alley, and ſome of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants intreating the officers to command the ſoldiers to be peaceable and retire to their <hi>barracks.</hi> One of the officers, viz.

I then ſaw a party of ſoldiers loading their muſquets about the cuſtom-houſe door, after which they all ſhouldered. I heard ſome of the inhabitants cry out, <hi>heave no ſnow balls</hi>; others cry'd they dare not fire.

               <p>In the ſpace of about five minutes, to the beſt of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, I perceived a party of ſoldiers come from the main guard directly through the concourſe of people that was then in Kingſtreet, with their muſkets and fixed bayonets, puſhing too and fro, ſaying, make way; when they had got a-breaſt of the Cuſtom-houſe they drew up in a line from the corner of royal-exchange lane to the centry box at the Cuſtom-houſe door, and being in that poſition for the ſpace of five or ſix minutes, with their muſkets level'd breaſt high and pointed at the people that was ſtill in the ſtreet, huzzaing, &amp;c and crying fire, as before, and ſome more ſnow balls or other things being hove, I heard and ſaw the flaſh of a gun that went off near the corner of the aforementioned lane, and in the ſpace of two ſeconds I heard <hi>the word fire given,</hi> but by whom I cannot aſcertain, but <hi>the ſoldiers fired regularly one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and when diſcharged, loaded again</hi>; I then ſtood behind the centry box, between the ſoldier next it and the Cuſtom-houſe.</p>

bayonet charged, dodging it about as if puſhing at the boys, who ſeemed to be laughing at him, and <hi>none of them within</hi> 12 <hi>or</hi> 15 <hi>feet of him.</hi> In a few minutes after, <hi>Capt.

The captain came before them and put his arm under three or four of their pieces, and puting them into an upright poſture, then retired from my ſight; and preſently they again levelled and the firing began, and proceeded till ten or eleven pieces were diſcharged. On the people's ſcattering a little, I ſaw two men near me lay dead on the ſtreet, and obſerved the ſoldiers to load again, and moved off. And further I ſay not.</p>

I aſked them if this was the fire that is cry'd; they made no anſwer. I aſk'd them what they meant by coming on me in that manner; their anſwer was, <hi>Damn you, ſtand out of our way.</hi> I told them I would not move for no man under the heavens. I offended no one. Therefore they paſſed me, ſome on my right and ſome on my left. I followed behind them, they went to the centry-box
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011580_0074_0F8745ED22C4E8D0"/>
and faced round and form'd in a half-circle. I ſaw a number of people near the middle of kingſtreet, about twenty yards from the centry-box. I ſpoke out and deſired that no diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance might be betwixt the inhabitants and the ſoldiers, for if the ſoldiers were in fault, there was their officer, which I look'd upon to be the officer of the day, and he could ſettle the affair in one minute; then I ſpake to two men to ſpeak to the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; then I ſee two or three advance towards the officer. I heard ſome words paſs, what they were I know not, I turned round and ſpake to the people to ſtep off and let them that went to the officer ſettle the diſpute, the people ſtanding ſtill, <hi>I turned towards the officer and ſee him fall into the regular circle, then I heard the word</hi> FIRE, on my left one gun was fir'd off by a ſoldier on their right. Upon which I ruſhed in, then ſeeing the firſt ſoldier that fired run at ſome perſons and fall upon the ground, I hallow'd to take his gun from him, then <hi>I received three puſhes by their bayonets, two in my left arm and one in my breaſt, that at my breaſt I ſtruck off with a ſtick, and the gun went off inſtantly.</hi> Then I drew back, and finding one dead, as I thought, on my left and one on my right, I then run over to quaker-lane, where I ſaw a number of people, I deſired them to ſtep out and keep the ſoldiers from getting off; from thence I went over to the other ſide the ſtreet, to the lane near the town watch-houſe, where I deſired the people to ſtep out, and not to let the ſoldiers get off, for I would go home and get my gun and bring a party againſt them, which I did, but meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of the inhabitants returning, they told me the ſoldiers were gone off and affairs would be ſettled to-morrow, on that I went home.</p>

paſſed by ſeveral ſoldiers running that way <hi>with naked cutlaſſes and bayonets in their hands.</hi> The deponent aſked one of them what was the matter, and was anſwered by him, <hi>by God you ſhall all know what is the matter ſoon!</hi> Between 9 and 10 o'clock the deponent came into Kingſtreet and ſtood about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the ſtreet, or nearer the cuſtom-houſe, in the direction of Quaker and Royal Exchange lanes, and ſaw about eight or ten ſoldiers drawn up near the cuſtom-houſe, and an officer which he ſince underſtands was <hi>Capt.

               <p>I Richard Palmes of Boſton, of lawful age, teſtify and ſay, that between the hours of nine and ten o'clock of the 5th inſtant, I heard one of the bells ring, which I ſuppoſed was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by fire, &amp; enquiring where the fire was, was anſwered that <hi>the ſoldiers were abuſing the inhabitants</hi>; I aſked where, was firſt anſwered at Murray's barracks, I went there and ſpoke to ſome officers that were ſtanding at the door, I told them I was ſurprized they ſuffered the ſoldiers to go out of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rack after eight o'clock; I was anſwered by one of the officers pray do you mean to teach us our duty; I anſwered I did not, only to remind them of it; one of them ſaid you ſee that the ſoldiers are all in their barracks, and why do not you go to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011580_0076_0F8745EF0E6038B8"/>
your homes; Mr. James Lamb and I ſaid, Gentlemen let us go home, &amp; were anſwered by ſome, home, home; according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I aſked Mr. William Hickling if he was going home, he ſaid he was, I walked with him as far as the poſt-office, upon my ſtopping to talk with two or three people, Mr. Hickling left me; I then ſaw Mr. Pool Spear going towards the town-houſe, he aſked me if I was going home, I told him I was; I aſked him where he was going that way, he ſaid he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his brother David's. But when I got to the town-pump, we were told there was a rumpus at the cuſtom-houſe door; Mr. Spear ſaid to me you had better not go, I told him I would go and try to make peace; I immediately went there and ſaw <hi>Capt. Preſton</hi> at the head of ſix or eight ſoldiers in a circular form, with guns breaſt high and bayonets fixed; the ſaid Captain ſtood almoſt to the end of their guns. I went immediately to Capt. Preſton (as ſoon as Mr. Bliſs had left him) and aſked him if their guns were loaded, his anſwer was they are loaded with powder and ball; I then ſaid to him I hope you do not intend they ſhall fire upon the inhabitants; his reply was, by no means. When I was aſking him theſe queſtions my left hand was on his right ſhoulder; Mr. John Hickling had that inſtant taken his hand off my ſhoulder, and ſtept to my left, then inſtantly I ſaw a piece of ſnow or ice fall among the ſoldiers, on which the ſoldier at the officer's right hand ſtept back and <hi>diſcharged his gun,</hi> at the ſpace of ſome ſeconds the ſoldier at his left <hi>fired</hi> next, and the others one after the other. After the firſt gun was fired, I heard the word <hi>Fire,</hi> but who ſaid it I know not; after the firſt gun was fired the <hi>ſaid officer had full time to forbid the other ſoldiers not to fire, but I did not hear him ſpeak to them at all</hi>; then turning myſelf to the left I ſaw one man dead, diſtant about ſix feet; I having a ſtick in my hand made a ſtroke at the ſoldier who fired, and ſtruck the gun out of his hand. I then made a ſtroke at the officer, my right foot ſlipt, that brought me on my knee, the blow falling ſhort, he ſays I hit his arm; when I was recovering myſelf from the fall I ſaw the ſoldier that fired the firſt gun endeavoring <hi>to puſh me through with his bayonet,</hi> on which I threw my ſtick at his head, the ſoldier ſtarting back, gave me opportunity to jump from him into exchange-lane, or I muſt been inevitably run thro' my body. I looked back and ſaw three perſons laying on the ground, and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſoldier ſtepping round the corner as I thought to ſhoot
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011580_0077_0F8745EF6125DAE8"/>
me, I ran down Exchange lane, and ſo up the next into King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, and followed Mr. Gridley with ſeveral other perſons with the body of Capt. Morton's apprentice up to the priſon houſe, and ſaw he had a ball ſhot through his breaſt; at my return I found that the officer and ſoldiers were gone to the main guard. <hi>To my beſt obſervation there were not ſeventy people in Kingſtreet at the time of their firing, and them very ſcattering,</hi> but in a few minutes after the firing there were upwards of a thouſand; finding the ſoldiers were gone I went up to the main-guard and ſaw there the ſoldiers were formed into three diviſions, the front diviſion in the poſture of platoon firing, and I expected they would fire. Hearing that his Honor the Lieutenant Governor was going to the Council-chamber, I went there, his Honor looking out of the door deſired the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to hear him ſpeak; he deſired them to go home and he would enquire into the affair in the morning, and that the law ſhould take its courſe, and ſaid, I will live and die by the law. A gentleman deſired his Honor to order the ſoldiers to their barracks, he anſwered it was not in his power, and that he had no command over the troops and that it lay with Col. Dalrymple and not with him, but that he would ſend for him, which after ſome time he did; upon that a gentleman deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Honor to look out of the window facing the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, to ſee the poſition the ſoldiers were in, <hi>ready to fire on the inhabitants, which he did after a good deal of perſwaſion,</hi> and called for Col. Carr and deſired him to order the troops to their barracks in the ſame order they were in; accordingly they were ordered to ſhoulder their guns, and were marched off by ſome officers, and further ſaith not.</p>

               <p>I William Wyat of Salem, coaſter, teſtify and ſay, that laſt Monday evening, being the fifth day of March current, I was in Boſton, down at Treat's wharf, where my veſſel was lying, and hearing the bells ring ſuppoſed there was a fire in the town, whereupon I haſtened up to the town-houſe, on the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:011580_0078_0F8745F04D6E6290"/>
ſouth ſide of it, where I ſaw an officer of the army lead out of the guard-houſe there ſeven or eight ſoldiers of the army, and lead them down, in ſeeming haſte, to the cuſtom-houſe on the north ſide of kingſtreet, where I followed them, and when the officer had got there with the men, he bid them face about. I ſtood juſt below them on the left wing, and <hi>the ſaid officer or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his men to load,</hi> which they did accordingly, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſpatch, then they remained about ſix minutes, with their firelocks reſted and bayonets fixed, but not ſtanding in exact order. I obſerved <hi>a conſiderable number of young lads, and here and there a man amongſt them, about the middle of the ſtreet,</hi> facing the ſoldiers, but not within ten or twelve feet diſtance from them; I obſerved ſome of them, viz. the lads, &amp;c. had ſticks in their hands, laughing, ſhouting, huzzaing, and crying fire; but could not obſerve that any of them threw any thing at the ſoldiers, or threatened any of them. Then the <hi>ſaid officer</hi> retired from before the ſoldiers and ſteping behind them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the right wing, <hi>bid the ſoldiers fire</hi>; they not firing, he preſently again bid' em fire; they not yet firing, <hi>he ſtamp'd and ſaid, damn your bloods, fire, be the conſequence what it will</hi>; then the ſecond man on the left wing fired oft his gun, then, after a very ſhort pauſe, they fired one after another as quick as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, beginning on the right wing; the laſt man's gun on the left wing flaſh'd in the pan, then he prim'd again, and the people being withdrawn from before the ſoldiers, moſt of them further down the ſtreet, <hi>he turn'd his gun toward them and fired upon them.</hi> Immediately after the principal firing, I ſaw three of the people fall down in the ſtreet, preſently after the laſt gun was fired off, the ſaid officer, who had commanded the ſoldiers (as above) to fire, ſprung before them, waving his ſword or ſtick, ſaid, Damn ye, raſcals, what did ye fire for, and ſtruck up the gun of one of the ſoldiers who was loading again, whereupon they ſeemed confounded and fired no more. I then went up behind them to the right wing, where one of the people was lying, to ſee whether he was dead, where there were four or five people about him, one of them ſaying he was dead; whereupon one of the ſoldiers ſaid damn his blood he is dead, if he ever ſprawl again I will be damned for him.— And I remember as <hi>the ſaid officer</hi> was going down with the ſoldiers towards the Cuſtom-Houſe, a gentleman ſpoke to him and ſaid <hi>Capt. Preſton,</hi> for God's ſake keep your men in order and mind what you are about. And further I ſay not.</p>

There being a light in the lower room, and the door being upon the jarr, I ſaw it was the tall man that clapp'd me on the ſhoulder; then the young man <hi>Hammond Green</hi> let me out of the door, there being <hi>two or three people in the entry,</hi> when I got out of the houſe, I ſaw a number of people in the ſtreets. And I ran home as faſt as I could, and ſet up all night in my maſter's kitchen. And further ſay, that <hi>my maſter licked me the next night for telling Mrs. Waldren about his firing out of the Cuſtom houſe. And for fear that I ſhould be licked again,</hi> I did deny all that I ſaid before Juſtice <hi>Quincy,</hi> which I am very ſorry for. And further I ſay not.</p>

               <p>I DIMOND Morton, of lawful age, teſtify and ſay, that on Monday night the 5th inſtant, between the hours of nine and ten I heard the cry of Fire by my houſe. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately I ran out towards the town houſe; when I got between the Old-South Meeting and the Old-Brick Meeting, I met ſome people, they told me there was no fire, but people ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:011580_0085_0F8745F7A6552BE0"/>
in Kingſtreet; immediately I left them and came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the town-houſe, when I ſaw a number of people go round the Brazen-head corner, ſome crying they are this way, and I run in amongſt them, and came down before the cuſtom houſe, and there I ſaw a centinel walking backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards before the door. Soon after I ſaw the centinel retreat back upon the ſtone of the cuſtom houſe door, waving his bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onet breaſt high all the way. When he got on the ſtone he drew his cartridge to load his gun; whilſt he was loading his gun, I ſaw Thomas Greenwood a waiter to the commiſſioners run out from the people where I was, and run behind the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel, and knock at the door of the cuſtoms, and was ſoon let in: By that time the centinel had his gun loaded. Then the people cry'd, you dare not fire; and others ſaid, fire and be damn'd; then the boys gave two or three cheers. Upon that I ſaw <hi>Capt. Preſton marching and leading down from the main guard eight or ten ſoldiers, with their bayonets fix'd, ſwinging their guns.</hi> When they paſſed me, I followed them down to the cuſtom houſe. In about two minutes, Capt.

When I found there were three dead, and a number of others wounded, in about ten or fifteen minutes afterwards, I ſaw the ſoldiers march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the main guard—the ſnow being at that time near a foot deep—And I further ſay, that I did not ſee <hi>any inſult offered to the centinel from the inhabitants; and at the time the guns were fired, there were not above ſixty or ſeventy perſons ſtanding before the cuſtom houſe door.</hi>—And further I ſay not.</p>

the clock, he heard a bell ringing at the ſouth part of the town, which cauſed him to leave his ſhop to make enquiry.— Soon after, he heard that the ſoldiers had roſe upon the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; that when he had got as far as Faneuil Hall, ſeeing a number of gentlemen ſtanding together, the deponent made up to them, and aſked them what the diſturbance was; they anſwered him that two young men had been abuſed by the ſoldiers—but that the ſoldiers had now returned to their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks—he then proceeded with a number of others up royal exchange lane: at the head of the lane ſome of the perſons with him cry'd out here is a ſoldier and huzza'd; immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſoldier who was centry near to the box before the cuſtom houſe, repaired to the <hi>cuſtom houſe door</hi>; at which, with the knocker the ſoldier gave three very hard ſtrokes; upon which <hi>ſome perſon within ſide opened the door and ſpoke to him remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſhort, and then ſhut it again.</hi>—The ſoldier then directly loaded his gun, knocking the breech twice hard upon the ſtone ſteps: at the ſame time ſeven ſoldiers (as the deponent judges) with a commanding officer came and cry'd clear the way as he came along: then forming them into a half circle, ordered them to load: the deponent then made up as he could to the officer, and ſaid for God's ſake don't fire upon the people, he made him no anſwer: then turning to the inhabitants he the deponent expreſſed himſelf in the following manner; for God's ſake don't trouble theſe men for they are upon duty and will fire: turning about to the ſoldiers he ſaw them making up to the inhabitants with their bayonets fixed (aboat ten feet off) directing them to ſtand off, attempting to drive them away with their bayonets: then he withdrew himſelf to the other ſide of the way, where ſeeing a man attempt to throw a club, he beg'd that he would not; adding that if he did the ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would fire, and he did not: the deponent then ſtanding by Warden and Vernon's ſhop on the ſouth ſide of King-ſtreet with his back to the ſoldiers; immediately after heard the word <hi>preſent</hi>; at which word he ſtooped down.—A little ſpace of time enſued, and then he heard the words, <hi>damn you, fire;</hi> the ſound of which words ſeemed to proceed from the loſt of all the ſoldiers, and very near to the centry box; upon <hi>this order</hi> he judged two guns were diſcharged, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately three more, and then two more; one of the two laſt guns went about five or ſix inches over the deponent's back: after which he ſtood up, and another gun was diſcharged which wounded one Robert Patterſon in the arm, and the blood was ſprinkled upon the deponent's hand and waiſtcoat: after the firing the deponent ſaw four perſons drop: then

looking towards the ſoldiers the deponent ſaw them making <hi>towards the inhabitants with their fixed bayonents</hi>; upon which he retired down Quaker-lane, and went round into the main ſtreet homewards where he met a number of people going up royal exchange lane—from thence he retired home.</p>

               <p>I John Wilſon of lawful age teſtify, that on monday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 5th current, I was at Mr. Burdett's at the head of long-lane, and heard the bells ring and fire cried, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon went in company with others to king-ſtreet, and ſaw no diſturbance there, hearing the bells ſtill ringing, I aſked what was the matter? The people ſaid the ſoldiers had inſulted the inhabitants, on which I went to Cornhill, where the buſtle had been, and found no ſoldiers there. Then I came down King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet oppoſite the cuſtom-houſe, and ſaw a man with a light colour'd ſurtout coming from the main guard go up to the centry, and lay his hand on his ſhoulder and ſpeak ſome words to the centry, and then <hi>enter the cuſtom-houſe door.</hi> On this the centry grounded the breech of his gun, took out a cartridge, primed and loaded, and ſhoulder'd his firelock. After this I drew back oppoſite Mr. Stone's, &amp; in a few minutes ſaw a party of ſoldiers headed by <hi>an officer</hi> coming down from the main guard, crying to the inhabitants, <hi>Damn you, make way you boogers!</hi> I not moving from my place was ſtruck by one of them on the hip with the butt of his muſquet, which bruiſed me ſo much that it was next day very ſore, and much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured. <hi>The officer</hi> ſeeing the ſoldier ſtrike me <hi>ſaid to the ſoldier in an angry manner why don't you prick the boogers?</hi> The party drew up before the cuſtom-houſe door, and ranged to the weſt corner in a half circle, and charged their pieces breaſt high. Some ſmall boys coming up made a noiſe to the ſoldiers, on which <hi>the officer ſaid to them why don't you fire? Damn you fire!</hi> They hereupon fired and two men fell dead

in my ſight. I then left the place, and went over the ſtreet and aſſiſted Patterſon the wounded man in getting home. The deponent further ſaith, that when he got into kingſtreet he ſaw nobody but the centry walking backwards and forwards by the cuſtom-houſe, and then went to Cornhill as above; and at the time of firing he verily believes there were <hi>not above fifty perſons in the ſtreet near the cuſtom-houſe, the ſnow being at that time near a foot deep,</hi> and further I ſay not.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL Drowne of Boſton, of lawful age, teſtifieth and ſaith, that about nine of the clock of the evening of the fifth day of March current, ſtanding at his own door in Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, ſaw about 14 or 15 ſoldiers of the 29th regiment, who came from Murray's barrack, ſome of whom were armed with <hi>naked cutlaſſes, ſwords or bayonets, others with clubs, fire ſhovels or tongs, and came upon the inhabitants of the town, then ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or walking in Cornhill, and abuſed ſome and violently aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed others as they met them,</hi> moſt of whom were <hi>without ſo much as a ſtick in their hands to defend themſelves,</hi> as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent very clearly could diſcern, it being moon-light, and himſelf being one of the aſſaulted perſons—All or moſt of the ſaid ſoldiers he ſaw go by the way of Cornhill, Crooked-lane and Royal-exchange-lane into Kingſtreet, and there followed them, and ſoon diſcovered them to be <hi>quarrelling and fighting with the people</hi> whom they ſaw there, which the deponent thinks were not more than <hi>a dozen,</hi> when the ſoldiers came there firſt, armed as aforeſaid. <hi>Of thoſe dozen people, the moſt of them were gentlemen, ſtanding together a little below the town-houſe upon the exchange.</hi> At the appearance of thoſe ſoldiers ſo arm'd, the moſt of the twelve perſons <hi>went off,</hi> ſome of them being firſt <hi>aſſaulted</hi>—After which the ſaid ſoldiers were obſerv'd by the deponent, to go towards the main-guard, from whence were at the ſame time iſſuing and coming into kingſtreet five ſoldiers of ſaid guard and a corporal arm'd with <hi>firelocks,</hi> who call'd out to the fore-mention'd ſoldiers arm'd with cutlaſſes, &amp;c. and ſaid to them go away, on which they diſpers'd and went out of kingſtreet, ſome one way and ſome another—by this time were collected together in kingſtreet <hi>about two hundred people,</hi> and then the deponent ſtood upon the ſteps of the exchange tavern, being the next houſe to the cuſtom-houſe; and ſoon after ſaw <hi>Capt. Preſton, whom he well knew,</hi> with a number of ſoldiers arm'd with <hi>firelocks</hi> drawn up near the weſt corner of the cuſtom-houſe; and <hi>at that inſtant</hi> the deponent thinks ſo great a part of the people were diſpers'd at the ſight of the armed ſoldiers, as that <hi>not more than twenty or thirty remained in kingſtreet</hi>;<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Mr. Drowne ſays there were collected together in King-ſtreet about two hundred perſons, and that at the ſight of the armed Soldiers, they ſo far diſperſed, as that not more than twenty or thirty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in King ſtreet.</p>
                     <p>This Circumſtance accounts for the diverſity in ſome of the depoſitions, with regard to the number of perſons in King ſtreet about that time: ſuch Depoſitions probably referring to different moments.—Moments, becauſe the whole diſturbance in King-ſtreet, from its beginning to the firing, continued but a ſhort ſpace of time.</p>

remain being moſtly ſailors and other perſons meanly dreſt, call'd out to the arm'd ſoldiers and dared them to fire, upon which the deponent heard <hi>Capt.

Upon which they <hi>fired</hi> irregularly, pointing their guns variouſly in a part of a circle as they ſtood: during the time of the ſoldiers firing, <hi>the deponent ſaw the flaſhes of two guns fired from the cuſtom-houſe, one of which was out of a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the chamber weſtward of the balcony, and the other from the balcony, the gun which he clearly diſcerned being pointed thro' the balliſters, and the perſon who held the gun in a ſtooping poſture, withdraw himſelf into the houſe, having a handkerchief or ſome kind of cloth over his face.</hi> After this the deponent aſſiſted in carrying off the dead and wounded, as ſoon as the ſoldiers would permit the people ſo to do, for at firſt they were cruel enough to obſtruct the carrying them off.</p>

               <p>I ROBERT Goddard, of lawful age, teſtify and declare, that on Monday evening the 5th inſtant, between the hours of 9 &amp; 10 o'clock, being at my houſe at Wheeler's point, I heard the cry of <hi>Fire.</hi> I ran out and came thro' Long Lane into Kingſtreet, right up to the north-weſt ſide of the Town-houſe; when I got there, I ſaw a number of gentlemen ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and talking, and heard them ſay, that there was a man ſtab'd through the arm, and that it was very hard that the people could not paſs the ſtreets without being ſtabb'd. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after, I heard ſome people cry out for aſſiſtance. I then went down into Kingſtreet, and in going down, overtook an officer (as I tho't) with 8 or 9 ſoldiers with bayonets
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011580_0095_0F87460247B9A170"/>
charged breaſt-high, the <hi>officer holding a naked cutlaſs in his hand, ſwinging and calling, ſtand out of the way, and the ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers curſing and damning, and puſhing their bayonets</hi> to clear the way. They went down to the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> and placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves juſt above the <hi>centinel box,</hi> the officer then ordered the ſoldiers to place themſelves, which they did in a half circle; with that the boys came up near to the ſoldiers (ſtanding as before). The officer then ſaid, Boys go off, leſt their be ſome murder done; with that the boys removed back a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance throwing ſnow-balls, the ſoldiers <hi>puſhing them with their bayonets, ſaying, damn you, ſtand off</hi>; with that the boys went forward again, and a man with a naked cutlaſs in his hand, who appear'd to be the commanding officer (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) gave the word <hi>Fire,</hi> immediately a gun going off upon the left of me, I ſaw a man like a ſailor go up to the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſtrike him upon the left arm: Immediately he the ſaid <hi>officer ſaid,</hi> think I'll be uſed in this manner, <hi>Damn you, Fire, which they did,</hi> one after another. After they had all fired, <hi>he ordered them to prime and load again</hi>; after that he ordered his men in the middle of the ſtreet, <hi>and told them to clear their way with their bayonets breaſt high</hi>; with that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round, I ſaw four men lay dead on the ſnow, <hi>the ſnow being at that time near a foot deep.</hi> Then I went and help'd the molatto man who was ſhot, into Mr. Stone's houſe. After we got him in there, I ſaw him give one gaſp. I then open'd his breaſt, and ſaw two holes, one in each breaſt, where the Balls had enter'd. After that went to the door, and look'd, and ſaw the ſoldiers ſtanding in the middle of the ſtreet, and ſaw two gentlemen talking with the officers and ſoldiers. Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after went to ſee the molatto again; and return'd back into the ſtreet, <hi>ſaw all the ſoldiers at the main guard houſe out, with their bayonets charged breaſt high</hi>; with that going home thro' quaker-lane into long-lane, about the middle of the lane, ſaw two ſoldiers, <hi>who told me to ſtand out of the way or elſe they would ſtabb me.</hi> I immediately got out of the way, and made the beſt of my way home. And further ſay, that the grand jury deſired me to go and ſee whether I ſhould know the officer again; one of them going with me, I went up, and when I came to the goal I ſaw ſeveral people in the room with him. The gentleman of the grand jury (who went up with me) aſked me which was the man, I told him that that gentleman (pointing to Capt. <hi>Preſton</hi>) looked very much like the man, and I verily believed he was the man that order'd the ſoldiers to <hi>Fire.</hi> Dont you ſay ſo, ſays he; yes ſir, ſaid I, you look very much like the man. If you ſay
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:011580_0096_0F87460510EBE0F0"/>
ſo, ſaid he, clapping his hands, I am ruined and undone. And further ſay, <hi>that at the time of firing, there was but about fifty or ſixty perſons, moſtly boys, in Kingſtreet.</hi>

               <p>I JOHN Hickling being of lawful age, teſtify and ſay, that on monday the 5th day of March 1770, returning from New Boſton in the evening between the hours of nine and ten o'clock, I heard a noiſe and the cry of fire in King-ſtreet, and inquiring the cauſe was informed <hi>the ſoldiers</hi> intended to <hi>fire on the inhabitants,</hi> immediately proceeding to the place I ſaw eight or nine ſoldiers with fixed bayonets charged breaſt high ſtanding in a circular manner at the corner of the cuſtom houſe, and an officer ſtanding before them at the end of the bayonets between the ſoldiers and the inhabitants. <hi>I ſaw but a few ſcattering people ſuppoſed to be about thirty in the ſtreet before them at that time</hi> and therefore was at a loſs for the reaſon of ſuch an appearance; going up to the officer I found a young man named Bliſs talking with him, I inquired his name of Bliſs who informed me that it was <hi>Preſton.</hi> At that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Mr. Richard Palmes came up and aſked the officer if he intended to fire upon the people? he anſwered by no means; Palmes aſked if the guns were loaded? Preſton anſwered in the affirmative. Palmes further aſked, with powder and ball? <hi>Preſton anſwered they were. The ſoldiers</hi> during this conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation aſſumed different poſtures <hi>ſhoving their bayonets frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the people,</hi> one in particular <hi>puſhing againſt my ſide ſwore he would run me thro',</hi> I laid hold of his bayonet and told him that no body was going to meddle with them. Not more than ten ſeconds after this, I ſaw ſomething white reſembling a piece of ſnow or ice fall among the ſoldiers, which knock'd the end of a firelock to the ground. <hi>At that inſtant the word fire was given,</hi> but by whom I know not; but concluded it did not come from the officer aforeſaid, as I was within a yard of him and muſt have heard him had he ſpoke it, <hi>but am ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſaid Preſton did not forbid them to fire,</hi> I inſtantly leap'd within the ſoldier's bayonet as I heard him cock his gun, which that moment went off between Mr. Palmes and myſelf,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:011580_0097_0F8746051E3959B8"/>
I thinking there was nothing but powder fired ſtood ſtill, till upon the other ſide of Mr. Palmes and cloſe to him, <hi>I ſaw ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gun fired,</hi> and the man ſince called Attucks fall. I then withdrew about two or three yards, &amp; turning ſaw Mr. Palmes upon his knee, and the ſoldiers puſhing at him with their bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onets. During this the reſt of the guns were fired, one after another when I ſaw two more fall, I ran to one and ſeeing the blood guſh out of his head tho' juſt expiring, I felt for the wound and found a hole as big as my hand. This I have ſince learned was Mr. Gray. I then went to Attucks and found him gaſping, pulled his head out of the gutter and left him; I returning to the ſoldiers and aſked them what they thought of themſelves and whether they did not deſerve to be cut to pieces, to lay men wallowing in their blood in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>they anſwered God damn them, they ſhould have ſtood out of our way.</hi> The ſoldiers were then loading their muſkets and told me upon my peril not to come any nearer to them. <hi>I further declare that I heard no other affront given them than the huzzaing and whiſtling of boys in the ſtreet.</hi>

               <p>I Thomas Jackſon jun'r. do teſtify and declare that on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the 5th inſtant in the evening, being in company, I heard, (as near as I can recollect) between nine and ten o'clock, a drum beat to arms, I immediately told the gentleman (with whom I was then engaged) I imagin'd there was ſome diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance between the inhabitants and the ſoldiery, he replied, foh, I believe it is nothing but boys, I told him I was afraid there was ſomething more in it than that, and deſired him (as the drum approached us) to look out of the window to ſee whether they were ſoldiers, or not. He immediately opened the window, and told me they were ſoldiers. Upon this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, I immediately put on my hat and went out. I had not gone many paces before I met a man, of whom I enquired the reaſon of the drum beating. He told me there were ſix men killed in kingſtreet by the military: I immediately haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on in my way to kingſtreet, and met another perſon by Concert-hall, of whom I likewiſe enquired as aforeſaid; his anſwer to me correſponded with the other. When I got into kingſtreet, I found a great number of people there aſſembled, and intended going into the cuſtom-houſe, to find out the particulars of the affair. Upon my knocking at the cuſtom-houſe door with the knocker, Mr. Hammond Green (who was then looking out of the window) aſk'd me Who was there? I called him by name, and told him I wanted to come into the cuſtom-houſe. <hi>He told me he would not let me, nor even his father</hi> (and I think he ſaid) <hi>nor one of the commiſſioners, into the houſe, for he had orders for ſo doing,</hi> or to that effect. I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately quitted the door and ſtay'd ſome time at the bottom, and then at the head of the town-houſe, where I met Capt. John Riordan. While we were converſing, a party of the 29th regiment came down Queenſtreet and joined the regiment then at the town-houſe. Soon after that, I aſked Capt. Rior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan if he would ſpend an hour at the coffee-houſe, he compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and we immediately went, after ſpending ſome time there, I went home, and in going home, I found the inhabitants were gone off and the ſoldiers gone from the town-houſe. It was ſome time before I came into kingſtreet, that the guns were
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:011580_0100_0F874607CBBABB38"/>
fired, and when I knock'd at the cuſtom-houſe door, all the perſons I ſaw at the window over the centry box at the cuſtom houſe (which window was then open'd) was Mr. Hammond Green and ſome women.</p>

               <p>I Edward Crafts, of lawful age, teſtify and ſay, that on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day evening the fifth inſtant, between 11 and 12 o'clock, Mr. Joſeph Ayers met me at my gate, and I aſked him where he was going. He anſwered to call Mr. Thomas Theodore Bliſs to attend at the council-chamber, to give evidence of the captain's giving the ſoldiers orders to fire on the inhabitants. On leaving Mr. Bliſs's door, there paſſed by us two corporals with about twenty ſoldiers with muſquets and fixed bayonets, and on their obſerving our moving towards the town-houſe, the ſoldiers halted, and ſurrounded us, ſaying we <hi>were a pack of damn'd raſcals, and for three coppers they would blow our brains out. One of the corporals (viz. Euſtice) gave orders for one half the ſoldiers to cock, and the reſt to make ready.</hi> On which we told them we had nothing to ſay to them, but were on other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. <hi>The corporal, Euſtice, ſtruck Mr. Haldan, then in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and turning to me aimed a blow at my head with his firelock, which I took upon my arm, and then with all his might he made a paſs at me with his fixed bayonet, with full intent to take my life, as I thought. This I alſo parried with my naked hand. Then a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier ſtep'd out from among the reſt and preſented his muſquet to my breaſt, and ſix or ſeven more at about</hi> 8 <hi>or</hi> 10 <hi>feet diſtance alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.</hi> Upon this I called corporal McCan, who came to me with a drawn ſword or cutlaſs in his hand and puſhed the gun from my breaſt, ſaying, this is Mr. Crafts, and if any of you offers to touch him again I will blow your brains out. Corporal Euſtice anſwered and ſaid, he is as damn'd a raſcal as any of
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:011580_0104_0F87460A5BA0C100"/>
them. The next evening about duſk coming by Rowe's bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rack I ſaw corporal McCan who ſaved my life. He aſked me if my arm was broke? I anſwered no. He ſaid <hi>the gun with which Euſtice ſtruck me was broke to pieces. And continued, you would have been in heaven or hell in an inſtant if you had not called me by name: One man in particular would have ſhot you, ſeven more preſented at you!</hi> He alſo ſaid, <hi>his orders were, when the party came from the guard-houſe by the fortification, if any perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aſſaulted them, to fire upon them, every man being loaded with a brace of balls.

               <p>I Benjamin Church, jun. of lawful age, teſtify and ſay, that being requeſted by Mr. Robert Pierpont the Coroner, to aſſiſt in examining the body of Criſpus Attucks, who was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be murdered by the ſoldiers on Monday evening the 5th inſtant, I found two wounds in the region of the Thorax, the one on the right ſide which entered thro' the ſecond true Rib within an inch and an half of the Sternum, dividing the Rib and ſeperating the cartilaginous extremity from the Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, the ball paſſed obliquely downward thro' the Diaphragm and entering thro' the large Lobe of the Liver and the Gall-Bladder, ſtill keeping its oblique direction, divided the Aorta Deſcendens juſt above its diviſion into the Iliacs, from thence it made its exit on the left ſide of the Spine. This wound I apprehended was the immediate cauſe of his death. The other ball entered the fourth of the falſe Ribs, about five inches from the Linea Alba, and deſcending obliquely paſſed through the ſecond falſe Rib, at the diſtance of about eight inches from the Linea Alba; from the oblique direction of the wounds, I apprehend the gun muſt have been diſcharged from ſome ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and further the deponent ſaith not.</p>

                  <hi>I wiſh I could get into the Cuſtom Houſe, I would make the money circulate amongſt us,</hi> after that I went up to the cuſtom-houſe door and ſaw 2 or 3 ſnow balls fall on the flat ſtones near the ſteps of the door; I knock'd and Mr. Hammond Green came to the door, while I was ſpeaking to the centry, who ſtood upon the ſteps, I told him not to let any body come into the door and no perſon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to come in; the ſaid Green aſk'd who was there, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd 'tis Thomas, let me in Hammond, when I got in, the ſaid Green ſaid to me if I wanted to ſee any thing, go up ſtairs, I went into the back room and got the key of the little draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room, being the lower weſt corner chamber, and went up ſtairs, and Elizabeth Avery, Mary Rogers and Ann Green followed me into the room; we all looked thro' the glaſs, I ſaw ſome perſons ſtanding by the centry-box ſtriking with ſticks, <hi>but did not ſee them hit any body, tho' a number of perſons were cloſe by them</hi>; I told the women above mentioned that I would not ſtay, for I was afraid that the houſe would be pull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down, there being about <hi>forty or fifty perſons conſiſting of men and boys; I ſaw no perſon throw any ſtones or attempt to break even a ſquare of glaſs, or get into the houſe (the next morning I found there was not a pane of glaſs broke in the ſaid houſe.)</hi> Afterwards, I went down ſtairs and met Hammond Green in the middle room; he aſked me where I was going, I told him, I was going out, upon which I went into the kitchen and took my hat and went into the yard, got upon the wood pile and went to the fence; John Green being by the gate aſked me to open the gate and let him in, I told him I would not open the gate for any body, one perſon paſſing by, ſaid to me, heave over ſome ſhalales, I jump'd off the fence into royal exchange lane, went down the lane with John Green, and went round by the poſt-office to the main-guard; I told one of the ſoldiers if they did not go

down to the centry at the Cuſtom-houſe, <note n="‡" place="bottom">It ſeems very difficult, according to Greenwood's account, to form even a conjecture of the reaſon of his fears, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed for the centry, when in the ſame breath he declares that he had not ſeen any perſon inſult him.—But probably the true motives of his application to the main-guard were not of a nature to be made public.</note>

I left Mr. Burch's houſe and went to the barracks at Wheelwright's Wharf, and ſtaid there all night; <hi>I heard ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſoldiers ſay they wiſh'd they were let out, for if they were, there ſhould not be many people alive in the morning</hi>; the whole of the 14th regiment being under arms, and the piquet guard went to the main guard houſe about 12 o'clock that night.</p>
