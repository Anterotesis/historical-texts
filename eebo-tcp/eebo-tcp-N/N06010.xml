            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And theſe I have Quoted, not becauſe they were eaſier Confuted than others; but becauſe to keep a good Conſcience in the Oppoſing of theſe ſaid Articles, has proved a more direct Leading into Perſecution: As a alſo in the Proving of the ſaid Articles to be Contrary to Scripture and againſt plain Scripture proves your Confeſſion to be Erroneous, or an Image made to the Beaſt, ſee, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 14, and as by the following <hi>Treatiſe</hi> will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and your Eſtabliſhed Miniſters to be Antichriſtian Miniſters, and your Churches Conſequently Antichriſtian Churches, or Synagogues of Satan, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.9.

in ſaid <hi>Rev.</hi> By Worſhipping the Beaſt, and his Image. By the Beaſt, is to be underſtood the worldly Powers; and by his Image, that form of Worſhip they Eſtabliſh, and Defend.</p>
                  <p>And now let us take a View of the Conduct of our Anceſtors, briefly touching the Sufferings of the Anabaptiſts, and Quakers: as alſo the Evils that befel <hi>New-England</hi> afterwards, as they have left them on Record in the Book of their Confeſſion, Pag. 94 in two Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Queſtion 1ſt. <hi>What are the Evils that have provoked the LORD to bring His Judgments on</hi> New-England?</p>
                  <p>As for the Sufferings of the Anabaptiſts it was for Separating from the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches in the Country, under a ſcruple of Baptiſm; accounting their Baptiſm no Baptiſm, and the Baptizing Infants Unlawful, this Occaſioned the Civil Magiſtrates to put forth their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by Fining, Whipping and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning the ſaid Anabaptiſts, as may be ſeen more at Large in <hi>Daniel Neals

Hiſtory of New-England.</hi> Vol. 1. Page 278, to 291.</p>
                  <p>Soon after the Anabaptiſts, came the Quakers into <hi>Boſton</hi> Colony, and were proceeded againſt in like Manner, by Fining, Impriſoning, and Whipping: but theſe Puniſhments proving Ineffectual to keep them out of their Government, they proceeded to make many Laws, annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many, and grievous Puniſhments, as may be ſeen at Large in <hi>Biſhops Hiſtory of New-England.</hi> Judged alſo (ſaid <hi>Neals</hi> Hiſtory, Vol. 1 pag. 291. to laſt) till it came to cutting off Ears, and Baniſhment, upon pain of Death, and putting to Death; ſo that by ſaid Quakers was Fulfilled that in Rev. 12.11. <hi>And they Overcame him by the Blood of the LAMB, and by the Word of their Teſtimony, and they loved not their Lives unto the Death.</hi> So that they have undeniably purchaſed to themſelves the title of worthy Martyrs, and they that Perſecuted them, ſhewed no better Spirit than they that Perſecuted, and put the Martyrs to Death in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign, as they that Read the Hiſtory of both may ſee.</p>

Difference in Perſwaſions, and ſo to Defend differing Principles alters nothing. There is but two Spirits Manifeſt in the World, that is the Spirit of GOD, and the Spirit of the Devil, and theſe were always at Variance: <hi>Cain</hi> Perſecuted his Brother <hi>Abel; Iſhmael</hi> Perſecuted <hi>Iſaac;</hi> the <hi>Egyptians, Iſrael;</hi> backſlidden <hi>Iſrael</hi> the Prophets: Matth. 23.37. <hi>O Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, Jeruſalem, Thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them which are ſent unto thee, &amp;c.

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007622_0020_102BAB7F46DBFB40"/>
and to the Teſtimony, are in Iſa. 8 20, The Words in the Verſe are,</hi> To the Law, and to the Teſtimony, if they Speak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no Light in them.</p>
                  <p>Thus far I have Quoted out of each Confeſſion of Faith, and they both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us to the holy Scriptures, and not barely to take upon truſt from their Word; and I have compared both ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions together, and they are both one, being Chapter for Chapter, Paragraph for Paragraph, Word for Word, (miſtakes in Printing excepted.) But in as much as in <hi>Boſton</hi> Confeſſion, they have not brought one Text to prove one Article, throughout their whole Confeſſion. I have therefore made uſe of ſome Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Proof's out of <hi>Connecticut</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to Confute both, they being both one, as is ſaid Word, for Word; and they are Approved, and Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the General Courts in each Colony.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007622_0021_102BAB6006D2CBB0"/>
Governments have taken them under their Protection to Defend them, that both Elders, and Meſſengers, and ſaid General Courts, and civil Governments as they own and defend them, they all ſtand equally charged with an Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Now let us take their Advice as was before Quoted; as alſo their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in ſaid Preface, Page 8. <hi>And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the ſame to your diligent Peruſal that you be Eſtabliſhed in the Truth, and your Faith reſt upon it's proper Baſes, the Word of GOD. Follow the example of the Noble Bereans, Search the Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 17, 11. <hi>Theſe were more Noble than thoſe in Theſſalonica, in that they received the Word with all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of Mind, and ſearched the Scriptures daily whether thoſe things were ſo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And now under the Conſideration, that I have Written to all the Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this Colony of <hi>Connecticut;</hi> and have Journeyed from County, to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and delivered in Writing to one of the Elders in each County, to be delivered to their ſeveral Aſſociations, as followeth.</p>

For as much as I have peruſed ſaid Confeſſion, and to me it appears, that there are many dangerous, and hurtful Principles, ſome of which I have Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and preſented before ſaid Elders, to be delivered to their ſeveral Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations deſiring their further peruſal, and if they appear not to have Scripture Foundation, that they would Rectify them, but they diſregarded my Requeſt.</p>
                  <p>I therefore went to the General Court, to deſire Them, under the Conſideration of the danger of being ſeated upon, and contending for unſound Principles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To put ſaid Elders forward, to Anſwer my Requeſt, which was as little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as the other. And this is now near <hi>thirty Years</hi> paſt; and each Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment goes on ſtill in approving and defending each Confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>And now GOD hath put it into my Heart, to reprove both Governments, by your own Confeſſions; by Rehearſing ſundry of your Articles, and proving them to contradict the Scriptures; and ſome to wreſt the Scriptures, and to teach another Doctrine than what was originally Given, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

But before I go any further, I think it not amiſs to give ſome Account of my own Life from my Infancy, and of GOD's Dealing towards me; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, Pſal. 66.16. <hi>Come and hear all ye that fear GOD, and I will tell you what He hath done for my Soul.</hi> That was his Experiences of GOD's Goodneſs towards him. And as to my ſelf, my Father lived about a Mile out of <hi>New-London</hi> Town; and my Mother was at home with only three little Children, I being the Youngeſt (about 10 Months old) ſhe with the other two were Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by a youth about 16 years of Age, who was afterwards Executed at <hi>Hartford;</hi> and I was found (as was ſaid) at my dead Mothers Breaſt.</p>
                  <p>And ſince in the courſe of my Life GOD hath preſerved me out of many eminent Dangers, when there was but a Hairs breadth between Me and Death, which I have a particular Remembrance of to this Day; and the moſt of them by Water. And I was brought up in the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> way till I was about thirty Years old, and had four or five Children, but Baptiſed none; for reading the Scriptures, and as my Age gave me
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:007622_0024_102BAB855780EC08"/>
underſtanding to conſider what I Read. It appeared to me by the Scriptures, that we muſt firſt Believe, before we were Baptiſed, and in our Baptiſm we muſt be Buried in Water. And now living to this Age in the neglect of Baptiſm, my Conſcience accuſed me, ſo that I read the Scriptures that I might be fully Informed what was for me to do. And the more I read them, I was confirmed in my firſt Belief, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly was Baptiſed by <hi>John Rogers,</hi> a Baptiſt Teacher.</p>
                  <p>And now as I had made a Profeſſion thus far, and going on in my Chriſtian Progreſs, I found no command in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the firſt day Sabbath; and therefore began to Work upon it, not thinking that the civil Authority would riſe up againſt me. For though I was Baptiſed by ſaid <hi>Rogers,</hi> and joined in Fellowſhip with that People that had ſuffered much for Conſcience ſake, by Whipping, Impriſoning and ſetting in the Stocks, and loſs of Goods, and particularly, for Working on the firſt Day of the Week; yet of late, they had not been Moleſted as at the firſt, though they Work't as freely, and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:007622_0025_102BAB65E5BFE508"/>
openly: but I was ſoon Preſented, and brought before the Authority, and Fined, and then they would let me alone till after three firſt Day and then ſend for me, and Fine me, for three Days together; and now as the Battle grew hotter GOD gave me more Courage, and I grew ſtronger, and ſtronger, that what was ſaid of Iſrael under the Oppreſſion of Pharaoh, and the Egyptians was very lively with me, Exod. 1, 12. <hi>But the more they Afflicted them the more they Multiplied, and Grew;</hi> as alſo that of the Houſe of Saul, and David, 2 Sam. 3, 1. <hi>Now there was long War between the Houſe of Saul, and the Houſe of David, but David waxed ſtronger, and ſtronger, and the Houſe of Saul weaker, and weaker;</hi> and ſo it has proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me, and the Authority, for the Conſolation that I injoyed, ſet me over the loſs of my Goods, and herein I could Witneſs with the Apoſtle, 2 Cor; 1, 5. <hi>For as the Sufferings of CHRIST Abound in us, ſo our Conſolation alſo A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth by CHRIST;</hi> for GOD gave me ſuch a chearful Spirit in this Warfare, that when I had not the Knowlege that the Grand-Jury man ſaw me at Work,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007622_0026_102BAB86DB99B838"/>
on ſaid Day, I would Inform againſt my ſelf before Witneſs, till they gave out, and let me Plow, and Cart, and do whatſoever I have occaſion to this Day, and to this my Brethren can Witneſs, according to their Faith, as ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 John 5, 4 <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is Born of GOD overcometh the World, and this is the Victory that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the World; even our Faith,</hi> and in this are we GOD's Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, Iſaiah 44, 8. <hi>Ye are even my Witneſſes.

And now we Call for your Witneſs, as in Chap. 43, 9. <hi>Let them bring forth their Witneſſes, that they may be Juſtified, or let them hear, and ſay it is Truth;</hi> or elſe be Convicted by the Prophet, Chap. 44, 9. <hi>They are their own Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, they ſee not nor know that they may be Aſhamed.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Anſwer,</p>
                     <p>Whereas you ſay, <hi>So by His Word in a poſitive, moral and perpetual Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, binding all Men, in all Ages, He hath particularly appointed one day in ſeven for a Sabbath to be kept Holy unto Him,</hi> &amp;c. This is making GOD's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of none Effect, which ſaith Expreſly, Exod. 20.9, 10. <hi>Six Days ſhalt thou Labour, and do all thy Work, but the ſeventh Day is the Sabbath of the LORD thy GOD, in it thou

ſhalt not do any Work,</hi> &amp;c. But you open a Door of Liberty for every Man to Chuſe which Day of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven he will keep for a Sabbath, and then ſet up your own Choice for the firſt Day of the Week, without the leaſt word in Scripture for it, and Require all Men to Conform to it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you ſay,—<hi>Which from the beginning of the World, to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of</hi> CHRIST was the laſt Day of the Week.</p>

                     <p>There is Evening and Morning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to all the ſix Days in which GOD Created all Things, Gen. 1. But to the ſeventh Day when GOD had finiſhed all His Works, there is no Evening nor Morning aſcribed to it, which ſhews it was not reckoned with the other ſix Days; and as the Scriptures inform us, Man was the laſt thing GOD Made, or His finiſhing Work: ſo that, that Mom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>t that GOD Breathed into his Noſtrils the Breath of Life, by which he became a living Soul, he immediately

entered into GOD's Reſt, or Sabbath, that had no Evening, or Morning aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to it, even a perpetual Reſt; it was no Reſt to Adam from any Work that he had done, for he had done no Work to Reſt from; but it was GOD's Reſt, or Sabbath, that GOD put Adam in poſſeſſion of, when he was firſt Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, even the Day he Bleſſed, and Sanctified, Chap. 2. ver. 3. <hi>And GOD Bleſſed the ſeventh Day, and Sanctified it, becauſe that in it He had Reſted from all His Work, which GOD Created and Made.</hi> And as to the length of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> that Adam continued in GOD's Reſt or Sabbath; the Scripture is ſilent, neither is it needful for us to know but to know this, that GOD Created Adam in a ſtate of Innocency, and ſet him in his own Reſt, and through his Diſobedience was turned out of it, to Eat his Bread by the Sweat of his Face; and we Read of no weekly, or ſeven Day Sabbath required of Man to be Kept, till in <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. When GOD firſt gave Iſrael Manna, then he ſet a part the ſeventh Day for a Sabbath, ſee ver. 26. <hi>Six Days ye ſhall gather it, but on the ſeventh Day which is the Sabbath,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:007622_0030_102BAB8BE3320E38"/>
in it there ſhall be none.</hi> And it is good Evidence to us, that they had not lived in the practice of keeping a ſeventh Day Sabbath, nor that they had any knowlege of it till now, by their Averſeneſs to it, as in Ver. 27. <hi>And it came to paſs that there went out ſome of the People on the ſeventh Day for to gather, and they found none.</hi> Ver. 28, 29. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, how long refuſe ye to keep my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and my Laws: See for that the Lord hath given you the Sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the ſixth Day, the Bread of two Days; abide ye every Man in his place, let no Man go out of his place on the ſeventh Day.</hi> And for a final Confirmation, let us take <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Teſtimony, Deut. 5.2, 3. <hi>The Lord our God made a Covenant with us in Horeb, the Lord made not this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with our Fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this Day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus it is ſufficiently Proved that GOD's Church had no ſix Days Labour, and ſeventh Day Sabbath given them to be obſerved, till it was given by
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:007622_0031_102BABC3B38894C8"/>
                        <hi>Moſes,</hi> which by Scripture Date was 2513 Years after the beginning of the World.</p>
                     <p>And as to your Scripture Proof, Exod. 20, 8, to 11. <hi>Remember the Sabbath-Day, to keep it Holy, ſix Days ſhalt thou La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and do all thy Work, but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou ſhalt not do any Work, Thou, nor thy Son, nor thy Daughter, thy Man-Servant, nor thy Maid-Servant, nor thy Cattle, nor thy Stranger that is within thy Gates, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the 16th Chap. we read only of their being forbidden to gather <hi>Manna</hi> on the ſeventh Day, or Sabbath; but now in this Text all manner of Labour is expreſly forbidden; and the Reaſon is given, in Ver, 11. <hi>For in ſix Days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea and all that in them is, and reſted the ſeventh Day, wherefore the Lord Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Sabbath Day and hallowed it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here we ſee <hi>Moſes</hi> in Eſtabliſhing the ſeventh Day Sabbath to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> puts them in mind how that in ſix Days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:007622_0032_102BAB8D64F00248"/>
Sea and all that in them is, and reſted the ſeventh Day; wherefore (ſaith he) the Lord Bleſſed the Sabbath Day and Hallowed it.</p>
                     <p>And in this Bleſſed and Sanctified Day of GOD's Reſt it was, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Happineſs conſiſted, ſo long as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in Innocency, but he for his Tranſgreſſion was turned out of it, to eat his Bread by the Sweat of his Face: and this Bleſſed Day of Pleaſure and Delight, was turned into a Curſed Day of Labour and Sorrow, not to <hi>Adam</hi> only, but to all his Poſterity deſcending by natural Generation. And in this ſtate of Labour and Sorrow it was that <hi>Iſrael</hi> underwent their Bondage in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now let us conſider the Reaſon given here for obſerving the Sabbath, with that in Deut. 5.15. <hi>And Remember that thou waſt a Servant in the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence, through a mighty Hand, and by a ſtretched out Arm; therefore the Lord thy God Commanded thee to keep the Sabbath Day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="unknown:007622_0033_102BABC6691019A8"/>
Thus we ſee the ſeventh Day Sabbath was Commanded to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> not only in Remembrance of the happy State that <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in whilſt in Innocency, before his Tranſgreſſion; but alſo in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their Servitude in Egypt, and of GOD's Delivering them by His Mighty Hand, and Stretched out Arm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in Exod. 31.12, 13. <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto Moſes ſaying, ſpeak thou unto the Children of Iſrael, ſaying, verily my Sabbaths ye ſhall keep, for it is a Sign between me, and you, throughout your Generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth Sanctify you.</hi> Alſo, Ezek. 20.12. <hi>Moreover alſo I gave them my Sabbaths to be a Sign between me, and them, that they might know that I am the</hi> LORD <hi>that Sanctify them.</hi> Here we may ſee, by comparing theſe Texts that <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt puts <hi>Iſrael</hi> in mind of the Day of GOD's Reſt from His Works of Creation, which He Bleſſed and Sanctified, which <hi>Adams</hi> Happineſs conſiſted in, ſo long as he continued in Innocency.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="36" facs="unknown:007622_0034_102BAB90B2594840"/>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Bondage in Egypt, and of GOD's Delivering them, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.—</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the LORD gave them the ſeventh Day Sabbath to keep as a Sign of GOD's bringing His Church and People into His ſeventh Day Reſt, or Sabbath again, which had no Evening, or Morning aſcribed to it; or into His everlaſting Reſt, which <hi>Adam</hi> for his Tranſgreſſion was diſpoſſeſſed of: and of this Reſt or Sabbath, all the Faithful were Witneſſes, from <hi>Adam</hi> till <hi>Moſes;</hi> as CHRIST Teſtifieth, John 8.56. <hi>Your Father Abraham Rejoiced to ſee my Day, and he ſaw it and was glad:</hi> That was through Faith he believed in the Promiſes as really as if he had ſeen them Fulfilled, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17, 18, 19. And this is the Sabbath or Reſt, that every Child of GOD has to Labour to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into; as ſaith the Apoſtle, Chap. 4.11. <hi>Let us Labour therefore to enter into that Reſt, leſt any Man Fail after the ſame example of unbelief:</hi> That is as <hi>Iſrael</hi> who through unbelief, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You ſay, and from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of CHRIST was changed into the firſt Day of the Week, and for Proof quote Acts 20.7. <hi>And upon the firſt day of the Week when the Diſciples came together to break Bread, Paul Preached unto them ready to depart on the Morrow, and continued his Speech until Midnight.</hi>

Now let us take your Advice, as in your Confeſſions; Chap. 1. 9 Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, you ſay; <hi>The infallible Rule of Interpretation of Scripture, is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it Self,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now in as much as there is no Pre-eminence given to the Day; but called the firſt Day of the Week, not Sabbath Day; and that their coming together was to break Bread: <hi>Paul Preached unto them,</hi> &amp;c. I ſee no further Interpretation of this text of Scripture, than that their coming toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to break Bread, was in a Chriſtian Fellowſhip of Love; except it might be a more general Thing at this Time, <hi>Paul</hi> being there, and ready to depart on the Morrow, and to this it Agrees with other texts of Scripture, as in Chap. 2. 42. <hi>And they continued Sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and in Fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers,</hi> ver. 46. <hi>And they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing Daily with one Accord in the Temple, and in breaking Bread from Houſe to Houſe, did eat their Meat with gladneſs, and ſingleneſs of Heart;</hi> as alſo Jude 12. <hi>Theſe are ſpots, in your feaſts

of Charity, when they Feaſt with You,</hi> &amp;c. So that from this text ot Scripture you have no proof of the Sabbath, being Changed from the ſeventh Day, to the firſt Day of the Week; in as much as there is not the Word Sabbath uſed, nor any thing leading thereunto, neither now, nor before this Time; and as to your other proof Gen. 2 2. <hi>And on the ſeventh Day</hi> GOD <hi>ended all His Work, which He had Made, and Reſted on the ſeventh Day, from all His Work, which He had Made,</hi> &amp;c. This Text only ſpeaks of GOD's Reſting on the ſeventh Day from all His Work, that is to ſay, from His Work of Creation; and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Proof for your firſt Days Sabbath; you alſo Quote, 1 Cor. 6.1, 2. <hi>Dare any of you having a Matter againſt another go to Law before the Unjuſt, and not before the Saints; do ye not know that the Saints ſhall Judge the World? and if the World ſhall be Judged by You, are ye unworthy to Judge the ſmalleſt Matters?</hi> &amp;c.

compar'd with ver. 6. <hi>But Brother goeth to Law with Brother, and that before the Unbelievers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, whereas you Quote, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1, 10. And ſay upon it, which in Scripture is called the Lord's-Day, and apply it to prove your firſt Day Sabbath. I deſire to know from what text of Scripture, you prove that the Title Lord's-Day is given to the firſt Day of the Week, more than any other Day; or that any particular Day of the Week is intended by it? Pſal. 74.16. We read, <hi>The Day is Thine, the Night alſo is Thine.</hi> Jer 5.2. Saith, <hi>And tho' they ſay the Lord liveth, ſurely they Sware falſely.</hi> Now they had Scripture enough to prove that the LORD lived, but they had not the Witneſs in themſelves; and therefore their Witneſs was not True. And for you to ſet up the firſt Day of the Week for a Sabbath; and then ſay which in Scripture is called the LORD's Day, without any Proof from the Text, or any other Place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is a falſe Aſſertion of your own; and wreſting the Scriptures to your own Deſtruction. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.

                     <p>I proceed to prove, that the word Day, in Scripture, is not always to be limited to any particular Day in the Week, but the preſent Time: As in Pſal. 95.7. <hi>To day if you will hear his voice, &amp;c.</hi> Ver. 8. <hi>Harden not your hearts, as in the provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and as in the day of temptation in the wilderneſs;</hi> compar'd with ver. 10. <hi>Forty years long was I grieved with this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Text informs us, that the Day here ſpoken of, contained the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Forty Years Travel in the Wilderneſs: Alſo Pſal. 118.22, 23, 24. <hi>The Stone which the Builders refuſed is become the head ſtone of the Corner; this is the LORD'S Doing, it is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous in our Eyes: This is the Day which the</hi> LORD <hi>hath made, we will rejoice, and be glad in it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here is the word Day uſed, to ſet forth GOD'S great Goodneſs to <hi>David,</hi> and to his Church, in deſtroying their Enemies, and eſtabliſhing him on the Throne of his Kingdom. A Day which cannot be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to one ſingle Day, or to any particular
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:007622_0041_102BABCFF0DA8010"/>
Day of the Week; but to that preſent Time wherein they enjoyed the Mercy there ſpoken of. As alſo 2 Cor. 6.2. <hi>For I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of ſalvation have I ſuccoured thee: Behold, now is the accepted time, behold now is the day of ſalvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee, the Text has no reference to any particular Day of the Week; but the preſent Time.</p>
                     <p>To conclude with the words of the Text, <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, &amp;c.</hi> is as much as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, I was in the Spirit, or Spiritualized in the day of the LORD'S Appearing to me, and requiring me to write the Propheſies of this Book; which to our acceptation may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, Time of the Lord's Appearing, compared with the fore cited Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſingle out only theſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, &amp;c.</hi> for the proof of your Firſt-Day Sabbath; and add to the Text, and ſay, <hi>Which in Scripture is called the Lord's-Day,</hi> without proof either from this Text, or any other Scripture, that the Firſt Day of the Week was ever ſo intitled.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="unknown:007622_0042_102BAB994B305970"/>
You alſo Quote <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.8.10, to prove ſaid Sabbath, and leave out the ninth Verſe, that ſays, <hi>Six days ſhalt thou Labour, and do all thy Work:</hi> For that would have been in right Oppoſition to your Firſt Day Sabbath. But your proof in the tenth Verſe, is, <hi>But the ſeventh day is the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Lord thy God; in it thou ſhalt not do any Work, thou, nor thy Son, nor thy Daughter, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus you bring the expreſs Command For the Seventh Day Sabbath, to prove your Firſt Day Sabbath; and in ſo doing break God's Commandment in a Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Senſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> You command Reſt on the Day that He commanded Labour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> You Labour on the Day that He commanded Reſt.</p>
                     <p>And herein you alſo go contrary to the command of the Angel of the Lord, and of Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.7.10. who both commanded the Diſciples to Labour, by Travelling on the Firſt Day of the Week, being the Day of Chriſt's Reſurrection. And for us to do the like, would be more Exemplary, than to command, and do contrary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="unknown:007622_0043_102BABD1F85F7908"/>
There remains more of your proofs that I have not ſpoken to; but they are ſo far from proving any Command for your Firſt Day Sabbath, that they inform us of no Example, Name, nor the leaſt Breath lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto. And the Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 4.15. <hi>Where no law is there is no tranſgreſſion,</hi> Alſo Chap. 5. 13. <hi>Sin is not imputed where there is no Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now <hi>Connecticut,</hi> I turn your own Words back upon your ſelves. Page 7, of your Preface you ſay, <hi>Believe in all divine Worſhip, it is not enough that this or that Act of Worſhip is not forbidden in the Word of God, if it be not Commanded, and you perform it, you may fear you will be found guilty, and expoſed to divine Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And alſo you of <hi>Boſton</hi> in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, page 4 ſay, <hi>To the Law, and to the Teſtimony, we do wholly refer our ſelves; and if any thing in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Concluſion be indeed found not to ſpeak according thereunto let it be Rejected.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Boſton Confeſſion,</hi> by its Date, has been Printed more than ſeventy Years, what

Witneſs has been borne againſt it, I know not; but the length of Time has been ſufficient for them to have Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, and Corrected it, or Condemned it.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Connecticut Confeſſion,</hi> it has been Printed more than forty Years, and there has been public Witneſs borne againſt it, both before the Miniſters, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Rulers of the common Wealth, but it was not regarded.</p>
                     <p>And now I ſpeak to the Elders, and Meſſengers, and General Courts of both ſaid Governments, the former as you have recommended the aboveſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, the latter as you have eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and cauſed them to be Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and uſe the carnal Sword to defend them, what have you to ſay for your ſelves? For as much, as you have Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it over, and over ſo many times in your Confeſſions, that we ſhould make the Scriptures, or the Word of GOD our rule of Life, and to that Effect, and not to take any thing upon truſt as from you, and ſay, in Chap. 21. 1, 2, Paragraph, <hi>GOD alone is LORD of the Conſcience, and hath left it free from

the Doctrines, and Commandments of Men, which are in any thing contrary to His Word, or not contained in it, ſo that to believe ſuch Doctrines, or to obey ſuch Commands out of Conſcience, is to betray true liberty of Conſcience, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of an implicit Faith, and an abſolute, and blind Obedience, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy liberty of Conſcience, and Reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſay, what have you to ſay for your ſelves in Defence of your firſt day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath? that has neither command, nor example, nor name, nor the leaſt breath, or title in Scripture for it; but expreſs Commands to the contrary, both in the old, and new Teſtament.</p>
                     <p>And whereas you ſay, <hi>GOD alone is LORD of the Conſcience, &amp;c.</hi> How do you Prove it? where are your Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes? you only give Him the Title of LORD, but take the ruling power of Lordſhip to your ſelves, to rule over Conſcience; and ſo with your carnal Weapons, as Stocks, Whips, Fines, and Impriſonments, and the like, to Perſecute CHRIST in His Members, that for

Conſcience ſake cannot conform to your inſtitutions of Worſhip; they are ſo contrary to Scripture, that they cannot both be obeyed: As CHRIST ſaith, <hi>No Man can ſerve two Maſters, &amp;c.</hi> Matth. 6, 24. Yet you preſumptuouſly require Obedience to your own Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, againſt Scripture, againſt Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and againſt your own Counſels, page 5. 6. in <hi>Connecticut Preface;</hi> and why is all this? it is for the ſake of a little honour, and friendſhip of this World, as ſaith CHRIST, John 5, 44. <hi>How can ye believe which receive honour one of another, and ſeek not the honour that cometh from</hi> God <hi>only?</hi> Thus CHRIST ſets it forth as a thing impoſlible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in GOD, whilſt we are ſeeking Honour one of another; and James 4.4. ſaith, <hi>Ye adulterers, and adultereſſes, know ye not that the friendſhip of the World, if enmity with</hi> GOD? <hi>whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of</hi> GOD; that is, to be in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the ſpirit of the World, makes us enemies to God: And moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, you are twiſted together in the honour, and friendſhip of the World, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſhew of Godlineſs: But by your

                     <p>
                        <hi>An Oath is warranted by the Word of <hi>GOD</hi> under the New Teſtament, as well as under the Old.</hi> And to prove it. Quote many Texts of Scripture out of the Old Teſtament; but I make uſe of none of them, to prove it, or diſprove it: For as much as we read, Deut. 18.17, 18, 19. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto me, They have well ſpoken that which they have ſpoken. I will raiſe them up a Prophet from among their Brethren like unto thee, and I will put my Words in his Mouth, and he ſhall ſpeak unto them, all that I ſhall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him, and it ſhall come to paſs that whoſoever will not hearken unto my Words, which he ſhall ſpeak in my Name, I will require it of him.</hi> Matth. 17, 5. <hi>While He yet ſpake behold a bright Cloud over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed them, and behold a Voice out of

                     <p>So now let us hear your New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament Proofs, Matth. 5.34, 35, 36, <hi>But I ſay unto you, Swear not at all, neither by Heaven for it is</hi> GOD<hi>'s Throne; nor by the Earth for it is His Foot-ſtool; neither by Jeruſalem, for it is the City of the Great King; neither ſhalt thou Swear by thy Head, becauſe thou canſt not make one Hair white or black.</hi> Jam. 5.12. <hi>But above all things, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſwear not, neither by Heaven, neither by the Earth, neither by any other Oath, but let your yea, be yea, and your nay, nay, leſt you full into Condemnation.</hi>

Exod. 14.22. <hi>And the Children of Iſrael went into the midſt of the Sea, upon the dry Ground, and the Waters were a wall unto them on the right hand, and on the left;</hi> Compared with 1 Cor. 10.1, 2. <hi>Moreover, brethren,

                     <p>Here we ſee, as all Iſrael were under the Cloud, and paſſed through the Sea, that was a Wall on their right Hand, and on their left; the Apoſtle calls it Baptiſm, or being Baptized unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the Cloud and in the Sea;</hi>

<pb n="53" facs="unknown:007622_0051_102BABDC84E0B010"/>
into the Water for, but to be buried in Baptiſm? and do you ſay, this manner of Adminiſtration of Baptiſm is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, which CHRIST Himſelf hath given us a Pattern by His own Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſaith thus, <hi>It becometh us to fulfill all Righteouſneſs:</hi> And in ſtead hereof ſet up a Tradition of your own, and ſay, <hi>Baptiſm is rightly adminiſtred by pouring, or ſprinkling Water upon the Perſon.</hi> Thus you make void CHRIST'S Pattern, and Example, and eſtabliſh your own Tradition. Read alſo, Acts 8.38, 39. <hi>And they went down both into the Water, both Philip, and the Eunuch, and he Baptized him, and when they were come up out of the Water, &amp;c.</hi> It had no need to be ſaid, that they went both down into the Water, and when they were come up out of the Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It <hi>Philip</hi> by taking a little Water in his Hand and adminiſtring it by pouring, or ſprinkling it on the Eunuch, would have been accepted for Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>Rom. 6, 3. <hi>Know ye not, that ſo many of us as were Baptized into</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>were Baptized into His Death.</hi> ver. 4. <hi>Therefore we are Buried with Him by Baptiſm unto Death,</hi> ſaith the

But pouring, or ſprinkling Water upon the Perſon, bares no name in Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Baptiſm, and is a Worſhipping you know not what: Or as CHRIST ſaith, Matth 15.9. <hi>But in vain do they Worſhip me, teaching for Doctrines the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Men.</hi>

Neither have you any Scripture for the Baptizing Infants, as you call it, but it is an Invention of your own, to pretend to Baptize thoſe that have no Knowlege, neither of Good, or Evil. Deut. 1, 39. <hi>Moreover your little ones which ye ſaid ſhould be a prey, and your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which in that day had no knowlege between good and Evil,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Thus it appears that your Baptiſm is made up with Contradictions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And in the Adminiſtring it you ſay, <hi>I Baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> which is a Lie both to GOD and Man: Neither do I ſee it to be leſs than Blaſphemy; for the Spirit of GOD and the Scriptures agree in one: For ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 Pet. 1.21. <hi>The Prophecy came not in old Time by the will of Man, but holy Men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 1 Cor. 12.3. <hi>No man can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And for you to take God's Name to Witneſs to that is ſo contrary to the Scriptures, we may ſafely believe it to be by the ſpirit of Antichriſt; and therefore a lie, as to what you pretend.</p>

                     <p>And whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>As free, and not uſing your Liberty for a Cloke of Maliciouſneſs; but as the Servants of God:</hi> that is, to do it Chearfully, not Grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; but in a free Spirit.

                     <p>So that from theſe Texts, there is no Inlargement for any Rulers of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wealth to Exerciſe any Authority over any man's Conſcience; neither have we the leaſt Word in all the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to encourage Chriſtians for Help that way: but all on the contrary. As in Mat. 10.18. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>And ye ſhall be brought before Governors and Kings for my ſake for a Teſtimony againſt them, and the Gentiles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it is the run of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that a Suffering Life is marked out
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:007622_0057_102BABE0901E86A0"/>
for a Chriſtian's Life. And as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of GOD are ſaid to be Strangers, and Pilgrims in the World, ſo it is the Will of GOD, that they ſhould live a Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Quiet Life, in all Places where GOD is pleaſed to call them. But in the caſe of Conſcience, we muſt Obey GOD rather than Man. And we are Exhorted to Contend Earneſtly for the Faith, and not to Fear them that Kill the Body, <hi>&amp;c. Mat.</hi> 10.28.</p>
                     <p>But civil Rulers, not being contented in the Place that God hath ſet them in through the Pride of their own Hearts, and Malice of Satan, uſurp Authority to Rule in Church Affairs alſo; and to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Lordſhip over Men's Conſciences: Whereas the Prophet Iſaiah, Chap. 33.22. ſaith, <hi>The LORD is our Judge, the LORD is our Lawgiver, the LORD is our King,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But if we ſit in his Seat of Judgment, to Judge, how is He a Judge? And if we Exerciſe our ſelves in His Place of Lordſhip, how is He a Lord? And if we ſet up our Authority to Rule over His Church, which is His Kingdom, how then is He a King? For ſaith Chriſt, Luk. 17.20, 21. <hi>The Kingdom of GOD cometh
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:007622_0058_102BABAB928B21A0"/>
not with Obſervation,&amp;c.</hi> Or as we may ſay, not by obſerving outward Rules. For behold ſaith he, <hi>The Kingdom of God is within you.</hi> That is by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of GOD's Spirit in our Hearts, which is out of Man's Sight to Judge of.</p>
                     <p>Thus it is ſufficiently Proved that GOD hath ſet up the civil Government to Rule in the common Wealth, in Temporal things; and as well Proved that he hath not committed unto them the Government of His Church; and His Revealed Will in Men's Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which is a Secret, know only by GOD, and to him to whom GOD is pleaſed to Reveal it, Rev. 2.17. <hi>He that hath an ear let him hear, what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches; to him that over cometh will I give to eat of the hidden Manna; and I will give him a white Stone, and in the Stone, a new Name written which no Man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſaving he that receiveth it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus I have Proved that the civil Government as they exerciſe their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to Rule only in Temporal things
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:007622_0059_102B86D8C64F3430"/>
are the Miniſters of GOD, and that GOD hath not committed to them the Government of His Church, or to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in caſes of Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>And now I ſpeak to you Elders, and Meſſengers; as you have Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended your Confeſſions of Faith; and to you Rulers of the common Wealth, as you have acknowleged them, and publiſhed them, and eſtabliſhed them by Law, and defend them by the carnal Sword, I ſpeak I ſay to both Parties as One, as you are in Fellowſhip with each other in theſe Things, and ſo proceed to prove that your exerciſing your Selves in the affairs of Conſcience, and matters of Faith towards GOD, you do it under the authority of the Dragon, or ſpirit of Antichriſt. Rev. 13.1, 2, 3. <hi>And I ſtood upon the ſand of the Sea, and ſaw a Beaſt riſe up out of the Sea having ſeven Heads, and ten Horns; and upon his Horns ten Crowns, and upon his Heads the name of Blaſphemy: And the Beaſt which I ſaw was like unto a Leopard, and his Feet were as the Feet of a Bear, and his Mouth as the Mouth of
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:007622_0060_102BABAD153922D0"/>
a Lion: And the Dragon gave him his Power, and his Seat, and great Authority.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now as hath been ſaid, the power, and authority of the civil Government is of GOD, to execute juſtice, and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among Men; and the civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as it was Repreſented to <hi>John</hi> by a Beaſt riſing up out of the Sea, or multitude of People, as in Chap. 17. 15. had this power, and authority given them of GOD, before that of the Dragon's, as it is ſet forth by the Beaſt, having <hi>ſeven Heads, and ten Horns, and upon his Horns ten Crowns:</hi> So that it is very clear, and evident that the power, ſeat, and authority given by the Dragon was an additional power, not from GOD, but of his own Nature, a perſecuting Power, readily imbraced by the Rulers of the common Wealth, for the ſake of the glory, honor, and friendſhip of this World; and this power, and glory he offered to CHRIST, Luke 4, 5, 6, but CHRIST did not accept of it, but we ſee the Beaſt, or worldly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers did accept of it, in that they put it in Practice. <hi>And I ſaw one of his

We are to underſtand the worldly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or Rulers that GOD hath ſet up to Govern the World, or common Wealth, whether Kings, Governors, or thoſe of lower Degrees, compared with the following part of Rev. 13, and more Particularly the 7 ver. <hi>And it was given unto him to make War with the Saints, and to over-come them, and power was given him over all Kindreds, and Tongues and Nations.</hi> And by the Dragon is to be underſtood the Devil, or Satan, as in Chap. 12, 9. <hi>And the great Dragon was caſt out, that old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole World,</hi> &amp;c. And whereas it is ſaid the <hi>Dragon gave him his power, and his ſeat, and great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;</hi> this is to be underſtood by ſtirring up the powers of this World, by the ſpirit of Perſecution, to turn the Sword that GOD had put into their Hands to execute juſtice among Men, to perſecute the Saints, as in Chap. 12, 7.

<pb n="65" facs="unknown:007622_0063_102BABE7DF4D0020"/>
Gentiles, according to what is ſpoken, Iſa. 11.9. <hi>They ſhall not hurt nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy in all my holy Mountain; for the Earth ſhall be full of the knowlege of the LORD as the Waters cover the Sea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This was a prophecy of the Gentiles receiving the knowlege of GOD by preaching the Goſpel unto them: For we receive the knowlege of GOD, and of the myſteries or Godlineſs no other way but by the Goſpel, and by our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of GOD, and of the myſteries of Godlineſs in and by the Goſpel; the myſtery of Iniquity is alſo diſcovered, and the diſcovering the myſtery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in the time of <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> and their worſhipping of Idols, to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion or a work of Satan, was the wounding as unto Death, as the Apoſtle ſaith, that head or power given to the Beaſt, by the Dragon and by the Sword in the hand of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> GOD executed His Judgments upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Pers;e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Power to their utter overthrow, and deliverance of His Church out of their perſecuting Hands.</p>
                     <p>

Thus we are come to the end of Perſecution, under <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> or the <hi>Gentiles</hi> oppoſing the Chriſtian Faith, and the wounding the Beaſts Head, or perſecuting Power given him by the Dragon.</p>
                     <p>The next thing to underſtand is, how his wounded Head was healed; which will appear by reading and comparing the following part of Rev. 13. ver. 11, 12, &amp;c. <hi>And I beheld another Beaſt Coming up out of the Earth, and he had two Horns like a Lamb, and he ſpake as a Dragon, and he exerciſeth all the power of the firs;t Beaſt before him, and cauſeth the Earth and them which dwell therein, to worſhip the firſt Beaſt whoſe deadly wound was healed.</hi> The Apoſtle calls this another Beaſt to diſtinguiſh it from the Beaſt mentioned in ver. firſt, that roſe up out of the Sea, <hi>having ſeven Heads, and ten Horns, and upon his Horns ten Crowns,</hi> &amp;c. Which ſhews the perfection of the Power that GOD had given him to govern the common Wealth; as in Chap. 12. 3.

<pb n="67" facs="unknown:007622_0065_102BABE9DEEBD908"/>
the perfection of his Power; and the Dragon giving the ſaid Beaſt his Power and his Seat, and great Authority; and the ſaid Beaſt or worldly Powers repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by it, exerciſing the Power given him by the Dragon, becomes a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Power, not only to Rule in the common Wealth, but alſo in the Church, in things that relate to the worſhip of GOD, bringing both the common Wealth and Church under one Government, and the Beaſt mentioned in ver. 11 12. <hi>Coming up out of the Earth,</hi> which ſhews his Earthly nature that is ſaid to have <hi>two horns like a Lamb, and to ſpeak as a Dragon, and to exerciſe all the power of the firſt Beaſt before him, and to cauſe the Earth and them that dwell therein to worſhip the firſt Beaſt whoſe deadly wound was healed.</hi> Why this Beaſt was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to <hi>John</hi> in the appearance of a Lamb, was in imitation to CHRIST, as CHRIST is ſet forth by the ſimilitude of a Lamb, John 1.29. <hi>Behold the Lamb of GOD, which taketh away the Sin of the World.</hi> Rev. 5.12. <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was Slain,</hi> &amp;c.

ſo that it was in Imitation to CHRIST, and His Miniſters, as being ſent by CHRIST, and coming in His Name: But He is ſaid to <hi>ſpeak as a Dragon,</hi> which ſhews He was a Counterfeit, or Antichriſt, and did not come in a real Lamb-like Spirit, but in the Spirit of Antichriſt, or falſe Prophets; as CHRIST foretold, Matth. 7 15. <hi>Beware of falſe Prophets, which come to you in Sheeps Cloathing but inwardly they are raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wolves,</hi> And in the following Verſes ſhews, that we ſhall <hi>know them by their Fruits.</hi> And why he is ſaid to have two Horns, is to ſhew his exerciſing Authority, not only in the common Wealth, but alſo in the Church: ver. 13. <hi>And he doth great Wonders, ſo that he maketh Fire to come down from Heaven on the Earth in the ſight of Men.</hi> That is, by his Miniſters, by their formal and long Prayers, with ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Holineſs, and many and vain Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions forbidden by CHRIST; Matth. 6.7, 8. <hi>But when ye Pray, uſe not vain Repetitions as the Heathen do, for they think that they ſhall be heard for their much ſpeaking; be not ye therefore like unto them.</hi>

And your Confeſſions of Faith, as your eſtabliſhed Miniſters, or Elders, and Meſſengers have recommended them to the Civil Government in each Colony; and they have eſtabliſhed them, and defend them by the force of the Sword: This evidently proves them to be the ſaid Image, made to the Beaſt, divided to each Government: For the Apoſtle is not ſpeaking particularly to this, or that, or the other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but to the whole World, where CHRIST is Preached: And yet uſes the word <hi>Image,</hi> not <hi>Images;</hi> for tho' there may be a Thouſand Kingdoms, common Wealths, or Governments under <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> in the World, and each of them may have a differing form of Worſhip, or image of Worſhip, yet they all make but one Image to the Beaſt.</p>
                     <p>As the Body hath many Members, and yet make but one Body. And though the Dragon be called Dragon, Serpent, Devil, and Satan, in Rev. Chapter 12.9. Yet he is but one Spirit.</p>

                     <p>To this I Anſwer: The Figurative Kingly Office of CHRIST was Propheſied to Deſcend of <hi>Judah;</hi> Gen. 49.10. <hi>The ſcepter ſhall not depart from Judah, nor a law giver from between his feet until Shiloh come, and unto him ſhall the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the People be.</hi> Which was Fulfilled in <hi>David,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>We are to underſtand, that upon CHRIST's coming, the figurative King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> was at an End; as is Witneſſed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 18.15. <hi>The LORD thy GOD ſhall raiſe up unto thee a Prophet from the midſt of thee, of thy Brethren like unto me, unto him ye ſhall Hearken:</hi> And this was confirmed by GOD Himſelf, Matth. 17.5. <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well Pleaſed, hear ye him;</hi> as alſo Acts 3.22, <hi>For Moſes truly ſaid unto the Fathers,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>a Prophet ſhall the LORD your GOD raiſe up unto you of your Brethren like unto me, him ſhall ye hear in all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto you.</hi>

As to the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I ſhall briefly mention <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and <hi>Jehu,</hi> who in Particular were Ordained of GOD by His Prophets to rule over the common Wealth of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but had no Authority at all over His Church in thoſe things that concern'd the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of GOD; and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> in taking upon himſelf to ſet up a form of Worſhip, it was highly provoking to GOD: See 1 Kings 13.34. <hi>And this thing became Sin unto the houſe of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to deſtroy it from off the face of the Earth;</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Iſrael</hi> alſo, Chap. 14.16. <hi>And he ſhall give Iſrael up, becauſe of the Sins of Jeroboam, who did Sin, and who made Iſrael to Sin.</hi>

light of Conſcience, and the expreſs Command of CHRIST, to do to others as we are willing to Receive: And ſaith He, <hi>This is the Law, and the Prophets,</hi> Matth. 7.12.</p>
                     <p>Thus much <hi>Connecticut.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus I have preſented the Reader with a view of the Perſecutions by our Fore-fathers in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and <hi>Boſton</hi> Governments; as alſo of the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>England</hi> in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> by the Papiſts; and alſo in ſaid foreign Parts by the Papiſts; and have ſhewed that their Authority pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from themſelves: The Pope, by the Papiſts, being allowed to be CHRIST's Vice-gerent on Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the holy Mother Church of <hi>Rome, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if theſe Titles are truly, and rightly apply'd to the Pope, and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then why may they not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, and make Laws, and join Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the breach of each Law accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Diſcretion in the defence, and for the preſervation of their ſuppoſed

holy Inſtitutions of Worſhip, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly proceed to do all the aforeſaid acts of Violence upon their fellow Creatures?</p>
                     <p>And why may not <hi>Boſton</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if it be true indeed, in that they ſay, <hi>The end of the Magiſtrates Office is not only the quiet and peaceable Life of the Subject, in Matters of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Honeſty; but alſo in matters of Godlineſs; yea of all Godlineſs.</hi>

                     <p>Thus for <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and <hi>Boſton Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>'s ASSEMBLY Proteſtants.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>England,</hi> in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſaid foreign Parts, being Papiſts, theſe being Named as aforeſaid; and each of them aſſume to themſelves hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authority, to rule over the Church of CHRIST, and Light of Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>And if we allow it to one, we muſt allow it to all, one as much as another; and not only to theſe, but to all Papiſts, and Proteſtants, throughout the World, even to all People that profeſs the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>For as CHRIST hath not limited Kingly Power to any particular People, now under the Goſpel Miniſtration, as GOD did to the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> under the Law; ſo that throughout the World
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:007622_0096_102BAC345C5259D8"/>
where CHRIST is Named, whether Papiſts, or Proteſtants; they have equal Right to ſet up Kingly Authority to rule over the Church of GOD, as any of thoſe already Named, <hi>Viz.</hi> The Papiſts in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign, and thoſe in foreign Parts; and <hi>Boſton</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and <hi>Connecticut.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as I have thus given the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a brief View of the Works of each, I think theſe ſufficient to Judge them by their Works.</p>
                     <p>For as much as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>In the Mouth of two, or three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the Matter ſhall be Eſtabliſhed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if we will Read the Hiſtory's Cited, we may ſee Hundreds more of unrighteous, and inhumane Actions done to the Sufferers: And many of them by the Officers.</p>
                     <p>To my knowlege was taken from a Man, only for the coſt of a Juſtices Court, and Court charge of Whipping him, for Breach of SABBATH, (ſo called) a Mare worth a <hi>hundred Pounds,</hi> and nothing returned; And
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:007622_0097_102BABFF624DE7F8"/>
this is known by us yet Living, to have been the general Practice in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now I deſire every Chriſtian Reader, to give his Judgment particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of theſe above Named, whether their proceedings againſt the Sufferers were not all of one Spirit? as for Inſtance, one partly put to Death by Burning, another by Drowning, another by Hanging: Were not all theſe acts of Violence upon their fellow Creatures? I call for Judgment. CHRIST ſaith, <hi>A good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit, neither can a corrupt Tree bring forth good Fruit.</hi> And ſaith He, <hi>By their Fruits ye ſhall know them.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith, Rev. 13.15. <hi>He</hi> (that is the Dragon) <hi>had power to give life unto the image of the Beaſt, that the image of the Beaſt ſhould both ſpeak, and cauſe that as many as would not Worſhip the image of the Beaſt ſhould be Killed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And here we ſee the Apoſtles Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy fulfilled: And in differing ways in <hi>Connecticut Confeſſion,</hi> Chap. 24. they
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:007622_0098_102BAC35DF1BF188"/>
Quote to <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. and Tit. 3.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14, 17. to prove the civil Magiſtrates Authority to rule in the Church. And in <hi>Boſton</hi> form of Church Government, Chap. 17. they alſo Quote to <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2: in like Manner, to prove the Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates Authority in the Church.</p>
                     <p>Thus they borrow the heathen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Authority, that required the Worſhipping of Idols to rule, and govern the Church under a conformity to their ſeveral Inſtitutions of Worſhip; and ſo uſe the carnal Sword to defend their own Inſtitutions, as the Heathen did their's.</p>
                     <p>And thus the Dragon's Head that was wounded to Death, by the light of the Goſpel in the time of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, now comes to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by the falling away of the Church in Antichriſtianiſm: But it is the ſame Dragon and ſame perſecuting Spirit that required the Worſhipping of Idols, and perſecuted the primitive Church, that now profeſſes himſelf to be a Chriſtian, and furniſhes himſelf with

                     <p>And he allures the Rulers of the common Wealth, that GOD hath ſet to do Juſtice among Men, to take under their Care <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>So that he may rightly be ſaid to be the GOD of this World, 2. Cor. 4.4. <hi>In whom the God of this World hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,</hi> &amp;c. And to <hi>ſit in the temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.4. And ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>which deceiveth the whole World,</hi> Rev. 12.9, And in Chap. 13. ver. 14, 15, <hi>Saying to them that dwell on the Earth, that they ſhould make an image to the Beaſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:007622_0100_102BAC37DF2DC020"/>
cauſe that as many as would not Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the image of the Beaſt ſhould be Killed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus he appears to be the God of this World, having gotten all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Glory of Religion, and the Powers of the World, on his ſide, to defend all his Inſtitutions of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or Image made to the Beaſt.</p>
                     <p>And thus as we ſee by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Antichriſtian Church Anoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mized, and laid Naked before our Eyes.</p>
                     <p>Let us take the warning given us, Chap. 14.9, 10. <hi>And the third Angel followed them, ſaying with a loud Voice, if any Man Worſhip the Beaſt, and his Image, and receive his Mark in his Fore-head, or in his Hand, the ſame ſhall drink of the Wine, of the Wrath of GOD, which is poured out without Mixture, into the Cup of his Indignation; and he ſhall be Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with Fire, and Brimſtone, in the preſence of the holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb.</hi>

In the foregoing Treatiſe, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may ſee how I have formerly been with the Elders and Meſſengers, and General Courts of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> with this Scruple, that ſundry Articles in their Confeſſion of Faith had not Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Proof, but they regarded it not, and in the Year 1754, I went to the General Court at <hi>Hartford,</hi> and alſo to the General Court at <hi>Boſton;</hi> conſidering their Confeſſions were both one; and that both Governments lie under the ſame Reproof that they would peruſe them, and conſider them, but neither of them regarded, ſo as to enquire into them.</p>
                     <p>And I have publiſhed three Treatiſes already, touching theſe Things; but there has been no Anſwer made to any; and this is the Fourth; that after ſo much Proof, I think it may truly be ſaid of them, as in Rev. 2.2. <hi>And thou haſt tried them which ſay they are Apoſtles, and are not, and haſt found them Lyars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lyars Indeed, both to GOD, and Man, to give forth ſuch a Body of Articles of Faith for our rule of Life,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:007622_0102_102BAC39EDB80E48"/>
that are ſo contrary to Scripture, and againſt the plain commands of CHRIST as words can expreſs; and yet recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to us, and to our Poſterity, as the unchangeable, and eternal Truths of GOD, founded upon the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                     <p>See <hi>Connecticut Preface,</hi> Page 8. And much more to this Purpoſe, I have quoted out of ſaid <hi>Preface,</hi> as the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may ſee; and they ſay, that <hi>GOD alone is LORD of the Conſcience:</hi> And <hi>hath leſt it free from the Doctrines, and Commandments of Men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And then ſet up their own Doctrines, and Commandments to be obſerved, and leave it to carnal Men to deviſe what Puniſhments ſhall be Inflicted upon the Tranſgreſſors, in defence of ſaid Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, and Impower the Civil Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate to execute them againſt the revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Will of GOD in the Heart, which is the light of Conſcience, and ſo give GOD the Title of Lord-ſhip, but make themſelves Lord of the Conſcience, by ſubjecting it under their humane Laws, and carnal Weapons, by the Power,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:007622_0103_102BAC04ECD2B758"/>
and Authority received from the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, as in Rev. 13.2. <hi>And the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon gave him his Power, and his Seat, and great Authority.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And from this Spirit of Perſecution received from the Dragon, proceeds all Perſecution, that ariſes where CHRIST is Received; even ſo as to make divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions between neareſt Relations, in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.34. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it is alſo hurtful to Kingdoms and common Wealths, to moleſt People that live Honeſtly, and are diligent in their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Employments, and live under confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to all Things, relating to the good and benefit of the common Wealth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting thoſe Things that they Scruple for Conſcience ſake towards GOD; as in the caſe of <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 6.5.</p>
                     <p>I ſay, to moleſt ſuch, by injuring either their Perſons, or Eſtates, is ſo far violating the peace, and good of the common Wealth, which the civil Magiſtrates Work is to Preſerve.</p>
                     <p>In a word, to go to rule the Church by the power of the Magiſtrate, is to
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:007622_0104_102BAC3D603FD048"/>
deſtroy the peace of both Church, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and common Wealths. But on the contrary, CHRIST is ſaid to be <hi>the Prince of Peace,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. And when he was Born into the World, this Teſtimony was given of him from Heaven, Luke 2.13, 14. <hi>And ſuddenly there was with the Angel, a Multitude of the Heavenly Hoſt, praiſing GOD, and ſaying, glory to GOD in the Higheſt, and on Earth peace, good will towards Men.</hi> As alſo, Rom. 10.15. <hi>As it is Written, how Beautiful are the Feet of them that preach the Goſpel of Peace, and bring glad Tidings of good Things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And all that walk in his Spirit, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Example, to <hi>live peaceably to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all Men,</hi> as alſo toward the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wealth, and to pay Tribute, as he did, for Peace ſake, rather than to offend, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But not as a due Debt; for ſaith the Apoſtle, Tim. 1.9. <hi>The Law is not made for a Righteous Man,</hi> but ſaith he, <hi>for the Lawleſs, and Diſobedient, for the Ungodly, and for Sinners,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="107" facs="unknown:007622_0105_102BAC07F092EBD8"/>
Thus it appears by this Text, that the Law is not made for the Righteous, and they are therefore not Indebted to the Law, ſo as to pay Tribute, or the like, as a due Debt, but as a free, and voluntary Act, for Peace ſake, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to Offend.</p>
                     <p>There is no Compulſion in CHRIST's Church, neither towards GOD, nor Man; but every Man, to whom it is given, is at his own free Will, to Chuſe, or Refuſe for himſelf; as 2 Cor. 5.20. <hi>We are Ambaſſadors for CHRIST,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>as thô GOD did beſeech you by us, we pray you in CHRIST's Stead, be ye reconciled to GOD.</hi> Rev. 22.17. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſay Come, and let him that heareth ſay Come, and let him that is a thirſt Come, and whoſoever will, let him take of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Life freely.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee, tho' all Power was given to CHRIST, as He ſaith, <hi>Both in Heaven, and Earth,</hi> Matth. 28.18. Yet the Foundation of his Church is Love; as he ſaith, John 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:007622_0106_102BAC3EE3A85F48"/>
only begotten Son, that whoſoever believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on him ſhould not Periſh, but have eternal Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And CHRIST has given it as an evidence to the World, to know his Diſciples, by their Love, one to another; John 13.35. <hi>By this ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye love one another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And our ſaid Confeſſions tell us, Chap. 22 1. Parag. <hi>The acceptable way of Worſhipping the true GOD is Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by himſelf, and ſo limited by his own revealed Will, that he may not be Worſhipped according to the imaginations, and devices of Men, or the ſuggeſtions of Satan, under any viſible Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or any other way not preſcribed in the holy Scriptures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in the 7th, and 8th Parag. ſpeaking particularly of their firſt Day SABBATH, (ſo called) and in it's Sanctification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in effect ſay, <hi>We muſt Worſhip GOD according to the imaginations and devices of Men, and ſuggeſtions of Satan,</hi> by ſubjecting it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="109" facs="unknown:007622_0107_102BAC09EBF17748"/>
and this agrees with the Apoſtles Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, Rev. 13 4. <hi>And they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Dragon which gave power to the Beaſt, and they worſhipped the Beaſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But as to ſaid Sabbath, there is no command, nor example, nor name in Scripture for it; as hath been proved, and will ſtand proved, till it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
                     <p>Thus they deceive the World, in a ſhew of extolling GOD, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but it is nothing but a flouriſh of Words, out of the ſmoke of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit of Antichriſt, to gain the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Authority for their Antichriſtian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; the obſerving of which, is the great Idol of <hi>New-England,</hi> which the Worldly Powers defend by Stocks, Whips, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and taking away the Eſtates of the King's peaceable Subjects, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the common Wealth.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Signs, GOD made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf known to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by Signs, and Miracles, pronounced and wrought by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> till by great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he was forced to let <hi>Iſreal go:</hi>

So likewiſe when CHRIST was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the Fleſh, GOD manifeſted himſelf in him <hi>by Signs, and Miracles,</hi> in doing <hi>merciful Deeds,</hi> in <hi>healing the Sick,</hi> and <hi>curing all manner of Diſeaſes</hi> and <hi>opening the Eyes of the Blind,</hi> and <hi>raiſing the Dead,</hi> and <hi>caſting out Devils,</hi> and the like: But notwithſtanding all theſe Signs and Miracle, the <hi>Jews</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly deſired of him a Sign from Heaven; he ſaid unto them, <hi>O ye H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thus it appears that they had no Judgment to Judge of Signs, whether they were of GOD, or of the Devil: They had let in ſuch a wilful Spirit of Unbelief, and hardneſs of Heart, and Perſecution, that the Devil had gotten that Power over them, as to make them believe Lies, and oppoſe the

Truth: In a word, they truſted in their own Righteouſneſs, and rejected the Righteouſneſs of GOD in CHRIST, and ſo procured this doleful Sentence againſt themſelves, Math. 23 37, 38. <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them which are ſent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy Children together, even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not; behold your Houſe is leſt unto you deſolate.</hi>

                     <p>The deſtruction of their Fathers, was their not hearkening to the warnings of the Prophets; but Perſecuted them, and put them to Death: And the Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe, was, their wilful rejecting the Goſpel Preached by CHRIST, and his Apoſtles, and confirmed to be the Goſpel of GOD, by the Sign, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles that they Wrought: They both former, and latter, were deſtroyed by a mighty Deſtruction, and we can think no better of their eternal Eſtate without Repentance; theſe are all gone <hi>to come to Judgment, to receive according to the deeds done in the Body,</hi> and ought to be our Examples, to take Warning leſt we fall into the like Condemnation.</p>

Now as touching our Fore-fathers who came out of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe they were not allowed to Worſhip GOD ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the light of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, but were Perſecuted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore came into this Country, that they might not be debarred that Liberty; but how ſoon did they ſet up a form of Worſhip contrary to Scripture, of humane Invention, and then ſubjected the obſerving it under the Power of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and ſo became deſtroyers of that Liberty that their Fathers had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed at ſo dear a Rate, and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe that for Conſcience ſake with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from their eſtabliſhed Worſhip.</p>
                     <p>I now ſum up this Diſcourſe, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that all the eſtabliſhed Worſhip of <hi>New-England</hi> defended by the worldly Powers, is nothing but the Worſhip of the Dragon, and the Beaſt, and his Image: For ſaith the Apoſtle, Rev. 12.9. <hi>The great Dragon was caſt out, that old Serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole World,</hi> of which <hi>New-England</hi> is a part; and their Worſhip, or Image, made to the Beaſt, (<hi>Chap. 13. ver. 14.</hi>) is made up

of Contradictions, of Scriptures; and therefore of neceſſity comes under the Apoſtles Teſtimony, that <hi>they are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the reſt of the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that it is defended by the worldly Powers, by the Power and Authority given them by the Dragon; ſee Ver. 2. <hi>And the Dragon gave him his Power, and his Seat, and great Authority.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That is to ſay, the power and ſeat of Perſecution; and that it is the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Dragon, and the Beaſt in fellowſhip together, ſee ver. 4. <hi>And they Worſhipped the Dragon which gave Power unto the Beaſt, and they Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the Beaſt,</hi> &amp;c. And that the Power, Seat, and Authority given to the Beaſt by the Dragon; is intended the Seat of Perſecution: Let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with ver. 15. <hi>And he had power to give life unto the Image of the Beaſt, that the Image of the Beaſt ſhould both ſpeak, and cauſe that as many as would not worſhip the Image of the Beaſt, ſhould be Killed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By the Scriptures thus it is Proved, that all the eſtabliſhed Worſhip of <hi>New-England,</hi>

defended by the worldly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, is nothing, but the Worſhip of the Dragon, and the Beaſt, and his Image; and alſo proved that the Power, Seat, and Authority given to the Beaſt, or worldly Powers, by the Dragon; is the power, and ſeat of Perſecution to defend the ſaid Worſhip, given to the Image of the Beaſt.</p>
                     <p>And the Sin of falſe Worſhip, was the Crying Sin that provoked GOD to ſend his Judgments upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the time of the Law, from time to time, to their utter Deſtruction; as is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly Recorded in Scripture.</p>
                     <p>And if we will take the Scriptures for our Inſtructors, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>All Scripture is given by Inſpiration of GOD, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. Then let us hear how it Saith, that GOD viſits <hi>the Iniquities of the Fathers upon the Children, and upon the Children's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, unto the third, and to the fourth Generation,</hi> Exod: 34.7.</p>

And this GOD doth, in his Patience, and Forbearance by leſſer Judgments, to warn a People to turn from their evil Ways in time; and not only by his Judgments, but alſo by his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that he ſends; Jer. 25.4. <hi>And the LORD hath ſent unto you all his Servants the Prophets, riſing early and ſending them, but ye have not Hearkened, nor enclined your Ear to Hear.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And theſe Warnings, both by his Judgments, and by his Meſſenger, GOD hath been warning <hi>New-England,</hi> by viſiting the Iniquities of the Fathers upon the Children, and upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Children, down to this Day; as by the <hi>Indian</hi> Wars, that began ſoon after the Perſecuting, and putting the <hi>Quaker's</hi> to Death, from which <hi>New-England</hi> has had no aſſurance of Peace to this Day.</p>
                     <p>And GOD has viſited <hi>Boſton,</hi> with the Small-Pox, five Times, ſince they, put the ſaid Quakers to Death; and alſo other Sickneſs that has been very Mortal in <hi>New-England;</hi> and the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, that has been very Mortal among

                     <p>But there has been no returning to GOD, notwithſtanding all theſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Warnings; but a wilful maintaining, and defending the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Dragon, the Beaſt, and his Image.</p>

No mention is made that the Giants (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6, 4:) deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Adam,</hi> or any of his Poſterity: Were they therefore a new Generation of Men, no way related to <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; his Poſterity? Many of the Commands were not ſo much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned 'till <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Day; did they not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'till then, belong to the Decalogue, or moral Law? But is it not evident enough, that the Law of the Sabbath was publiſh'd, &amp; obligatory, long before <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Time, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007622_0136_102BAC5F1596F658"/>
from the beginning? For that part of the original Inſtitution, is brought down into the ſecond Publication of it in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Day; and that even word, for word. And 'tis plain beyond all reaſonable Diſpute (as publiſh'd by <hi>Moſes,</hi> at the falling of Manna, and as it ſtands in the moral Law) it is not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a new Command; but as old as the Creation. Tho'it had been much abuſed, &amp; profaned, by an abandon'd wicked World; and even much, and long violated by GOD'S own profeſſing People: Therefore we find <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking of it, as what was already publiſhed, and known, Exod. 16.23. <hi>This</hi> (ſays he) is <hi>what the Lord hath ſaid,</hi> (not what He doth now Command,) <hi>To-morrow is,</hi> (not to morrow ſhall be) <hi>the reſt of the Sabbath:</hi> Therefore we find the Complaint made in the 23th ver. of the ſame Chapter; <hi>How long?</hi> mark the Words! how long? Had they been ſtrangers to the Command 'till then, they coud'nt had a long Time to have broke it; as the Queſtion imply's; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Sabbath-Day;</hi> imply's it had mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably been neglected, violated, &amp; even for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got!</p>
                     <p>Friend <hi>Bolles</hi> ſays, The Sabbath was only for the <hi>Jews,</hi> and continued 'till CHRIST, &amp; ſo come to an End; and ſince that all Days are alike. But will any one believe this?

who conſiders, That the Command to keep the Sabbath, is one of the Ten Commands of the Decalogue; and is of a moral, as well as poſitive Nature; and as to its moral Nature, is univerſally, and perpetually Binding. To ſpend a part of our Time to worſhip, &amp; ſerve GOD publickly, is of univerſal, and perpetual Obligation; and this muſt reſpect <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; his Poſterity, yea, all his Poſterity, one as well as another. Again, the reaſons, and ends of its Inſtitution, are in general the ſame, and ſo common, and obligatory on Mankind. As GOD'S finiſhing His works of Creation; His bleſſing, &amp; ſanctifying the Sabbath-Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And even where the Sabbath is called a Sign, and the keeping of it Holy, a keeping Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with GOD; or GOD's perpetual, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Covenant with His People, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. I ſay, even there, 'twas not only obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory on the <hi>Jews;</hi> but <hi>Gentiles</hi> too. The Stranger, <hi>i.e</hi> the <hi>Gentile</hi> Stranger, within the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Gates, was bound to keep the Sabbath, as well as the <hi>Jew;</hi> and as much needed the Sabbath as a Sign that GOD was an Holy GOD; and that they ſhould be an Holy People. They needed as much to be brought into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Relation, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did; and the Court of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> was opened for that End, to invite, and bring them in, and bind them to their Duty; and eſpecially to the keeping

holy the Sabbath, which they had long, &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly neglected &amp; profaned, which was a ſign, &amp; evidence they were Unholy, &amp; Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in the Sight of GOD; while <hi>Jews,</hi> &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyted <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were faithful in ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sabbath, carried with them, one very conſiderable Sign, and viſible Evidence that they were an Holy People, &amp; Conſecrated to an Holy GOD; and not deſecrated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, and abominable Idol-gods.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, we find the fourth Command en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced, from the conſideration, that they were Servants in the Land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and that the LORD brough them out from thence, with a high Hand, <hi>&amp;c. Deut.</hi> 5 15. The Reaſons of which Enforcement, ſeem plain enough to be theſe two, more eſpecially.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1) Becauſe they had with, and in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> profaned the Holy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; therefore they were now more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to take care, to ſanctify that Day, they had ſo often, Profaned.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) They being now by divine Grace, &amp; a ſeries of Miracles, brought out of the Land of Servitude, and brought into viſible Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with GOD, to be his People; this, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the other nine Commands of the Decalogue, was reinforced, and this more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, ſhewing their Liberty from Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and great Privilege of keeping a Day

of Reſt, or Sabbath to the LORD. But then we muſt remember agreable to our Aſſembly of Divines the Reaſons annexed to the fourth Command (as binding on <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as <hi>Jews</hi>) are, <hi>God's allowing us ſix Days of the Week for our own employment, His chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging, a ſpecial</hi> right, and <hi>propriety to the ſeventh, His own example, and His bleſſing,</hi> &amp; ſanctifying <hi>the Sabbath day.</hi>

                     <p>Friend <hi>Bolles</hi> ſays, The firſt Day of the Week, is not the Chriſtian Sabbath; nor any Day, as diſtinguiſh't, one from another; but all Days in common, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>I anſwer, There is a Chriſtian ſabbath-Day, as diſtinguiſh't from the Days of the Week in common: And that this Day is the firſt-Day of the Week; which may be evidenc'd divers Ways.</p>

Water, in the Name of the Sacred Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But perhaps you will ſay, We are Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with CHRIST in Baptiſm unto Death: Allow it. But what was the Baptiſm, with which CHRIST was Baptized unto Death? Was it not the pricking Thorns, Nails, and Spear? which ſtain'd all His Raiment, as one that had been treading in the Wine-Preſs; a reſemblance of the ſprinkling of the Blood of CHRIST, for the remiſſion of Sin. Altho'I am nothing againſt dipping, or even plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all-over in Water when the Seaſon will allow, or Conſtitution endure it; Yet I muſt again ſay with the Confeſſion, I don't ſee it neceſſary; but think waſhing with Water full as Good; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Theſe are words of his own Framing, and not as I have Spoken. And then he ſaith, <q>
                        <hi>I have ſaid contrary to the expreſs Words of our Saviour,</hi> Mark 2.27. <hi>The Sabbath was made for Man, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> But as I have Written, I do not contradict our Saviour at all: For I allow all that is written in the Bible about the Reſt, or Sabbath, to be for Man, and for Man's Teaching; and I have no where ſaid as he has charged me. All which the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may obſerve in reading over what I have Written, beginning at my 30th Pag. He ought to ſay, the words exact as they are ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>He argues much for a Sabbath between <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet he has not ſhewn one place of Scripture that forbad La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, nor one place of Scripture where any perſon was blamed for Prophaning the Sabbath in all that time; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he has found neither Law nor Tranſgreſſion about the Sabbath until <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet in his tenth Page, he complains,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007622_0171_102BACBA43DD78B0"/>
                     <q>It had been <hi>much abuſed, and prophaned by an abandoned wicked World, and even much and long Violated by God's own profeſſing People.</hi>
                     </q> And much more he ſaith to the ſame Effect.</p>
                  <p>Now whether we ought to join with him to Judge and Blame the World, and God's People alſo, ſince God who is the righteous Judge, has not Blamed them at all for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning a Sabbath, in all them Thouſands of Years, I leave this to the Judgment of all Mankind.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Sabbath I have written in full, by Quoting Scriptures both out of the Old Teſtament and New, as the Reader may ſee, beginning at my Book, pag. 30. But now I ſay in ſhort, There is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for the Keeping the Firſt Day of the Week as a Sabbath, neither in the Old Teſtament, nor in the New: And all that ſaid <hi>Johnſon</hi> hath ſaid by way of Queſtion, and Anſwer, and Argument, Tradition, Reaſon, Revelation, and his pretended O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal. And if he had ſaid an Hundred Times as much, it would not balance a Command. See Rom. 4.15. <hi>Where no Law is there is no Tranſgreſſion,</hi> Chap. 5. 13. <hi>Sin is not imputed when there is no Law.</hi> And ſays the Confeſſion, (which he ſays, pag. 7, <q>
                        <hi>Perhaps a better they could not</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And as to his pretended Original, ſhall we lay aſide the Bible as it is Tranſlated into our own Tongue, by ſo many Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and ſo often Reviſed? Read the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <hi>The Holy Bible, containing the Old Teſtament, and the New, Newly Tranſlated cut of the Original Tongues, and with the former Tranſlations, diligently Compared and Reviſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And we have God's Teſtimony to the Truth of it, who both ſpeaks Comfort and Reproof to us by it, as it is now in our Tongue; according to our inward Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Exerciſes of Mind, of which I am a Witneſs; and no doubt Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands beſides. Shall we, I ſay, ſet all this at Nought, and that which has been counted ſo great a Privilege, as to have the Scriptures in our own Tongue, and now to take for Truth what one Man tells us is the Meaning of this or the other Scripture in the Original, other ways than it is Tranſlated in our Tongue? Shall we,

I ſay, believe one Man againſt all the Tranſlators of the Bible?

                  <p>After ſaid <hi>Johnſon</hi> has Cited <hi>Mat. 5.34, &amp;c.</hi> and Repeated Chriſt's Words, <q>Swear not at all, Neither by Heaven, for it is God's Throne, nor by the Earth, for it is his Footſtool, &amp;c.</q> And ſaith he his Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, Chap. 5. 12. <q>But above all Things, my Brethren, Swear not, neither by Heaven, neither by the Earth, neither by any other Oath, &amp;c.</q> After theſe Texts of his own Citing, ſaith, <q>Now I would aſk, Where in theſe two Places of Scripture Cited, or any other in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are we Forbidden Swearing by the Living and True GOD? &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="unknown:007622_0174_102BAC8A60949380"/>
Anſwer,</p>
                  <p>By theſe Two Texts cited, compared with Mat. 23.22. <hi>And he that ſhall Swear by Heaven, Sweareth by the Throne of God, and by Him that Sitteth thereon.</hi> I ſay, it evidently appears we are Forbidden to Swear by the Living and True GOD.</p>
                  <p>After this he goes on to prove the Lawfulneſs of an Oath; but I think theſe Scriptures cited, with what is ſaid already, is ſufficient to convince thoſe that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſee; and they that are not, it doth not lie in the multitude of Words to help them.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Baptiſm,</p>
                  <p>We have no Command, nor Example throughout the New-Teſtament, for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing by pouring, or ſprinkling Water upon the Perſon, nor for Baptiſing Infants of believing Parents, though ſaid <hi>Johnſon <q>ſays much for it by way of Argument and Reaſoning, and pleads for it in the room of Circumciſion.</q>
                     </hi> Yet all that he hath ſaid makes no Proof; but let the Reader Read what I have Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, together with his Anſwer, and Judge as he pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="unknown:007622_0175_102BACBC45E9CB40"/>
In pag. 26, ſaid <hi>Johnſon</hi> ſays, <q>Where in all the Scripture do we find the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance, or Notice of the civil Ruler Limited, or Reſtrained to things Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral only?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer,</p>
                  <p>We Read, Gen. 49.10. <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from Judah, nor a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver from between his Feet until Shiloh come, and unto him ſhall the gathering of the People be;</hi> and whereas 'tis ſaid, <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from Judah, &amp;c.</hi> That is, the typical Kingdom, and Laws ſhould be given to them to Rule by, and to continue 'till CHRIST's Coming. And whereas 'tis ſaid, <hi>and to him ſhall the gathering of the People be;</hi> That is, by Faith, that he might Rule, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them in Righteouſneſs, and in Peace. Alſo, Luk. 1.32, 33. <hi>The LORD ſhall give unto him the Throne of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther David, and he ſhall Reign over the Houſe of Jacob for ever, and of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom there ſhall be no end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So it appears there was no Power giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to other Kings to Rule in matters of Religion before CHRIST came; but only to them Kings, and Prieſts which
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007622_0176_102D74F1ACBA2A30"/>

                  <p>Not in matters of Religion, but only in temporal Things; for both the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and rewards of the civil Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are all Temporal, and CHRIST has left no Rule for any of his Church, ſo to Rule one over another: But his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is contrary. Luke 22.25, &amp;c. <hi>And he ſaid unto them, The Kings of the Gentiles exerciſe lordſhip over them; and they that exerciſe authority upon them, are called Benefactors. But ye ſhall not be ſo; but he that is greateſt among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth ſerve. For whether is greater, he that ſitteth at meat, at he that ſerveth? is not he that ſitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that ſerveth;</hi> alſo Matt. 20.25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

We ought to conſider that the Rulers, that the Apoſtles <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to ſubmit our ſelves to, were Heathen, that worſhipped Idols; and both theſe Apoſtles ſuffered Death for not ſubmitting to the ſame Rulers in matters of Religion; and ſo did many Thouſands more, by which it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the Apoſtles did not mean to Command us to obey Magiſtrates in matters of Religion, but only as the Apoſtles did themſelves, in temporal Things, to <hi>follow peace with all men,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <hi>Paul</hi> ſays nothing about happy <hi>Influence and Government;</hi> but he exhorts to Pray for all Men, one as well as another ſaying, <hi>This is Good, and Acceptable in the ſight of GOD our Saviour, who will have all Men to be Saved, and to come to the knowlege of the Truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.1, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Said <hi>Johnſon</hi> ſaiths, Pag. 27. <q>It is Propheſied concerning the Gentile Church and the Church in the Goſpel Day: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 23. That Kings ſhall be their nurſing Fathers, and Queens their nurſing Mothers.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>This was concerning their return out of Captivity, and was fulfilled in that Day by <hi>Cyrus</hi> and others, whom God raiſed up to be their nurſing Fathers, and nurſing Mothers: Alſo Hag. 2.7. &amp;c. 'tis ſaid, <hi>I will ſhake all Nation,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007622_0180_102D74F5077E5D90"/>
and the deſire of all Nations ſhall come, and I will fill this Houſe with Glory ſaith the LORD of Hoſts: The Silver is mine, and the Gold is mine, ſaith the LORD of Hoſts: The Glory of this Houſe ſhall be greater than the former ſaith the LORD of Hoſts.</hi> Thus it appears, that GOD found ways to reſtore them with Silver, and Gold, and all things needful to build his Houſe, with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Priſt-hood alſo, which the Scripture ſhews were all Typical, and were to continue 'till CHRIST came; but now in the Goſpel 'tis ſaid, Heb. 3.6. <hi>CHRIST as a Son over his own Houſe, whoſe Houſe art we,</hi> &amp;c. And the Faith he works in us is much more precious than Gold that Periſheth, I Pet. 1.7. But if it were a Promiſe that Kings ſhould be their nurſing Fathers, and Queens their nurſing Mothers in the Goſpel Day, when has it been fulfilled? We know that the Apoſtles and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians endured much Perſecution; and the Reformers out of Popery endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Much Perſecution; and our fore Fathers endured Perſecution in EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GLAND and therefore came into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart Land, but when GOD Tent his Meſſengers to reform our Fathers,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007622_0181_102D71429282BD30"/>
they were alſo Perſecuted, and this hath been the practice to this Day, as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>He that will live Godly in CHRIST JESUS ſhall ſuffer Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.12.</p>
                  <p>One who felt the Perſecution in <hi>New-England,</hi> ſaith thus,</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>'<hi>New-England</hi> for Religion did leave her native Land,</l>

                     </l>
                     <l>'And ſurely for Religion, ſhe made this Reſolution,</l>
                     <l>'To come and leave her native Place to ſhun her Perſecution:</l>
                     <l>'But ſoon ſhe turns to Perſecute, by which it does appear,</l>
                     <l>'That ſhe is not the ſame ſhe was when firſt ſhe did come here:</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>And truly <hi>New-England</hi> has ſhewed; more bitter Spirit of Perſecution than any other part of the Kingdom, by Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the Quakers in a more cruel man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, even unto Death.</p>
                  <p>Further ſaith <hi>Johnſon,</hi> 
                     <q>Is the civil Ruler to be a terror to evil doers?

                  <p>Anſwer,</p>
                  <p>When he hath purged all evil doers out of the Common-wealth, we may hope he will find none in the Church. And as for Blaſphemy, the civil Ruler had need be very careful leſt as the <hi>Jews</hi> who Perſecuted CHRIST for Blaſphemy, he alſo Perſecute him in his Members. <hi>Paul</hi> and the Martyrs Worſhipped GOD in the way which their Perſecutors called Hereſie; and as to the many other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Principles, or Doctrines, ſaid <hi>Johnſon</hi> has named the civil Ruler may now be as liable to be miſtaken as others were before him.</p>
                  <p>Said <hi>Johnſon</hi> ſaith, Pag. 28. <q>Who then dare be ſo bold as to put aſunder, what GOD hath joined together?</q> (meaning the Church, and civil Rulers.)</p>
                  <p>Anſwer,</p>
                  <p>The Church of CHRIST is joined to himſelf who is her Head, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23. and over which he ought to Rule: But both Himſelf and his Church have been

Perſecuted, even to this Day: As it was fore-told by him, and his Apoſtles; and it hath been the Practice of the falſe Church, to join with the Rulers to ſtrive to put CHRIST, and his Church aſunder whom GOD hath joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>Said <hi>Johnſon</hi> further ſaith, <q>
                        <hi>Who dare be ſo brazen Fac'd, and loſt to all Medeſty as to ſay, the civil Ruler has nothing to do with the Church?</hi>

                  <p>Anſwer,</p>
                  <p>It was a brazen Face in the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and Teachers at all Times when they have preſumed to ſit in CHRIST's Seat to Judge in caſes of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or things relating to the Worſhip of GOD.

from among you:</hi> O <hi>New-Engliſh Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el!</hi> — After ſuch <hi>humbling</hi> Things as have befallen us, God forbid that it ſhould be ſaid of us as in Jer. 44.10. <hi>They are not humbled, even unto this Day.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <q>Let them look upon all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations round about them, and ſee if they can find any Compare, as to Perſecution, or the Judgments that have followed; I ſay, that <hi>New-England,</hi> above all others, ſhould be a Land of Judgment, and not of Mercy, muſt needs Argue, that there is a Cauſe for it, more than Ordinary.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I doubt not, but moſt other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are Guilty of other Sins, as well as Them, (Except Hypocris;ie and Perſecution to that Degree as they are) and yet they have not been puniſhed in ſo Eminent a Manner as <hi>New-England;</hi> which ſhews that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s;ecution is a Capital Sin; and that tho'
<hi>C. M.</hi> hath confeſſed largely their other Sins, as well as their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and alſo, in pretence, preſt an Enquiry into the Cauſe of it, as if there might be ſome further Cauſe of their Affliction, than they have yet found out; yet its plain they have

not yet pitch'd on the Right, or confeſt the Chief Sins of it, <hi>viz:</hi> Their Perſecutions, and Murthers; <hi>and that the accurſed things,</hi> as he ſays, <hi>ſtill remains among them. — Theſe</hi> (as Sir WALTER RALEIGH ſays) <hi>were the lovers of other Mens Miſeries; and Miſery found them out.</hi>
