            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE following directions were drawn up at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Proprietor of the Mineral Spring and Bath, at Harrogate, whoſe laudable diſpoſition to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the health of his fellow-citizens, at the riſk of his property, merits the encouragement of every friend of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. Thoſe directions, which relate to the uſe of the mineral water, are extracted chiefly from an eſſay read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Philoſophical Society in the year 1773, by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, on the mineral waters of Philadelphia, Abington and Briſtol, and afterwards publiſhed in a pamphlet. The analyſis of the water at Harrogate will be laid in due time before the Society. It will be ſufficient for the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, who uſe it for the preſent, to know that it is very light, and that it contains a ſmall quantity of iron, with a large quantity of air, which has lately received the name of hepatic air, and from which its offenſive ſmell and taſte are derived.</p>
            <p>The directions for the uſe of the Cold Bath will derive their principal merit from their according with the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and advice of the moſt approved writers upon that ſubject.</p>

            <head>DIRECTIONS FOR THE USE OF THE <hi>MINERAL WATER.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE different ſtages of ſociety, like the different ages of the human body, have their peculiar diſeaſes.— In the infancy of all ſocieties diſeaſes are ſimple and few in number, but in proportion as they advance in arts and opulence, which always bring along with them the refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of luxury, diſeaſes multiply, and are complicated in ſuch a manner, as to require more powerful aids than the ſimple preparations of plants and metals. Theſe aids have been ſought for from a variety of ſources, but from none oftener than mineral waters. Theſe waters, which have flowed for many years unnoticed by our anceſtors, have of late attracted the attention of the public, and have now become a very important part of the Materia Medica.</p>
            <p>The mineral water, which is to be the ſubject of the following directions, when taken into the body, is gently ſtimulating and tonic, promotes the urinary ſecretion, and perſpiration, and ſometimes gently opens the bowels.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>OF THE DISEASES IN WHICH THIS MINE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAL WATER IS PROPER.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THIS water is proper in the HYSTERIA.—This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order ſhews itſelf in a variety of ſhapes. It is known by attacking the female more than the male ſex; eſpecially ſuch as are of a delicate habit, by being accompanied with flatulencies, contractions of the muſcles of the belly, and a ſenſe of ſomething reſembling a ball riſing in the throat.—It prevails moſt in warm climates and ſeaſons; and laſtly, it is always ſubject to exacerbations from any cauſe that ſuddenly affects and diſturbs the mind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is proper in the PALSY, whether of part or of the whole of the body, when the pulſe is not
<pb facs="unknown:019971_0004_0FAD4977512CBA80"/>
full, and when the ſymptoms of a plethora are wanting; it is always a ſtrong preſumption of the propriety of uſing theſe waters, where the diſeaſe has continued a long time, without any remarkable change in the ſymptoms.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the EPILEPSY, when it ariſes from an affection of the ſtomach, or the womb, or from a general weak habit of body, this water is proper.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It may be drank with advantage in a certain ſtage of the GOUT, particularly when it comes on in the decline of life.—The conſtitution then exhibits various marks of great debility; the gouty affection in conſequence of this, inſtead of appearing in the feet, ſhews itſelf in a weakneſs, nauſea and acidity of the ſtomach. Theſe ſymptoms are generally accompanied with coſtiveneſs and flatulency of the bowels.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is uſeful in an old obſtinate Diarrhoea or an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual purgings, when not accompanied with a griping or a diſcharge of blood mixed with the ſtools. Sailors returning from long voyages, or from warm climates, are moſt ſubject to this diſorder.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It affords the moſt certain relief in all caſes of a WANT OF APPETITE, when it originates from a defect in the ſtomach. The appetite may be diſtroyed by cauſes which operate directly or indirectly upon the ſtomach. Thoſe which operate directly are tea, ſpirituous liquors, and bitters taken in an immoderate quantity, or at impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per times, too full meals, ſtrong vomits, and warm drinks of all kinds; the cauſes which operate indirectly on the ſtomach are all ſedative paſſions of the mind, ſuch as, grief, fear, love, &amp;c. together with whatever weakens or diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the other parts of the ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>We ſhall hereafter point out what kind of diet ſhould be joined with the mineral water, in this diſorder.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is proper in all thoſe COLICS, which ariſe from mere weakneſs of the bowels, and particularly in that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which is accompanied with an overflowing of the bile, a diſeaſe this to which the inhabitants of warm climates are moſt ſubject.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Beſides theſe diſeaſes, in which the nervous ſyſtem is chiefly affected, this mineral water is uſeful in all OB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STRUCTIONS OF THE LIVER AND SPLEEN, whether they are brought on by indolence, intemperance, or intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fevers, and whether they ſhew themſelves in a mere
<pb facs="unknown:019971_0005_0FAD49780A784470"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>elling and hardneſs, or a jaundice, a cough or a dropſy. If the dropſy it ſhould be given only while it continues to operate by urine or ſtool; for this purpoſe it ſhould be drank not in the uſual manner, but in large quantities.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It is proper in all caſes of CHRONIC RHEUMATISM. It will be more efficacious in this diſorder if the fleſh bruſh be uſed at the ſame time.</p>
               <p n="10">10. It is very uſeful in the PILES, eſpecially when they occur in that ſtage of life in which the artereal plethora yield to the venous. This ſeldom happens till the thirty-fifth or thirty-ſixth year of life,</p>
               <p n="11">11. In all FEMALE OBSTRUCTIONS and weakneſſes, which are accompanied with general languor and debility of the whole ſyſtem, this water affords conſiderable relief.</p>
               <p n="12">12. It may be given with advantage to children afflicted with WORMS. Here it acts like bark, rhubarb, aloes and bitters of all kinds <hi>indirectly</hi> upon the worms, by giving a proper tone to the bowels. Among the many ſubſtances which deſtroy them <hi>directly,</hi> there are few more powerful than sugar, honey, ſalt and ripe ſummer-fruits; all children ſhew a fondneſs for theſe things. The appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite in this early period of life is not corrupted by habit or vitiated by diſeaſe, and may therefore be liſtened to as the voice of nature. Theſe ſubſtances ſhould be given upon an empty ſtomach, and the patient ſhould not eat any thing for an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p n="13">13. It is proper in all CUTANEOUS DISEASES and foul ulcers of long ſtanding, whether they be of ſcorbutic or ſcrophulous nature.—The part affected ſhould be waſhed with the mineral water twice a-day.</p>
               <p n="14">14. It is uſeful in diſeaſes of the KIDNEYS and BLAD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER, when a difficulty or obſtruction in making water ariſes from relaxation or ſmall calculi in theſe organs.</p>
               <p n="15">15. It has been uſed with ſucceſs in obſtinate GLEETS, after the moſt powerful aſtringent medicines have been uſed to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Let us next enquire in WHAT DISEASES THIS WATER IS HURTFUL.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the HYPOCHONDRIAC DISORDER it is an improper remedy.—Although this diſorder is ſometimes joined with
<pb facs="unknown:019971_0006_0FAD4978CAF13948"/>
Hyſteria, yet it is diſtinct from it in its nature, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a very different treatment.—It is known by its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking the male more than the female ſex, by its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing moſt in cold ſeaſons and climates, and by its being accompanied with acidity, flatulency, coſtiveneſs or a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arrhoea, an entire want of, or an inordinate appetite, pain in the ſtomach and breaſt after eating, a vomiting, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual diſcharge of ſpittle from the mouth, colic, &amp;c. In this diſorder all preparations of iron have been found hurtful. It is a little extraordinary, that a draught of warm water, will ſometimes create an appetite in this diſorder, after bitter and aromatic medicines have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It has ſometimes been recommended in the PHTHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIS PULMONALIS or conſumption of the lungs.—But I doubt much whether a chalybeate water ever cured or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved a true conſumption, whether brought on by an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, tubercles, or ulcers.-In every ſtate of the human bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, when the inflammatory diatheſis prevails, this water is improper—that it prevails in the conſumption we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the hard pulſe and ſizy appearance of the blood.</p>
               <p>This water we ſaid is improper in all diſeaſes, when an inflammatory diatheſis prevails.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is hurtful therefore in moſt caſes of HEMORRHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GY, or praeternatural diſcharges of blood from the body. Hemorrhagies are either active or paſſive: the former hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen before, the latter after the thirty-fifth or thirty-ſixth year of life. It is in the former in which the inflammatory diatheſis chiefly prevails. They are known by an increaſe of tone and action of the arterial ſyſtem, and by all the common ſymptoms of plethora.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This water is likewiſe hurtful for the ſame reaſon in the ACUTE RHEUMATISM and GOUT. This latter diſeaſe reſembles the former a good deal, in its ſeat, ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and methods of cure, when it attacks in the early period of life. It appears at the uſual ſeaſons of inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory diſorders, and is accompanied with a degree of inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory diatheſis. It is now called the tonic gout, to diſtinguiſh it from that which comes on in the decline of life, and which, from the irregularity of its ſeat, times of acceſſion, and ſymptoms, is called the anomalous or atonic gout.</p>

               <head>THE MANNER OF USING THIS WATER</head>
               <p>The quantity to be drank daily of this water muſt be determined by the conſtitution and diſeaſe of the patient. Too large a draught at firſt has ſometimes produced very diſagreeable effects, which have diſcouraged patients from giving it a fair trial. They ſhould be guarded againſt this, and in ſome caſes, when the uſe of it is clearly indicated, they ſhould be encouraged to look upon its harſh operation at firſt as a preſage of its doing much good. The beſt method for people of delicate habits, is to begin with a gill or half a pint and increaſe it gradually to five or ſix half pints in a day. Formerly the chalybeate water was drank in a much larger quantity, but experience has taught us that three pints or two quarts at moſt in a day is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to produce all the ſalutary effects we have reaſon to expect from it.</p>
               <p>The patient has always drank too much, if he becomes feveriſh and perceives an uneaſy ſenſe of heat in his breaſt, immediately after taking the water.</p>
               <p>He ſhould drink it if poſſible at the fountain head, as its virtue is much impaired by being deprived of its air.—The beſt time for drinking it is early in the morning, at noon and in the evening, upon an empty ſtomach.—The patient ſhould always walk or ride, or uſe ſome gentle exerciſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after drinking it. When we want to promote perſpiration, it ſhould be drank juſt before the patient goes to bed,—In ſome diſeaſes, which require theſe waters, the ſtomach is oftentimes ſo weak as to reject them even in the ſmalleſt quantity; when this is the caſe, the water ſhould be mixed with a little cinnamon or mint water, or the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach ſhould be prepared for it by ſome grateful aromatic tincture. I have heard of a Lady who could retain a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeate water on her ſtomach only when ſhe drank it in bed, and remained there an hour or two afterwards; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved her of the complaint for which ſhe drank it.</p>
               <p>If the water ſhould not keep the bowels gently open, the patient ſhould make uſe of ſuch laxative medicines as will beſt ſuit his diſorder.</p>
               <p>It may be drank for ſeveral months in any ſeaſon of the year, eſpecially in the ſpring, ſummer and autumn; it is a good practice to intermit it now and then for a few days, leſt it ſhould loſe its efficacy by habit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="unknown:019971_0008_0FAD497A4EBEBC08"/>It would encroach too much upon our plan, to mention the particular diet, which the ſeveral diſeaſes, we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, require. The patient ſhould obſerve the moſt ſtrict regard to the quantity of his food. This caution is the more neceſſary, as the water ſometimes excites an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial appetite, which it is by no means ſafe to gratify fully. Four or five ſmall, are better than one or two full meals in a day for valetudinarians, upon the account of their being leſs ſtimulating.</p>
               <p>In all caſes of indigeſtion, acidity, flatulency, &amp;c. in the ſtomach, patients ſhould abſtain from vegetables, and live as much as poſſible upon an animal diet. Beef and mutton will be found much eaſier of digeſtion in theſe caſes than what are commonly called the white meats.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>
                        <q>The younger an animal is, the more it poſſeſſes of a vegetable nature, and of courſe the leſs it is diſpoſed to corruption. In proportion as it grows old, it looſes its vegetable nature, and tends to alkaleſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and hence it becomes more ſuſceptible of putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. By the ſtrength of the organs of maſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, digeſtion, &amp;c. in full grown animals, vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble food is completely animalized.</q>

               </p>
               <p>This diet ſhould not be continued too long. In propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the ſtomach recovers its tone, the patient ſhould gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually return to the uſe of vegetables or to mixed aliment. What Dr. Cadogan ſays of milk, we may ſay of vegetables, that it is generally a ſign the ſtomach requires them, when it cannot bear them.</p>
               <p>In all cutaneous and ſcorbutic diſeaſes, foul ulcers, &amp;c. the patient ſhould live entirly upon vegetables, provided he is not very old or of a weak habit.</p>
               <p>There can be no other objection to patients drinking this water with all their meals, than the danger of looſing their efficacy by too conſtant a uſe. The ingenious female au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of "The hiſtory of putrefaction," has proved by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, that chalybeate waters haſten the diſſolution and putrefaction of aliment.</p>
               <p>After all that has been ſaid upon this ſubject, we muſt acknowlegde, that mineral waters, like moſt of our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, are only ſubſtitutes for temperance and excerciſe in chronic diſeaſes. An angel muſt deſcend from heaven and

                  </gap>uble this chalybeate pool, before we can expect any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary effects from its uſe alone. There is a great reſemblance between the fate of medicine and religion. In every age and country an article of faith or a mode of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip have uſurped the place of the precepts of morality. Thus in medicine we find a variety of remedies ſuch as mercury, bark, ſteel, woodlice, tar, lime and mineral wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of all kinds, pine buds, ginſeng, &amp;c. have been put in the place of temperance and exerciſe. The faſhion of the former paſſes away, but the effects of the latter, like the obligations of morality, endure forever.</p>

               <head>DIRECTIONS FOR THE USE OF THE <hi>COLD BATH.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>It would be an eaſy taſk to collect a variety of facts in favor of the antiquity and uſefulneſs of the Cold Bath, and to ſhew that it has been recommended by the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, uſed by the Philoſophers and praiſed by the Poets of every age and country, both as the means of health and pleaſure; but this would be foreign to the ſimple deſign of the preſent eſſay.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed to deliver directions for the uſe of the cold bath, I ſhall take notice in a few words of its uſual effects upon the body, and mention the diſeaſes, in which it is a proper or a doubtful and improper remedy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> effect of the cold bath is, to waſh off impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of all kinds from the ſkin, and thereby to promote a free and equal perſpiration.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. By its preſſure it drives the fluids from the ſurface to the internal parts of the body. Hence the quick and and ſometimes difficult reſpiration which is generally felt after plunging into cold water.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. It braces the animal fibres, and thereby increaſes their tone and ſtrength. And</p>
               <p n="4">4th. It ſtimulates the whole nervous ſyſtem, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by favors the more eaſy action of the vital, animal and natural functions of the body.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> advantage of the cold bath, which I ſhall mention, is that it prevents the diſeaſes of warm weather. By its tonic action upon the nervous ſyſtem, it diminiſhes
<pb facs="unknown:019971_0010_0FAD497BD040DF98"/>
its ſenſibility to heat, and thereby ſecures the conſtitution from the painful as well as morbid effects of the ſummer months. Children therefore (who ſuffer ſo generally from warm weather) and perſons ſubject to fevers or nervous complaints, ſhould uſe the cold bath, in the Months of June, July and Auguſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. In the chronic Rheumatiſm and atonic Gout the cold bath is a ſafe and powerful remedy.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. In diſeaſes attended with a relaxation of the nervous ſyſtem, the cold bath promiſes relief. Thoſe diſeaſes may be reduced to the following heads:
<list>

               </p>
               <p>The good effects of the cold bath in the laſt named diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order have lately been fully aſcertained by Dr. Wright of the iſland of Jamaica.</p>
               <p n="4">4th. In thoſe obſtructions of the liver and ſpleen, which follow autumnal fevers, and which are not attended with inflammation, the cold bath may be uſed with advantage.</p>
               <p n="5">5th. The exceſs and defect of that evacuation which is connected with the health of the female conſtitution, have both been relieved by the cold bath. It not only cures theſe diſeaſes, but frequently removes barrenneſs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents abortion. Its agreeable effects upon female beauty, would furniſh materials for many pages, but theſe are fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to the ſubject of the preſent eſſay.</p>
               <p n="6">6th. In eruptions and diſeaſes of the ſkin of all kinds, the application of cold water in the form of a bath, has often produced the moſt ſalutary effects.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now point out thoſe conſtitutions and diſeaſes in which the uſe of the cold bath is doubtful or improper.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. In very old people, and in habits, where the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of nature have been exhauſted by intemperance, or long and waſting diſeaſes, the cold bath is a doubtful remedy.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:019971_0011_0FAD497CF88B76C0"/>2d. In full habits, where from the manner of life, or from the peculiar make of the body, or from previous diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we have reaſon to ſuſpect a diſpoſition to Apoplexy or Palſy, the cold bath ſhould be uſed with great caution, and never till previous evacuations have been made from the bowels or the blood veſſels.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. In a Plethora of the lungs whether it manifeſts it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by pain, a difficulty of breathing, or by a ſpitting of blood, the cold bath is never proper. It has ſeldom been uſed with advantage or even ſafety, in conſumptive caſes. How far an union of the cold bath with other remedies that determine powerfully to the ſkin, might prove uſeful in the conſumption of the lungs, remains to be determined hereafter by bold experiments and accurate obſervations</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>OF THE TIME AND MANNER OF USING THE COLD BATH.</head>
               <p>The beſt time for uſing the cold bath, is in the morning before breakfaſt. A ſhort walk, or a moderate degree of exerciſe, is ſometimes neceſſary to prepare the body for the action of the cold water upon it, eſpecially in the middle of ſummer, when the heat of a cloſe room and a feather-bed<note n="*" place="bottom">Patients, who uſe the cold bath, will find its good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects more certain, if they at the ſame time ſleep upon a matraſs.</note> the proceeding night, are ſo apt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe relaxation, or promote weakning ſweats. The ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the water is applied to the whole body the better. The head ſhould be expoſed to the coldneſs and preſſure of the water, as nearly as poſſible at the ſame inſtant, with the other parts of the body. The inconveniencies ariſing from wetting the hair, may be obviated by the patients covering his head, before he goes into the bath, with an oiled cloth or bladder cap. From one to three minutes will be long enough in moſt caſes, to remain in the bath.</p>
               <p>A patient may always know when he has uſed the bath improperly or ſtaid too long in the water, when he feels a chillineſs or pains in his head or breaſt, which do not ſoon yield to the warmth of the air, or to gentle exerciſe; on the contrary, it is a promiſing ſign of future benefit from the bath, when a patient, upon coming out of the water feels a ſudden glow of heat diffuſe itſelf over the whole
<pb facs="unknown:019971_0012_0FAD497D43E58730"/>
body, accompanied with a chearful and animated tone of mind.</p>
               <p>The good effects of the bath will be increaſed, by the patients employing a friend or a ſervant to rub the body for a quarter or half an hour with a fleſh-bruſh, or where this cannot be had, with a piece of flannel or coarſe linnen cloth, immediately after he comes out of the bath. As ſoon as he is dreſſed he ſhould devote from half an hour to an hour to gentle exerciſe, either by walking or riding on horſe-back, or in a carriage, according to the degrees of his ſtrength, or the nature of his diſorder.</p>
               <p>To <hi>preſerve</hi> health, it will be ſufficient to uſe the cold bath from once a-day to three times a-week. To <hi>reſtore</hi> health in moſt diſeaſes it ſhould be uſed every day, but in diſeaſes of an obſtinate nature, or that have been of a long duration, it ſhould be uſed every morning and evening. It will only be neceſſary to add here, that when a patient uſes the bath twice in a day, he ſhould avoid going into it too ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dining, and ſhould not uſe it ſo late in the evening, as to prevent his taking the exerciſe formerly recommended after it.</p>
               <p>I conſider the ſhower bath as a ſubſtitute for the plunging bath. It was invented only to gratify the weak and indolent. I do not condemn it; on the contrary, I think it may be uſed with advantage in caſes of great weakneſs, where the plunging bath is improper. In diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes too, where the uſe of the plunging bath is of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful iſſue, it ſhould always be prefered. Perhaps in moſt caſes, where there exiſts a dread of the ſhock from the weight or coldneſs of the water, the mind as well as the body may be prepared to ſuſtain them both, by the uſe of the ſhower bath for a few days.</p>
