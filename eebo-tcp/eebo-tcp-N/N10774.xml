            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <q>FENELON has left us a treatiſe on the education of women. Since his time, other authors, more or leſs celebrated, have written on the ſame ſubject; and there is ſtill room for a treatiſe on female educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But to ſupply that want is not the immediate deſign of this piece: the Author here only preſents an hiſtorical picture, an aſſemblage of facts and obſervations, which may ſerve as the elements of a didactic work. It will perhaps ſhew, that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:013650_0003_0F919BE08E92E560"/>are ſuſceptible of all the qualities which religion, ſociety, or government, would chuſe to aſſign them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the foregoing preamble, M. Thomas proceeds to tell us, that this Eſſay muſt be conſidered as part of a Hiſtory of the Manners. Viewed in that light, it is perhaps the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete performance hitherto publiſhed; and it is indiſputably the moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, and moſt philoſophical treatiſe, on the female mind and female cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. But, notwithſtanding theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, it appeared to the Editor to want a good deal more than tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to make it ſatisfactory to the Engliſh reader. The ſentences were often complicated, and the paragraphs tedious. It had none of thoſe larger diviſions, which are ſo neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:013650_0004_0F919BE19828A970"/>the mind, nor any of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior ones, which are not leſs eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the perſpicuity of reaſoning. He therefore in ſome meaſure decom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it; he ſplit the ſentences, broke the paragraphs, and divided the work into parts and ſections: he omitted ſome things<note n="*" place="bottom">His omiſſions conſiſt only of ſuch things as ſeemed foreign to the ſubject, and which can only intereſt a Frenchman, and a lover of <hi>éloge.</hi>
                     </note>, and added others. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the progreſs of ſociety in Britain is entirely new. In ſhort, he is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for the defects of the Eſſay, as it now appears; though he has not the vanity to claim its beauties. Thoſe who are acquainted with the original, however, he doubts not will give him credit for his labours.</p>

                     <p>IF we take a ſurvey of ages and of countries, we will find the women—almoſt without exception—at all times, and in all places, adored and oppreſſed. Man, who has never neglected an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of exerting his power, in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing homage to their beauty, has always availed himſelf of their weakneſs. He has been at once their tyrant and their ſlave.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="2" facs="unknown:013650_0008_0F919BE468830090"/>
Nature herſelf, in forming beings ſo ſuſceptible and tender, appears to have been more attentive to their charms than their happineſs. Continually ſurrounded with griefs and fears, the women more than ſhare all our miſeries, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſubjected to ills which are peculiarly their own. They cannot be the means of life without expoſing themſelves to the loſs of it. Every revolution which they undergo alters their health, and threatens their exiſtence. Cruel diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers attack their beauty—and the hour which confirms their releaſe from thoſe, is perhaps the moſt melancholy of their lives. It robs them of the moſt eſſential, and, in ſome reſpects, the moſt endearing characteriſtic of their ſex. They can then only hope for protection from the humiliating claims of pity, or the feeble voice of gratitude.</p>
                     <p>Society, inſtead of alleviating their condition, is to them the ſource of new miſeries. More than one half of the globe is covered with ſavages; and,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:013650_0009_0F919BE651DCD870"/>among all thoſe people, women are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely wretched. Man, in a ſtate of barbarity, equally cruel and indolent, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by neceſſity, but naturally inclined to repoſe, is acquainted with little more than the phyſical effects of love; and having none of thoſe moral ideas, which only can ſoften the empire of force, he is led to conſider it as his ſupreme law, ſubjecting to his deſpotiſm thoſe whom reaſon had made his equals, but whoſe imbecillity betrayed them to his ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>'Nothing' (ſays profeſſor Millar, ſpeaking of the women of barbarous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,) <q>can exceed the dependence and ſubjection in which they are kept, or the toil and drudgery which they are obliged to undergo.—The huſband, when he is not engaged in ſome war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like exerciſe, indulges himſelf in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and devolves upon his wife the whole burden of his domeſtic affairs. He diſdains to aſſiſt her in any of thoſe ſervile employments; ſhe ſleeps in a different bed, and is ſeldom permitted
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013650_0010_0F919BE683450D28"/>to have any converſation, or correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with him.<note n="*" place="bottom">Obſervations concerning the Diſtinction of Ranks in ſociety.

                     </p>
                     <p>The women among the Indians of America are what the helots were among the Spartans, a vanquiſhed people obliged to toil for their conquerors. Hence, on the banks of the Oroonoko, we have ſeen mothers ſlaying their daughters out of compaſſion, and ſmothering them in the hour of their birth. They conſider this barbarous pity as a virtue.</p>
                     <p>'The men' (ſays Commodore Byron, in his account of the inhabitants of South America,) <q>exerciſe a moſt deſpotic au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over their wives, whom they conſider in the ſame view they do any other part of their property, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them accordingly: even their common treatment of them is cruel; for though the toil and hazard of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing food lies entirely on the women,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013650_0011_0F919BE833FDA1A0"/>yet they are not ſuffered to touch any part of it, till the huſband is ſatisfied; and then he aſſigns them their portion, which is generally very ſcanty, and ſuch as he has not a ſtomach for himſelf.<note n="*" place="bottom">Byron's Narrative.</note>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Among the nations of the Eaſt, we find another kind of deſpotiſm and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion prevail—the ſeraglio, and the domeſtic ſervitude of women, authoriſed by the manners, and eſtabliſhed by the laws. In Turky, in Perſia, in India, in Japan, and over the vaſt empire of China, one half of the human ſpecies is oppreſſed by the other.</p>
                     <p>The exceſs of oppreſſion in thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries ſprings from the exceſs of love.</p>
                     <p>All Aſia is covered with priſons, where beauty in bondage waits the caprices of a maſter. The multitudes of women there aſſembled have no will, no incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, but his. Their triumphs are
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013650_0012_0F919BE93ADA4CA8"/>only for a moment; and their rivalry, their hate, and their animoſities continue till death. There the lovely ſex are obliged to repay even their ſervitude with the moſt tender affection; or, what is ſtill more mortifying, with the counterfeit of an affection which they do not feel: There the moſt gloomy tyranny has ſubjected them to creatures, who, being of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſex, are a diſhonour to both: There, in ſhort, their education tends only to debafe them; their virtues are forced; their very pleaſures are involuntary and joyleſs; and, after an exiſtence of a few years—till the bloom of youth is over— their period of neglect commences, which is long and dreadful.</p>
                     <p>In the temperate latitudes, where the climate giving leſs ardour to paſſion leaves more confidence in virtue, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have not been deprived of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; but a ſevere legiſlation has at all times kept them in a ſtate of dependence. One while they were confined to their own apartments, and debarred at once from buſineſs and amuſement; at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013650_0013_0F919BE99C759D30"/>time, a tedious guardianſhip de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded their hearts and inſulted their underſtandings. Affronted in one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by poligamy, which gives them their rivals for their inſeparable companions; enſlaved in another by indiſſoluble ties, which often join the gentle to the rude, and ſenſibility to brutality; even in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where they may be eſteemed moſt happy, conſtrained in their deſires, in the diſpoſal of their goods, robbed of freedom of will by the laws, the ſlaves of opinion, which rules them with abſolute ſway, and conſtrues the ſlighteſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances into guilt; ſurrounded on all ſides by judges who are at once their tyrants and their ſeducers, and who, after having prepared their faults, puniſh every lapſe with diſhonour—nay uſurp the right of degrading them on ſuſpicion; who does not feel for the tender ſex? Yet ſuch, I am ſorry to ſay, is the lot of women over the whole earth. Man, with regard to them, in all climates and in all ages, has been either an inſenſible or an oppreſſor; but they have ſometimes experienced the cold and deliberate oppreſſion of pride,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013650_0014_0F919BEA5165DB80"/>and ſometimes the violent and terrible tyranny of jealouſy. When they are not beloved, they are nothing; and when they are, they are tormented.

We cultivate in you that humanity, which makes you feel for the misfortunes of others; and our tears forewarn you of your own danger. Nay, you cannot be ignorant, that we have need of courage not leſs than you. More feeble in ourſelves, we have perhaps more trials to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Nature aſſails us with ſorrow, law and cuſtom preſs us with conſtraint, and ſenſibility and virtue alarm us by their continual conflicts. Sometimes alſo the name of citizen demands from us the tribute of fortitude. When you offer your blood to the ſtate, think that it is ours.

                     <p>All men however, it muſt be owned, have not been equally unjuſt to their fair companions. In ſome countries public honours have been paid to women.

Without entering into circumſtantial details, which might perhaps diſguſt by their uniformity, I ſhall inquire, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, what are the qualities and the kinds of merit of which women are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable; how far government, laws, and circumſtances can raiſe them; and ſhall attempt to diſcover the ſecret connections of policy with their manners.

                     <p>WE find in the writings of Plutarch, the panegyriſt and the judge of ſo many great men, a piece intituled, THE VIRTUOUS ACTIONS OF WOMEN. It is addreſſed to one of the ſex, named CLEA, of whom we know little. But her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the philoſopher of Chaero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea alone, has been deemed ſufficient, by ſome writers, to claſs her among the number of learned women.</p>
                     <p>Plutarch begins his performance with blaming thoſe, who would deprive wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of that praiſe which is their due. 'One might,' ſays he, <q>make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon between Anacreon and Sappho, between Semiramis and Seſoſtris, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Tanaquil and Servius, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Brutus and Portia. The talents
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013650_0021_0F919BF10A1A3268"/>and the virtues are modified by the circumſtances and the perſons, but the foundation is the ſame; the colour and the ſurface, ſo to ſpeak, are only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The philoſophical hiſtorian next pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to mention a great number of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of all nations, who have given ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of their courage, and who have ſhewn a generous contempt of death.</p>
                     <p>He inſtances the Phoenician women; who, before an engagement which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the deſtruction of their city, agreed to bury themſelves in the flames, if the battle ſhould be loſt, and crowned with flowers the woman who firſt made that motion in the council.</p>
                     <p>He tells us of other women, who, in a city beſieged, made the men bluſh for a ſhameful capitulation;—of women, who, ſeeing their ſons and their huſbands flee in battle, ran before them, and obſtructed their paſſage, forcing them to return, to death or to victory;—of women, who,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013650_0022_0F919BF1E73AE090"/>during the time of a ſiege, mounted the walls, defended their city, and bravely repulſed the enemy:—of women who reſiſted deſpotiſm and oppreſſion, and who, as ſoon as the tyrant was ſlain, ran dancing before the conſpirators, and crowned them with their own hands;—of ſome, who themſelves gave liberty to their country;—of ſeveral, who expoſed themſelves to death, and loaded themſelves with chains to ſave their captive huſbands:—and he takes particular notice of Camma, who poiſoned herſelf at the altar, that ſhe might poiſon the murderer of her huſband; and who, turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the aſſaſſin, ſaid,</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I have only lived to revenge the death of my ſpouſe—It is done. Thee, this moment, I order, in place of a nuptial bed, to prepare thyſelf a tomb.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He likewiſe inſtances the women of Gaul, who, in the time of a civil war, threw themſelves between two armies ruſhing to battle, and ſeparated, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled the combatants. As a reward
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013650_0023_0F919BF4CF6C5D40"/>for which act of valour, they had the honour of being admitted into the public councils, and ſometimes of being choſen the arbiters of nations.</p>
                     <p>To theſe great and generous qualities, by which women ſeem to riſe above themſelves, Plutarch has joined the ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to men more attractive virtues, as being more natural to the ſex. He praiſes the women of an iſland of the Archipelago, where, during the courſe of ſeven years, he ſays, there was neither an inſtance of weakneſs in a young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor of infidelity in a married wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: — And he relates an anecdote of the Mileſian virgins, which merits the attention of a philoſopher. Multitudes fell by their own hands — doubtleſs in that trying age, when nature giving birth to reſtleſs and turbulent deſires, inflames the imagination; and when the heart, aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at new wants, which virtue forbids it to gratify, feels pining melancholy ſucceed to the ſportful tranquillity of childhood. Nothing could ſtop the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion. A law was made condemning
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013650_0024_0F919BF5B7C88480"/>the firſt who ſhould be guilty of ſelf-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to be brought naked, and expoſed in the market-place. Thoſe young women were not afraid of death; but they were afraid of ſhame, even after death. Not one of them henceforth made an attempt upon her life.</p>
                     <p>Plutarch in the ſame piece relates ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anecdote, which, even at this day, might afford an excellent leſſon of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical oeconomy. A king, who believed that riches conſiſted in gold, obliged the greater part of his ſubjects to labour in the mines. They all periſhed. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining inhabitants of the country had recourſe to the quen. She ordered an artificer to make privately the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of bread, of meat, and of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds of fruits, of gold; and, when the king returned from a journey, ſhe had them ſerved up to him. The view pleaſed him very much; but, at length, he grew hungry, and deſired to have ſomething to eat. The queen replied.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="19" facs="unknown:013650_0025_0F919BF64B9028C8"/>
                        <q>We have nothing but gold. Your lands are uncultivated: they produce nothing. I have ſet before you what you love, and all that now remains to us of a once plentiful and populous kingdom.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The king ſaw, and corrected his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.</p>

                     <head>SECTION II. Of the Grecian WOMEN.</head>
                     <p>BESIDES his general treatiſe on the actions of women, Plutarch has left us a piece in honour of the Spartan dames. There he cites a variety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, which demonſtrate their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and vigour of mind; there we find beings and virtues very different from thoſe of the ſame ſex with which we have occaſion to be acquainted: — Nature ſacrificed to patriotiſm; honour ranked before affection; the name of citizen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the name of mother; tears of joy ſhed over the body of a ſon pierced
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013650_0026_0F919BF7087C5148"/>with wounds; the maternal hands armed againſt a ſon guilty of cowardice; the mandate of death conveyed to a ſon ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of a crime; and ſorrow, and even compaſſion, regarded as a weakneſs, or as an inſult! —</p>
                     <p>He gives us a ſingular inſtance, in a Spartan woman, of intrepidity and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in a ſtate of ſervitude. A priſoner, and ſold as a ſlave, the queſtion was put to her, 'What knoweſt thou?' — 'To be free!' ſhe replied; and, when her maſter commanded what ſhe deemed ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious, ſhe cooly ſaid, <q>You are unworthy of me:</q> and reſigned herſelf to death.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who have not been accuſtomed to look beyond their own times, and who conclude what women have been, from what they are; and thoſe, more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, who are ignorant what eſſects a legiſlation conceived in one head, and combined in all its branches, can produce on the mind, will be at a loſs to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, how a ſex that ſeems rather formed
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013650_0027_0F919BF7C97E5028"/>for ſenſibility than fortitude, ſhould poſſeſs ſo much courage. It ſprung from the vigour of ancient laws.</p>
                     <p>Among the Greeks, who were almoſt all republicans, the manners of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men became neceſſarily bold and auſtere. The retreats where they ſpent their lives ſubdued their deſires; the poverty of the public denied the means of corruption; and the apprehenſion of national honour exalted their ſentiments. They had an ambition of not being behind their ſons, their brothers, and their huſbands; and, not being able to attract them by feminine arts, they boldly trod in their footſteps.</p>
                     <p>Other cauſes co-operated to place the women of thoſe early ages on a level with the men. In the era of the formation of ſtates, when ſociety is only emerging from barbariſm, the toils and the dangers of the two fexes are nearly the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The republics, or the kingdoms of Greece, conſiſting often only of one city, were continually either threatened with
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013650_0028_0F919BF8830262C0"/>war, or were the ſcene of blood. National animoſities, inflamed by the claſhing of intereſts, were more ardent, and leſs eaſily extinguiſhed than in our times. The wars of Europe are now only the means, and the manner of deciding the quarrels of princes: they were then the awakened paſſions of the people. The inhabitants of one ſtate fought for the lives of the inhabitants of another. Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory condemned the women to ſlavery. Such a condition was an aſylum againſt death, and might ſometimes be alleviated by the favour of a maſter, but could never protect them from diſhonour.</p>
                     <p>The uncertainty of the laws, in the particular ſtates of Greece, and the ſhocks of liberty, opened a door to tyrants. The right to command, was then a right to abuſe it. To aſcend the throne, was to be a robber and an aſſaſſin. The citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen knew not thenceforth what he had to fear, to hope, or to ſuffer.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants of one place were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in oppoſition and bloodſhed, and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013650_0029_0F919BF942BC16A8"/>choſe of another were engaged in dark conſpiracies, where women were admitted to the myſteries, and ſometimes employed as the miniſters of vengeance; for the ills complained of extended to them, and they had often more to loſe than their lives. The two ſexes then kept pace with each other: their courage was great, becauſe the occaſions of exerting it were many and trying.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame periods, and from the ſame impulſe, both Europe and Aſia were over-run by invaſions and emigrations of armed multitudes; and, among all thoſe wandering people, the two ſexes encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the ſame hardſhips and the ſame perils. The women would therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly acquire a habit of fortitude; — and, as the virtue of the ſofter ſex has its exiſtence in pride — as indolence is almoſt always the companion of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction — as the practice of ſurmounting dangers teaches us to ſubdue ourſelves — as the life of thoſe women was either altogether active, or altogether retired; — and, as they could know nothing of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013650_0030_0F919BFB62172C40"/>that anxious leiſure of ſociety, where imagination eternally out-runs deſire, and the ſoul is at once corrupted by all its ſenſes, they would join to their courage a high and delicate apprehenſion of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: — and theſe are, indeed, the two qualities aſſigned by Plutarch to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of thoſe early times, both Greeks and Barbarians.</p>
                     <p>But, in the different eras of Grecian hiſtory, we muſt not ſuppoſe that the women were always the ſame. It appears that the manners in the iſles of Greece, in general, were much purer than on the continent. Thoſe iſlanders, by being leſs expoſed to foreign intercourſe, could more eaſily preſerve their laws and their virtues. The warlike convents of Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon, the nurſeries only of ſoldiers, would be much more rigid than the ſmiling retreats of Athens, whence po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs was propagated, and faſhion an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced; and the city of Thebes, where a ruſtic groſſneſs ſupplied the place of an elegant luxury, muſt have been very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from Corinth, which on account
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013650_0031_0F919BFD4B4813A8"/>of its ſituation and commerce, obtained the name of THE TWO SEAS OF WEALTH AND PLEASURE.</p>
                     <p>In proportion as their Inſtitutions were corrupted, the virtues of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, we may conclude, were loſt. But the rank which the courtezans enjoyed, even in the brighteſt ages of Greece, and particularly at Athens, is one of the greateſt ſingularities in the manners of any people. By what circumſtance could that order of women, who debaſe at once their own ſex and ours — in a country where the women were poſſeſſed of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, and the men of ſentiment — arrive at diſtinction, and ſometimes even at the higheſt degree of reputation and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? — Several reaſons may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for that phenomenon in ſociety.</p>
                     <p>In Greece, the courtezans were in ſome meaſure connected with the religion of the country. The goddeſs of Beauty had her altars: and ſhe was ſuppoſed to protect proſtitution, which was to her a ſpecies of worſhip. The people invoked
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013650_0032_0F919BFE4F206020"/>Venus in times of danger; and, after a battle, they thought they had done ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Miltiades and Themiſtocles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Laiſes and the Glyceras of the age had chanted hymns to their goddeſs.</p>
                     <p>The courtezans were likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with religion by means of the arts. Their perſons afforded models for ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which were afterwards adored in the temples. Phrine ſerved as a model to Praxiteles for his Venus of Cnidus: and, during the feaſts of Neptune near Eluſis, Appelles having ſeen the ſame courtezan on the ſea-ſhore, without any other veil than her looſe and flowing hair, was ſo much ſtruck with her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, that he borrowed from it the idea of his Venus riſing from the waves.</p>
                     <p>They were therefore connected with ſtatuary and painting; as they furniſhed the practiſers of thoſe arts with the means of embelliſhing their works.</p>
                     <p>The greater part of them were ſkilled in muſic; and, as that art was attended
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013650_0033_0F919C004D3178D0"/>with higher effects in Greece than it has ever been in any other country, it muſt have poſſeſſed, in their hands, an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible charm.</p>
                     <p>Every one knows, how enthuſiaſtic the Greeks were of beauty. They adored it in the temples; they admired it in the principal works of art; they ſtudied it in the exerciſes and the games; they ſought to perfect it by their marriages, and they offered rewards to it at the public feſtivals. But virtuous beauty was ſeldom to be ſeen. The modeſt women were confined to their own apartments, and were viſited only by their huſbands and neareſt relations. The courtezans offered themſelves every where to view; and their beauty, as might be expected, obtained univerſal homage.</p>
                     <p>Society only can unfold the beauties of the mind: modeſt women were excluded from it. The courtezans of Athens by living in public, and converſing freely with all ranks of people, upon all manner of ſubjects, acquired by degrees a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013650_0034_0F919C00C8202788"/>of hiſtory, of philoſophy, of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, and a taſte in the whole circle of the arts. Their ideas were more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and various, and their converſation was more ſprightly and entertaining, than any thing that was to be found among the virtuous part of the ſex. Hence their houſes became the ſchools of elegance. The poets and the painters went there to catch the fleeting forms of grace, and the changeable features of ridicule; the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians to perfect the delicacy of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; and the philoſophers, to collect thoſe particulars of human life which had hitherto eſcaped their obſervation. The houſe of Aſpaſia was the reſort of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates and Pericles, as that of Ninon was of St. Evremont and Conde. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from thoſe fair libertines taſte and politeneſs, and they gave them in exchange knowledge and reputation.</p>
                     <p>Greece was governed by eloquent men; and the celebrated courtezans having an influence over thoſe orators, muſt have had an influence on public affairs. There was not one, not even
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013650_0035_0F919C01848155E8"/>the thundering, the inflexible Demoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenes, ſo terrible to tyrants, but was ſubjected to their ſway. Of that great maſter of eloquence it has been ſaid: <q>What he had been a whole year in erecting, a woman overturned in a day?</q> That influence augmented their conſequence; and their talent of pleaſing increaſed with the occaſions of exerting it.</p>
                     <p>The laws and the public inſtitutions, indeed, by authoriſing the privacy of women, ſet a high value on the ſanctity of the marriage vow. But in Athens, imagination, ſentiment, luxury, the taſte in arts and pleaſures, was oppoſite to the laws. The courtezans therefore may be ſaid to have come in ſupport of the manners.</p>
                     <p>There was no check upon public li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs; but private infidelity, which concerned the peace of families, was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as a crime. By a ſtrange, and perhaps unequalled ſingularity, the men were corrupted, — yet the domeſtic man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were pure. It ſeems as if the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezans
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013650_0036_0F919C02783CD9C0"/>had not been conſidered to belong to their ſex; and, by a convention to which the laws and the manners bended, while other women were eſtimated merely by their virtues, they were eſtimated only by their accompliſhments.</p>
                     <p>Theſe reaſons will, in ſome meaſure, account for the honours which the vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Venus ſo often received in Greece. Otherwiſe we ſhould have been at a loſs to conceive, why ſix or ſeven writers had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted their talents to celebrate the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezans of Athens<note n="*" place="bottom">See Athenaeus.</note>; why three great painters had uniformly devoted their pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils to repreſent them on canvaſs; and why ſo many poets had ſtrove to immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talize them in their verſes. We ſhould hardly have believed, that ſo many illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious men had courted their ſociety; that Aſpaſia had been conſulted in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations of peace and war; that Phrine had a ſtatue of gold placed between the ſtatues of two kings, at Delphos; that, after death, magnificent tombs had been erected to their memory.</p>

                     <head>SECTION III. Of the Roman WOMEN.</head>
                     <p>AMONG the Romans, a grave and auſtere people, who during five hundred years were unacquainted with the elegancies and the pleaſures of life, and who, in the middle of furrows and of fields of battle, were employed in til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage or in war, the manners of the women were a long time as ſolemn and ſevere as thoſe of the men, and without the ſmalleſt mixture of corruption or of weakneſs.</p>
                     <p>The time when the Roman women began to appear in public marks a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular era in hiſtory. In the infancy of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013650_0039_0F919C0544C50220"/>the city, and even till the conqueſt of Carthage, ſhut up in their houſes, where a ſimple and ruſtic virtue paid every thing to inſtinct, and nothing to elegance; ſo nearly allied to barbariſm, as only to know what it was to be wives and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; chaſte, without apprehending they could be otherwiſe; tender and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate, before they had learned the meaning of the words; occupied in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ignorant that there were other pleaſures, they ſpent their life in retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in nurſing their children, and in rearing to the republic a race of labourers or of ſoldiers. Nor were they inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the other parts of domeſtic oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy: virtuouſly happy during the night, in the receſs of more important cares, they were employed through the day in working alternately at the loom and at the ſpindle.</p>
                     <p>The habits of the moſt illuſtrious Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, for many ages, were ſpun by their wives, or by their ſiſters. Even Auguſtus, when lord of the world, remained an example of that ancient ſimplicity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="unknown:013650_0040_0F919C06E002CF18"/>
The Roman women, during that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod were reſpected over the whole earth. Their victorious huſbands reviſited them with tranſport, at their return from battle; they laid at their feet the ſpoils of the enemy, and exalted, and endeared themſelves in their eyes, by the wounds which they had received for them and for the ſtate. Thoſe warriors often came from impoſing commands upon kings, and, in their own houſes, accounted it an honour to obey. In vain the too rigid laws had made them the arbiters of life and death: more powerful than the laws, the women ruled their judges. In vain the legiſlature, foreſeeing the wants which exiſt only among a corrupt people, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted divorce; the indulgence of the polity was proſcribed by the manners.</p>
                     <p>Such was the influence of beauty at Rome, before the licentious intercourſe of the ſexes had corrupted both, debaſing the one by the other: and every mean it appears was uſed to prolong the happy period, and preſerve the purity of female manners.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="unknown:013650_0041_0F919C07F3F1AF08"/>
A ſevere guardianſhip, from which no age relieved the unmarried women; the cenſure of the magiſtrates; the domeſtic tribunals; the laws for preventing their luxury, by fixing their dowries; the ſumptuary laws, for regulating their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments; the temples erected to chaſtity, and to a goddeſs who preſided over the peace of marriages and the reconciliation of ſpouſes; decrees of the ſenate in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of women who had been ſerviceable to the ſtate; all demonſtrate the attention which that warlike people paid to the ſofter ſex, and to their virtues, as long as they had any themſelves.</p>
                     <p>The Roman matrons do not ſeem to have poſſeſſed that military courage, which Plutarch has praiſed in certain Greek and Barbarian women. They par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took more of the nature of their ſex; or, at leaſt, they departed leſs from its character. Their firſt quality was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. Every one knows the ſtory of Cato the cenſor, who ſtabbed a Roman ſenator for kiſſing his own wife, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his daughter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="36" facs="unknown:013650_0042_0F919C084DBAF420"/>
To theſe auſtere manners the Roman women joined an enthuſiaſtic love of their country, which diſcovered itſelf upon many great occaſions. On the death of Brutus, they all clothed themſelves in mourning. In the time of Coriolanus, they ſaved the city. That incenſed war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, who had inſulted the ſenate and the prieſts, and who was ſuperior even to the pride of pardoning, could not reſiſt the tears and the entreaties of the women: They melted his obdurate heart. The ſenate decreed them public thanks; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the men to give place to them upon all occaſions; made an altar be erected on the ſpot where the mother had ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened her ſon, and the wife her huſband; — and the ſex were permitted to add ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ornament to their head-dreſs.</p>
                     <p>It is to be wiſhed, that our modern la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies could aſſign as good a reaſon for the ſize of their caps.</p>
                     <p>The Roman women ſaved the city a ſecond time, when beſieged by Brennus. They gave up all their gold as its ranſom.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013650_0043_0F919C09031ABD20"/>For that inſtance of their generoſity, the ſenate granted them the honour of having funeral orations pronounced from the roſtrum, in common with patriots and heroes. — After the battle of Cannae, when Rome had no other treaſures but the virtues of her citizens, the women ſacriſiced both their gold and their jewels. A new decree rewarded their zeal.</p>
                     <p>Valerius Maximus, who lived in the reign of Tiberius, and who has left us a book which is a more ſingular monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of great virtues than of good taſte, has ſeveral eſſays in praiſe of the Roman women. But theſe are leſs panegyrics than detached hiſtories, to which he has ſometimes given the ſtyle and the manner of the oration. We have good reaſon to think ſo, ſince the celebrated Portia, the daughter of Cato, and the wife of Brutus, is not there forgot; nor that Julia, the wife of Pompey, who died of terror, at ſeeing the robe of her huſband tinged with his blood; nor that young Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who, in priſon, ſupported her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by her milk; nor ſeveral other
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013650_0044_0F919C0AE891E128"/>illuſtrious women, who, during the time of the proſcriptions, expoſed their lives to ſave their huſbands.</p>
                     <p>The ſame writer, in extolling the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, touches alſo on the talents of the Roman women. He informs us that, in the ſecond triumvirate, the three aſſaſſins who governed Rome, thirſting after gold not leſs than blood, and having already practiſed every ſpecies of robbery, and worn out every method of plunder, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to tax the women. They impoſed a heavy contribution upon each of them. The women ſought an orator to defend their cauſe, but found none: nobody would reaſon againſt thoſe who had the power of life and death. The daughter of the celebrated Hortenſius alone appeared: ſhe revived the memory of her father's abilities; and ſupported with intrepidity her own cauſe, and that of her ſex. The ruffians bluſhed, and revoked their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Hortenſia was conducted home in triumph; and had the honour of having given in one day, an example of courage
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013650_0045_0F919C0B4C747230"/>to men, a pattern of eloquence to women, and a leſſon of humanity to tyrants.</p>
                     <p>But the era of the talents of women at Rome, is to be found under the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; when ſociety was more perfected by opulence, by luxury, by the uſe and abuſe of the arts, and by commerce. Their retirement was then leſs ſtrict; their genius, more active, was more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted; their heart had new wants; the idea of reputation ſprung up in their minds; their leſure increaſed with the diviſion of employments. They had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile offices, which the women of rank left — if I may ſo expreſs myſelf — to the people: they had thoſe of a higher claſs, which were ſoon ſilled. During upwards of ſix hundred years, the virtues had been found ſufficient to pleaſe; they now found it neceſſary to call in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments. They were deſirous to join admiration to eſteem, till they learned to exceed eſteem itſelf: for, in all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, in proportion as the love of virtue diminiſhes, we find the value of talents to increaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="40" facs="unknown:013650_0046_0F919C0C0767C468"/>
A thouſand cauſes concurred to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this revolution of manners among the Romans. The vaſt inequality of ranks; the enormous fortunes of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals; the ridicule affixed by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial court to moral ideas; all contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to haſten the period of corruption. Then vice had no curb. The exceſſive deſire of ſhews brought a low and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs freedom into faſhion. Women con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with each other, who ſhould bribe higheſt for the embraces of a player. They ſixed their hearts and their eyes upon the ſtage, to devour the movements of a pantomime. A dancer, or a jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gler, ſwallowed up the patrimonies, and gave heirs to the deſcendants of the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pios and the Emiliuſes. Debauchery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced fertility. They learned to cheat nature. The art of producing abortions completed the deteſtable practice. The paſſions, always craving, always gratified; and the women tired of all, cloyed of all, multiplied in Rome the monſters of Aſia: they mutilated their ſlaves, to ſatisfy the new caprices of an imagination jaded even with pleaſure itſelf. The vices became
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:013650_0047_0F919C0D06BFFB48"/>more powerful than the laws. It was no longer the ſtudy of the magiſtrate to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the manners, but to puniſh crimes; and ſometimes their number, and their nature, was ſo alarming, that it became neceſſary for public juſtice to cover her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a veil: becauſe there would have been no leſs danger than ſhame in taking notice of all the guilty.</p>
                     <p>When Septimus Severus mounted the throne, he found three thouſand accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of adultery on the roll. He was obliged to lay aſide his plan of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                     <p>In that age, the rank of the women appears to have been more frequently praiſed than the virtue, and the talents, or accompliſhments, than the manners.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of the empire, ſeveral funeral orations were pronounced at Rome in honour of women: the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Junia, the ſiſter of Brutus, and the wife of Caſſius; the oration of the Empreſs Livia, the mother of Tiberius;
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013650_0048_0F919C0D8403F440"/>that of Octavia, ſpoken by Auguſtus; and that of Poppaea, by Nero. The firſt may be ſaid to be the eulogy of virtue, ſtill ſevere and republican. The ſecond ought to mark the gradation of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the women of a common-wealth to their manners in a court, and under monarchical government.</p>
                     <p>The manners of Livia partook of both periods, and of both governments. She was connected with the republic by a remnant of ſimplicity; and, to uſe the words of Tacitus, <q>by the ſanctity of her houſe:</q> She was connected with the monarchy by a boundleſs ambition, by a deſire of reputation, by a ſtudied deceit, by the art of happily employing the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of her ſex — in ſhort, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue and addreſs applied by turns to great or to trifling purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>The third oration, or that of Octavia, the ſiſter of Auguſtus, the wife of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony, and the virtuous and tender rival of Cleopatra, was the eulogy of beauty rendered intereſting by misfortunes, and
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:013650_0049_0F919C1066CC8690"/>mingled with great events, of which ſhe was rather the victim than the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Theſe panegyrics might paſs without reprehenſion; but the eulogy of Poppaea pronounced by an Emperor and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded by the Romans, was a proof of the laſt ſtage of corruption<note n="*" place="bottom">Tacit. Ann. XVI. 6.</note> It ſeemed to inſinuate, that all the women con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the imperial houſe, or who entered there, had a right to be praiſed in the ſame manner after their death. Several of them, while on the throne, were publicly abandoned in their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; but the apotheoſis repaired all. Religion was even leſs ſtrict than the manners: it was eaſier to obtain the rank of a goddeſs, than the character of a virtuous woman.</p>
                     <p>There were ſtill however ſome virtues among the Roman women; but theſe were remarkable. The greater part of them owed their birth to Stoiciſm, which, under the firſt emperors, ſpread itſelf to
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:013650_0050_0F919C108CBED140"/>Rome. Stoiciſm is to the manners, what republican ſeverity is to government. It revived in ſome houſes the ancient vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; but with this difference, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the Romans may be ſaid to have ſucked in virtue with their milk; it was a kind of habitual inſtinct, and the happy effect of example and of laws: now, to reſiſt the torrent of corruption, it was neceſſary to poſſeſs cultivated manners, firm opinions, and philoſophical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources. It was likewiſe neceſſary to have principles; for cold reaſon could not long have held our: it was neceſſary to poſſeſs a certain enthuſiaſm, which at once animated and ſupported the ſoul; which propoſed to itſelf a dignity ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to man, that it might elevate him to the height of his powers; which deſpiſed pleaſure, that it might hate vice; which withſtood ſorrow and compaſſion, that it might fortify itſelf againſt weakneſs; which, in ſhort, in places where guilt was all powerful by authority and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, where men were enſlaved by all things, rendered man independent of all things — but of moral obligation; and
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:013650_0051_0F919C118D048CD0"/>which, raiſing him above this ſublunary ſcene and all its deluſive joys, made him his own cenſor, his preceptor, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templator, and his judge.</p>
                     <p>Such was the doctrine of the Stoics. It was therefore highly neceſſary at Rome in this period, as a powerful counterpoiſe to an enormous weight; and it produced, indeed, in that city the moſt amazing contraſts: — the moſt exalted courage was often found by the ſide of the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing cowardice, and the moſt rigid auſterity in the neighbourhood of the moſt ſhameleſs licentiouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>It is worthy of remark, that Stoiciſm never produced ſuch great effects in Greece as in Rome. As there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extravagant in its nature, it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps requires extraordinary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to give it energy. Great wants and great evils are neceſſary to create great virtues. Stoiciſm reſembles thoſe mechanical powers, which increaſe in proportion to their reſiſtances.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="unknown:013650_0052_0F919C1211A7AF10"/>
Several illuſtrious Romans, nurſed in this ſect, diſplayed the virtues which it inſpired: and the women, more ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of habits than of principles, and almoſt always governed by the manners, which ſtrike them more forcibly, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the conduct of their huſbands or of their fathers. Portia had given the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. The daughter of Cato, and the wife of Brutus, ſhe was raiſed to the very ſummit of their ideas. In the conſpiracy againſt Caeſar, ſhe ſhewed herſelf worthy to be aſſociated with the firſt of human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and truſted with the fate of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires. After the battle of Philippi, ſhe would neither ſurvive liberty nor Brutus, but died with the bold intrepidity of Cato.</p>
                     <p>The example of Portia was followed by that Arria, who ſeeing her huſband heſitating, and afraid to die, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him, pierced her own breaſt, and delivered to him the dagger with a ſmile<note n="*" place="bottom">The name of Arria's huſband was Petus. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their death has afforded Martial the ſubject of an elegant Epigram; which may be thus paraphraſed.
<lg>
                              <l>When to her huſband Arria gave the ſword,</l>
                              <l>Which from her chaſte, her bleeding breaſt ſhe drew,</l>
                              <l>She ſaid, "My Petus, this I do not feel;</l>
                              <l>"But—oh! the wound, that muſt be made by you!"</l>
                           </lg>
                           <lg>
                              <l>She could no more—but on her Perus ſtill,</l>
                              <l>She fix'd her feeble, her expiring eyes;</l>
                              <l>And, when ſhe ſaw him raiſe the pointed ſteel,</l>
                              <l>She ſunk—and ſeem'd to ſay, "Now Arria dies!"</l>
                           </lg>
                        </note>; by Arria's daughter, the wife
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:013650_0053_0F919C12CAD7B608"/>of Thraſea, and by the daughter of Thraſea, the wife of Helvidius Priſcus, both worthy of having had for their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands men of the greateſt virtue and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; by Paulinia, the wife of Seneca, who made her veins be opened at the ſame time with her huſband's; and who, forced to live, during the few years which ſhe ſurvived him, <q>bore in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,' ſays Tacitus, 'the honourable teſtimony of her love, a PALENESS which proved that part of her blood had ſympathetically iſſued with the blood of her ſpouſe.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame exalted virtues were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, though in a different manner, by Agrippina, the wife of Germanicus; who, naturally haughty and ſenſible,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:013650_0054_0F919C13863E7320"/>after the death of that great man, buried herſelf in retirement in all the bloom of youth; and who, neither bending her ſtatelineſs under Tiberius, nor allowing herſelf to be corrupted by the manners of her age, as implacable in her hatred to the tyrant as ſhe had been faithful to her huſband, ſpent her life in lamenting the one and in deteſting the other. Nor ſhould the celebrated Epinina be forgot, whom Veſpaſion ought to have admired — but whom he ſo baſely put to death.</p>
                     <p>It is remarkable, that not one of thoſe extraordinary women had the honour of a funeral oration. But that avails little: their virtues were preſerved by Tacitus. Two lines of that author are of more weight with poſterity than all the pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrics that ever were pronounced.</p>
                     <p>I do not mean to ſpeak of all the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated women of the empire; but Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian, Herodian, Philoſtratus, and Dion, take notice of a woman poſſeſſed of a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and a ſpecies of merit ſo very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from any of thoſe that I have had
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:013650_0055_0F919C14454F7F40"/>occaſion to mention, as to claim my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attention. It is the empreſs Julia, the wife of Septimus Severus: born in Syria, and the daughter of a prieſt of the Sun, it was predicted, that ſhe ſhould riſe to ſovereign dignity. Her character juſtified the prophecy.</p>
                     <p>Julia, while on the throne, loved, or pretended paſſionately to love letters. Be it taſte, be it a deſire of knowledge, be it a deſire of reputation — be it all theſe, or be it what it may that induced her, ſhe ſpent her life with philoſophers. Her rank of empreſs would not perhaps have been ſufficient to ſubdue thoſe bold ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; but ſhe joined to that the more powerful influences of wit and beauty. Theſe three kinds of empire rendered leſs neceſſary to her that which conſiſts only in art; and which, attentive to their taſtes and their weakneſſes, governs great minds by little means. It is ſaid that ſhe was a philoſopher. Her philoſophy how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever did not extend ſo far as to give chaſtity to her manners. Her huſband, who did not love her, valued her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:013650_0056_0F919C15450537A0"/>ſo much that he conſulted her upon all occaſions. She governed in the ſame manner under his ſon. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude her character, empreſs and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of ſtate, occupied at the ſame time about literature and politics, and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her pleaſures freely with both, having courtiers for her loyers, ſcholars for her friends, and philoſophers for her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, in the middle of a ſociety where ſhe reigned and was inſtructed, Julia ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the higheſt celebrity; but, as among all her excellencies we find not thoſe of her ſex, the virtues of a woman, our admiration is loſt in blame. In her lifetime ſhe obtained more praiſe than reſpect; and poſterity, while is has done juſtice to her talents and her accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, has agreed to deny her eſteem.</p>
                     <p>After this extraordinary woman, we find Julia Mammaea, of the ſame family, and who was likewiſe an empreſs, or at leaſt mother to an emperor. Her merit was to have united genius and valour; but, above all, to have educated for the throne, her ſon, the young Alexander
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:013650_0057_0F919C172DFF2968"/>Severus, nearly in the ſame manner as Fenelon afterwards educated the duke of Burgundy. She made him at once vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and intelligent.</p>
                     <p>In following the courſe of hiſtory, the illuſtrious Zenobia, though not of Roman extraction, preſents herſelf to view—A princeſs no leſs worthy, than happy, to have had Longinus for her preceptor; who knew as well to write as to conquer; who was afterward unfortunate with dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and who conſoled herſelf for the loſs of a throne, and the pleaſures of grandeur, with the ſweets of ſolitude, and the joys of reaſon.</p>
                     <p>All theſe women received high enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums from the writers of their age;— which have ſince ſerved to ſwell the ſize of all the panegyrics of celebrated wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                     <p>We have ſtill remaining two panegyrics on empreſſes: one is the panegyric of Euſebia, the wife of Conſtance. She was the protectreſs of Julian. It was ſhe
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:013650_0058_0F919C1753E21A68"/>likewiſe who raiſed him to the imperial throne; and, by that ſecret charm which wit and beauty have over even tyrants themſelves, ſhe often prevented the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical cruelties of a prince, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to aſſaſſinate thoſe whom he feared. Julian, who owed to her, life and empire, compoſed her panegyric, His gratitude has not made him eloquent.</p>
                     <p>The other panegyric is written by Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian: it is in dialogue, and in the form of a portrait. We do not know pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely whom it is deſigned for; but the commentators, who are always in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſuch ſecrets, have not failed to tell us that it is the panegyric of an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. Be that as it may, we may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to a affirm, that it is the original of forty or fifty thouſand portraits of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roines or of princeſſes, which, four hundred years after, had been made in France, in Italy, or in Spain, by the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, hiſtorians, poets, and romance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writers of thoſe times, who frequently beſtow on one woman all the perfections of the ſex.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="unknown:013650_0059_0F919C18072B3868"/>
It is the firſt trace which we find among the ancients of that light ſpirit of gallantry, which is ſo faſhionable among the moderns; and which conſiſts in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to women, with a warm tongue and a cold heart, all that we do not believe, and all that we would have them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. This rant, which is the offspring of inſenſibility and affectation, and which joins bombaſt to falſehood, owes its birth to Lucian; and muſt have proceeded from the corruption of the manners of the empire, from the levity natural to the Greeks of his time, and from ſome peculiarity in his own character. The head may declaim, but the heart only knows how to praiſe.</p>

                     <head>SECTION IV. Of the Effects of Chriſtianity on the Manners of WOMEN.</head>
                     <p>WE have already ſeen, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution in the government of Rome, was followed by a change in the manners; but, towards the third century,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:013650_0060_0F919C196295D608"/>they underwent a new and more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able change.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto the manners of the women had been only founded on morality, and had no connection with religious ideas. The manners had been united to the policy of ſome countries; but the laws had traced different lines, according to the different plans of legiſlation, for the commencement and termination of the virtues of women.</p>
                     <p>The dances, and the dreſs of the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan virgins, are well known. According to Monteſquieu, Lycurgus had murdered modeſty, and chaſtity itſelf.</p>
                     <p>At Rome, women had been ſeen to dance publicly on the ſtage, without the ſlighteſt veil between their nakedneſs and the eyes of the people: and, if Cato re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from ſuch a ſpectacle, the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates and the prieſts there attended.</p>
                     <p>The arts of painting and ſculpture, which chiefly delighted in imitating na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:013650_0061_0F919C198B23D650"/>ſimple and unattired, contributed farther to ſeduce the imagination by means of the ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>Philoſophy had no fixed principles for women. Sometimes it combated, and would have extinguiſhed in them, that ſweet ſentiment which is at once the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard and the charm of their ſex<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſchool of the Cynies, which regarded modeſty as a dangerous allurement, and made it a duty to baniſh it from ſociety.</note>; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it taught that the tender union, which ſuppoſes a perpetual contract of hearts, was only the tie of a moment, deſtroyed by the moment that followed<note n="†" place="bottom">Syſtème de la Communauté des Femmes dans un Etat.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Religion itſelf was only a kind of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred policy, which had rather ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies than precepts. The ancients ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured their gods, as we honour our great men: they offered them incenſe, and expected their protection in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change. The gods were their guardians, not their legiſlators.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="unknown:013650_0062_0F919C1A873375C8"/>
Chriſtianity, which now began to ſpread itſelf over the earth, was a legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. It impoſed the moſt ſevere laws upon women, and upon manners. It ſtrengthened the marriage knot. To the political, it added a ſacred tie; and, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified between the bench and the altar, placed the matrimonial engagements un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the juriſdiction of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Not ſatisfied with regulating the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Chriſtianity extended its empire even to the thoughts. Above all it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated the ſenſes. It waged war even with ſuch inanimate objects as might be the accomplices of ſeduction, or were the means of delight. In a word, rouſing vice in her ſecret cell, it made her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her own tormentor, and condemned all the guilty to bluſh, by a forced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their weakneſſes.</p>
                     <p>The legiſlation of the Greeks and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans referred the motive of every action to the political intereſt of ſociety; but the new and ſacred legiſlation, inſpiring only contempt for this world, referred all
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:013650_0063_0F919C1B20A77B58"/>things to a future and very different ſtate of exiſtence. Hence ſprung the idea of an unknown perfection.</p>
                     <p>The detachment of the ſenſes, the reign of the ſoul, and an inexpreſſibly ſublime and ſupernatural ſomething, which blended itſelf with both, became the doctrine of a body of people. Hence the vow of continence, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of celibacy.</p>
                     <p>Life was a combat. The ſanctity of the manners threw a veil over nature and over ſociety. Beauty was afraid to pleaſe; valour dropt his ſpear; the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were taught to ſubmit; and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of the ſoul increaſed every day by the ſacrifices of the ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>The women, who generally poſſeſs a lively imagination and a warm heart, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted themſelves to virtues which were as flattering as they were difficult, which were no leſs elevated than auſtere. It is almoſt a matter of indifference to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whether high paſſions are to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:013650_0064_0F919C1BC6D6AFC8"/>or ſubdued. The ſoul is pleaſed with its efforts; and, provided it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted, it ſignifies little though its activity ſhould be turned againſt itſelf.</p>
                     <p>The diſciples of Chriſtianity were far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taught to love and comfort one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, like children of the ſame family. In conſequence of this doctrine, the more virtuous as much as the more tender ſex, converting to pity the ſenſibility of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, — the uſe and abuſe of which religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taught them equally to fear, — devoted their lives to the ſervice of indigence and diſtreſs. Delicacy learned to overcome diſguſt; and the tears of beauty were ſeen to flow in the huts of miſery, and in the cells of diſeaſe, with the friendly ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a ſiſter.</p>
                     <p>The perſecutions which aroſe in the empire ſoon after the introduction of Chriſtianity, afforded that religion a new opportunity of diſcovering its efficacy. To preſerve the faith, it was often neceſſary to ſuffer impriſonment, baniſhment, and death. Courage then became neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="unknown:013650_0065_0F919C1C8DB8D140"/>
There is a deliberate courage, which is the reſult of reaſon, and which is equally bold and calm: It is the courage of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and of heroes. There is a courage which ſprings from the imagination, which is ardent and precipitant; and ſuch is moſt commonly the courage of martyrs, or the religious courage.</p>
                     <p>The courage of the Chriſtian women was founded upon the nobleſt motives. Animated by the glorious hope of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, they embraced flames and gibbets, and offered their delicate and feeble bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the moſt excruciating tortures.</p>
                     <p>This revolution in the ideas and in the manners, was followed by another in the writings. Such as made women their ſubject, became as auſtere and ſeraphic as they.</p>
                     <p>Almoſt all the doctors of thoſe times, to whom the church has aſſigned the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound title of ſaints and of orators, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to admiration the Chriſtian women. But he who ſpeaks of them with moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:013650_0066_0F919C1D4C01F980"/>and with moſt zeal, is Saint Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom; who, born with a ſoul of fire, ſpent twenty-four years in writing, in combat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in conquering himſelf.</p>
                     <p>The manners of this ſaint were proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more ſevere than his thoughts. He had a number of illuſtrious women at Rome among his diſciples. But, though ſurrounded with beauty, he eſcaped weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without eſcaping ſlander; and, fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world, the women and himſelf, he retired to Paleſtine; where all which he had quitted purſued him ſtill, tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him under the penitential ſackcloth, and, in the middle of ſolitary deſerts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>echoed in his ears the tumult of Rome.</p>
                     <p>Such was Saint Jerom, the moſt elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent panegyriſt of the Chriſtian women of the fourth century. That warm and pious writer, though generally harſh and obſcure, ſoftens his ſtyle in a thouſand places to praiſe the Marcellas, the Paulas, the Euſtochiums, and many other Roman women, who at the Capitol had embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Chriſtianity, and ſtudied in Rome
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:013650_0067_0F919C1E328B6078"/>the language of the Hebrews, to read and underſtand the books of Moſes.</p>
                     <p>When the Roman empire, like ſome venerable column, was puſhed from its baſe, and broke in pieces by the myriads of the North, Chriſtianity paſſed from the conquered to the conquerors, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entirely by the zeal of the women; who, at the ſame time, diffuſed the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and ſoftened the manners of ſavages.</p>
                     <p>It is obſerved, that the Chriſtian wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have, in all ages, been more anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of making proſelites than the men. Whether it be that their weakneſs takes advantage of the ſacred opinions, which are the greateſt ſupport to the ſoul; that their imagination, more lively, is more ſtrongly inflamed by objects which are above nature, and ſometimes even above reaſon; that the religious principles of men are more connected with reflection, and thoſe of women with ſentiment; — for the one, we know, has much more activity than the other; — that they look upon Chriſtianity, which reduces all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:013650_0068_0F919C204D039AA0"/>to a level, as a neceſſary defence for them, and a counterpoiſe to weakneſs againſt force; that, in ſhort, their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſire of ſway, which is ſuppoſed to have no bounds, would perhaps exerciſe its dominion over that which is moſt free, over the mind itſelf — or whatever be their motive, the world has been obliged to their ardour.</p>
                     <p>It was women who, making the charms of their ſex ſubſervient to religion — who, raiſed to thrones by their beauty, drew over their huſbands to their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and ſpread Chriſtianity over the greater part of Europe. It was by their means that France, England, a part of Germany, Bavaria, Hungary, Bohemia, Lithuania, Poland, Ruſſia, and, for ſome time, that Perſia received the goſpel. By the ſame influence, Lombardy and Spain renounced the opinions of Arius.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not here repeat the names of thoſe princeſſes. They are inſcribed in the barbarous annals of the times, and
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:013650_0069_0F919C21029452F8"/>have ſince been repeated by a number of panegyriſts. It is ſufficient for me to have pointed out the ſpecies of merit for which they were diſtinguiſhed, and on what the eulogies dwell, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in their life-time, or which have been paid them by poſterity.</p>

                     <p>HISTORY does not afford ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular a revolution in policy and manners, as that which followed the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Roman empire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="65" facs="unknown:013650_0071_0F919C25E4515148"/>
It is to the Barbarians who ſpread conflagration and ruin, who trampled on the monuments of art, and ſpurned the appendages of elegance and pleaſure, that we owe the bewitching ſpirit of gallantry, which, in theſe ages of refinement, reigns in the courts of Europe: and that ſyſtem, which has made it a principle of honour among us to conſider the women as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns, which has partly formed our cuſtoms, our manners, our policy, and which has ſo remarkably influenced our writings and our languages— that ſyſtem, which has exalted the human character by ſoftening the empire of force, which mingles politeneſs with the uſe of the ſword, which delights in protecting the weak, and in conferring that importance which nature or fortune have denied, was brought hither from the frozen ſhores of the Baltic, and from the ſavage foreſts of the North.</p>
                     <p>The northern nations in general paid great reſpect to women. Continually employed in hunting or in war, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended only to ſoften their ferocity
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:013650_0072_0F919C26DBFE4280"/>in the preſence of the fair. Their foreſts were the nurſeries of chivalry. Beauty was there the reward of valour. A war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, to render himſelf worthy of his miſtreſs, went in ſearch of glory and of danger. Jealouſy produced challenges. Single combats, inſtituted by love, often ſtained with blood the woods and the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the lakes; and the ſword aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the rights of Venus as well as of Mars.</p>
                     <p>Let us not be ſurpriſed at theſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Among men who have made few advances in civilization, but who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready united in large bodies, women have naturally, and muſt have, the greateſt ſway. Society is then ſufficiently culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to have introduced the ideas of preference and of choice in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between the ſexes, — which ſeem to be little regarded, if at all known, among ſavages: it is too rude to partake of that ſtate of effeminacy, in which the ſenſes are enfeebled, and the affections worn out by habit. People but little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from barbariſm, in the perfection
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:013650_0073_0F919C270AEEC078"/>of their animal powers, and ignorant of all thoſe artificial pleaſures created by the wants of poliſhed life, feel more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely the pleaſures of nature, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine emotions of man. They mingle even with their love a kind of adoration to the female ſex.</p>
                     <p>Several of the northern nations ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that women could look into futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and that they had about them an inconceivable ſomething approaching to divinity. Perhaps that idea was only the effect of the ſagacity common to the ſex: and the advantage which their natural addreſs gave them over rough and ſimple warriors; perhaps alſo thoſe barbarians, ſurpriſed at the influence which beauty has over force, were lead to aſcribe to ſupernatural attraction, a charm which they could not comprehend.</p>
                     <p>A belief, however, that the Deity communicates himſelf more readily to women, has at one time or other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in every quarter of the earth. Not only the Germans, the Britons, and all
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:013650_0074_0F919C27CB83E040"/>the people of Scandinavia were poſſeſſed of it: it was women among the Greeks who delivered the oracles. The reſpect which the Romans paid to the Sibyls is well known. The Jews had their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſſes. The predictions of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian women obtained much credit at Rome, even under the emperors. And in moſt barbarous nations, all things that have the appearance of being ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, the myſteries of religion, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of phyſic, and the rites of magic, are in the poſſeſſion of the women.</p>
                     <p>The barbarians, who over-ran Europe, carried their opinions along with their arms. A revolution, in the manner of living, muſt therefore ſoon have taken place. The climates of the North re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired little reſerve between the ſexes; and during the invaſions from that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which continued for three or four hundred years, it was common to ſee women mixed with warriors. Hence that ſweet and timid modeſty, which has generally been conſidered as eſſential to
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:013650_0075_0F919C2885C2DA80"/>beauty, by being unveiled to every eye, ceaſed to be regarded as a virtue.</p>
                     <p>Among the ancients, the retirement of women was a long time a part of the conſtitution of the ſtate; becauſe the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and the laws reſted upon the manners. In modern Europe, the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians having every where concerted military eſtabliſhments, paid little atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the manners: they reſted all things upon force.</p>
                     <p>By mingling with a corrupted people, who had all the vices of former proſperity along with thoſe of preſent adverſity, the conquerors were not likely to imbibe more ſevere ideas. Hence we ſee thoſe ſons of the North, in ſofter climates, uniting the vices of reſinement to the ſtatelineſs of the warrior, and the pride of the barbarian.</p>
                     <p>They embraced Chriſtianity: but it rather modified than changed their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. It mingled itſelf with their cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:013650_0076_0F919C296E6E17D8"/>without altering the genius of the people.</p>
                     <p>Thus, by degrees, were laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of new manners, which in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Europe have brought the two ſexes more on a level, by aſſigning to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men a kind of ſovereignty, and aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating love with valour.</p>
                     <p>Nearly about the time that this revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution took place in the Weſt, a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance pretty remarkable, a religion,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mahometiſm.</note> and a people, aroſe, that eſtabliſhed and conſecrated in the Eaſt, the domeſtic ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude of women: ſo that the ſame era which gave birth to the empire of beauty in Europe, doomed the lovely ſex to be eternal ſlaves in Aſia. Their ſlavery ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the arms of the conquering Arabs, and their dominion and the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry of the North accompanied the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of the ſavage, but generous inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the pole.</p>

The reign of chivalry already com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, began to advance over Europe. That civil and military inſtitution took its riſe from a train of circumſtances, and the native bent of the new inhabitants. Its true era was the fourteenth century.</p>
                     <p>Shattered by the fall of the empire, Europe had not yet arrived at any degree of conſiſtency. After five hundred years, nothing was fixed; nothing, if I may uſe the phraſe, was moulded together. From the mixture of Chriſtianity with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtoms of the barbarians, ſprung a continual diſcord in the manners; from the mixture of the rights of the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood with thoſe of the empire, ſprung a diſcord in laws and politics; from the mixture of the rights of ſovereigns with thoſe of the nobility, ſprung a diſcord in government; and, from the mixture of Arabians and Chriſtians, ſprung a diſcord in religions. Anarchy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion were the reſult of ſo many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="72" facs="unknown:013650_0078_0F919C2BCFDDF360"/>
Chriſtianity, which had now loſt much of its original influence, like a feeble curb, was ſtill ſufficient to reſtrain the weak paſſions, but was no longer able to bridle the ſtrong. It produced re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, but could not prevent guilt.</p>
                     <p>The people of thoſe times made pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, and they pillaged: they maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and they afterwards did pennance. Robbery and debauchery were blended with ſuperſtition.</p>
                     <p>It was in this era that the nobility, idle and warlike, from a ſentiment of natural equity, and that uneaſineſs which follows the perpetration of violence— from the double motive of religion and of heroiſm, aſſociated themſelves to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in a body what government had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, or but poorly executed. Their object was to combat the Moors in Spain, the Saracens in Aſia, the tyrants of the caſtles and ſtrong holds in Germany, and in France; to aſſure the ſafety of travellers, as Hercules and Theſeus did
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:013650_0079_0F919C2DB90346A0"/>of old; and, above all things, to defend the honour and protect the rights of the feeble ſex, againſt the too frequent vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany and oppreſſion of the ſtrong.</p>
                     <p>A noble ſpirit of gallantry ſoon ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led itſelf with that inſtitution. Every knight, in devoting himſelf to danger, liſted himſelf under ſome lady as his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign. It was for her that he attacked, for her that he defended, for her that he mounted the walls of cities and of caſtles—and for her honour that he ſhed his blood.</p>
                     <p>Europe was only one large field of battle, where warriors clad in armour, and adorned with ribbands and with the cyphers of their miſtreſſes, engaged in cloſe fight to merit the favour of beauty.</p>
                     <p>Fidelity was then aſſociated with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and love was inſeparably connected with honour.</p>
                     <p>The women, proud of their ſway, and of receiving it from the hands of virtue,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:013650_0080_0F919C2DF95F60C0"/>became worthy of the great actions of their lovers, and reciprocated paſſions as noble as thoſe they inſpired. An unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous choice debaſed them. The ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſentiment was never felt but when united with glory; and the manners breathed an inexpreſſible ſomething of pride, heroiſm, and tenderneſs, which was altogether aſtoniſhing.</p>
                     <p>Beauty perhaps never exerciſed ſo ſweet, or ſo powerful an empire over the heart. Hence thoſe conſtant paſſions which our levity cannot comprehend, and which our manners, our little weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, our perpetual thirſt of hopes and deſires, our liſtleſs anxiety that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments us, and which tires itſelf in the purſuit of emotion without pleaſure, and of impulſe without aim, lead us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, are turned every day into ridicule on our theatres, in our converſations, and in our lives.</p>
                     <p>But it is nevertheleſs true, that thoſe paſſions, foſtered by years and rouſed by obſtacles, where reſpect kept hope at a
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:013650_0081_0F919C2F04F24FC8"/>diſtance, where love, fed only by ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, ſacrificed itſelf unceaſingly to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, reinvigorated the characters and the ſouls of the two ſexes; gave more energy to the one, and more elevation to the other; changed men into heroes, and inſpired the women with a pride—which was by no means hurtful to virtue.</p>
                     <p>The foregoing account of the origin and progreſs of chivalry, ſeems naturally to ariſe out of the hiſtory of the times, and is founded upon the authority of the beſt early writers. But there are two late writers, of ſo high, and ſuch juſtly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited reputation, that it would be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the public to omit their opinion, and a crime againſt genius, to alter their expreſſion: they ſhall therefore ſpeak for themſelves, for the women, and for us; —for their ſentiments ſeem only to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate ours.</p>

                        <q>The ſyſtem of chivalry, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely formed,</q> ſays profeſſor Fergu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, 'proceeded on a marvellous reſpect and veneration to the fair ſex, on forms
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:013650_0082_0F919C2F45C64968"/>of combat eſtabliſhed, and on a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed junction of the heroic and ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified character. The formalities of the duel, and a kind of judicial challenge, were known among the ancient Celtic nations of Europe. The Germans, even in their native foreſts, paid a kind of devotion to the female ſex. The Chriſtian religion enjoined meekneſs and compaſſion to barbarous ages. Theſe different principles combined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, may have ſerved as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a ſyſtem, in which courage was directed by religion and love, and the warlike and gentle were united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. When the characters of the hero and the ſaint were mixed, the mild ſpirit of Chriſtianity, though of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten turned into venom by the bigotry of oppoſite parties, though it could not always ſubdue the ferocity of the warrior, nor ſuppreſs the admiration of courage and force, may have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the apprehenſions of men in what was to be held meritorious and ſplendid in the conduct of their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels.</p>

The feudal eſtabliſhments, by the high rank to which they elevated cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain families, no doubt greatly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured this romantic ſyſtem. Not only the luſtre of a noble deſcent, but the ſtately caſtle beſet with battlements and towers, ſerved to inflame the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to create a veneration for the daughter and the ſiſter of gallant chiefs, whoſe point of honour it was to be inacceſſible and chaſte, and who could perceive no merit but that of the high-minded and the brave, nor be approached in any other accents than thoſe of gentleneſs and reſpect.<note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſay on the hiſtory of Civil Society, Part iv.

                        <p>From the prevailing ſpirit of the times, ſays profeſſor Millar, the art of war became the ſtudy of every one who was deſirous of maintaining the character of a gentleman. The youth were early initiated in the profeſſion of arms, and ſerved a ſort of apprentice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip under perſons of rank and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:013650_0084_0F919C320185F038"/>The young ſquire became in reality the ſervant of that leader to whom he had attached himſelf, and whoſe virtues were ſet before him as a model which he propoſed to imitate. He was taught to perform with eaſe and dexterity thoſe exerciſes which were either ornamental or uſeful, and at the ſame time he endeavoured to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thoſe talents and accompliſhments which were thought ſuitable to his profeſſion. He was taught to look upon it as his duty to check the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, to reſtrain the oppreſſor, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the weak and defenceleſs; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have with frankneſs and humanity even to an enemy, with modeſty and polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all. According to the proſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency which he had made, he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably advanced in rank and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and was honoured with now titles and marks of diſtinction, till at length he arrived at the dignity of knighthood; a dignity which even the greateſt potentates were ambitious of acquiring, as it was ſuppoſed to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh a perſon who had obtained the
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:013650_0085_0F919C3247240890"/>moſt complete military education, and who had attained to a high degree of eminence in thoſe particular qualities which were then univerſally admired and reſpected.</p>
                        <p>The ſituation of mankind in thoſe periods had alſo a manifeſt tendency to heighten and improve the paſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſexes. It was not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that thoſe opulent chiefs, who were ſo often at variance, and who maintained a conſtant oppoſition to each other, would allow any ſort of familiarity to take place between the members of their reſpective families. Retired in their own caſtles, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by their numerous vaſſals, they looked upon their neighbours ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as inferior to them in rank, or as enemies, againſt whom they were obliged to be conſtantly upon their guard. They behaved to each other with that ceremonious civility which the laws of chivalry required; but at the ſame time with that reſerve and caution which a regard to their own
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:013650_0086_0F919C330CD124A8"/>ſafety made it neceſſary for them to obſerve. The young knight as he marched to the tournament ſaw at a diſtance the daughter of the chieftan by whom the ſhow was exhibited; and it was even with difficulty that he could obtain acceſs to her, in order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the ſentiments with which ſhe had inſpired him. He was entertained by her relations with that cold reſpect which demonſtrated their unwillingneſs to contract an alliance with him. The lady herſelf was taught to aſſume the pride of her family, and to think that no perſon was worthy of her affection who did not poſſeſs the moſt exalted rank and character. To have given way to a ſudden inclination would have diſgraced her for ever in the opinion of all her kindred; and it was only by a long courſe of attention, and of the moſt reſpectful ſervice, that the lover could hope for any favour from his miſtreſs.</p>
                        <p>The barbarous ſtate of the country at that time, and the injuries to which
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:013650_0087_0F919C33C450FB00"/>the inhabitants, eſpecially thoſe of the weaker ſex, were frequently expoſed, gave ample ſcope for the diſplay of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary talents; and the knight who had nothing to do at home was encouraged to wander from place to place, and from one court to another, in queſt of adventures; in which he endeavoured to advance his reputation in arms, and to recommend himſelf to the fair, of whom he was enamoured, by fighting with every perſon who was ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate as to diſpute her unrivalled beauty, virtue, or perſonal accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Thus, while his thoughts were conſtantly fixed upon the ſame object, and while his imagination, inflamed by abſence and repeated diſappointments, was employed in heightening all thoſe charms by which his deſires were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually excited, his paſſion was at length wrought up to the higheſt pitch; and uniting with the love of fame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the ruling and governing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of his conduct, and gave a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular turn and direction to all his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and opinions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="82" facs="unknown:013650_0088_0F919C34B50380B0"/>
As there were many perſons in the ſame ſituation, ſo they were naturally inſpired with ſimilar ſentiments. Rivals to one another in military glory, they were often competitors, as Milton ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it, 'to win her grace whom all commend;' and the ſame emulation which diſpoſed them to aim at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence in the one reſpect, excited them with no leſs eagerneſs to diſpute the preference in the other. Their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and manner of thinking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came faſhionable, and were gradually diffuſed by the force of education and example. To be in love was looked upon as one of the neceſſary qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a knight; and he was no leſs ambitious of ſhewing his conſtancy and fidelity to his miſtreſs, than of diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his military virtues. He aſſumed the title of her ſlave or ſervant. By this he diſtinguiſhed himſelf in every combat in which he was engaged; and his ſucceſs was ſuppoſed to redound to her honour, not leſs than to his own. If ſhe had beſtowed upon him a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be worn in the field of battle in
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:013650_0089_0F919C3542C03D28"/>token of her regard, it was conſidered as a ſure pledge of victory, and as lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him the ſtrongeſt obligation to act in ſuch a manner as would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him worthy of the favour which he had received<note n="*" place="bottom">Memoires ſur l'ancienne chevalrie, par M. de la Curne de Ste.

                        <p>The ſincere and faithful paſſion, the diſtant ſentimental attachment, which commonly occupied the heart of every warrior, and which he profeſſed upon all occaſions, was naturally productive of the utmoſt purity of manners, and of great reſpect and veneration for the female ſex. Perſons who made a point of defending the reputation and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of that particular lady to whom they were devoted, became thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely cautious and delicate; leſt, by any inſinuation whatever, they ſhould hurt the character of another, and be expoſed to the juſt cenſure and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe by whom ſhe was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected. A woman who deviated ſo far
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:013650_0090_0F919C38C1D34CE8"/>from the eſtabliſhed maxims of the age as to violate the laws of chaſtity, was indeed deſerted by every body, and was therefore univerſally contemned and inſulted. But thoſe who adhered to the ſtrict rules of virtue, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an unblemiſhed reputation, were treated like beings of a ſuperior order<note n="*" place="bottom">Obſervations concerning the Diſtinction of Ranks in Society, Chap.

                     </q>
                     <p>Such was the ſpirit of chivalry. It gave birth to an incredible number of performances in honour and in praiſe of women. The verſes of the bards, the Italian ſonnet, the plaintive romance, the poems of chivalry, the Spaniſh and French romances<note n="†" place="bottom">Theſe compoſitions, all once ſo much celebrated, are only calculated to gratify a vain curioſity. They may be compared to the ruins of a Gothic palace: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all of them have the ſame foundation; and the praiſes in the one are as uniform as the apartments in the other. All the women are prodigies of beauty, and miracles of virtue.
<p>The diverſity of nations, however, has ſhewn itſelf in the manner of painting the ſame objects. Hence the French compoſitions have moſt ſimplicity, the Italian moſt depth, the Spaniſh moſt imagination—and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is obvious. The ſimplicity of the French writers proceeded from the uncompounded manners of a people ſtill in a ſtate of military ſubordination, and more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to fight than to think: the depth of the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian writers was the effect of more cultivated minds, more intercourſe with ſtrangers, more diverſified man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and of a crowd of little political intereſts: the pomp and imagination of the Spaniſh writers took its riſe from an ancient pride, from the activity of ſouls more ſublimed by the ſun, and from the mixture of the Moors and Arabs with the native inhabitants of the country; which laſt circumſtance muſt have had a prodigious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the manners, upon the Language, and, by the manner of painting objects, upon the manner of ſeeing them. For, if the genius of a people forms their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, the characteriſtic of language muſt ſtamp itſelf upon genius.</p>
                        </note>, were ſo many monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:013650_0091_0F919C3AAD69F618"/>of that kind, compoſed in the time of a noble barbariſm, and of a he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roiſm in which the great and the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous were often blended.</p>
                     <p>In the courts, in the fields of battle or of tournament, every thing breathed of women:— and the ſame taſte prevailed in letters. One did not write, one did not think, but for them. The ſame man was often both poet and warrior; he ſung to his lyre, and encountered with his lance, by turns, for the beauty that he adored.</p>
                     <p>The times, and the manners of chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:013650_0092_0F919C3BD173B278"/>by bringing great enterpriſes, bold adventures, and I know not what of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant heroiſm into faſhion, inſpired the women with the ſame taſte. The two ſexes always imitate each other; their manners and their minds are refined or corrupted, invigorated or diſſolved together.</p>
                     <p>The women, in conſequence of the prevailing paſſion, were now ſeen in the middle of camps and of armies: they quitted the ſoft and tender inclinations, and the delicate offices of their own ſex, for the courage and the toilſome occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ours. During the cruſades, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the double enthuſiaſm of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and of valour, they often performed the moſt romantic exploits; obtained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencies on the field of battle, and died with arms in their hands, by the ſide of their lovers or of their huſbands.</p>
                     <p>In Europe, the women attacked and defended fortifications; princeſſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded their armies, and obtained vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. Such was the celebrated Joan de
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:013650_0093_0F919C3C0BFCF458"/>Mountfort, diſputing for her duchy of Bretagne, and fighting herſelf. Such was that ſtill more celebrated Margaret of Anjou<note n="*" place="bottom">Queen of England, and wife of Henry VI.</note>, active and intrepid, general and ſoldier, whoſe genius ſupported a long time a feeble huſband; which taught him to conquer; which replaced him upon the throne; which twice relieved him from priſon; and, oppreſſed by fortune and by rebels, which did not bend, till after ſhe had decided in perſon twelve battles.</p>
                     <p>The warlike ſpirit among the women, conſiſtent with ages of barbariſm, when every thing is impetuous, becauſe nothing is fixed, and when all exceſs is the exceſs of force, continued in Europe upwards of four hundred years, ſhewing itſelf from time to time, and always in the middle of convulſions, or on the eve of great revolutions.</p>
                     <p>But there were eras and countries in which that ſpirit appeared with particular
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:013650_0094_0F919C3CC88E4AD8"/>luſtre. Such were the diſplays it made in the fifteenth and ſixteenth centuries in Hungary, and in the iſlands of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chipelago and the Mediterranean, when they were invaded by the Turks.</p>
                     <p>Every thing conſpired to animate the women of thoſe countries with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted courage:— the prevailing ſpirit of the foregoing ages; the terror which the name of the Turks inſpired; the ſtill more dreadful apprehenſions of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known enemy; the difference of dreſs, which has a ſtronger effect than is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſuppoſed on the imagination of a people; the difference of religion, which produced a kind of ſacred horrour; the ſtriking difference of manners; and, above all, the confinement of the female ſex; which, though in the Eaſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered only as a civil and political inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, preſented to the women of Europe nothing but the frightful ideas of ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and of a maſter— the groans of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the tears of beauty in the embrace of barbariſm, and the double tyranny of love and pride!</p>

                        <pb n="89" facs="unknown:013650_0095_0F919C3D838CDBF8"/>
The contemplation of theſe objects ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly rouſed in the hearts of the women a reſolute courage to defend themſelves, nay ſometimes even a courage of enthuſiaſm, which hurled itſelf againſt the enemy; and that courage was aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, by the promiſes of a religion, which offered eternal happineſs in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for the ſufferings of a moment.</p>
                     <p>It is not therefore ſurpriſing, that when three beautiful women of the Iſle of Cyprus were led priſoners to Selim, to be ſecluded in the ſeraglio, one of them preferring death to ſuch a condition, conceived the project of ſetting fire to the magazine; and, after having commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated her deſign to the reſt, put it in execution; — that the year following, a city of Cyprus being beſieged by the Turks, the women ran in crowds, ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themſelves with the ſoldiers, and, fighting gallantly in the breach, were the means of ſaving their country; — that, under Mahomet II. a girl of the iſle of Lemnos, armed with the ſword and ſhield of her father, who had fallen in

                     <p>That era, and theſe multiplied exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of courage among the women merit our moſt ſerious attention: but only to conſider the revolutions of hiſtory, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, in the iſlands of the Archipelago, the deſcendants of the illuſtrious Greeks, after a revolution of fifteen hundred years, became Chriſtians, and ſubjects of the republic of Venice, defending their cities and their coaſts againſt the ravages
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:013650_0097_0F919C3F11C44760"/>of the conquering Tartars, who carried to the countries of Homer and Plato the religion of an Arabian prophet, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting ſpectacle, and teems with reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of every kind.</p>
                     <p>The Hungarian women, in their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters with the ſame Tartars, do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent us with a ſpectacle leſs ſingular. We cannot doubt that it was the double mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of religion and honour, which exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their courage to ſuch a height: for theſe are the two principles which in all ages have given birth to the great actions of women.</p>

                     <head>SECTION II. Of the Revival of Letters, and the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of WOMEN.</head>
                     <p>WHILE war reigned in Greece, in Hungary, and in the iſlands of the Mediterranean, which ſeemed only ſo many theatres for the illuſtrious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of women, another revolution took place in Italy: — the revival of arts and
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:013650_0098_0F91A472367ACAE8"/>of letters. That era gave a new direction to the ideas and occupations of the female ſex. A general thirſt after knowledge turned all the world to the ſtudy of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.</p>
                     <p>There is a time when the ſymbols of ideas are taken for ideas themſelves. We hope to inſtruct ourſelves by learning words, as ſome projectors have hoped to enrich themſelves by exploring mines. Languages are otherwiſe ſo many chains of enigmas, where ideas are hid, and never could provoke our aſſiduity. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the exerciſe of thought, we would know the hiſtory of the thoughts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. This proceſs is perhaps even ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. In the infancy of life, the ſenſes collect the materials of thinking; in the infancy of letters, the mind treaſures up words, to combine them afterwards. In both caſes, it is the memory that gives activity to the reſt of the intellectual pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                     <p>As words lead to ideas, the ancient philoſophy revived with the languages.
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:013650_0099_0F91A4731D16DE70"/>Perſons of auſtere minds and obtuſe feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, thoſe who looked upon cold reaſon to be right reaſon, who ſet moſt value u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a certain logic that reſtrains, a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty that divides, and a vague obſcurity which exerciſes the underſtanding, and leaves it the merit of determining for it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and of fixing its ideas, made choice of the philoſophy of Ariſtotle: But people of ſenſibility and fancy, thoſe who could pardon errors for eloquence, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred a ſublime and ſeraphic ſyſtem of metaphyſics to a dry logic, and elegant alluſions to ſylogiſtic quibbles; thoſe, in ſhort, who had ſouls upon which ideas, even chimerically refined, of perfection, of order, and of beauty, made a deep and lively impreſſion, devoted themſelves to the philoſophy of Plato.</p>
                     <p>The philoſophy of Ariſtotle occupied the univerſities and the cloiſters; the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, the lovers, the ſentimental philoſoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the ladies, were the diſciples of Plato.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="94" facs="unknown:013650_0100_0F91A473B1B2E298"/>
Theology, or the art of applying hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man reaſonings to celeſtial matters, was another kind of knowledge which then employed and engaged the mind: it was faſhionable, and it was neceſſary that it ſhould be ſo. It was a magazine for the wars of religion, a ſupport for the court of Rome, and a ſure road to honour and preferment. A high value was therefore put on that ſcience; and the deſcendants of the ancient Romans became celebrated by their religious ſtudies, in the country where their anceſtors had been ſo much renowned by their victories.</p>
                     <p>After the times of conſpiracy, of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and of domeſtic broils, law and order muſt have been highly prized. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſprudence was therefore cultivated. They had not ſufficient knowledge to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come legiſlators; but they ſtudied, they explained, they altered, and they disfigur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Roman laws.</p>
                     <p>Chivalry now began to decline in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope: but it left behind it a tincture of romantic gallantry in the manners, which
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:013650_0101_0F91A476DEE852B0"/>communicated itſelf to the works of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
                     <p>Many verſes were then written, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of paſſions either real or feigned, but always reſpectful and tender: and as in France, where the diſſipated nobility ſpent their life in war, love was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly painted under the idea of a conqueſt; in Italy, where another ſet of ideas pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, it was always repreſented as an adoration or worſhip.</p>
                     <p>This confuſion of religion and gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of Platoniſm and poetry, of the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the languages and of the laws, of the ancient philoſophy and the modern theology, formed the general character of the moſt illuſtrious men of thoſe times. The ſame obſervation may be extended to the moſt celebrated women.</p>
                     <p>Never were the women ſo univerſally diſtinguiſhed for profound learning, as in this period. Perhaps as it followed the ages of chivalry, when ſeveral wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had diſputed with men the prize of
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:013650_0102_0F91A477D4D9B908"/>valour, willing to eſtabliſh the equality of their ſex in all things, they were am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to prove that they had as much genius as courage; and to ſubject, even by their talents, thoſe over whom they reigned by their beauty.</p>
                     <p>What ſtrikes us moſt remarkably in that era is, the general ſpirit. We ſee women preach, and unwind controverſy; women publicly ſupport theſes; women fill the chairs of philoſophy and of law; women harrangue in Latin before the popes; women write in Greek, and read Hebrew; nuns, poeteſſes; women of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, divines; and (which happened more than once) young girls perfected in elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, with the ſweeteſt features and the ſofteſt voice, pathetically exhorting the Holy Father and the Chriſtian princes to declare war againſt the Turks.</p>
                     <p>The religious ſpirit which has animated women in all ages ſhowed itſelf at this time, but it changed its form. It had made them, by turns, martyrs, apoſtles,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:013650_0103_0F91A4783AEE3650"/>warriors, and concluded with making them divines and ſcholars.</p>
                     <p>An incredible value was ſtill ſet on the ſtudy of languages. In private families, in the cloiſters, in the courts, and even on the thrones the ſame taſte reigned. It was but a poor qualification for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to read Virgil and Cicero. The mouth of a young Italian, Spaniſh, or Britiſh lady, ſeemed adorned with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular grace, when ſhe repeated ſome Hebrew phraſe, or thundered out ſome verſes of Homer.</p>
                     <p>Poetry, ſo dear to the imagination, and to ſuſceptible hearts, was embraced with ardour by the women. It was a new and pleaſing exertion of talents, which ſlattered ſelf-love, and amuſed the mind. Perhaps too that want which they muſt have experienced, ſpite of themſelves, and even without knowing it, in a ſubtile philoſophy, an abſtract theology, and an empty ſtudy of dialects and of ſounds, would make them more ſenſible to the charms of an art, which
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:013650_0104_0F91A4791020E030"/>continually feeds the imagination with its images, and the heart with its ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall particularize a few of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were moſt celebrated for their learning and talents in that period. It would be eaſy to double the liſt.</p>
                     <p>In the thirteenth century, a young lady of Bologna, devoted herſelf to the ſtudy of the Latin language, and of the laws. At the age of twenty-three, ſhe pronounced a funeral oration in Latin in the great church of Bologna; and, to be admired as an orator, ſhe had neither need of indulgence on account of her youth nor of her ſex. At the age of twenty-ſix ſhe took the degree of a doctor of laws, and began publicly to expound the Inſtitutions of Juſtinian. At the age of thirty, her great reputation raiſed her to a chair, where ſhe taught the law to a prodigious concourſe of ſcholars from all nations. She joined the charms and accompliſhments of a woman to all the knowledge of a man. But ſuch was the
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:013650_0105_0F91A479DA085E20"/>power of her eloquence, that her beauty was only admired when her tongue was ſilent.</p>
                     <p>In the fourteenth century, a like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample was exhibited in that city. In the fifteenth century, the ſame prodigy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed itſelf there a third time:— and I cannot help here remarking, that even at this day, in the city of Bologna, there is ſtill a learned chair ſilled with honour by a woman.</p>
                     <p>At Venice, in the courſe of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century, two celebrated women attract our notice, the one (Modeſta di Pozzo di Zorzi) compoſed ſucceſsfully a great number of pieces in verſe, ſerious, comic, heroic, and tender; and ſome paſtorals, which were much admired: The other, (Caſſandra Fidele) who was one of the moſt learned women of Italy, wrote equally well the three languages of Homer, Virgil, and Dante, and in verſe as well as in proſe. She poſſeſſed all the philoſophy of her own, and of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding ages; ſhe embelliſhed with graces
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:013650_0106_0F91A47A71A05498"/>theology itſelf; ſhe ſupported theſes with the greateſt luſtre; ſhe gave public lectures at Padua; ſhe joined to her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtudies the elegant arts, particularly muſic, and ſoftened her learning ſtill farther by her manners. She received homage from ſovereign pontiffs and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign princes; and, that ſhe might be ſingular in all things, ſhe lived upwards of a century.</p>
                     <p>At Milan a lady of the illuſtrious houſe of Trivulzio, early in life, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a great number of elegant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes before popes and potentates, in the ancient language of the Romans.</p>
                     <p>At Verona, in the fifteenth century, Iſſotta Nogarolla, acquired ſo great a reputation by her eloquence that kings were curious to liſten, and ſcholars to attend, to hear, and to ſee.</p>
                     <p>At Florence, a nun of the houſe of Strozzi diſpelled the languor and indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the cloiſter by her taſte for let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:013650_0107_0F91A47DAA36A400"/>and, in her ſolitude, was known over Italy, Germany, and France.</p>
                     <p>At Naples, Sarrochia compoſed a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated poem upon Scanderbeg; and, in her life-time, was compared to Boyardo and to Taſſo.</p>
                     <p>At Rome, we find Victoria Colonna, marchioneſs of Peſcaira, who paſſionately loved and ſucceſsfully cultivated letters; and who, left in youth to mourn a great and gallant huſband, ſpent the reſt of her life in ſtudy, and in ſorrow, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating in her tender verſes her long loſt hero.</p>
                     <p>In Spain we ſee Iſabella of Roſera, preach in the great church of Barcelona, come to Rome under Paul III. there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Jews by her eloquence, and comment upon the learned Scotus, with applauſe, before the cardinals and arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops; — Iſabella of Cardoua, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Latin, the Greek, and the Hebrew, and who, though poſſeſſed of beauty, reputation, and riches, had ſtill
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:013650_0108_0F91A4816008ED80"/>the whim of becoming a doctor, and took degrees in divinity; — Catharine Ribera, who compoſed a great many Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh verſes, partly devotional and partly amorous; — Aloyſia Sigea of Toledo, ſtill more celebrated than the three for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who, beſides Latin, Greek, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, underſtood Arabic and Syriac; who wrote a letter in theſe five languages to pope Paul III. who was afterwards called to the court of Portugal, where ſhe compoſed ſeveral pieces, and died young.</p>
                     <p>In France we ſee ſeveral women poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of all the learning of the times, particularly the ducheſs of Retz, who under Charles IX. was celebrated even in Italy, and who aſtoniſhed the Poliſh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility when they came to demand the duke of Anjou for their king. They beheld with wonder, at court, a young lady ſo intelligent, and who ſpoke the ancient languages with no leſs purity than grace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="103" facs="unknown:013650_0109_0F91A4825C8E3610"/>
In England we meet with the three Seymours, ſiſters, nieces to a king, and daughters to a protector, all celebrated for their learning, and for their elegant Latin verſes, which were tranſlated and repeated all over Europe; — Jane Gray, whoſe elevation to the throne was only a ſtep to the ſcaffold, and who read before her death, in Greek, Plato's Dialogue on the Immortality of the Soul; — nor can we paſs by the eldeſt daughter of the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious chancellor, Sir Thomas More, whoſe learning was almoſt eclipſed by her virtues; who correſponded in Latin with the great Eraſmus, who ſtyled her the ornament of Britain; and who, after ſhe had conſoled her father in priſon, had ruſhed through the guards to ſnatch a laſt embrace, had obtained the liberty of paying him funeral honours, had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed his head with a bribe, — accuſed herſelf, and loaded with fetters for two crimes — for having watched the head of her father as a relique, and for having preſerved his books and writings — ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with unconcern before her judge; juſtified herſelf with that eloquence which
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:013650_0110_0F91A48445F72920"/>virtue beſtows on injured merit, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding admiration and reſpect, and ſpent the remainder of her life in ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in ſorrow, and in ſtudy.</p>
                     <p>We behold in Scotland Mary Stuart, heir of that crown, the moſt beautiful woman of her age, and one of the moſt learned, who could write and ſpeak ſix languages; who made elegant verſes in French; and who, when very young, delivered an oration in Latin to the court of France, to prove that the ſtudy of letters is conſiſtent with the female cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. So lovely, and ſo happy an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the truth which ſhe advanced, could not fail to convince. Mary added to her learning, a delicate taſte in the polite arts, particularly muſic, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned the whole with the moſt feminine and courtly manners.</p>
                     <p>Several women were even deſirous of uniting every ſpecies of learning, and ſome ſucceeded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="105" facs="unknown:013650_0111_0F91A484F4FCAE98"/>
What has ſince been called SOCIETY was not then indeed ſo much known. Luxury, and the want of occupation, had not introduced the cuſtom of ſitting five or ſix hours before a glaſs, to invent faſhions. Some uſe was made of time. Hence that variety of languages, arts, and ſciences, which were acquired by women.</p>
                     <p>It is but juſt, however, to obſerve, that the vanity of being univerſal is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the infancy of letters. In child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, all the world over-rate their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. It is only by meaſuring them that we come to know them. The deſires themſelves were then more eaſily ſatisfied than the thirſt of learning. People were more anxious to know than to think; and the mind, more active than extended, unable yet to comprehend the ſecret, or reach the depth of the ſciences, ought naturally to have conſidered them as a ſacred depoſit in books, which the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory would neceſſarily impair.</p>

                     <head>SECTION III. Of the Books written in Honour of WO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEN, and on the Superiority of the Sexes.</head>
                     <p>IF the women of thoſe ages were am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of arraying themſelves in the knowledge of men, the men were at all times ready with their panegyrics to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the compliment to the women. It was the ſequel of the general ſpirit, which carried gallantry into letters as it had introduced it into arms.</p>
                     <p>Italy in particular was over-run with performances of that kind. The firſt who gave the example was Boccace. He paſſionately loved and was beloved by the women; and compoſed in Latin a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe in honour of the ſex. It is intituled, OF ILLUSTRIOUS WOMEN. In ſearch of theſe he wanders through the whole circuit of fable; through the Greek, Roman, and Sacred Hiſtories; and places together Cleopatra and Lucretia, Flora
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:013650_0113_0F91A48697C32CF8"/>and Portia, Semiramis and Sappho, Athalia and Dido.</p>
                     <p>Boccace undertook above all things to re-eſtabliſh the reputation of Dido, in oppoſition to Virgil. The panegyriſt proves againſt the poet, that the widow of Sichaeus was never unfaithful to his memory.</p>
                     <p>It is humorous to hear Boccace after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in an eloquent and vigorous ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel to that treatiſe, harrangue againſt the Chriſtian widows who married again. The author of the Decameron cites St. Paul, and explains the text of that Apoſtle to a young widow, who excuſed herſelf on account of her age for not imitating Dido. This piece, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords ſo much pleaſantry, is of a ſerious caſt; and, what will ſcarcely be credited, the moral of Boccace is ſevere.</p>
                     <p>The example being now ſet, a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of writers publiſhed ſucceſſively pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyrical catalogues of the illuſtrious women of all nations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="108" facs="unknown:013650_0114_0F91A48731455B88"/>
Joſeph Betuſſi, tranſlated into Italian the Latin treatiſe of Boccace; and, in the ardour of his zeal, he enriched it with fifty new articles. Francis Serdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati, thinking the work not yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, collected from hiſtorians, ſacred and profane, barbarous and poliſhed, the names of all the women of eminence which had been omitted, and added to the catalogue a hundred and twenty pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyrics.</p>
                     <p>But this was not all. Philip de Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamo, an Auguſtine monk, publiſhed a volume in Latin OF ILLUSTRIOUS Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEN. Another performance on the ſame ſubject was publiſhed by Julius Caeſar Capacio, ſecretary to the city of Naples; — one by Charles Pinto, in Latin, and in verſe; — one by Ludovico Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichi; — one by James Philip Thomaſſini, biſhop of Venice; — and one by Bernard Scardioni, a canon of Padua, OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS WOMEN OF PADUA.</p>
                     <p>Francis Auguſtine della Chieſa, biſhop of Saluca, wrote a treatiſe on THE
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:013650_0115_0F91A48A51A60548"/>WOMEN FAMOUS IN LITERATURE; — Lewis Jacob de St. Charles, a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melite, wrote another on THE WOMEN ILLUSTRIOUS BY THEIR WRITINGS; and Alexander Van Denbuſche, of the Low Countries, wrote one on THE LEARNED WOMEN.</p>
                     <p>The celebrated Father le Moine pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a volume under the title of GALE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIE DE FEMMES FORTES; and Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome wrote THE LIVES OF ILLUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRIOUS WOMEN. But it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that Brantome, a French knight and a courtier, ſpeaks only of queens and princeſſes. It is in his writings that we find the panegyric of Catherine of Medicis, and of the famous Joan of Naples. In his prolix ſtyle, ſimple and plain, Brantome juſtifies the conduct of theſe two queens. He tells us that the ſecond was without weakneſs, and the firſt free of guilt. He abſolves the one of her incontinence, and the murder of her huſband; and the other of the civil wars, and the maſſacre of St. Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew.</p>
                     <p>

After Brantome Hilario da Coſta, a Minim, publiſhed two volumes in quarto, each volume conſiſting of eight hundred pages, containing, as he tells us, the panegyrics of ALL the women of the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth and ſixteenth centuries, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by their valour, their talents, or their virtues. But the pious eccleſiaſtic has, in fact, only given us the panegyrics of the CATHOLIC women of that period. He does not ſay a word, for example, of queen Elizabeth; but he has made a long and elaborate eulogy on her ſiſter queen Mary, who began her reign with ſhedding the blood of the amiable Jane Gray; and who, in the five years which ſhe ſat on the throne, devoted to the flames on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of religion between ſix and ſeven hundred perſons, of all ranks, ages, and ſexes.</p>
                     <p>The eulogies of this monkiſh pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyriſt amount to a hundred and ſeventy. No ſmall number. But all muſt yield to the indefatigable Italian, Peter Paul de Ribera, who publiſhed in his own language, a work intituled, <q>The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal

                     <p>Beſides theſe large compilations dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the honour of the whole ſex, many of the writers of thoſe times, men of taſte and gallantry, addreſſed panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rics to individuals, to women who were the living ornaments of their age. This practice was moſt common in Italy, where every thing conſpired to favour it. The world perhaps had never ſeen, at one time, ſo many ſhining princeſſes as then appeared in that part of Europe. The courts of Naples, of Milan, of Mantua, of Parma, of Florence, and ſeveral others, formed ſo many ſchools of taſte, between which reigned an emulation of glory and of talents. The men diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed themſelves by their addreſs in war, or in love; the women, by their knowledge and accompliſhments. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every one of theſe little courts was the reſidence of ſome man of high repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in literature.</p>

In a country, however extenſive, which forms only one great kingdom, or ſtate, men of genius are ſcarce; becauſe there is only one capital, one court, and one centre of luminaries. The diſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces have neither the ſame activity, nor the ſame taſte. But in a country like Italy, divided into a number of ſtates, and where almoſt every city is a capital; the mind gathers energy, and expands itſelf amazingly. This was certainly one cauſe of the ſuperiority of the Italians to the reſt of Europe. What was their misfortune in politics, was their glory in arts and in letters.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe men of wit or genius attached themſelves to the celebrated women, the ornaments of the courts where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided. Some of them, eſtimating human conditions only by the mind, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving talents to be equal to all things, had even the boldneſs to entertain the warmeſt paſſions for great princeſſes<note n="*" place="bottom">Boccace at the court of Naples, and Taſſo at the court of Ferr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Others, who had imagination without feeling, ſubſtituted for paſſion the ſport of fancy; and, mingling with it the Platonic ideas which then prevailed, compoſed for thoſe princeſſes, in a metaphyſical ſtyle, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful hymns under the notion of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyrics.</p>
                     <p>But of all the panegyrics, or collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of panegyrics, in honour of women, in verſe, in proſe, in ſermons, or in ſonnets, the moſt ſingular, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, is that which was publiſhed at Venice, in 1555, under the title of <q>The Temple of the divine Seigniora Joan of Arragon; erected in honour of her by all the greateſt wits, and in all the principal languages of the world.</q> She was one of the moſt extraordinary women of the ſixteenth century; and, married to a prince of the houſe of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna, was mother to Mark Anthony of Colonna, who ſignalized himſelf in the battle of Lepanto, againſt the Turks.</p>

This ideal temple was erected in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a decree paſſed at Venice, in the year 1551, in the academy of the DUBBIOSI. One of the members of that ſociety had conceived the notion of ſuch a deification; but the idea was too happy not to be adopted by the body. They had only one diſpute, which divided them much; viz. whether Joan of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon ſhould poſſeſs alone the honours of the temple, or if they ſhould aſſociate with that divinity the marchioneſs de Guaſt her ſiſter, and no leſs celebrated. But after mature deliberation and many learned arguments on both ſides, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the academy, that two divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, two ſovereigns, and two women would not much love to dwell together; it was therefore reſolved, <q>That the marchioneſs de Guaſt have ſeparate worſhip; and that Joan of Arragon, her ſiſter, remain in the ſole and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive poſſeſſion of her altars.</q> They next proceeded to the building of the temple; and the Latin, Greek, Italian, French, Spaniſh, Sclavonic, Polonize, Hungarian, Hebrew, Chaldaic, and many
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:013650_0121_0F91A49038C28098"/>other languages, were made uſe of in the fabrication of that monument;—one of the moſt extraordinary that ever gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try raiſed to beauty.</p>

                     <p>THE ſame ſpirit which in that era gave birth to ſo many panegyrics on wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, produced a number of books on the merit of the ſex in general. The impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant queſtion of the equality, or ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority, of the ſexes was agitated:—and, during five hundred years, there was a kind of literary combination for aſſigning the pre-eminence to the women.</p>
                     <p>At the head of that conſpiracy was the famous Cornelius Agrippa; who, born at Cologn in 1486, ſtudied all the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, embraced all conditions, travelled all countries; who bore arms with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, and was afterwards divine, doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of law, doctor of phyſic; who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented on the Epiſtles of St. Paul in
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:013650_0122_0F91A4915D485E50"/>England, gave lectures on the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's Stone at Turin, on divinity at Pavia, and practiſed phyſic in Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; who was ſucceſſively connected with three or four princes and princeſſes, and was only the more unfortunate; who bore injuries with courage, and without complaining; who was twice in fetters; who was always wandering, becauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways guided by a warm and weak imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,—becauſe unfit either to be free or to be a ſlave; becauſe he could neither endure poverty nor dependence; and who, after having excited by turns, or at once, pity, admiration, and hate, died in France in the forty-ninth year of his age, loaded with reputation, and oppreſſed with misfortunes.</p>
                     <p>He had publiſhed, in 1509, his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe <q>Of the Excellence of Women above the Men.</q> He had then the misfortune to pleaſe the famous Margaret of Auſtria, who governed the Low Countries. It is a pity that little cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance ſhould have mingled itſelf with ſo gallant a cauſe. The book is divided
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:013650_0123_0F91A491D72504B0"/>into thirty chapters; and, in each chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he demonſtrates the ſuperiority of the women by theological, phyſical, hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical, cabaliſtical, and moral proofs. He calls to his aſſiſtance ſcripture and fable, the hiſtorians, the poets, the civil and canon laws, cites a great deal more than he reaſons, and concludes with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting, that he had no human motive for writing but a ſenſe of duty; becauſe every man who knows the truth holds it in truſt, and conſequently ſilence would be a crime.</p>
                     <p>The Italians, on reading that work, muſt have conſidered it as a robbery, which had been committed in their terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories by a native of Germany. But they ſoon reimburſed themſelves. Cardinal Pompoeia Colonna, Portio, Lando, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menichi, Maggio, Bernado, Spina, and a great many others, all wrote on the perfection of women.</p>
                     <p>But the moſt ſingular work on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is that of Ruſcelli. It appeared at Venice in 1552. Ruſcelli came after all
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:013650_0124_0F91A4952DC5F0F8"/>the reſt; and diſſatisfied, as he ſays, with the manner in which they had ſupported a cauſe ſo evident, he conceived new proofs, ſo poſitive, that henceforth there could not be the poſſibility of a doubt. After having copied, criticiſed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented upon Agrippa, he throws in ſome ſublime ſpeculations of his own, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to prove, that the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of beauty alone can render man happy on earth, and raiſe him to the contemplation of the divinity.</p>
                     <p>Such is the ſcope of Ruſcelli's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. But the effect of his reaſoning is deſtroyed by the conſuſed impreſſion which is made on the mind of the reader, by the mixture of divinity and Platoniſm; by blending through the whole the name of God and of woman; by placing Moſes by the ſide of Petrarch and of Dante; and by giving in the ſame page, and even in the ſame period, quotations from Boccace and from St. Auguſtine, from 0 Homer and from St. John.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="119" facs="unknown:013650_0125_0F91A4962CDAAE68"/>
Nothing, in my opinion, can exhibit a truer picture than this performance does of the ſpirit of the ſixteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, particularly in Italy; where the ſame man was or would be, in good earneſt, a lover, a devotee, a chriſtian, a pagan, a divine, and a philoſopher. Perhaps even that extravagant combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ideas and of characters muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be found in a country, where we often meet with the ruins of a temple of Jupiter in the neighbourhood of a church, a ſtatue of St. Peter upon a column of Trajan, and a Madona beſide an Apollo.</p>
                     <p>It appears, that even after Ruſcelli had written, there were ſtill infidels to perſuade, and that the work of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was not thought complete; for we find a great many future performances publiſhed in Italy, in France, and in Spain, on the ſame ſubject.</p>
                     <p>In 1593, a celebrated Venetian, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, MODESTA DI POZZO DI ZORZI, maintained the ſuperiority of her ſex to ours. Her performance had
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:013650_0126_0F91A4965191ECC0"/>great ſucceſs: and, unfortunately for her, what perhaps added to its celebrity was, that one might commend without jealouſy. She died juſt as it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. The men, however, always viewed with pleaſure thoſe kind of compoſitions by women. Pride, which conſtrues every thing to its own advantage, regarded as ſo many proofs of its pre-eminence, the very efforts which were made to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate its inferiority.</p>
                     <p>Lucretia Marinella, another Venetian lady, ſupported the ſame cauſe. Her performance is intituled, <q>The Dignity and Excellence of Women, with the Faults and Imperfections of Men.</q> The men, at leaſt, will not be accuſed of the fault of injuſtice to her; for ſhe had all the ſucceſs which beauty can give to genius.</p>
                     <p>In 1628, yet another Italian perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance appeared upon <q>The Dignity of Women.</q> The author of that book was one Chriſtopher Bronzini. The work is in dialogue, and divided by Days.
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:013650_0127_0F91A497043316A8"/>We may judge by the extent of his plan how rich the ſubject appeared to him: his diviſion is twenty-four Days. The eighth Day, in which nothing is treated of but marriage, occupies upwards of two hundred pages. Bronzini, in praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the women, has aſſigned them no rank, and has left the diſpute of the ſexes undecided.</p>
                     <p>But, in 1650, a book appeared, in which the controverſy was treated very prettily. The title of the piece was, <q>Woman better than man; a paradox, by James del Pozzo.</q> It ſeems doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful how far the women would be flattered with the word Paradox.</p>
                     <p>In Spain, in the ſixteenth century, John Spinoſa wrote a dialogue in praiſe of women. We may believe that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled them with all the imagination of his country, and with all the majeſty of his language.</p>
                     <p>The French women were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="122" facs="unknown:013650_0128_0F91A497B67CF598"/>honour of their ſex. Margaret queen of Navarre, and firſt wife to Henry IV. by turns devout and gay, and more ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated for the ſprightlineſs of her wit than the purity of her manners, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to prove, in a piece in the form of a letter, <q>that Woman is much ſuperior to Man.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mademoiſelle de Gournay, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be adopted by Montagne, wrote alſo upon her ſex; but, more modeſt, or more timid, ſhe confined her pretenſions, and was contented with equality. That modeſty however did not hinder Mary Schurman,— born at Cologn, and who in her life-time had a prodigious reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, — to ſay, after ſhe had read M. de Gournay's book in honour of her ſex, <q>I neither would nor dare approve all that is contained in this performance.</q> Yet, if any woman ever had a right to aſpire at the ſuperiority, it was perhaps that lady. She was a painter, muſician, engraver, ſculptor, philoſopher, geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trician, divine, and underſtood and ſpoke nine different languages,</p>

In 1643, a piece appeared at Paris under this title: <q>The Generous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; who ſhews that her Sex is more noble, more patriotic, more brave, more learned, more virtuous, and more oeconomical than that of man.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In 1665, another lady publiſhed at Paris a book intituled, <q>The illuſtrious Dames; where, by good and ſtrong Reaſons, it is proved, that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſurpaſs the Men.</q>

A lady of Languedoc, in the ſame century, was willing to repoſſeſs herſelf of the ſuperiority, and endeavoured to eſtabliſh it by GOOD and SURE reaſons. In ſhort, that opinion, or that contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, produced a kind of war among writers otherwiſe obſcure, and gave birth to Diſſertations, to Anſwers, and to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, now equally unknown: and it is but juſt to remark, that few of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be read, and that the queſtion has not been properly treated in any of them.

                     <p>TO determine this grand queſtion of ſelf-love and rivalry between the ſexes, it would be neceſſary to examine the ſtrength or weakneſs of their organs; the education of which they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable; the end of nature in forming them; how far it is poſſible to correct or to change her purpoſe; which would
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:013650_0134_0F91A49E83839110"/>gain, and which would loſe by departing from her; and, in ſhort, to mark par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the influence which the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of duties, of occupations, and of manners, muſt unavoidably have on the genius, on the ſentiments, and on the character of the two ſexes.</p>
                     <p>In comparing the intellectual powers of the ſexes, it would be neceſſary to conſider diſtinctly the philoſophical ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, which meditates; the talent of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, which collects; the talent of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, which creates; the moral and political talent, which governs.</p>
                     <p>It would further be neceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, to what degree women poſſeſs theſe four kinds of genius: If the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural weakneſs of their organs, which is the cauſe of their beauty; if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude of their character, which ariſes from their imagination; if the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and the variety of their ſenſations, which are numbered among their charms, may not deprive them of that vigorous and continued attention which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:013650_0135_0F91A49F40D05BD8"/>to connect a numerous train of ideas — an attention, which excludes all other objects, to view and contemplate one; which out of a ſingle idea produces a multitude, all chained to the firſt; or which, out of a number of ſcattered ideas, ſelects one primitive and vaſt idea which combines all the reſt.</p>
                     <p>This philoſophical ſpirit is rare, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, even among men; but ſtill there are many great men who have poſſeſſed it—who have raiſed themſelves to the height of nature to become acquainted with her works; who have ſhewn to the ſoul the ſource of its ideas; who have aſſigned to reaſon its bounds, to motion its laws, and to the univerſe its harmony; who have created ſciences in creating principles, and who have aggrandiſed the human mind in cultivating their own. If there is no woman found on a level with thoſe illuſtrious men, is it the fault of education, or of nature?</p>
                     <p>Deſcartes, abuſed by envious men, but admired by two generous princeſſes,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013650_0136_0F91A4A01EB51580"/>boaſted of the philoſophical talents of women. I am far however from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his gratitude could lead him into a voluntary error, even in compliment to beauty. He would no doubt find in Elizabeth and in Chriſtina a docility which prided itſelf in liſtening to ſo great a man, and which ſeemed to aſſociate it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his genius in following the range of his ideas. He might perhaps even find in the compoſitions of women per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity, order, and method; but did he find that ſtrong diſcernment, that depth of intellect, that diſſidence which characteriſes the real philoſopher? — Did he find that cool reaſon which, always inquiſitive, advances ſlowly, and remea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures all its ſteps?—Their genius, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating and rapid, flies off, — and is at reſt. They have more ſallies than ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. What they do not ſee at once, they either cannot ſee at all, or they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, or they deſpair to ſee. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore little wonder they ſhould want that unremitted aſſiduity, which alone can purſue and diſcover important truths.</p>

                     <p>It has been obſerved, that the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of women has in it ſomething un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountably ſingular and extraordinary. All things ſtrike it; all things paint themſelves on it in a lively manner. Their volatile ſenſes embrace every object, and carry off its image. Some unknown powers, ſome ſecret ſympathies enable them rapidly to ſeize the impreſſions. The material world is not ſufficient for them: they love to create an ideal world of their own; which they embelliſh, and prodigies — whatever tranſcends the ordinary laws of nature, is their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and their delight. They enjoy even their terrors. Their feelings are fine, and their fancy always approaches to enthuſiaſm.</p>
                     <p>But it would be neceſſary to inquire, how far that fancy, when applied to the arts, can unfold itſelf in the talent of creating and of painting: if their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013650_0138_0F91A4A190E2F7B0"/>is as vigorous, as it is lively and verſatile; if it does not unavoidably par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of their occupations, of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, of their taſtes, and even of their weakneſſes. I ſuſpect that their delicate fibres are afraid of ſtrong ſenſations, which fatigue them, and that they ſeek the ſoft, on which they may repoſe.</p>
                     <p>Man, always active, is expoſed to ſtorms. The imagination of the poet enjoys itſelf on the ridge of mountains, on the brink of volcanoes, in the middle of ruins, on ſeas, and on fields of battle; and it is never more ſuſceptible of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous and tender ideas, than after having experienced ſome great emotion.</p>
                     <p>But women, by means of their delicate and ſedentary life, leſs acquainted with the contraſt of the gentle and the terrible, may be ſuppoſed to feel and to paint leſs perfectly, even the agreeable ſenſations, than thoſe who, thrown into oppoſite conditions, paſs rapidly from the one ſentiment to the other. Perhaps too, from the habit of reſigning themſelves to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013650_0139_0F91A4A4DA15B048"/>the impreſſion of the moment, which with them is very ſtrong, their minds muſt be more repleniſhed with images than pictures:—or perhaps their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, though lively, may be compared to a mirror, which reflects fairly, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, multiplies, diſtorts, or diminiſhes, like their good-humour, their hopes, their fears, their jealouſies, their envies, the forms of all things, but creates no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     <p>Love is without diſpute the paſſion which the women feel the ſtrongeſt, and which they expreſs the beſt. They feel the other paſſions more feebly, and by rebound: but love is their own; it is the charm and the buſineſs of their life; it is their ſoul. They ſhould therefore know well how to paint it.</p>
                     <p>But do they know, like the author of Othello, of The Revenge, or of Zara, to expreſs the tranſports of a troubled ſoul, which joins fury to love; which is ſometimes impetuous, and ſometimes tender; which now is ſoftened, and now
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013650_0140_0F91A4A6CD835DA8"/>is rouſed; which ſheds blood, and which ſacrifices itſelf? Can they paint theſe doublings of the human heart, theſe ſtorms of emotion and paſſion?—No: na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture herſelf reſtrains them. She has given to one of the ſexes bold deſires, and the right of attack; to the other ſhe has aſſigned the province of defence, and timid deſires, which attract by reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Love in the one ſex is a conqueſt, in the other a ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>It therefore follows, that the women of all countries, and in all ages, muſt have known better how to paint a delicate and tender ſentiment, than a violent and turbulent paſſion. Obliged, in ſhort, by their duty, by the reſerve of their ſex, by the deſire of a certain charm, which is more bewitching than wit, and more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive than beauty, always to conceal a part of their ſentiments,—muſt not theſe ſentiments, by being continually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, become weaker by degrees, and have leſs energy than thoſe of men, who, at all times, bold and extravagant with impunity, give to their paſſions what tome
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013650_0141_0F91A4A7E123A480"/>they pleaſe, and which are invigorated by exerciſe?</p>
                     <p>A temporary conſtraint inflames the paſſions; but a continued conſtraint cools or extinguiſhes them.</p>
                     <p>With regard to the talent of order and memory, which claſſes facts, and ideas when neceſſary, as it depends a good deal upon method and habit, there ſeems little reaſon why the two ſexes may not poſſeſs it in an equal degree, Yet it would ſtill be neceſſary to examine, if the women would not be deficient in the quantity of materials, which are ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to erudition; if exceſſive appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation would not more eaſily diſguſt them. Is it not true, that their impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and natural deſire of change, which ariſe from fleeting and rapid impreſſions, prevent them from following for a courſe of years the ſame kind of ſtudy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently from acquiring profound or extenſive knowledge? We are ſenſible they have qualities of mind which atone for it. It is not the ſame hand which
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013650_0142_0F91A4A835FF1EC0"/>poliſhes the diamond, and which digs the mine.</p>
                     <p>We come now to a more important object, the moral and political talent; which conſiſts in the regulating of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and of others. To compare the advantages and diſadvantages of the two ſexes with regard to this object, it would be neceſſary to obſerve the ſame talent in ſociety, and when applied to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>The women in ſociety, by being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually upon the look-out, from the double motive of curioſity and of policy, muſt have a perfect knowledge of men. They muſt be able to diſentangle all the folds of ſelf-love; to diſcover the ſecret weakneſſes, the falſe modeſties, and the falſe grandeurs; what a man is, and what he would be; the qualities which he ſhews, even by an effort to conceal them; his eſteem marked even in his ſatires, and by his ſatires themſelves. They muſt know and diſtinguiſh cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters: —the cool pride, which enjoys
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013650_0143_0F91A4A906286698"/>itſelf in ſtate; the warm and impetuous pride, which is eaſily inflamed; the vain ſenſibility, the tender ſenſibility, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility which is veiled under an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of indifference; the pretended le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and the levity of the heart; the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence which proceeds from character, from vice, from misfortune, or from the mind; in ſhort, all the ſentiments, and all their ſhades.</p>
                     <p>As women ſet a high value on opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, they muſt reflect much upon what can produce it, deſtroy it, or confirm it. They muſt know how far one may direct, without appearing to be intereſted; how far one may preſume upon that art, even after it is known; in what eſtimation they are held by thoſe with whom they live, and to what degree it is neceſſary to ſerve them that they may govern them.</p>
                     <p>In all matters of buſineſs women know the great effects which are produced by little cauſes. They have the art of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing upon ſome, by ſeeming to diſcover
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013650_0144_0F91A4A9B5378130"/>to them what they already know; of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting others from their purpoſe, by confirming their moſt diſtant ſuſpicions. They know how to captivate by praiſes, thoſe who merit them; and to raiſe a bluſh, by beſtowing them where they are not due.</p>
                     <p>Theſe delicate ſciences are the leading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrings in which the women conduct the men. Society to them is like a harpſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chord, of which they know the touches: they can divine the ſound which every one will produce. But the men, bold and free, ſupplying addreſs by force, conſequently having leſs call for obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and hurried along beſides by the continual neceſſity of acting, can ſcarcely be poſſeſſed of that crowd of little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices and polite attentions, which are every moment neceſſary in the commerce of life: their calculations therefore on ſociety muſt be more ſlow, and leſs ſure, than thoſe of women.</p>
                     <p>It would afterwards be neceſſary to compare the genius of the two ſexes, as applied to government.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="unknown:013650_0145_0F91A4AA9A108028"/>
In ſociety men are governed by their paſſions, and the leaſt motives often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the greateſt conſequences. But, in the government of ſtates, it is by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive views, by the choice of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and, above all, by the diſcovery and the employment of talents, that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs can be obtained. Here, inſtead of taking advantage of foibles, we muſt fear them; we muſt raiſe men above their weakneſſes, not lead them into them.</p>
                     <p>The art of governing in ſociety may therefore be ſaid to conſiſt in flattering vice and folly with addreſs; and the art of adminiſtration, in combating them with judgment. The knowledge of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind required in the two caſes is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: In the one, they muſt be known by their weakneſs; in the other, by their ſtrength. The one takes part with fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for little ends; the other diſcovers great qualities, which are mingled with thoſe very faults. The one, in ſhort, ſeeks little blemiſhes in great men, and the other, in diſſecting great men, muſt often
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013650_0146_0F91A4ADC3307F70"/>perceive the ſame ſpots: for perfect cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters exiſt only in Utopia.</p>
                     <p>Let us now examine, if this kind of genius and obſervation agrees equally with the character of the two ſexes. I know that there are women who have reigned, and who ſtill reign with luſtre. Chriſtina in Sweden, Iſabella of Caſtile in Spain, and Elizabeth in England, have merited the eſteem of their age, and of poſterity. We ſaw, in the war of 1741, a princeſs, whom even her enemies ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, defend the German empire with no leſs genius than courage; and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, at this day, the Ottoman empire ſhaken by a woman. But, in general queſtions, we ſhould beware of taking exceptions for rules; we ought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend only to the ordinary courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>It therefore becomes neceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, if in ſociety the women being leſs engaged in action, and in general leſs fit for it, can know ſo well as the other ſex, the talents of men, their uſe, or their
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013650_0147_0F91A4AE8EF3BE58"/>extent; if great views, and the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of great principles, including the habit of ſeizing at a glance the reſult of things, correſpond not ill with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity of their imagination, or at leaſt with the arrangement of their ideas. It is character chiefly which governs; it is the vigour of the ſoul which gives im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe to genius, which ſtrengthens and extends political capacity. But this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is ſeldom formed but by great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, by great hopes, by great fears, and by the neceſſity of being continually engaged in action. Is not then the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of women in general, better calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for elegance than for ſway?—for attraction than for command?—Does not their rapid imagination, which often makes ſentiment precede thought, render them more ſuſceptible of prejudice or of error in the choice of men?—Would not one be in danger of abuſe, would not one even run the riſk of their diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if he ſhould ſay, that in the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of their eſteem they would ſet too high a value upon external accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and, in ſhort, that they would
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013650_0148_0F91A4AF01EECBF8"/>perhaps be too eaſily led to believe, that an agreeable man was a great man?—</p>
                     <p>Yet Elizabeth was not free from this cenſure. The inclinations of her ſex ſtole beneath the cares of the throne, and the grandeur of her character. We are chagrined at certain times, to ſee the little weakneſſes of a woman mingle with the views of a great mind. If Mary queen of Scotland had been leſs fair, perhaps her rival had been leſs cruel. This taſte for coquetry, as is well known, furniſhed Elizabeth with favourites; in the choice of which ſhe judged more like a woman than a ſovereign. She was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways too ready to believe, that the power of pleaſing her implied genius.</p>
                     <p>That ſo much celebrated queen exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed over England an almoſt arbitrary ſway; at which perhaps we ought not to be ſurpriſed. Women in general on the throne are more inclined to deſpotiſm, and more impatient of reſtraint than men. The ſex to whom nature has aſſigned power by giving them ſtrength, have a
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013650_0149_0F91A4AFB60E7488"/>certain confidence which raiſes them in their own eyes; ſo that they have no need of manifeſting to themſelves that ſuperiority of which they are ſure. But weakneſs, aſtoniſhed at the ſway which ſhe poſſeſſes, ſhakes her ſceptre on every ſide, to eſtabliſh her dominion.</p>
                     <p>Great men are perhaps more carried to that ſpecies of deſpotiſm which ariſes from lofty ideas; and women, above the ordinary claſs, to the deſpotiſm which proceeds from paſſion. The laſt is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſally of the heart, than the effect of ſyſtem.</p>
                     <p>One thing which favours the deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of female ſovereigns is, that the men confound the empire of their ſex with that of their rank. What we refuſe to grandeur, we pay to beauty. But the dominion of women, even when arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is ſeldom cruel. Theirs is rather a deſpotiſm of caprice, than of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The throne itſelf cannot cure their
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013650_0150_0F91A4B07564C708"/>ſenſibility they carry in their boſoms the counterpoiſe of their power<note n="*" place="bottom">Hence it follows, that in limited monarchies fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ſovereigns will tend to deſpotiſm from their jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy; and, in abſolute governments, will approach to monarchy by their mildneſs. This obſervation is prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by experience.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>If, after having compared the talents of the two ſexes, we ſhould compare their virtues, we would receive very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent informations.</p>
                     <p>Both experience and hiſtory atteſt, that in all ſects, in all countries, and in all ranks, the women have more religious virtues than the men. Naturally poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of more ſenſibility, they have more need of an object that may unceaſingly occupy their ſouls; they offer to God a ſentiment which they cannot contain, and which otherwiſe would be a crime. Greedy of happineſs, and not finding enough in this world, they launch into a life and a world abounding with ineffable delights. Extreme in their deſires, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing limited can ſatisfy them.—More
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013650_0151_0F91A4B26DB11138"/>flexible in their duties than men, they reaſon leſs, and feel more. More ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to good opinion, they pay more attention to what concerns themſelves. Leſs occupied, and leſs active, they have more time for contemplation. Leſs ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted or abſent, they are more ſtrongly affected by the ſame idea, becauſe they ſee it continually. More ſtruck by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal objects, they reliſh more the pageantry of ceremonies and of temples; and the devotion of the ſenſes has no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable effect on that of the ſoul. Confined, in ſhort, on all hands, denied the effuſion of their ſentiments to men by the reſerve of their ſex, to women by an eternal rivalry, they may at leaſt talk of their pleaſures and their pains to the great Being who knows them, and they often pour into his boſom many dear weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of which the world are ignorant. In ſo doing they recall their beloved er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, they enjoy even their ſorrow, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reproaching themſelves; and afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet free from remorſe, becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the eye of a benevolent Deity, they
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013650_0152_0F91A4B2B4740638"/>find ſecret delights in repenting, and in combating their warmeſt wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>It ſhould ſeem therefore, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the character of women, that their religion muſt be more tender, and that of men more ſevere, the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting more in practice, the other in principles; and, in exalting their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ideas, that the woman is more liable to ſuperſtition, the man to fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm. But, if once fanaticiſm catch hold of the woman, her more lively imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will carry her a greater length; and, more auſtere even from the dread of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, what was formerly a part of her charms, will only contribute to increaſe her fury.</p>
                     <p>The domeſtic virtues are intimately connected with thoſe of religion. They are doubtleſs common to both ſexes: but the advantage ſeems ſtill to be in favour of the women. At leaſt they have more need of virtues which they have more occaſion to practice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="unknown:013650_0153_0F91A4B3DA15E6F8"/>
In the firſt period of life, timid, and without ſupport, the girl is more attached to her mother: by ſeldom leaving her, ſhe comes to love her more. The trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling innocent is cheared by the preſence of her protectreſs; and her weakneſs, while it heightens her beauty, augments her ſenſibility. Become mother, ſhe has other duties, which all things invite her to fulfil. Then the condition of the two ſexes is widely different.</p>
                     <p>Man, in the middle of his labours, and among his arts, employing his powers, and commanding nature, finds a pleaſure in his induſtry, in his ſucceſs, and even in his toils. But woman, more ſolitary, and leſs active, has fewer reſources: her pleaſures muſt ariſe from her virtues; her amuſements are her family. It is by the cradle of her child—it is in viewing the ſmiles of her daughter, or the ſports of her ſon, that a mother is happy.</p>
                     <p>And where are the bowels, the cries, the powerful emotions of nature?— Where is the ſentiment, at once ſublime
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013650_0154_0F91A4B454444F08"/>and pathetic, that carries every feeling to exceſs?—is it to be found in the froſty indifference, and the four ſeverity of ſo many fathers?—No; but in the warm and paſſionate boſom of a mother. It is ſhe, who by an impulſe, as quick as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary, ruſhes into the flood to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a boy, whoſe imprudence had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him to the waves. It is ſhe, who, in the middle of a conflagration, throws herſelf acroſs the flames to ſave a ſleeping infant. It is ſhe, who with diſhevelled locks, pale, diſtracted, embraces with tranſport the body of a dead child, preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its cold lips to hers, as if ſhe would reanimate by her tears and her careſſes the inſenſible clay.</p>
                     <p>Theſe great expreſſions of nature, theſe heart-rending emotions, which fill us at once with wonder, compaſſion, and terror, always have belonged, and always will belong, only to women. They poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs in thoſe moments an inexpreſſible ſomething, which carries them beyond themſelves; they ſeem to diſcover to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013650_0155_0F91A4B78D1D77B8"/>us new ſouls, above the ſtandard of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
                     <p>If we conſider even the matrimonial duties, the obligations of huſband and wife; which of the two ſexes is moſt likely to be faithful?—which, in violating them, has moſt obſtacles to encounter? —Is not woman beſt defended by her education, by her reſerve, by that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty which ſilences even her deſires, and ſometimes diſputes the rights of the moſt tender love?—To theſe reſtraints we may add, the power of the firſt paſſion and the firſt ties over a heart endowed with ſenſibility, and which had formerly been forbid to love; the force of opinion, which reigns ſo deſpotically over the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and which, tyrant-like, applauds often the ſame weakneſſes in the one ſex, for which it devotes the other to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy.</p>
                     <p>Nature herſelf, attentive in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the manners of women, has taken care to ſurround them with the ſtrongeſt, yet the gentleſt barriers. She
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013650_0156_0F91A4B9778E9478"/>has made inconſtancy more painful, and fidelity more pleaſing to their hearts:— and it muſt be owned, that they have ſeldom begun the diſorders of families. Even in ages of general corruption, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal infidelity in women has been one of the laſt of crimes.</p>
                     <p>After the religious and domeſtic vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues come the ſocial virtues; and firſt the virtues of ſenſibility, or the ſweet and affectionate paſſions. The chief of theſe are friendſhip and love.</p>
                     <p>It has long been a queſtion, which of the two ſexes is moſt capable of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Montaigne, who is ſo much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for his knowledge of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, has given it poſitively againſt the women; and his opinion has been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally embraced: but he appears to have judged too haſtily on this ſubject. Through his whole Eſſays, indeed, he has done too little juſtice to the gentle ſex. Perhaps—for we cannot accuſe him of inſenſibility—he was like that
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013650_0157_0F91A4BA80FEC6A8"/>judge who, conſcious of his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was ſo much afraid of being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, that he decided every cauſe againſt his friends.</p>
                     <p>If I were to converſe with Montaigne on this ſubject, I would ſay to him,</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>You undoubtedly agree, that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is the ſentiment of two ſouls, which ſeek and which have need of the ſupport of each other. Now it ſhould ſeem, that the ſex whoſe head and hands are moſt occupied; which is moſt independent; which is moſt free; which has the greateſt ability of expanding its ideas, and of employing its ſentiments; which in proſperity is better ſupported by pride; which in adverſity is more humbled than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; which in all conditions has a conſciouſneſs of its powers, and which glories in them—it ſhould ſeem that man could more eaſily diſpenſe with the commerce, and the ſweet effuſions of friendſhip. But woman, delicate and feeble, and on that account having
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013650_0158_0F91A4BB05920E50"/>more need of ſupport; in herſelf more ſubject to chagrin, to private griefs, and to that ſorrow of heart which finds more relief in ſenſibility than pride; in the world, obliged almoſt always to play a part, and to carry along with her a load of ſenſations and of ideas, which ſhe hides, and which oppreſs her—woman, in ſhort, to whom externals are nothing, and her feelings every thing; woman, in whom every thing produces a ſentiment, to whom indifference is violence, and who knows almoſt only to love and to hate, muſt feel more exquiſitely the liberty and the pleaſure of a ſecret commerce, and the tender conſidence which friendſhip gives and receives.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Montaigne would not fail to reply,</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>You judge of women according to nature; judge of them likewiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſociety, as they exiſt in the world, and particularly in great cities. Examine if their general deſire to pleaſe, a ſentiment more ſlight than
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013650_0159_0F91A4BBDD682AF0"/>deep, and more vain than tender, has not withered their hearts, and in a great meaſure blaſted ſenſibility itſelf; if, intoxicated with eternal flattery, and accuſtomed to the ſweeteſt dominion, they could ſubmit to continual ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and to that happy equality which friendſhip impoſes; if, in ſhort, in their friendſhip with us, they would not have too much reſerve: — and how contemptible is a friendſhip which is on its guard, where the ſentiments are always covered with a ſlender veil, and where the naked heart is never ſeen!</p>
                        <p>I ſpeak not of their friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themſelves: there was no ſuch thing known in my time; and, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is the ſame in yours. But I ſhould be glad to know how they can love, or repoſe confidence in each other, in a world where they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually compared, and are continually comparing themſelves; where their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments divide them; where their pretenſions interfere; where they are rivals in rank, in beauty, in fortune,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013650_0160_0F91A4BC8EBCEB30"/>in wit, in their talent for ſociety, and in their ſocieties themſelves: for ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love always calculating, always mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring, views all things, is offended at all things, and is foſtered even by what offends it.</p>
                        <p>No!" —Montaigne might add, Friendſhip does not conſiſt in empty ſhow, in jargon, in vain phraſes, more ridiculous even in their motive than their meaning. It is a ſentiment which requires energy of ſoul, and a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of mind as well as of character; it is a ſacred and almoſt a holy union, which by a devotion peculiar to itſelf, conſecrates a heart entirely to a heart; it is a paſſion which transforms two wills into one, and gives to two beings the ſame life and the ſame ſoul.</p>
                        <p>Friendſhip is bold and ſevere: for, properly to fulfil its duties, it muſt be able to ſpeak and to hear the harſh and ungrateful language of truth. It muſt poſſeſs a courage, which is neither alarmed at ſacrifices nor at dangers:
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013650_0161_0F91A4BD33A2D770"/>and it demands, above all things, that unity of character which, from the variety and the eternal fluctuation of their paſſions, we ſeldom find in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and which only can enable us to feel, to think, and to act as a friend, at all times, and upon all occaſions.</p>
                        <p>What do I ſay? — Are not friends more ſtrongly aſſociated by great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and by great trials? — But wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, by their condition, are deſtined to repoſe. Nature has formed them, like the flowers, to bloom ſweetly on the parterre which gives them birth; but the trees, produced and reared in the middle of ſtorms, and in more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, even from their ſtrength, of being broken by the winds, have more need of ſupport from each other, and they are ſuſtained by union.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>From theſe objections, it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps follow, that friendſhip in women muſt be more rare than among men; but it will alſo be allowed at the ſame time, that it muſt be more delicate and more
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013650_0162_0F91A4BDF523C668"/>tender. Men have in general more of the parade than the elegance of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. They often wound while they ſerve; and their warmeſt ſentiments are not ſufficiently illuminated with thoſe little attentions which are of ſo much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue in the intercourſe of ſouls. But wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have a ſenſibility which is never ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which never forgets or omits any thing. Nothing eſcapes them: they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine the hidden friendſhip; they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the baſhful or timid friendſhip, and they offer their ſweeteſt conſolations to friendſhip in diſtreſs. Furniſhed with ſiner inſtruments, they treat more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately a wounded heart; they compoſe it, and prevent it from feeling its ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: and they know, above all things, to give an importance to circumſtances which have none in themſelves. We ought therefore perhaps to deſire the friendſhip of a man upon great occaſions; but, for general happineſs, we muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the friendſhip of a woman.</p>
                     <p>Women in love have the ſame delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and the ſame weakneſſes. Their
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013650_0163_0F91A4BEBA4C4160"/>paſſions are keen: they either love at once, or do not love at all. Men are leſs eaſily inflamed, and by degrees. The paſſions of women, by being more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, are perhaps more ardent: they are nurſed by ſilence, and rouſed by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Fear and modeſty mingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude with love in their gentle hearts, and by exerciſing it, double its force. — When a man is ſure of his conqueſt, his paſſion is tinctured with pride; but a woman is then only more tender. The more her confeſſion has coſt her, the more dearly ſhe loves the man to whom it was made. She attaches herſelf by her ſacrifices. Virtuous, ſhe enjoys her denials; guilty, ſhe glories in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſhe beſtows.</p>
                     <p>Women therefore, when love is a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, are more conſtant than men; but, when it is only an appetite, they are more libertine. For then they feel no more thoſe anxieties, thoſe ſtruggles, and that ſweet ſhame, which impreſſed the delicious ſentiment ſo ſtrongly on their hearts. Nothing remains but the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013650_0164_0F91A4C3D904FFB0"/>ſenſes and imagination: — ſenſes guided by caprice; an imagination waſted by its own ardour, and which is every moment inflamed and extinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>After love and friendſhip come bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, and that generous compaſſion which intereſts the heart in the miſſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of others. Theſe are more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the portion of women. Every thing inclines them to generoſity and Their delicate ſenſes revolt at the preſence of diſtreſs and pain. Objects of miſery and averſion diſcompoſe the ſoft indolence of their minds. Their ſouls are more hurt by images of ſorrow and of ſpleen than tormented by their own ſenſibility. They muſt therefore be very anxious to afford relief. — They poſſeſs beſides in a high degree, that inſtinctive feeling, which operates without reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and they often relieve, while men deliberate. Their benevolence is perhaps leſs rational, but it is more active. It is alſo more attentive, and more tender. What woman has ever been wanting in commiſeration to the unfortunate?</p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="unknown:013650_0165_0F91A4C3F89B8420"/>
                     <p>But it would be neceſſary to examine if women, ſo ſuſceptible of friedſhip, of love, of piety, of benevolence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, can elevate themſelves to that patriotiſm, or diſintereſted love of one's country, which embraces all its citizens, and to that philanthropy, or univerſal love of mankind, which embraces all nations.</p>
                     <p>I would not be thought to undervalue patriotiſm. It is the nobleſt ſentiment of the human mind; at leaſt it is that which has produced the greateſt men, and which gave birth to thoſe ancient heroes, whoſe hiſtory ſtill aſtoniſhes our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and accuſes our weakneſs. But if we ſhould trace its ſource, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in what it conſiſts, we would find that this boaſted virtue is almoſt always a compoſition of pride and ſelfiſhneſs, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by the ideas of intereſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, by the remembrance of paſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, by the hope of future honours or rewards, and a certain factitious enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm which robs men of themſelves, to
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013650_0166_0F91A4C5E6BF3850"/>tranſform their exiſtence entirely into the body of the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſentiments, it will readily be perceived, do not correſpond with the condition of women. In almoſt all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, excluded from honours, and from offices, they can neither obtain, nor hope to obtain, nor attach them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſtate, from the pride of having held a place of eminence. Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of little property, and reſtrained by the laws even in what they have, the form of legiſlation in all countries muſt make them in a great meaſure indifferent to public welfare. Never acting or fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their country, they have not one flattering remembrance to tie them to it, by vanity, by labours, or by virtues. Exiſting, in ſhort, more in themſelves, and in the objects of their ſenſibility, and being perhaps leſs fitted than men by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the civil inſtitutions in which they have leſs ſhare, they muſt be leſs ſuſceptible of that enthuſiaſm, which makes a man prefer the ſtate to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013650_0167_0F91A4C720643898"/>and the collective body of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>The example of the women of Rome and Sparta, I am ſenſible, may be urged in objection to theſe obſervations; but thoſe ancient republics are not to be compared with our modern eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The wonders performed by the Dutch women, in the revolution of the Seven Provinces, will likewiſe perhaps be urged. To which I anſwer, that the glorious enthuſiaſm of liberty can do all things; that there are times when nature is aſtoniſhed at herſelf; and that great virtues ſpring from great calamities. But of ſuch there is no reaſoning.</p>
                     <p>If the love of their country is little ſuited to women, that univerſal love of mankind, which extends to all nations, and to all ages, and which is a kind of abſtract ſentiment, ſeems to correſpond ſtill leſs with their character. They muſt have an image of what they love. It is only by the power of arranging his ideas, that the philoſopher is able to overleap
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013650_0168_0F91A4C7B697D480"/>ſo many barriers; to paſs from a man, to a people; from a people, to human kind; from the time in which he lives, to ages yet unborn; and from what he ſees, to what he does not ſee.</p>
                     <p>The tender ſex do not love to ſend their ſouls ſo far a-wandering. They aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble their ſentiments and their ideas about them, and confine their affections to what intereſts them moſt. Thoſe ſtrides of benevolence to women are out of nature. A man to them, is more than a nation; and the hour in which they live, than a thouſand ages after death.</p>
                     <p>There are certain qualities, which have generally been ranked among the ſocial virtues, but which may more properly be called THE VIRTUES OF POLISHED LIFE. They are the charm and the bond of company; and are uſeful at all times and upon all occaſions. They are in the commerce of the world, what current money is in trade: they are ſometimes not abſolutely neceſſary, but
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013650_0169_0F91A4C872E5A5D8"/>one can never ſafely be without them; and they always procure the poſſeſſor a more favourable reception. Such is that mild complacency, which gives a ſoftneſs to the character, and an attractive ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the manners; that indulgence, which pardons the faults of others, even when it has no need of pardon itſelf; the art of not ſeeing the weakneſſes which diſcover themſelves, and of keeping the ſecret of thoſe who hide it; of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our advantages, when we humble our rivals or opponents; of dealing gently with thoſe, who cannot ſubmit without being offended: that facility, which adopts ideas which it never had; that delicate foreſight, which divines the fears of thoſe with whom we converſe, and encourages the diſplay of thought and ſentiment; that freedom, which inſpires confidence; and all that politeneſs, in ſhort, which perhaps is not virtue,—nay, which is ſometimes no more than a happy lie,—but which gives laws to ſelf-love, and makes pride ſit eaſy by the ſide of pride, which would otherwiſe every moment be wounded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="unknown:013650_0170_0F91A4C942FCD0F8"/>
We ſhall not trace the parallel of the ſexes through all theſe ſentiments; but it is neceſſary to obſerve in general, that the women correct that rudeneſs which pride and paſſion introduce into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men. Their delicate hand ſmooths the aſperities of human life. Politeneſs is a part of their character; it is connected with their mind, with their manners, and even with their intereſt. To the moſt virtuous woman ſociety is a field of conqueſt.</p>
                     <p>Few men have formed the project of making every body happy, and ſo much the worſe for thoſe who have: but many women have not only formed ſuch a ſcheme, but have ſucceeded in it. The more general the intercourſe of the ſexes, the more the talent of pleaſing is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; the more general this ſpecies of merit; for then there are more little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts to conciliate, and characters to unite. Society becomes a complicated machine, and demands more dexterity to regulate its movements.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="39" facs="unknown:013650_0171_0F91A4CA35A9C330"/>
*We are, in general, ſo much the more polite, as we are leſs devoted to ourſelves and more to others; as we are more attentive to opinion; as we are more zealous to be diſtinguiſhed; and, perhaps, in proportion as we have fewer reſources and great means of being ſo. But theſe are not all: among individuals and among a people, between the ſexes and between the ranks, politeneſs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a certain degree of idleneſs; for it ſuppoſes the habit and the neceſſity of living together. Hence the art of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating our behaviour, of adjuſting our looks, our words, and our motions; the need of attentions, and all the little gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications of vanity. We are naturally inclined to pay that homage which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and to exact that which we pay. Thus the delicacy of ſelf-love produces all the refinements in ſociety; as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy of the ſenſes produces all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements in pleaſure; and as the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of taſte, which is perhaps only the reſult of the other two, produces all the refinements in literature, arts, and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.—It will be eaſy to diſcern how
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013650_0172_0F91A4CD56A38070"/>theſe objects are connected with one another, and how they are all related to women.</p>
                     <p>But refined politeneſs, it may be ſaid, is allied to falſhood. It ſubſtitutes the expreſſion of ſentiment too often for ſentiment itſelf. Hence the reproach ſo common againſt women:—and it muſt be owned, that they are by nature more diſpoſed to every kind of diſſimulation than men. Power and independance diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play all their motions with freedom; but weakneſs and the art of pleaſing, muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and meaſure all theirs. The timid ſex therefore learn to hide the ſentiments which they have, and exhibit thoſe which they have not.</p>
                     <p>A man may be open without being on that account entitled to praiſe; for he is often ſo without effort, nay from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity of ſoul which he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain; but ſincerity in a woman, when real, is never without merit. Men are ſometimes frank by deſign: women ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom affect that ſpecies of hypocriſy; and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:013650_0173_0F91A4CE62915998"/>when they do, to pleaſe the better, they give to their frankneſs the air of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. It is a ſacrifice which they make to friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>Men owe their frankneſs to pride, women to addreſs. The one ſex often utters a truth without any other view than truth itſelf; in the mouth of the other, even truth itſelf has an aim. The falſity of man almoſt always regards his intereſt; it is only for himſelf: that of woman generally proceeds from a deſire to pleaſe; ſhe refers every thing to others. The one cheats, the other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces you.</p>
                     <p>Flattery is common to both ſexes. But the flattery of men is often groſs to a degree that is baſe: that of women is more light, and has more the appearance of ſentiment. Even when it is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, it is generally amuſing, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſguſting. The motive and the manner ſave them from contempt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="unknown:013650_0174_0F91A4CE89E9B070"/>
To conclude this parallel, (which is already too long) it would be neceſſary ſtill to examine the rigid virtues of the two ſexes which are connected with juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and the bold and nervous qualities which are allied to courage.</p>
                     <p>But almoſt all the diſtinctions, which can be made on theſe ſubjects, proceed upon the ſame principles. Thus, for inſtance, in regard to equity, whence ariſe the duties of a ſevere and impartial juſtice; if there is one of the ſexes which almoſt always feels before it judges, and which is led by an imagination, that gives it averſions or likings for which it cannot account; whoſe caprices an uniform and inflexible rule would fatigue; and whoſe deciſions have at all times been more go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by particular ideas, than by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral views: it muſt be owned, that ſuch a character agrees ill with that rigid equity which pays leſs regard to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances than to facts, and to perſons than to things. Hence women rarely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the law, which pronounces with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:013650_0175_0F91A4CF4B581168"/>love or hate. Their juſtice has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſome head-mark, to diſtinguiſh thoſe whom it condemns or abſolves. Conſult the annals of hiſtory, and you will find them generally bordering on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of pity, or exceſs of vengeance. They want that cool deliberation which knows where to ſtop: to them modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is torment.</p>
                     <p>A woman of ſome genius has ſaid<note n="*" place="bottom">Madame de Graſſini, <hi>Lettres Peruviennes.</hi>
                        </note>, that the French ſeem to have eſcaped from the hands of nature, ſince they have nothing in their compoſition but air and fire. She might have ſaid as much of her ſex; but ſhe, no doubt, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to betray her ſecret.</p>
                     <p>It might ſeem bold, to preſume to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine how far the two ſexes are by nature ſuſceptible of courage. But the word Courage is ſo vague, that to give it any determinate idea we muſt diſtinguiſh that virtue into its different ſpecies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="unknown:013650_0176_0F91A4CFF8AEECE0"/>
The diſtinction of mental and animal courage, is well known: but theſe two kinds ſubdivide themſelves again. In the courage of mind, for example, we find a courage of principle, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies opinion; a courage of will, which gives energy to the ſoul, and ſpurns con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; a courage of conſtancy, which ſupports the idea of toil, and toil itſelf; a calm courage, which, in the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate circumſtances, views all things deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately. In the animal courage, in like manner, we find a courage againſt pain, which knows how to ſuffer; a courage againſt danger, whether it conſiſts of that hardineſs which encounters, or that firmneſs which keeps its poſt; an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual courage, which is always the ſame, and which diſcovers itſelf at all times, and upon all occaſions; and that enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic courage, which is a kind of fine fever of the ſoul, which rages and ceaſes by fits, and which meets with intrepidity at one time, what it would ſhrink from at another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="unknown:013650_0177_0F91A4D0B206BF58"/>
It would not be neceſſary to make a particular application of theſe, details; the reader's own reflections will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. We ought, however, to obſerve, that the courage which the women poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs in the higheſt degree, is that of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting pain; which is no doubt owing to the variety of ills to which they are ſubjected by nature. But whatever it proceeds from, the fact is certain: they would ſooner ſuffer than diſpleaſe, and would a thouſand times rather endure pain than reproach.</p>
                     <p>We have likewiſe ſeen women demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate an extraordinary courage in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but it is always owing to ſome ſtrong paſſion, or great idea, which rouſes their minds, and elevates them above themſelves. Then their inflamed imagination gives a new direction to the imagination of their ſex; and their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſenſibility, tending to one object, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the little ſenſibilities of character, which are the ſources of fear and of weakneſs. Under ſuch agitations they poſſeſs a courage which nothing can
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:013650_0178_0F91A4D18D414B98"/>withſtand, and which in effort exceeds even habitual valour; which, by reaſon of its experience, has leſs impetuoſity, as it borders leſs upon extravagance.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are ſome of the ſubjects which ſhould be diſcuſſed and compared, in ſettling the diſpute of the Equality, or Superiority of the Sexes. To treat the queſtion properly, it would be neceſſary to be at the ſame time a phyſician, an anatomiſt, and a philoſopher; to be equally rational and ſentimental; and, above all theſe ſingular attainments, one muſt have the misfortune to be perfectly diſintereſted.</p>

                     <head>SECTION VI. Of the Decline of ſerious Gallantry, and of the Progreſs of Society in FRANCE.</head>
                     <p>THE ſixteenth century, in which the diſpute of the ſuperiority of the ſexes was ſo much agitated, appears to have been the moſt brilliant era in the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:013650_0179_0F91A4D4D200EEB8"/>annals of women. After that period we find fewer champions, either literary or warlike, enliſted under their banners. The enthuſiaſm of ſerious gallantry was ſomewhat abated. The entire extinction of chivalry in Europe; the abolition of tournaments; the religious wars in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many. and in France, which drew the women of rank to court; and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners which neceſſarily flow from idleneſs, from intrigue, and from beauty being regarded as an inſtrument of fortune—in ſhort the new taſte of ſociety which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan univerſally to prevail, a taſte which poliſhed the manners in corrupting them, and which, by mingling the ſexes advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly, taught them to ſeek one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more, but eſteem one another leſs; —all contributed to diminiſh a ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which, to gather ſtrength, ſtands in need of obſtacles, and of a certain ſtate of the ſoul in which it is honoured by its deſires, and reſpected even from its weakneſs.</p>
                     <p>The progreſs of this revolution, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was for ſome time ſlow in France.
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:013650_0180_0F91A4D6BA9C7C70"/>Under Francis I. who gave the ſignal of corruption, we find ſtill in the affairs of love a jealouſy, a revenge, a hate, and crimes which prove the manners,</p>
                     <p>Under Catherine of Medicis, love was a mixture of gallantry and fury. The Italian ardour mingled itſelf with the French voluptuouſneſs. All was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue. They talked of carnage in the rendezvous of beauty, and meditated in dancing the ruin of nations. In the mean time, the attention to policy and war, the factions, the parties, and a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic ſomething which ſtill remained, gave an energy to the ſoul, which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered itſelf even in the ſentiments which the women inſpired.</p>
                     <p>The reign of Henry IV. diſplayed a milder gallantry. That prince joined the courteous manners of a knight, to the weakneſſes of a great king. It was thought an honour to imitate him; and his courtiers, bold and brilliant, accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to glory and to conqueſt, carried into love a ſpecies of that noble courage
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:013650_0181_0F91A4D7B7252C18"/>which they had diſplayed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats of war. They were corrupted, but not debaſed.</p>
                     <p>Under Lewis XIII. genius, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to unfold itſelf, mingled metaphyſics with gallantry. Every body knows the famous theſis which Cardinal Richlieu cauſed to be ſupported on love. That ludicrous injunction, which ſome may ſuppoſe was given in jeſt, and intended as a burleſque on the miſapplication of learning and talents, was no more than a ſerious expreſſion of the manners of thoſe times in France. The religious conteſts had brought controverſy into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion. The infant taſte in letters made them take the ſcholaſtic forms for ſcience. A falſe wit ſprung from a deſire of being witty, and the inability to be ſo. The gallantry, which mingled itſelf with all things, and which diſturbed nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not deep—the gallantry, which was rather a twiſt of the fancy than a ſentiment of the heart, adopted the whole maſs of abſurdities, and formed a jargon equally myſtical, metaphyſical,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:013650_0182_0F91A4D845CE9668"/>and romantic. There was nothing writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or talked of, but diſſertations upon the delicacies and the ſacrifices of love.</p>
                     <p>Though we generally deſcant little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what we feel much, yet theſe conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations and reaſonings diſcovered a turn of mind, which, in permitting gallantry, connected it with tenderneſs, and which always joined to the idea of woman the ideas of ſenſibility and reſpect.</p>
                     <p>The regency of Anne of Auſtria, and the war of the minority, formed a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar era. France was a ſcene of anarchy: but the taſte of the times mingled plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry with battles, and ballads with fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. All things then were conducted by women. They had in that period all the reſtleſs agitation which is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the ſpirit of party; a ſpirit which is leſs foreign to their character than is commonly ſuppoſed. Some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the ſhock, others received it. Every one according to her intereſt and her views caballed, wrote, and conſpired. Their aſſemblies were at midnight. A
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:013650_0183_0F91A4D901125290"/>woman in a bed, or on a ſopha, was the ſoul of the council. There ſhe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to negociate, to fight, to embroil or accommodate matters with the court.</p>
                     <p>Love preſided at all their conſultations. They conſpired to ruin a lover in the affections of his miſtreſs, and a miſtreſs in the favour of her lover, with as much ſolemnity as to lay waſte a city, or aſſaſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inate a prince; and not without reaſon: for a revolution in love almoſt always announced a revolution in politics.</p>
                     <p>Each woman had her department, and her dominion. Madame de Montbazon, fair and ſhewy, governed the duke of Beaufort; Madame de Longueville, the duke of Rochefoucault; Madame de Chatillon, Namours and Conde; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle de Chevreuſe, the Coadjutor; Mademoiſelle de Saujon, devout and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the duke of Orleans; and the ducheſs of Bouillon, her huſband.—In the mean time Madame de Chevreuſe, lively and warm, reſigned herſelf to her lovers from taſte, and to politics occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally;
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:013650_0184_0F91A4D9B43B1418"/>and the Princeſs Palatine, in turns the friend and the enemy of the great Conde, by means of her genius more than by her beauty, ſubjected all whom ſhe deſired to pleaſe, and whom ſhe had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a whim or an intereſt to perſuade. She poſſeſſed at once a paſſionate heart and a ſound head; and ſhe was no leſs romantic in love, than politic in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Women often appeared publicly at the head of factions, in camps, and in councils of war. Then, to the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of equipage and dreſs, they joined the enſigns of their party. At ſuch a ſight one muſt have ſuppoſed himſelf tranſported to the regions of romance, or carried back to the times of ancient chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry. On the field, and in the fortreſs, inſtruments of muſic were mingled with inſtruments of war; curiaſſes with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins; lutes with ſpears; and the poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed features of beauty bloomed by the ſide of the war-worn ſoldier.</p>
                     <p>Devotion, among the women, blended
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:013650_0185_0F91A4DBA1E3A4D8"/>itſelf with the ſpirit of faction, as the ſpirit of faction did with gallantry. They plotted one hour and prayed the next. So many women of rank never became Carmelites, as at this time. It ſeemed as if the ſoul, rouſed by violent commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, applied itſelf to all things with greater impetuoſity; and that imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inflamed by ſo much exerciſe, ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with equal rapidity to war, to love, to religion, and to rebellion.</p>
                     <p>The ſpirit of gallantry, during the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, had nearly the ſame character, and the ſame ſymptoms, as under Louis XIII. except that the civil war, and that extravagance which great commotions give to the ſoul, warmed the little tincture of chivalry which ſtill remained in the cup of love.</p>
                     <p>Anne of Auſtria had brought to the court of France, a part of the manners of her country. It was a mixture of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetry and pride, of ſenſibility and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; that is to ſay, a remnant of the ancient and ſhining gallantry of the
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:013650_0186_0F91A4DBF6EAE238"/>Moors, joined to the pomp and the ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the Caſtillians. Then dances, romances, plays, intrigues, all were Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. Diſguiſes and nocturnal ſcenes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the faſhion: but the French viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city ſubſtituted the violin in place of the languiſhing guitar. That polite and loyal people, affected paſſions which they had not, and counted it an honour publicly to gibbet thoſe which they had. A ſacred homage to beauty, was numbered among the duties of men. Every thing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to women was viewed with an eye of importance: the moſt inconſiderable trifles had a value; and a preſent of a bracelet, or a complimentary card, made an event in life. They talked as ſeriouſly of an affair of gallantry, as of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of a negociation, or the iſſue of a battle<note n="*" place="bottom">

It was this ſpirit which formed the character of the firſt romances of the age of Lewis XIV:—eternal romances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the writers ſuppoſed that all paſſion muſt be durable; ſerious, becauſe they conſidered love as an important concern in life; full of adventures, becauſe they imagined it muſt turn the brain; full of converſations, becauſe they made it a ſcience, which had its principles and forms; heroic, above all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it muſt throw the greateſt men at the feet of the women, and becauſe they then believed that true paſſion is inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from honour, and will elevate itſelf to its object, in place of ſeeking to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe it.</p>
                     <p>It was that ſpirit likewiſe which form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the French theatre; and which made the great Corneille himſelf blend love with the intereſt of ſtates, with maſſacre, conſpiracy, and parricide.</p>
                     <p>

It was the ſame general ſpirit perhaps, which, reigning during the infancy of Lewis XIV. obtained to that monarch among the women the character of being at once great and tender; by which, when young, and paſſionately in love, he would have placed one of his ſubjects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the throne, and was afterwards able to conquer his weakneſs; by which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a paſſion, not leſs warm, for Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietta of England, yet curbed its violence; by which, always a king, though always a lover, he from his youth knew to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve dignity in his pleaſures. But, though he covered ſenſuality with decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the manners of the women, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of circumſtances, muſt have been much altered under his reign.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto the vices of the court had not been thoſe of the nation. The different orders of the ſtate were more ſeparated. The nobility ſtill retained a remnant of that feudal grandeur, which had made them at once, the formidable rivals of the prince, and the imperious tyrants of the people. The greater their power,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:013650_0189_0F91A4E14A6A8100"/>the greater the diſtinction of ranks. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily pride kept even wealth at a diſtance. Vanity had not yet given the ſignal of union. The crown, no longer jealous, removed its barriers; but the nobility multiplied theirs, to ſeparate themſelves more completely from thoſe who might have the inſolence to pretend to equality.</p>
                     <p>In thoſe times, licentiouſneſs and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of manners were almoſt always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as the privilege of rank. The vices of the great were even a part of the oppreſſion of the common people: we are ſeldom inclined to imitate thoſe whom we hate. The manners of the court therefore could only be communicated to the chief magiſtrates, and to the rich. But the magiſtrates were ſecure in their auſterity: living in the ſtudy, and in the exerciſe of juſtice, they aſtoniſhed the court, and diſdained its vices. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the people of wealth, few were really wealthy; the ſhameful, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent acquiſition of certain fortunes, did not permit the familiarity of pride with thoſe who were; and luxury, which only
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:013650_0190_0F91A4E1F7B26C40"/>can place the rich on a level with the great, was by no means general. The nobility had not yet need of trading with their names; and the traders had ſtill leſs thought of purchaſing titles.</p>
                     <p>As people of buſineſs and commerce were then much occupied in their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive employments, they had little time to loſe; and, conſequently, little knowledge of ſociety. The manners of all who did not belong to the court were very unpoliſhed; and that ſpecies of ancient ruſticity was the greater bar to coalition, becauſe it was an object of ridicule among the courtiers. The contraſt of behaviour marked the limits of pride: the line was too ſtrongly drawn to be miſtaken; and neither party was willing to croſs it.</p>
                     <p>Between the capital and the provinces there were not fewer barriers than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ranks in life. The inſecurity of travelling, the ſcarcity of great roads, of carriages; and, above all, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of luxury and factitious wants; and, of courſe, the abſence in a great
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:013650_0191_0F91A4E2B0BB5780"/>meaſure of that reſtleſs diſſipation which hurries the preſent inhabitants from place to place, and which makes them run in crowds to the capital in queſt of gold, of ſlavery, and of vice; by retaining eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one under the roof of his fathers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to preſerve the manners of the nation.</p>
                     <p>But, under Lewis XIV. all things changed. The people of the court, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only titles without power, and being reduced from a real to an imaginary gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, mingled more freely in general ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and with the people of the city. The inequality of fortunes increaſed with the inequality of taxes. More value was ſet upon wealth. The great had more wants, the rich had more ſtate; the poor, corrupted by their deſires, had leſs virtue: all ranks approximated.</p>
                     <p>The magniſicence and luxury of the prince foſtered theſe ideas. His courtiers, involved in debt by their loyalty, and ruined by their pride, ſoon came to careſs thoſe whom they deſpiſed. To preſerve
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:013650_0192_0F91A4E3A6CB84C0"/>their titles, it was neceſſary to ſhare them with families of inferior condition. Gold, extorted from the poor, became the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between the rich and the great. The magiſtracy itſelf was metamorphoſed. All who reſorted to Verſailles partook of its manners. The difference of accent was loſt in the poliſh of ſociety. The ruſt of ancient manners diſappeared. All orders of men mingled.</p>
                     <p>The provinces were deſerted. The miſery of the country, the luxury of the city; the ambition, the amours, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the prince, and his conqueſts; the romantic feaſts of his court; the pleaſures even of the mind drew every body to the capital. They went there in crowds; quitted there prejudices, bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their manners, and at once poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, enriched, and corrupted themſelves.</p>
                     <p>It is eaſy to ſee what influence all theſe changes, and this univerſal intercourſe muſt have had upon the women. Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry became the faſhion, and freedom of manners a grace. Every body imitated
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:013650_0193_0F91A4E6DD5907F0"/>the court; and, from one end of the kingdom to the other, the vices circulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the accompliſhments.</p>
                     <p>Another revolution accompanied that of the manners.</p>
                     <p>In a country where ſociety and letters begin to be cultivated, a taſte for litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt prevail among the women. But, as that taſte is ſlowly formed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the delicate feeling which diſcovers the natural and the graceful, and which enables us to paint them with truth, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by habit; as we are apt to think that muſt be admired which has coſt us much trouble, and that it muſt be the more ſo the leſs it reſembles any other compoſition; as what is falſe often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears fine, becauſe it preſents a new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring, and ſhades part of the object to make the reſt ſpring out; as, in ſhort, whatever is the prevailing humour is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to extravagance, wit muſt at firſt be miſtaken for genius; — the women, who attempted to diſtinguiſh themſelves, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented expreſſions which were much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:013650_0194_0F91A4E7F0F5C0A0"/>becauſe they were little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. They made uſe of ſingular words, when they were at a loſs for ideas; and, to avoid being common, they became ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous.</p>
                     <p>Every thing contributed to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium: — the Italian and Spaniſh books, which were ſtill much in vogue; the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of Mademoiſelle Scudery; the real admiration of what they called the PRECIEUSES; the converſations of the hotel de Rambouillet; in ſhort, the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and the impoſing name of Madame de Longueville; who, after being in the ſweep and at the head of factions, old, and without lovers, as without cabal, amuſed herſelf in writing metaphyſically upon love, and logically upon wit; and who taſteleſsly preferred Voiture to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neille.</p>
                     <p>Moliere, by attacking with ridicule the learning of women, made not only its extravagancies, but the taſte itſelf, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear. Some women afterwards devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to letters, and ſome culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:013650_0195_0F91A4E81A513E60"/>the ſciences; but that ſpirit was by no means general.</p>
                     <p>In the moſt enlightened age, women were not permitted to be intelligent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out becoming the objects of deriſion. They were obliged to hide themſelves to improve their minds; and they bluſhed on the diſcovery of their knowledge, as much as, in ruder ages, they had bluſhed on the diſcovery of an intrigue.</p>
                     <p>AS all good has its exceſs, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb cannot need a reaſon; by aſſociating what is ridiculous with what is reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the learning of women, like every thing elſe, may be brought into contempt. To examine the queſtion however impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, it appears, that in a country and in an age very remote from that primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive innocence which attaches the heart to the pure pleaſures of retirement, and which makes us happy in the ignorance of every thing — but our duty; in an age when the general manners are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by idleneſs; when all the vices mingle by diſſipation; and when the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:013650_0196_0F91A3847514DA18"/>cannot be replaced, or ſupplied, but by the help of reaſon, inſtead of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring women from inſtructing themſelves, it muſt be neceſſary to encourage them. Not all the humour of Moliere had been able to raiſe a laugh againſt the lovely ſex, on account of their learning if he had not ſubſtituted folly for wiſdom. Socrates periſhed by ſuch a miſapplication of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule.</p>
                     <p>If Moliere, in place of ridiculing the abuſe of learning in women, had exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an example of its happy effects, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to thoughtleſs levity and giddy amuſement; if he had painted a woman, young and beautiful, whoſe mind was opened by a liberal education, and who retained all the graces of her ſex; who could think deeply, but who aſſumed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; who covered her knowledge with a gentle veil, and who always had a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of temper, a preſence of mind, and an eaſe of manner, which made her moſt profound reaſonings appear to be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of nature; who could eſtimate and feel the greateſt concerns, without being
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:013650_0197_0F91A3853330D008"/>above the leaſt; who proſecuted her ſpeculations only to heighten the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of friendſhip, and render more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite the intercourſe of affection; who, in ſtudying and knowing the heart of man, had learned to have more indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for his weakneſſes, and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for his virtues; who, in ſhort, rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her duties above all things, but her mental accompliſhments next to her du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and who only employed in ſtudy what may be called the VOID of life — the intervals of ſociety, and the receſs of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic affairs, in bettering her heart by embelliſhing her underſtanding; — he would have done a real ſervice to women, to virtue, to his country, and to the world.</p>
                     <p>But though the women under Lewis XIV. were, in general, laughed out of their paſſion for letters, the politeneſs of the age introduced a ſpirit ſomewhat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied to it, and which was then much in faſhion, particularly at court. It may be called the TALENT OF SOCIETY: an amiable kind of genius which delights in
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:013650_0198_0F91A3861158AC80"/>light graces, which is fonder of beauty than ſublimity, and which borrows few of its ornaments from ſcience, or does it in ſo eaſy a way that ignorance cannot be jealous, and knowledge dares not blame; which throws out agreeable trifles, and which ſometimes can bring itſelf to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with elegance a few facetious or ſprightly verſes; which always charms in converſation, without ſeeming to aim at it; which pleaſes every body; which humbles nobody; and even when it ſhines moſt, which has a manner that pleads its excuſe, and makes us perceive that it is free from oſtentation or vanity. Such was the well-known genius of la Fayette, of Ninon, of la Suze; of la Sabliere and of Sevigne; of Thianges and of Monteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan; of the dutcheſs of Bouillon, and of the fair Hortenſa Mancini her ſiſter; in ſhort, of Madame de Maintenon; who, when young, was the delight of Paris, and till ſhe inhabited a court, and was condemned to grandeur and to care<note n="*" place="bottom">Among thoſe celebrated women, we always diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Madame de la Fayette and Madame de Sevigné.
<p>Madame de la Fayette, ſo well known by her it geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous romances, full of ſweet ſenſibility, joined to a ſound underſtanding all the graces of wit and character. It was ſhe who firſt introduced into the romance ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in place of adventure, and agreeable men inſtead of heroes. She performed in her walk what Racine did in his. In ſubſtituting intereſt for incident, and men for prodigies, ſhe proved, that we love better to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved than aſtoniſhed.</p>
                           <p>Madame de Sevigné has formed, without deſign, of her letters written occaſionally, a moſt enchanting book.

After all theſe accompliſhed women, commended with levity by the poets, or gravity by the orators, there are ſtill two, who, though of a rank and order dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, arrived nevertheleſs at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt celebrity. The one is the famous Mademoiſelle de Scudery, who lived to the age of eighty-five, ſixty years of which period ſhe ſpent in writing with elegance ſome pretty verſes, which are ſtill admired, and with an amazing faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity voluminous romances, which are no more read. Theſe romances however were once able to turn heads; and the
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:013650_0200_0F91A389D8C35718"/>prejudice in favour of her manner was almoſt a match for the ſatires and taſte of Boileau. The other is the learned Mademoiſelle le Febvre, ſo well known under the name of Madam Dacier. Her merit, it is true, was not that of a woman, but ſhe choſe a good time to aſſume the character of a man; and, though ſhe had not the manner of Ninon, ſhe did not want her admirers. The two languages natural to her, were thoſe of Terence and Homer; and madrigals were often ſent to her in Greek and Latin. The moſt learned men in Europe conſpired to ſound her praiſe.</p>
                     <p>I ſay nothing of the other women who wrote about the ſame time. The cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue is every where to be found. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I ſpeak only here of the women whoſe genius had a character, and who can ſerve to illuſtrate the ideas or the manners of their age. This is a picture, not a hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>The reſult of the manners, and the general character of the women of that age
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:013650_0201_0F91A38AD3856408"/>was, a voluptuouſneſs united with decency; activity directed to intrigue; little learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; many accompliſhments; a refined politeneſs; a remnant of empire over men; a reſpect for all the religious ideas, which mingled themſelves with that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetry of manners, and remorſe always by the ſide, or in the train of love.</p>
                     <p>During the regency, and under the reign of Lewis XV. the manners under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went another revolution. The latter years of Lewis XIV. had ſhed over the court, and part of the nation, an air of dejection and melancholy. At bottom the inclinations were the ſame; but they were more repreſſed. A new court and new ideas changed all things. A bolder ſenſuality became the faſhion. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires grew more confident and impetuous; and part of the veil which covered gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry was torn away. Decency, which had hitherto been reſpected as a duty, was not even regarded as a pleaſure. Shame was mutually communicated—and mutually pardoned. Levity joined itſelf to exceſs; and a corruption was formed
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:013650_0202_0F91A38B3553A068"/>at the ſame time frivolous and deep, which laughed at every thing, that it might bluſh at nothing.</p>
                     <p>The ruin of families, and the ſhifting of fortunes, precipitated this change. Exceſſive miſery and exceſſive luxury were the conſequences;—and the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of theſe is known. A ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution rarely happens in the property of a people, without a quick alteration in manners.</p>
                     <p>For upwards of ſix centuries, gallantry had formed the character of the nation; but the ſpirit of chivalry always mingled itſelf with that ſentiment; which ſpirit, inſeparably connected with honour, gave to gallantry at leaſt the RESEMBLANCE of love, and to vice as much of virtue as its nature is ſuſceptible of. But when few traces of ancient honour remained, gallantry itſelf was loſt; it became a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent which always ſuppoſed weakneſs, or endeavoured to produce it.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, by that general ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:013650_0203_0F91A38C003E60C0"/>which attracted all ranks, the taſte for the ſociety of women increaſed, and the intercourſe of the ſexes became more frequent. Hope grew more ſanguine, as ſeduction grew more eaſy. The men every day aſſociated leſs with each other; the women, leſs timid, threw off that decent reſerve which is their honour. The two ſexes changed characters; the men ſet too high a value upon perſonal charms, the women on independence.</p>
                     <p>As the youths were more anxious to be men of the world than men of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, they entered ſooner into ſociety. Theſe young men, corrupted by the libertine part of the other ſex, joined the faults of their age to thoſe of their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. Having in general more deſires than ideas, an empty head and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled heart,—inconſtant through vanity, or multiplying their amours from idleneſs, — ſetting no value upon opinion, which for them indeed had no exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, —they communicated to a great number of women their vices and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="72" facs="unknown:013650_0204_0F91A38CB9EB9F18"/>
The irkſomneſs of time, and the univerſal deſire to pleaſe, ſpread ſtill wider and wider the ſpirit of ſociety, till the nation arrived at its preſent ſtate of ſociability and general intercourſe, where manners and character are ſacrificed to elegance and politeneſs, while virtue and ſentiment are exchanged for pleaſure and amuſement.</p>

                     <p>WHAT poliſhed nations under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by ſociety, appears to have been little known in England, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reign of Henry VIII. This backwardneſs may in ſome meaſure be aſcribed to our continual wars with France and with Scotland: by our quarrels with the one we were ſhut out from foreign intercourſe, and by our hoſtilities with both we were diverted from cultivating the arts of peace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="73" facs="unknown:013650_0205_0F91A38D7AF89E60"/>
The ſpirit of chivalry, which produced ſuch amazing effects on the Continent, was more weakly felt here. Edward III. had indeed eſtabliſhed the order of the garter; but real wars allowed the knights little time for the mock encounter, or the generous viſions of romantic heroiſm; and love was ſtill a ſimple paſſion, which led the ſhorteſt way to its gratification, and generally in conformity with law and cuſtom. It partook little of imagination; and, conſequently, required few perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in its object: it aſpired neither at angels nor goddeſſes.</p>
                     <p>The women, who ſtill retained all their native innocence and modeſty, were regarded only as wives and mothers. Where qualifications are not demanded they will never be found: the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments of the ſex entitled them to no other character; and it had perhaps been happy for both ſexes, if they could have remained in ſuch a ſtate of ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
                     <p>The Scots, by means of their alliance
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:013650_0206_0F91A38E33C80310"/>with France, which had ſubſiſted for ſeveral centuries, and that ſpirit of adventure which has at all times led them abroad in queſt of reputation, civil or military, may be ſuppoſed at this time to have been better acquainted with the elegancies of life than their wealthy and powerful neighbours: — and we actually find, in the court of James IV. a taſte in muſic, in letters, and in gallantry, to which the great monarch of the houſe of Tudor and his haughty barons were yet ſtrangers.</p>
                     <p>But the political ſtate of both king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms was an inſuperable bar to all libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral intercourſe. The barons, or chiefs, were hoſtile to the court, from which they had every thing to fear, and nothing to hope; they were dreaded by it in their turn; they looked from the walls of their caſtles with a jealous eye on each other; they never went abroad but attended by a numerous train of domeſtics; they viſited each other with the ſtate, and the diffidence of neighbouring princes; their marriages were contracted from family motives, and their courtſhips were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:013650_0207_0F91A391756AD9B8"/>with the greateſt form, and the moſt diſtant reſpect. They took liberties indeed with the women of inferior con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and they rioted in thoughtleſs jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with their dependents: but the ideas of inferiority and dependence are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with thoſe of ſociety and gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                     <p>Henry VII. by curbing the hoſtile ſpirit of the Barons, by abridging their power, by diminiſhing their retainers; by extending commerce; by encouraging agriculture; by ſecuring peace to his ſubjects, at home and abroad, prepared the way for learning, arts and elegance. But the taſte of the nation was not yet ripe for their reception; and the temper of his ſon Henry VIII. was not highly favourable to ſuch a revolution. That prince, however, by his taſte for tourna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, foſtered the ſpirit of chivalry; and, by his paſſion for controverſy, he encouraged a ſpecies of learning, though not the moſt agreeable: by his magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and profuſion he drew the nobility to court; who, ſince deprived of their
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:013650_0208_0F91A39365DB0658"/>judicial authority, had leſs buſineſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them in the country; and, by his interviews with the emperor and the French King, he rouſed their emulation of foreign elegance: they were ſmit with the love of letters and of gallantry. The earl of Surrey, in particular, celebrated his miſtreſs in his verſes, and defended her honour with his ſword, againſt all who dared with unhallowed lips profane her immaculate name.</p>
                     <p>The women in this reign likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to diſcover a taſte for literature and politeneſs. The counteſs of Richmond, mother to Henry VII. and who ſurvived him, had ſhewn the way. She tranſlated two pious treatiſes from the French; and was a great patroneſs of learning. Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Blount, miſtreſs to Henry VIII. was a woman of elegant accompliſhments; and his laſt queen Catherine Parr, wrote with facility both in Latin and in Engliſh, and appears beſides to have been a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of addreſs.</p>
                     <p>But the houſe of Sir Thomas Moore,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:013650_0209_0F91A393A7FE4FD0"/>whoſe eldeſt daughter, Mrs. Roper, has been already mentioned among the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed women of this period, ſeems in a more particular manner to have been the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of the Muſes, and even of the Graces. He was poſſeſſed of all the learning of antiquity; he was pious even to weakneſs; for he appears to have given credit to the propheſies of the Maid of Kent; but neither his religion nor his learning ſoured his temper, or blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his taſte for ſociety. His ideas of the female character would do honour to a gentleman of the preſent age. In an elegant Latin poem to a friend on the choice of a wife, he ſpeaks to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing purpoſe. <q>May you meet with a wife not ſtupidly ſilent, nor always prattling nonſenſe; may ſhe be learned, if poſſible, or at leaſt capable of being made ſo. A woman thus accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will be always drawing ſentiments and maxims out of the beſt authors. She will be herſelf, in all the changes of fortune; neither blown up with proſperity, nor broken in adverſity. You will find in her an even, cheerful,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:013650_0210_0F91A394B405CF60"/>good-humoured friend, and an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able companion for life. She will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe knowledge into your children with their milk, and from their infancy train them up to wiſdom. Whatever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany you are engaged in, you will long to be at home; and will retire with delight from the ſociety of men, into the boſom of a woman who is ſo dear, ſo knowing, and ſo amiable. If ſhe touches her lute, and more particularly if ſhe ſings to it any of her own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, it will ſooth your ſolitude, and her voice will ſound ſweeter in your ear than the ſong of the nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale. You will ſpend whole days and nights with pleaſure in her company, and you will be always finding out new beauties in her mind. She will keep your ſoul in perpetual ſerenity; ſhe will reſtrain its mirth from being diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and prevent its melancholy from becoming painful.</q> — According to theſe ideas he educated his three daughters, whoſe virtues and talents appear to have merited all his care. They lived for ſome time in one houſe, with their father, their
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:013650_0211_0F91A394F4063CC0"/>huſbands, and their children, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſociety, all things conſidered, which has ſeldom, if ever, been equalled, in any age or country; — where morals were ſublimed by religion; where manners were poliſhed by a ſenſe of elegance, and ſoftened by a deſire to pleaſe; where friendſhip was warmed by love, and ſtrengthened by the ties of blood; — while converſation, animated by genius; enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by learning, and moderated by reſpect, exulting in the dignity of its objects, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to approach to that fine tranſport, which immortal beings may be ſuppoſed to feel in pouring out their contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the wiſdom and goodneſs of the Creator; and, when it condeſcended to treat of lighter ſubjects, wit had a ſpring, humour a flow, and ſentiment a poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, which thoſe who are eternally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of trifles, who hover continually on the ſurface of the earth, and rove like butterflies from ſenſe to ſenſe, both in their lives and converſations, can have no conception.</p>
                     <p>The religious conteſts, the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:013650_0212_0F91A396E0872218"/>and the preſecutions, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured the latter part of the reign of Henry VIII. and which continued, with little intermiſſion, till the death of queen Mary, were a great bar to the progreſs of elegance and politeneſs in England: but it may be doubted how far they were hurtful to learning or to manners. Both parties, and both ſexes, were uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly zealous to diſtinguiſh themſelves by virtues and by talents. Lady Jane Gray, and the three Seymours, who lived in this period, have already been mentioned among the ornaments of the ſixteenth century. Queen Mary herſelf was a writer of no mean rank; and Mary Roper, grand-daughter of Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas More, and one of the GENTLE-WOMEN, as they were then called, of her majeſty's PRIVY-CHAMBER, is ſaid to have poſſeſſed all the learning and accompliſhments of her mother. She muſt have done honour to the court.</p>
                     <p>The reign of Elizabeth is juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as one of the moſt ſhining pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods in Engliſh hiſtory; and for purity
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:013650_0213_0F91A397362196F8"/>of manners, vigour of mind, vigour of character, and perſonal addreſs, it is perhaps unequalled.</p>
                     <p>The magnificent entertainments which that illuſtrious princeſs ſo frequently gave her court, and at which ſhe generally appeared in perſon, with a moſt engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing familiarity, rubbed off the ancient reſerve of the nobility, and increaſed the taſte of ſociety, and even of gallantry: but the maſculine boldneſs of her charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was unfavourable to famale graces. The women of her court, like herſelf, were rather objects of reſpect than love. Their virtues were ſevere; their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, their talents were often great: they had paſſions, but they knew to ſuppreſs them, or to divert them into the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of intereſt or ambition. They did not however want their admirers. Men were leſs delicate in thoſe days.</p>
                     <p>Spenſer, by writing his Fairy Queen, revived in Britain the ſpirit of chivalry, at a time when it began to expire on the continent, and Sir Philip Sidney, in his
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:013650_0214_0F91A39804DDBA40"/>Arcadia, refined on that ſentiment. The Fairy Queen was intended as a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Elizabeth; and the Arcadia was dedicated by Sir Philip to his ſiſter, the counteſs of Pembroke, the moſt amiable and accompliſhed woman of her time<note n="*" place="bottom">The following ingenious and well known verſes were intended as part of her epitaph.

                     <p>But the moſt remarkable women of this reign were the Lady Burleigh, the Lady Bacon, the Lady Ruſſel, and Mrs. Killgrew, all daughters of Sir Anthony Cooke, and all diſtinguiſhed for learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, genius, and virtue.</p>
                     <p>Elizabeth herſelf was a great and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar character. But ſhe had few qualities to recommend her as a woman, though paſſionately fond of perſonal admiration; nor were her talents as a writer either ſtriking or elegant, though ſhe appears to have been ambitious of literary fame.
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:013650_0215_0F91A398B78BE8E0"/>Her ability as a ſoverign has been already conſidered, in treating of the talent of women for government. Her virtues were thoſe of her rank, and of her age; and her weakneſs, thoſe of her ſex: yet they failed to render her amiable.</p>
                     <p>Mary queen of Scotland, (whoſe learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and accompliſhments have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned) the cotemporary of Elizabeth, and her rival in beauty, in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and in ſway, though a leſs perfect, is a more attractive character. While we blame her conduct ſhe conciliates our affection. Even thoſe who accuſe her of guilt, muſt weep for her misfortunes; and will feel their boſoms ſwell with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt her inhuman ſubjects, and her perſidious protectreſs, while they read her unhappy ſtory, as told by her enemies.</p>
                     <p>The return of Mary to her native kingdom, after the death of her huſband Francis II. with all the elegancies of France ſupperadded to the fineſt natural endowments, made the Scots hope, and
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:013650_0216_0F91A39975A39CF8"/>not without reaſon, that literature, arts, and politeneſs, would arrive at perfection among them, as ſoon as in any northern nation. But the ſpirit of fanaticiſm, which awaked in Scotland about this time, which was attended with ſuch amazing effects, and which ſpread itſelf over the whole iſland; which produced the death of the lovely Mary, of the pious Charles, and which terminated in the expulſion of the royal houſe, threw a cloud over the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and the ſtudies of that country, which two centuries have ſcarcely been able to diſpel<note n="*" place="bottom">A bold ſpirit of liberty and independence however, which has been productive of many great and beneficial conſequences, mingled itſelf with that fanatical ſpirit, and ought for ever to free the Scots from the imputation of ſervility.</note>.</p>
                     <p>The acceſſion of James VI. to the throne of England, contributed ſtill far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to obſtruct the progreſs to civilizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Scotland, and to the decline of the arts in that country. The removal of the court, drew the nobility to London, to ſpend their fortunes, or obtain prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and men of genius and learning likewiſe looked this way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="85" facs="unknown:013650_0217_0F91A39A33E85098"/>
That event, however, muſt have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the advancement of ſociety in England. Yet not ſo much as might be expected. The ſcantineſs of James's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, together with his want of oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, rendered him unable to ſupport the ſplendor of a court. It was beſides in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with his maxims of policy, and with his temper. He loved to be ſocial with his friends, but hated a crowd; and had rather an averſion to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of woman. A mean jealouſy, which took place of a generous emulation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Scots and Engliſh courtiers, prevented ſtill farther the refinement of manners; which can only be effected by a liberal intercourſe.</p>
                     <p>The nobility and gentry of England are ſtill fonder of a country life than thoſe of any poliſhed nation in Europe: it prevailed much more then, and was highly encouraged by James. He even iſſued proclamations, containing ſevere threatnings againſt the gentry who lived in town. By theſe means the ancient pride of family was preſerved. Men of
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:013650_0218_0F91A39B14ED77B8"/>birth were diſtinguiſhed by a ſtatelineſs of carriage: much ceremony took place in the ordinary commerce of life; and, as riches acquired by trade were ſtill rare, little familiarity was indulged by the great.</p>
                     <p>The king's pacific, or rather puſilani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous diſpoſition, though it ſunk the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional character, was favourable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and not altogether unfriendly to letters. James himſelf was a ſcholar; but he was unhappy in a bad taſte, which infected his whole court, and indeed the whole nation. He was fond of metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical quibbles, the jingle of words, and every ſpecies of falſe wit. Such a taſte is in ſome meaſure inſeparable from the revival of letters: we admire what is glaring, before we can diſcern what is beautiful; but the ſanction, and even the example of the monarch, only could have carried it to ſuch a height at this time in England. What induces one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to this opinion is, the comparative purity of the writers of the former reign. The contraſt between the compoſition of
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:013650_0219_0F91A39BB2CD3BD8"/>Spencer and Drayton, is as great as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the character of Elizabeth and James.</p>
                     <p>The theatre, that great former of manners, and which is formed by them, had been founded by Shakeſpeare under the reign of Elizabeth: he was ſucceeded by Jonſon and Fletcher. Theſe writers have ſeldom painted the manners of their own country, and ſeldomer thoſe of their own age; but, as they muſt have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to pleaſe the people for whom they wrote, and as they no doubt knew the taſte of the public, we may diſcern that taſte more perfectly in their compoſitions than in the barren records of the times.</p>
                     <p>In the writings of Shakeſpeare we find all the noble ſpirit of the virgin-reign. Love has its native importance; and little more: it is productive of the greateſt events, when connected with circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but, when a ſimple paſſion, its effects are feeble and tranſient. He ſeldom at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to be wanton; but when his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject makes it neceſſary to reveal the ſecrets
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:013650_0220_0F91A39F5F13B428"/>of Venus, he does it with as much free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as if ſhe were a common proſtitute: be expreſſes his meaning in the plaineſt, and often in the broadeſt words.</p>
                     <p>But in the writings of Fletcher,—for I ſhall omit Jonſon, as being a cotempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary of Shakeſpeare, and therefore leſs proper to mark the gradation of taſte,—love has acquired an imaginary power: it is equal to every thing in itſelf; and ſeems to diſregard thoſe circumſtances which alone can give it conſequence; without which it is a boyiſh paſſion, that excites our contempt; but, connected with which, it is the ſtrongeſt ſentiment of our nature, and awakens moſt deeply the feelings of the human breaſt. He is frequently wanton, with a grace peculiar to himſelf;—for a genteel education and a good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural taſte conſpired to render him the moſt elegant writer of his age—he veils his idea beneath the delicacy of his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, or toys with it ſo prettily, that we often fall in love with a thought, which, rudely diſcloſed, could not fail to diſguſt.</p>

                        <pb n="89" facs="unknown:013650_0221_0F91A39F8523A0C8"/>
We may therefore conclude, that the paſſion, or rather the commerce, between the ſexes was increaſed; that it was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of being thought more important than it really was; that it had purpoſes to carry which made ſuch exaggeration neceſſary, that it had wiſhes to reveal which it durſt not avow; and which, conſequently, ſuggeſted the diſguiſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate expreſſion. The duel, we know, had taken place of the tournament; and the intrigue, we may be certain, would not be long behind.</p>
                     <p>Under Charles I. a good taſte in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in arts, and in ſociety, began to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. The king himſelf was both a judge and an example of fine writing; and he was a lover of painting, muſic, and archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture; all which he liberally encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the religious and political diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, which early in this reign divided the nation, and which brought about the death of the king, and the ſubverſion of the monarchy, diverted the thoughts of men from every elegant purſuit. The dread of popery and arbitrary power, of
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:013650_0222_0F91A3A1779504E8"/>ſlavery and eternal damnation, and the hope of heaven, and of liberty, threw the whole iſland into the moſt violent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, and gave birth to ſome of the greateſt geniuſes, and called forth ſome of the greateſt characters, in the hiſtory of mankind.</p>
                     <p>The cavaliers, or royal party, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, notwithſtanding the horrors of civil war, maintained a gaiety of temper which was altogether aſtoniſhing, and a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of manners which too often border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on licentiouſneſs. But the republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, though perhaps not infected with fewer vices, and thoſe of a leſs amiable caſt, diſcover ſo much vigour of mind, ſuch a reſolute ſpirit of action, a love of freedom, and a contempt of death, that we almoſt deſpiſe the poliſh of ſociety,—even while we deteſt the cant of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy.</p>
                     <p>The moſt diſtinguiſhed women of this period, in Britain, were the Ducheſs of
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:013650_0223_0F91A3A291333E78"/>Newcaſtle, Lady Pakington, and Lady Halket<note n="*" place="bottom">The Ducheſs of Newcaſtle has left us a variety of compoſitions both in proſe and verſe, (tragedies, come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, eſſays, hiſtories, orations, letters,) of no mean character. She appears to be the firſt Engliſh lady who attempted what is now called <hi>polite literature;</hi> which ought to be ſome apology for her want of correctneſs.
<p>Lady Pakington has long been the <hi>reputed,</hi> and, from the proofs produced by Mr Ballard, it appears the <hi>real</hi> author of <hi>The Whole Duty of Man,</hi> and ſeveral other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and divine treatiſes; which are written with ſo much temper, purity, piety, philoſophy, and good ſenſe, that ſhe may be juſtly reckoned the glory of her ſex, and an honour to human nature.

                           <p>Lady Halket was remarkable for her learning, and for her ſkill both in phyſie and divinity. Her writings are all of the religious kind, and are voluminous beyond all credibiliy.</p>
                        </note>.</p>
                     <p>Under the commonwealth the face of the nation was entirely changed; it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced a revolution, as complete in manners as in policy. One would have imagined himſelf in a different world. The theatres were ſhut; games, ſports, ſhews, and amuſements of every kind were prohibited. Inſtead of the voice of
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:013650_0224_0F91A3A34441BCA8"/>mirth and joy, nothing was to be heard but groans, ſighs, prayers, and ſpiritual ſongs. All liberal knowledge, ornamental learning, gentility of manner, elegance of dreſs, and all ſuperfluity in eating and drinking were proſcribed, as carnal vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and as the accomplices of ſin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. All ranks, ages, and ſexes were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. The illuminations of the ſpirit placed all on a level. The leaders of the republic prayed, or exhorted one while, and liſtened the next to the meaneſt of the people. Women taught the brethren.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe fair divines, by reaſon of their finer feelings and more vivid imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were often carried into the moſt extraordinary ſeverities, and the wildeſt enthuſiaſm. They were not contented with laying aſide the allurements of their ſex, with making a covenant with their eyes that they ſhould not rove, and with crucifying their thoughts; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned themſelves to humiliation and faſting, for the wandering of their hearts. Many of them conſidered cloaths of any kind to be improper. Whether this
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:013650_0225_0F91A3A3F54033C0"/>opinion proceeded from their looking upon dreſs as a luxury, or as unneceſſary to the truely regenerate, does not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly appear; but one of them, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by that perſuaſion, came into the church where the Protector ſat, in the condition of our original mother before ſhe plucked the fig-leaf, 'to be,' as ſhe ſaid, 'a SIGN to the people.'</p>
                     <p>The men in general held in contempt all books but the Bible; and ſome of them were even above uſing that: they believed themſelves illuminated by the ſame ſpirit which inſpired the ſacred writings. One man, from the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundance of this inward light, and a certain reſemblance between his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and the common pictures of Chriſt, conceived himſelf to be the ſaviour,—no doubt ſent to earth a ſecond time, to collect the faithful, and begin his mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennial reign<note n="*" place="bottom">Some have believed the millennium to be before, others after the reſurrection.</note>. He pretended to work miracles: to cure the ſick, to raiſe the dead; and entered Briſtol mounted
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:013650_0226_0F91A3A4B400DDC0"/>on a HORSE—perhaps he thought an ASS too mean an animal, and that he had now a right to aſſume more dignity—while his diſciples ſpread their garments before him, crying, 'Hoſanna! to the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.'</p>
                     <p>Love under the commonwealth, was a mixture of cant and hypocriſy. Never was beauty ſo much in diſgrace. It was not only denied all adventitious orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and excellencies, but even the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of nature were ſubject of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach:—it was forbid to pleaſe; and it was criminal to conſider it as an object of deſire.</p>
                     <p>'Man,' ſaid the godly.—for ſo they called themſelves,— <q>is conceived in ſin, and brought forth in iniquity; he is a ſlave to the fleſh, till regenerated by the ſpirit; it was his complacency in woman that firſt wrought his debaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: let him not therefore glory in his ſhame, let him not worſhip the fountain of his corruption!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="unknown:013650_0227_0F91A3A5799FE848"/>
The emotions of nature were conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the ſtruggles of original guilt; and beauty was viewed as a ſpell in the hands of Satan, to ſeduce the hearts of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. The pleaſures of the marriage-bed were only indulged as the means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting a greater evil, and of increaſing the number of the ſaints; nor even then without fear and trembling, humiliation, and prayer, <q>that they might be ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the CURSE!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the reſtoration of monarchy made ample amends to beauty for the indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the commonwealth. The reign of Charles II. may be conſidered in one light, as the moſt glorious era to women in the hiſtory of Britain, and as the moſt debaſing in another. They were never ſo much careſſed; never ſo little reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>Charles himſelf had a ſuſceptible, but changeable heart; a ſocial temper; a genteel manner; a lively wit:—and his courtiers partook much of the character of their maſter. They had all ſuffered
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:013650_0228_0F91A3A63883F4E0"/>the preſſure of adverſity, the neglect of poverty, or felt the inſolence of pious ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. They began to think that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity was a fable; that virtue was a cheat; that friendſhip and generoſity were but words of courſe; and, in greedily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying their change of fortune, they ſunk themſelves beneath the dignity of men. In avoiding ſpiritual pride, and in retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating ſelfiſhneſs, they departed from the eſſential principles of religion and morals; and, by contraſting the language and the manners of hypocriſy, they ſhameleſsly violated the laws of decency and deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</p>
                     <p>Overjoyed at the return of their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, the whole royal party diſſolved in thoughtleſs jollity; and even many of the republicans, particularly the younger claſs. and the women, were glad to be releaſed from the gloomy auſterity of the commonwealth. A general relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of manners took place. Pleaſure became the univerſal object, and love the prevailing taſte: but that love was rather an appetite than a paſſion. Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:013650_0229_0F91A3A7063120F8"/>unconnected with virtue, was its object: it was therefore void of honour and attachment. In conſequence of ſuch manners, famale virtue, robbed of its reward, became rather a mode of beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, to inflame deſire, or procure ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, than a ſentiment or principle; and, of courſe, ſooner or later, was either ſacrificed to inclination or to caprice.</p>
                     <p>But theſe obſervations, in their full extent, muſt only be underſtood of the court. The greater part of the gentry ſtill reſided on their eſtates in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, equally ſtrangers to the pleaſures of the court and town; and one half of the iſland was filled with indignation at the vices of Whitehall. Nor without reaſon; for it was little better than one great bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel — and the ſtage, which generally takes its complexion from the court, was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſcene of ſenſuality, blaſphemy, and abſurdity.</p>
                     <p>The free intercourſe, however of all ranks of men, from the king to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:013650_0230_0F91A3AAAAE57200"/>improved the talent of ſociety, and poliſhed the language of converſation; gallantry, licentious as it was, produced a habit of politeneſs; and from the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and even impious freedom of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and thinking, ſprung many ſtrokes of real genius, and a liberal ſpirit of inquiry, whoſe reſearches and experiments have benefited mankind, and carried philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and the ſciences to a height that does honour to modern times<note n="*" place="bottom">The royal Society was founded under Charles II.</note>.</p>
                     <p>The women of this reign, as may be expected from the taſte of the men, were more ſolicitous about adorning their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, than informing their minds. But the frequent intercourſe between the ſexes in ſome meaſure compenſated that neglect. By ſuch a commerce they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more eaſy, more free, more lively, and more capable of converſation, than the women of any preceding age. They had leſs learning, but more accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and perhaps, more genius. They
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:013650_0231_0F91A3ACA610C040"/>wanted nothing but virtue to have made their memories immortal: and, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the general depravity, there were ſome who trod the narrow path; whoſe taſte and ſentiments were uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and whoſe names ſtill live in their writings, and in the verſes of their cotemporaries. Katherine Philips, (ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated under the name of Orinda) Anne Killegrew, and Anne Wharton, employed their elegant talents in a manner ſuitable to their ſex. The female wantons of moſt genius were Behn and Centlivre, whoſe writings are both their honour and their diſgrace<note n="*" place="bottom">From this cenſure however, may be excepted the Hiſtory of Oroonoko, and the Comedy of the Buſy Body.</note>.— Among the women of elegant, or ſpirited converſation, we ſhould perhaps diſtinguiſh the Dutcheſs of York, the Dutcheſs of Cleveland, Lady Cheſterfield, and the fair Hamilton.</p>
                     <p>The reign of James II. was too ſhort to have any diſtinct character. It is only ſingular for the blind bigotry, and blinder
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:013650_0232_0F91A3ADDAD22E30"/>diſpoſition of the prince; which rouſed the minds of men from the delirium of pleaſure, in which they had been loſt, and brought about the Revolution.</p>
                     <p>Under William III. the effects of that change were viſible on the manners. The nation returned to what may be called its natural ſtate. An attention to juſt politics, to found philoſophy, and true religion, characterize the era of Britiſh liberty.</p>
                     <p>William himſelf was of a gloomy temper, and had a diſlike to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of women. The intercourſe of the ſexes, and thoſe amuſements which are its conſequence, were therefore little countenanced during his reign. By theſe means the ladies had more time for the purſuits of learning and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and they made uſe of it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. Many of them became adepts in the ſciences. Lady Maſham, and Mary Aſtell, in particular, diſcuſſed with judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ability the moſt abſtract points
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:013650_0233_0F91A3AE779C0DB0"/>in metaphyſics and divinity<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe two ladies differed on a very delicate point. Mary affirmed, that we ought to love with <hi>deſire</hi> God only, every other love being <hi>ſinful.</hi> Lady Maſham oppoſed that doctrine, as a dangerous refinement Each had her abettors, Miſs Aſtell was ſupported by Mr. Norris, and Lady Maſham by Mr. Locke.—They were both great advocates for the learning of women; and their arguments and example appear to have rouſed many of the ſex to a more ſerious attention to religion and morality.</note>; and Lady Grace Gethin, at the age of twenty, treated of life and morals with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of Socrates, and the elegance of Xenophon. She is celebrated by Mr. Congreve.</p>
                     <p>The reign of queen Anne may be ſaid to have been the ſummer, of which William's was only the ſpring. Every thing was ripened; nothing was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. It was a ſhort, but glorious period, of heroiſm and national capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; of taſte and ſcience, learning and genius; of gallantry without licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and politeneſs without effeminacy.</p>
                     <p>We are in doubt which moſt to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire in the women of this reign, the
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:013650_0234_0F91A3AF4BF00F90"/>manners, the talents, or the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. They were religious without ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, and without enthuſiaſm; they were learned without pedantry; they were intelligent and attractive, without neglecting the duties of their ſex; they were elegant and entertaining, without levity; in a word, they joined the graces of ſociety to the knowledge of letters and the virtues of domeſtic life—they were friends and companions, without ceaſing to be wives and mothers.</p>
                     <p>In ſupport of the foregoing character of the Britiſh ladies under the reign of queen Anne, we need only add the names of Lady Chudleigh, Lady Winchelſea, the honourable Mrs. Monk, Mrs. Bovey, and Stella<note n="*" place="bottom">Of theſe ladies, Mrs. Bovey is perhaps the leaſt known, as ſhe has left no writings, and had no poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal lover to ſpread her name. She is, however, very handſomly complimented by Sir Richard Steele, in the dedication of the ſecond volume of <hi>The Ladies Library;</hi> and Mrs. Manley, who wanted only virtue to have been an ornament to her age, and to her ſex, gives the following elegant character of her in <hi>The New Atalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi>

Under George 1. the manners of the nation were ſenſibly changed; but not ſo much as the national ſpirit. The South Sea ſcheme, and other mercenary projects, produced a paſſion of avarice, and a taſte of luxury, which prepared the way for all the corruptions of the following reign.</p>
                     <p>The delirium of riches was beyond what the moſt extravagant imagination can conceive. Any ſcheme, however abſurd, met with encouragement, if it only propoſed ſufficient advantages. All ranks and conditions, and even women, reſorted to 'Change-Alley, with the looks of harpies ready to ſeize upon their prey; but, in reality, the victims of their own credulity and ſordid paſſions. The peers of the realm became ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jobbers, and its miniſters brokers; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic virtue was loſt in the viſions of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:013650_0236_0F91A3B0B489AD30"/>benefit; letters fell into contempt, though ſupported by the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ſucceſsful genius; love grew covetous, and beauty venal.</p>
                     <p>There were however, in this reign, many women of liberal and elegant ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents; among the firſt of whom may be ranked Lady Mary W. Montague, ſo well known for her ſpirited poems, and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious letters.</p>
                     <p>Under George II. and George III. the debaſement of mind diſcovered itſelf more fully in the manners. Corruption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came general.</p>
                     <p>The Revolution had reſtrained the powers of the prince within ſuch narrow limits, that a coalition of parties, or the abſolute ſuperiority of one, was eſſential to carry the meaſures of government; and, as the oppoſition, or country party, began to gather ſtrength, the political machine was in danger of ſtanding ſtill by counteracting forces. It was therefore neceſſary that there ſhould be an aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency;</p>
                     <p>The Revolution had reſtrained the powers of the prince within ſuch narrow limits, that a coalition of parties, or the abſolute ſuperiority of one, was eſſential to carry the meaſures of government; and, as the oppoſition, or country party, began to gather ſtrength, the political machine was in danger of ſtanding ſtill by counteracting forces. It was therefore neceſſary that there ſhould be an aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency;
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:013650_0237_0F91A3B4A0569C38"/>it was likewiſe perhaps neceſſary that it ſhould be on the ſide of the court.</p>
                     <p>At this criſis Robert Walpole, an art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and able miniſter, a lover of peace and an encourager of commerce, found means to increaſe the influence of the crown without enlarging the prerogative. But he did it at the expence of the virtues of the people:—and his example has been followed by all ſucceeding miniſters. He took advantage of that ſpirit of avarice and luxury which he had foſtered; the treaſury was let looſe at elections. A majority was obtained of the refuſe of both parties; of men determined to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the meaſures of the court in deſiance of conſcience, honour, and honeſty—and who were only formidable by the number of their voices. Places and penſions were multiplied to reward the mercenary tribe; and men of ability and integrity were deprived of their employments, to make way for thoſe who were deſtitute of both. When virtue and talents are no longer the means of honour and preferment, they naturally diſappear in the public
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:013650_0238_0F91A3B58A2703A8"/>walks of life; they are only to be found in the ſolitary ſhade. Character ceaſed to create diſtinction. The effect of ſuch a want of ſentiment may eaſily be conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Patriotiſm became the common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ridicule; and virtue and genius were made the butt of ignorance, dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and profligacy. But people muſt always have ſomething to be the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſelf-applauſe. Inſtead of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential qualities of men and of citizens, they valued themſelves on a ſmooth addreſs, and an abſurd mixture of French levity and Engliſh gravity; on the ſplendor of their equipages; on the magnificence of their houſes; on the richneſs of their furniture; and on the elegance and ſumptuouſneſs of their tables.</p>
                     <p>The ruin of many ancient families by the late viſionary projects, and the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive fortunes acquired by trade, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted ſtill farther to increaſe the general maſs of manners. The pride of birth, the laſt barrier of corruption, was broken down. While people value themſelves upon their anceſtors, it is to be preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:013650_0239_0F91A3B5F5A9DAA0"/>that their actions will not be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unworthy of them. The nobility courted the alliance of the wealthy, to enable them to ſupport their ſtate: they intermarried with the ſons and daughters of commerce, without regard to charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or accompliſhments. Riches became the only idol of worſhip, and poverty the only object of contempt.</p>
                     <p>Theſe however were not the only evils refulting from ſuch a coalition. That reſpect to the higher orders of men, which is ſo neceſſary to preſerve due ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a ſtate, and that frugality and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, which are ſo eſſential to the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of traders, were at once deſtroyed by the union of the people of rank and commerce. The merchants ſoon vied with the peers of the realm, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the blood, in all the luxuries of life; and, by degrees, people of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions came to think themſelves entitled to the ſame indulgence; till, at length, the nation arrived at its preſent ſtate of ſociability, luxury, and vicious refinement; in which all ranks, ages, and ſexes min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:013650_0240_0F91A3B7E46765A0"/>and all aſpire at the ſame pleaſures and the ſame amuſements; in which taſte is a title to enjoyment, and money and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance to every polite circle, and to every auguſt aſſembly; to the ruin of manners, induſtry, public credit, and private faith; and to the increaſe of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, idleneſs fraud villainy, violence, and all the licentious diſorders of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted populace<note n="*" place="bottom">Some of the foregoing obſervations may perhaps be thought foreign to the ſubject of this eſſay; but the manners of women are ſo intimately connected with the manners of men, and thoſe of men with the ſtate, in this country, that it is impoſſible to ſeperate them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, without omitting many particulars neceſſary to be known for the perfect underſtanding of each.</note>.</p>
                     <p>The manners of the two ſexes, as has been already obſerved, generally keep pace with each other. In proportion as the men grew regardleſs of character, the women neglected the duties of their ſex. Though little inclined to hoarding, they are not perhaps leſs diſpoſed to avarice than men: gold to them is deſireable, as the miniſter of vanity, voluptuouſneſs, and ſhew. It became their ſupreme ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:013650_0241_0F91A3B844DF44C8"/>and the only ſource of the matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial union, to the excluſion of that tender ſentiment which alone can give ſtrength to the ſacred tie, or pleaſure to the nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſtate. The young, the beautiful, the healthful, were wedded — though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with their own conſent — to age, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and diſeaſe; virtue was joined to profligacy, and wantonneſs to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                     <p>Such marriages were neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of domeſtic felicity. The want of cordiality at home naturally leads us abroad, as the want of happineſs in our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves leads us to ſeek it in externals, and to torture imagination for the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of appetites, which, undepraved, are ſimple and uniform. New amuſements, and ſocieties of pleaſure, were every day formed; new modes of diſſipation were invented; the order of nature was chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; night and day were inverted; and fancy and language were exhauſted for names to the aſſemblies of politeneſs and gallantry. Nothing is ſo oppreſſive as time to the unhappy, or thought to the
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:013650_0242_0F91A3B8F97C9938"/>vacant mind: theſe were not all enough They ſeemed afraid of themſelves, and of each other. The huſband had one ſet of viſitors, the wife another; he proſecuted his pleaſures abroad, ſhe entertained her friends at home; or reſorted to ſome place of public amuſement, or private pleaſure. In a free country, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable in a man to accuſe his wife without evidence, or to pretend to abridge her liberty; and the guilty are ſilent for their own ſakes. It was often morning before they met at their joyleſs home.</p>
                     <p>A ſpirit of gaming, which mingled it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with diſſipation and pleaſure, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a new pretence for nocturnal meetings. Money loſt at play muſt be paid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>how; it is a debt of honour: and, to preſerve family-peace, it is to be feared that women of virtuous principles have often ſacrificed ſomething more precious than their jewels. At any rate gaming diſcovers the temper, ruffles the paſſions, corrupts the heart, and breaks down the ſtrongeſt barrier of virtue, — a decent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve between the ſexes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="111" facs="unknown:013650_0243_0F91A3B9B362A9C0"/>
Love grew confident, as beauty became more acceſſible; and the freedom of manners permitted the warmeſt declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without offence. The opportunities of gratification were infinite; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of reſtraint were few; and the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were many and great. A general tenſuality was the conſequence. Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal inſidelity became common.</p>
                     <p>Men of ſpirit obtained divorces. But theſe, inſtead of enforcing the obligation of the marriage-vow, by the fear of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſhame, appeared to have a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect; they only propagated weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: the ſeducing example of human frailty remained, the odium was forgot; while the equity of the ſentence was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, or its ſeverity blamed. Huſbands were loudly accuſed of libertiniſm, and juſtly of neglect. The women continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make repriſals, or make up their wants; the practice triumphed. Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent men overlooked ſuch liberties, when conducted with decency, which it muſt be owned was ſeldom violated; and good-natured huſbands in general begin to
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:013650_0244_0F91A3BAB2550280"/>adopt a polite opinion, which will leaſt be conducive to a private peace viz. That a man is not more diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the AMOURS of his wife than by any other DEVIATION of taſte, or than ſhe is by thoſe of her huſband.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, unleſs manners take a turn, there is reaſon to belive that our Britiſh ladies, once ſo remarkable for modeſty, chaſtity, and conjugal fidelity, will ſoon equal their ſiſters of France in impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, levity, and incontinence; as we already rival our continental brethren in foppery, falſhood, inconſtancy, vanity, —and in all their unmanly pleaſures, capricious appetites, and emaſculating luxuries<note n="*" place="bottom">This character, in its full extent, muſt only be applied to the court and the capital. Two women of the diſtant counties ſtill poſſeſs the domeſtic virtues in a conſiderable degree of perfection; the men are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively ſober and faithful; and the manners of the whole northern part of the iſland, are only arriving at that degree of refinement which is favourable to induſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to virtue, and to letters.</note>.</p>
                     <p>But the fears of virtue are often groundleſs: fancy magnifies future evil,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:013650_0245_0F91A3BB330BAC38"/>and overlooks preſent good: we have dwelt long enough—ſome may perhaps think too long—on the dark ſide of the picture. Our fair country women ſtill poſſeſs many virtues, and more accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments. Their gallantries are at leaſt regulated by a ſenſe of decency: volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs wears its lovelieſt form; deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy is the handmaid of pleaſure: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity is oftener yet the effect of paſſion than of appetite; and elopements are ſtronger proofs of ſenſibility than the want of ſhame.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the general relaxation of manners, the averſion to whatever is ſerious, the thirſt of admiration, and the neglect of eſteem, are at leaſt of thoſe qualities which produce it, there are in this age, in this iſland, and even in this city, women who would have done honour to any age or country; who join a refined taſte and cultivated under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to a feeling heart, and who adorn their talents and their ſenſibility with ſentiments of virtue, honour, and humanity. We have women who could
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:013650_0246_0F91A3BEA08FFBB8"/>have reaſoned with Locke, who might have diſputed the laurel with Pope, and to whom addiſon would have liſtened with pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Even in the middle of opulence, and of that luxury which too often mingles avarice with ſtate, which narrow the heart, and makes it at the ſame time vain and cruel, we ſee women who yearly ſet apart a portion of their ſubſtance for the poor; who make it their buſineſs to find out abodes of miſery, and who number among their pleaſures the relief of the orphan, and the tears ſhed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of the widow.</p>
                     <p>We have ſtill wives, young, beautiful, and affectionate, who honour their vows, and in the moſt delightful of human con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections offer the moſt enchanting ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of innocence and love; who are not aſhamed to be mothers; who devote their happy hours to the tendereſt cares of nature; who watch with anxiety, who preſs with tranſport, by turns, in their lovely arms, to their lips, and to
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:013650_0247_0F91A3C090B37788"/>their breaſt, the infant whom they nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with their milk, while the huſband, in ſilent joy, divides his fond regards between the mother and the child.</p>
                     <p>O that theſe ſweet examples could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive among us nature and manners!— that we could learn how much the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, even for our happineſs, are ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the pleaſures! — how much a ſimple, cordial life, where nothing is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, where we live in ourſelves, and in the objects of our ſenſibility, — where we enjoy by turns the delights of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, affection, and ſelf-approbation, is preferable to that giddy and diſſipated life, where we court continually a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom which eludes our purſuit, or vaniſhes in our embrace! — Then the women would recover their empire; then beauty, adorned with virtue, would lead captive the hearts of men, — would reſtrain them from wandering, and teach them to be faithful, — happy in their ſervitude, and proud of their weakneſs; then a ſine and blameleſs ſenſuality would ſeaſon every moment of exiſtence, and make life a
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:013650_0248_0F91A3C1B86C03F8"/>delicious dream; then the pains of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, unimpoiſoned by remorſe, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's pains, ſweetened by love and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated by friendſhip, would be rather a conflict of tenderneſs than a torment.</p>
                     <p>Society, in ſuch a world, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be leſs buſy; but there would be more domeſtic peace. There would be leſs oſtentation, and more pleaſure; leſs diſſipation, and more happineſs. We would talk leſs of pleaſing, and we would pleaſe more. Our days would flow, like a pure and quiet ſtream; — and if, in the evening of life, we had not the ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſatisfaction of having reciprocated the ſofteſt feelings with a hundred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons — of whom we were unworthy, who were unworthy of us, or who had no ſhare in our hearts — we would at leaſt have the comfort to have lived with thoſe we loved, and would ſweetly ſink to reſt, conſcious of having extracted from the pleaſures of to-day a charm to mingle with the joys of to-morrow.</p>

                     <head>SECTION VIII. CONCLUSION.</head>
                     <p>LET us not however, dream of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; nor conclude, from the virtues of individuals, that the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the age are pure, or the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of women in general reſpectable. Among a people where the ſpirit of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is carried ſo far, as it is at preſent both in France and in England, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic life muſt be little known. All the ſentiments of nature, which ſpring up in retirement, and which are nurſed in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, muſt be weakened. The women muſt therefore be leſs devoted to their original and moſt important duties; they muſt be leſs wives and mothers.</p>
                     <p>The manners now direct the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, as much as the prejudices for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly directed the manners. The ſacred attachments of love and friendſhip are exploded; they are baniſhed to the ſhepherd and the ſavage. Why? — Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:013650_0250_0F91A3C2B835D4E0"/>they are unpolite: they ſhew too great a preference; they pay to one, what is due to all.</p>
                     <p>The more the general tie extends, the more the particular ties are relaxed. We ſeem to be attached to all the world, and we are attached to nobody. Hence the increaſe of diſſimulation and falſhood. The leſs we feel, the more we appear to feel.</p>
                     <p>By a ſtrange contraſt, we are enrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured at the word SENTIMENT; — and all genuine ſentiment is ridiculed. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we imagine, what we do not feel, does not exiſt; and, indeed, we ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently vindicate ourſelves from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of real ſentiment, by the artful declamation which we ſubſtitute in its place.</p>
                     <p>The word ROMANTIC was never ſo much in uſe. This happy term affords a double feaſt to vanity: it excuſes eſteem, or juſtifies contempt, to the virtues which we want; and it prevents ſhame for the
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:013650_0251_0F91A3C3819ADBB0"/>vices or the weakneſſes which we have. It makes us content with our knowledge: we believe that we have eſtimated all things; and that we ſee both what man is, and what he can be.</p>
                     <p>We talk a great deal about pleaſure, and we taſte very little. The ſoul preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitates itſelf upon its objects, when it ſhould keep them at a certain diſtance; deſire is gratified, before it can awake the divinity of paſſion; the ſpell which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted the mind is too ſoon broke. Imagination turns cold, becauſe it has nothing to create; illuſion vaniſhes; ſenſe grows dead. But what is ſenſe, without paſſion and fancy?</p>
                     <p>The void which we experience, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of falſe pleaſure, and the want of energy in the ſoul, muſt have given birth to AMUSEMENT. the reſource of cold hearts and empty heads; a word which is become important, and which muſt be ridiculous to the ſerious every time they uſe it; a word which implies
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:013650_0252_0F91A3C434EE27D8"/>what has no connection with virtue, and none perhaps with the ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>That amuſement, that inexpreſſible ſomething, which is neither imagination, reaſon, nor paſſion, and which conſiſts principally in forms, being the univerſal taſte, all things muſt comply with it. The accompliſhments are ſuppoſed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and the vices are pardoned. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt nobody has the boldneſs to cenſure guilt, when it wears the habit of the Graces. The mind is contracted; the heart is ſhut; and attention is buſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout trifles. To pleaſe or to diſpleaſe are become the great words of language.</p>
                     <p>As we are continually under obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſelf-love, by being more rouſed, muſt be more keen; but the ſame ſpirit which rouſes it, likeways reſtrains it. It is curbed, and it is ſtimulated; its ſecret is rather veiled than hid, — and yet is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. The eyes of vanity are obſcured by a miſt, and the mutual feeling is willing to ſeem blind. Society is a ſencing ſchool or field of combat, where ſelf-love en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:013650_0253_0F91A3C506948260"/>ſelf-love, and where each are deſirous to conquer without the air of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation: they diſguiſe their efforts, that their pretenſions may not be ſuſpected.</p>
                     <p>From this aſſemblage of folly, vanity, and falſhood, muſt ſpring a reſtleſs levity in the commerce of the ſexes, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and buſy mockery of paſſion. But what above all characteriſes the manners of the preſent age, is the madneſs of ſhew; the frenzy of ſacrificing every thing to appearance; the importance aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to little duties, and the value ſet upon little objects. We talk gravely of the trifles of to-day, and of thoſe of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow. The ſoul has a languid, and never ſatisfied activity, which expands it over a thouſand objects without intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in one, and which communicates motion without impulſe.</p>
                     <p>But if a taſte for letters, and a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium of talents, mingle with the giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſociety, from ſuch a combination muſt reſult other effects. Then a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral paſſion of appearing informed muſt
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:013650_0254_0F91A3C8650A3168"/>prevail, without the time, or the trouble to be ſo; then we muſt ſee a torrent of ſuperficial knowledge, and a crowd of half-learned pretenders to ſcience; a multitude of philoſophical ideas, which men of genius throw out in retirement, and which are greedily ſeized by people of faſhion, diſputed, repeated, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in polite circles; light converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on profound ſubjects; the laws of genius ſettled, and a genius of memory, when we have nothing original; the eſtabliſhment and the oppoſition of lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary ſocieties; pretenſions of all kinds, and of all denominations; bold preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, cool and high pretenſions, and cautious pretenſions, with a mixture of reſerve; the fury of reputation, oftener uſurped than real; intrigue, flattery, and little arts to obtain it; in ſhort, the art of praiſing, to be praiſed; the art of joining foreign merit to our own, and of procuring renown either by ourſelves or by others.</p>
                     <p>As the general ſyſtem of luminaries is greater, and as they communicate their
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:013650_0255_0F91A3CA51DAD8B8"/>influence more fully by motion, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, without giving themſelves any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, muſt be more enlightened. But, faithful to their plan, they only covet knowledge as an ornament to the mind, as jewels are to the perſon. They ſtudy the arts rather from a deſire to pleaſe, than a deſire to know, or from the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of learning; and they read more for amuſement, than for inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, in a ſtate of ſociety where the motion is rapid, and where there is an eternal ſucceſſion of objects and ideas, the women, conſtantly occupied in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſcene, which changes and flies inceſſantly round them, muſt know better the ideas of the preſent, than of paſt times, and thoſe which are faſhionable than thoſe which are juſt. They muſt therefore be better acquainted with the language of the arts than wich their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and have more unconnected ideas than uſeful or ſyſtematic knowledge.</p>
                     <p>It might perhaps be thought curious now to examine, what muſt be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:013650_0256_0F91A3CB764591E8"/>of ſuch a mixture of ideas and manners, of levity and learning, of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy in the head, and libertiniſm in the heart: that however is too ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to afford room for much diſquiſition. It might likewiſe perhaps be thought cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, to compare the characters of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as they at preſent exiſt in London, and in Paris, with thoſe which they have had in different periods, and which they now have in different countries; with their ſweet modeſty in many parts of England; with their timid reſerve in Scotland; with their tameneſs and want of paſſion in Holland; with their mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of devotion and ſenſuality in Italy; with their warm imagination and keen ſenſibility in Spain; with their profound retirement in China, where they have been ſeparated during four thouſand years from the intercourſe of men; in ſhort, with the character and the manners which muſt reſult from their confinement in Turky, in Perſia, and over almoſt all Aſia, where they only exiſt for one man; where they can neither cultivate their character nor their reaſon; and, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:013650_0257_0F91A3CBC6224060"/>to have only ſenſes, where they are forced by the abſurdity of their condition to join modeſty to wantonneſs, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetry to retirement:—But, to complete ſuch a parallel, it is ſufficient to have hinted it.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore only obſerve, that in the preſent age there are fewer panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rics on women than in any former pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. The poets ſeem to have loſt that delicate gallantry which was ſo long their character. They are either Cynics or voluptuaries. The prevailing taſte for women, indeed, which is neither love, nor paſſion, nor even gallantry, but the cold and barren effect of a habit of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, can neither rouſe imagination nor ſentiment. In our numerous and growing aſſemblies, in the eternal round of diſſipation and amuſement, where the ſexes mingle with freedom, we learn to admire leſs, becauſe we learn to be more ſevere. Self-love, judge and rival, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times indulgent through pride, but always cruel from jealouſy, was never more vigilant in ſpying faults, or ſowing ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule.
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:013650_0258_0F91A3CC8BB79688"/>Praiſe is the reſult of enthuſiaſtic paſſion; and never was there an age in which there was leſs than in this, though perhaps we affect more than our prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. Enthuſiaſm ſprings from a warm imagination, which creates objects in place of ſeeing them, and which heightens what it has ſeen. At preſent we ſee too much; in conſequence of which we feel too little. Beauty obtrudes itſelf on the view: its ſpots are too viſible; paſſion is diſguſted; and fancy ſickens for want of exerciſe. Female delicacy is loſt. Vice is ranked in the number of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments. The leſs we eſteem the women, the more we pretend to know them:—and they at preſent make ſuch a language neceſſary. Every boy has more pride than to ſeem acquainted only with their virtues; and would be rakes, whoſe experience really reaches no further, that they may ſupport a reputation with the ſex, accuſe them of more than human weakneſs, by contemptibly aſſuming a knowledge and a character to which they have no right.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="127" facs="unknown:013650_0259_0F91A3CD55921458"/>
Such, with regard to women, is the influence of that general ſpirit of ſociety which they have inſpired, and of which they do not fail to boaſt. They are like eaſtern monarchs, who are never more honoured than when they are leaſt ſeen: by diſcovering themſelves too freely to their ſubjects, they have encouraged them to revolt.</p>
                     <p>But, leaſt the ladies ſhould take offence at being compared to tyrants, I will give them a gentler ſimile; which I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce with a ſhort analyſis of female ſociety, as it progreſſes in countries where the ſoft affections exerciſe their ſweeteſt influence. — In a ſtate of nature, the company of women is little deſired; their beauties are unveiled to every eye; and their favours are beſtowed without courting. In the early periods of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they are principally valued on account of their utility; their condition ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to ſervitude; and little delicacy is obſerved in the commerce of love. As ſociety advances, they are prized as objects of pleaſure: conſcious of their
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:013650_0260_0F91A3CDF6037808"/>importance, they become more delicate of their beauties, reſerved in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and nice of their favours. Love grows jealous, and beauty undergoes a degree of reſtraint. But as the mind opens, and when ſociety is better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, ſuch reſtraint is thought unjuſt — ungenerous to the partners of our dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt intereſts, our ſweeteſt pleaſures! — and inconſiſtent with that confidence which is due to love, to virtue, to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and which is eſſential to our own peace. The freedom of nature is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, within the pale of ſociety. Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty becomes more brilliant, more alluring, — but leſs engaging. Man ceaſes to adore what is familiar to his eye. Like her emblematic flower, the ſame ſun that beholds the glory of woman may be ſaid to be witneſs to her diſgrace: her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is too delicate to ſupport the beams of general admiration; ſhe opens her attractions too fully to the heart; ſhe yields too freely her ſweetneſs to the breath of praiſe; and, if ſhe does not ſink into her original neglect, ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences a fate little more to be envied;
