            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That Dedication and Flattery are synonimous, is the Complaint of every Dedicator who concludes himself ingenious and fortunate, if he can discover a less trite and direct Method of flattering than is usually practised; but we are happily prevented from the least Intention of this kind, by the repeated Offerings of the <hi>Muses and News Writers</hi> to your Excellency in the publick Papers: 'Twere prefumptuous even to dream of equalling or increasing them; we therefore flatter ourselves, that nothing we can advance will in the least shock your Excellency's Modesty; not doubting but your Goodness will pardon any Deficiency of Elegance and Politeness on account of our Sincerity, and the serious Truths we have the Honour to approach you with.</p>
            <p>We have seen the ancient Custom of sending forth Colonies for the Improvement of any distant Territory, or new Acquisition, continued down to ourselves; but to your Excellency alone it is owing, that the World is made acquainted with a Plan, highly refined from those of all former Projectors. They fondly imagin'd it necessary to communicate to such young Settlements, the fullest Rights and Properties, all the Immunities of their Mother Countries, and Privileges rather more extensive: By such Means indeed these Colonies flourished with early Trade and Affluence; but your Excellency's Concern for our perpetual Welfare could never permit you to propose such transitory Advantages for us: You considered Riches like a Divine and Philosopher,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:004817_0005_0F5ED98D77ADD860"/>
as the <hi>irritamenta malorum,</hi> and knew that they were disposed in inflate weak Minds with Pride, to pamper the Body with Luxury, and introduce a long Variety of Evils. Thus have you <hi>protected us from our selves,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Walter</hi> says, by keeping all earthly Comforts from us. You have afforded us the Opportunity of arriving at the Integrity of the <hi>Primitive Times,</hi> by entailing a more than <hi>Primitive Poverty</hi> on us: The Toil that is necessary to our bare Subsistance must effectually defend us from the Anxieties of any further Ambition: As we have no Properties to feed Vain-glory and beget Contention, so we are not puzzled with any System of Laws to ascertain and establish them: The valuable Vertue of Humility is secured to us by your Care, to prevent our procuring, or so much as seeing any <hi>Negroes,</hi> (the only human Creatures proper to improve our Soil) lest our Simplicity might mistake the poor <hi>Africans</hi> for greater Slaves than ourselves: And that we might fully receive the Spiritual Benefit of those wholesome Austerities, you have wisely denied us the Use of such Spiritous Liquors as might in the least divert our Minds from the Contemplation of our happy Circumstances.</p>
            <p>Our Subject swells upon us; and did we allow ourselves indulge our Inclination, without considering our weak Abilities, we should be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to launch out into many of your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's extraordinary Endowments, which do not so much regard the Affair in Hand; but as this
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:004817_0006_0F5ED98DE345D4B8"/>
would lead us beyond the Bounds of a Dedication, so would it engross a Subject too extensive for us, to the Prejudice of other Authors and Panegyrists; we shall therefore confine ourselves to that remarkable Scene of your Conduct, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Great Britain</hi> in general, and the Settlers of <hi>Georgia</hi> in particular, are laid under such inexpressible Obligations.</p>
            <p>Be pleased then, <hi>Great SIR,</hi> to accompany our heated Imaginations, in taking a View of this colony of <hi>Georgia,</hi> this Child of your auspicious Politicks, arrived at the utmost Vigor of its Constitution, at a Term when most former States have been struggling through the Convulsions of their Infancy. This early Maturity, however, lessens our Admiration that your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy lives to see (what few Founders ever aspired after) the great Decline and almost final Termination of it. So many have finished their Course during the Progress of the Experiment, and such Numbers have retreated from the Phantoms of Poverty and Slavery, which their cowardly I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations pictur'd to them, that you may justly vaunt with the boldest Hero of them all,

            <head>PREFACE</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE Colony of Georgia has afforded so much subject of Conversation to the World, that it is not to be question'd, but a true and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Account of it from its first Settlement to its present Period, will be generally agreeable; and the more so, that the Subject has hitherto been so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised and misrepresented in</hi> Pamphlets, Poems, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zettes <hi>and</hi> Journals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it is ask'd, Why this</hi> NARRATIVE <hi>has not been publish'd to the World sooner? We assign two Reasons, which (we doubt not) will be satisfactory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>A Number of Honourable Gentlemen</hi> accepted the Charge of Trustees <hi>for executing the Purposes in his Majesty's most gracious</hi> CHARTER; <hi>Gentlemen, whose Honour and Integrity we never did, nor yet do call in question: But, to our great Misfortune, none of that hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable Body (excepting Mr.</hi> OGLETHOTPE) <hi>ever had Opportunity of viewing the Situation and Circumstances of the Colony, and judging for themselves as to the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities thereof. How far Mr.</hi> Oglethorpe's <hi>Schemes were consistent with the Welfare or Prosperity of it, will best appear from the following</hi> Narrative.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When Experience gradually unfolded to us the Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we found absolutely requisite to our subsisting, we made all dutiful and submissive Applications to these our
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:004817_0010_0F5ED992896C8190"/>
Patrons, in whom we placed so much Confidence: This Course we judged the most proper and direct, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore repeated these our dutiful Applications, both to the Body of the Trustees and to Mr. Oglethorpe; but alas! our Miseries could not alter his Views of things, and therefore we could obtain no Redress from him; and the honourable Board we found were prejudiced against our Petitions (no don'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>) thro' Misinformations and Misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his (we are confident) a further Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Time will convince them of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The inviolable Regard we paid to the honourable Board kept us from applying to any other Power for Redress, whilst the least Hopes could be entertained of any from them: And we make no doubt, but that our Moderation in this respect will recommend us to all Persons of Humanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A second Reason is, That as we had daily Occasion of seeing our supreme Magistrates, who ruled over us with unlimited Power, exercising illegal Acts of Authority, by Threatnings, Imprisonments, and other Oppressions; therefore we had just Reason to apprehend, that any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Steps to obtain Relief might subject us to the like Effects of arbitrary Power; so, until now, that a handful of us have made our Escape to a Land of Liberty, (after having made Shipwreck of our Time and Substance in that unhappy Colony) we had it not in our Power to represent the State of that Settlement to the World, or make our Application to higher Powers for Redress.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are hopeful that the Perusal of the following Sheets will rectify two sorts of Readers in their Surprize in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the</hi> Colony of GEORGIA, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> 
               <hi>Those of Great Britain, who have never known this Part of the World but by Description; and those of</hi> America <hi>The</hi> First <hi>are no doubt surprized to think it possible, that so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and temperate a Crime, so fruitful a Soil, such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive Privileges, all which were publickly given out,
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:004817_0011_0F5ED99319417058"/>
and such considerable Sums of publick and private Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions, have not satisfied and enriched us: Them we refer to the</hi> following Narrative <hi>for</hi> Satisfaction. <hi>The</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican <hi>Reader, on the other hand, must be equally sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to find that such Numbers should have been so fooled and blindfolded, as to expect to live in this Part of</hi> Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica <hi>by Cultivation of Lands without</hi> Negroes, <hi>and much more without Titles to their Lands, and laid under a</hi> Load <hi>of Grievances and Restrictions: And tho' these were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress'd, how could Persons in their Senses ever imagine, that</hi> Fifty Acres of Pine-Barren, <hi>not value Fifty Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences in Property, (and whereof many Thousands may be purchased at half that rate in the neighbouring Province) could maintain a Family of White People, and pay such Duties and Quit-rents in a few years, as the richest Grounds in</hi> Carolina, <hi>or other Provinces in</hi> America, <hi>will never bear? To these last we shall only beg Leave to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that such fatal</hi> Artifice <hi>was used, (we shall not say by whom) such specious</hi> Pretences <hi>were made use of, and such real</hi> Falsities <hi>advanced, and the</hi> smallest Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations <hi>of Truth magnified to</hi> Hyperbole; <hi>that we, who had no Opportunity of knowing otherways, or means of learning the real Truth, and being void of all Suspicion of Artifice or Design, easily believed all these, and fell into the Decoy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Mind of Man is naturally curious and enterpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; we easily seed our Wishes into Realities, and affect and look upon every Novelty in the most favourable Light; how easy then is it for Cunning and Artifice to lay hold on the weak Sides of our Fellow Creatures, as we catch Fish with a</hi> Hook <hi>baited to their particular</hi> Gout?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To prove this Charge, we shall only transcribe some Passages from a Piece of Prose, and some from a Piece of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>The First are from a Pamphlet printed at</hi> London 1733, <hi>entituled,</hi> A new and accurate Account of the Provinces of SOUTH-CAROLINA and GEORGIA. <hi>The Author has not thought fit to favour us with his Name; but it is easy to conceive that we, who suspected no Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or Design, must conclude that it came from the best</hi> Authority, <hi>from the Circumstances of its being dispersed publickly, and not being contradicted, and from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's intimate Acquaintance (at least so pretended) with all the Trustees Measures and Designs. After a high En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comium upon the Trustees,</hi> Page 7, <hi>he says,</hi> 
               <q>The Air of GEORGIA is healthy, being always serene and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, never subject to excessive Heat or Cold, or sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Changes of Weather; the Winter is regular and short, and the Summer cooled with refreshing Breez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; it neither feels the cutting North-west Wind that the <hi>Virginians</hi> complain of, nor the intense Heats of <hi>Spain, Barbary, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Egypt.</hi> The Soil will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any thing with very little Culture.</q>—<hi>Page</hi> 19,<q> All Sorts of Corn yield an amazing Increase; one Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredfold is the common Estimate, tho' their Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry if so slight, that they can only be said to scratch the Earth, and meerly to cover the Seed: All the best Sort of Cattle and Fowls are multiplied without Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and therefore without a Price: Vines are Natives here.</q>—<hi>Page</hi> 21, <q>The Woods near <hi>Savannah</hi> are not hard to be cleared, many of them have no Under-Wood, and the Trees do not stand generally thick on the Ground, but at considerable Distances asunder: When you fell the Timber for Use, or to make Tar, the Root will rot in four or five Years; and in the mean time you may pasture the Ground; but if you would only destroy the Timber, 'tis done by half a Dozen Strokes of an Ax surrounding each Tree a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle above the Root, in a Year or two the Water get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Wound rots the Timber, and a brisk Gust

of Wind fells many Acres for you in an Hour, of which you may make one bright Bon-fire. Such will be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently here the Fate of the <hi>Pine,</hi> the <hi>Walnut,</hi> the <hi>Cypress,</hi> the <hi>Oak</hi> and the <hi>Cedar.</hi> Such an Air and Soil can only be described by a Poetical Pen, because there is no Danger of exceeding the Truth; therefore take <hi>WALLER's</hi> Description of an Island in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood at CAROLINA, to give you an Idea of this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Climate: 
<l>The Spring, which but salutes us here,</l>
                  <l>Inhabits there, and courts them all the Year:</l>
                  <l>Ripe Fruits and Blossoms on the same Tree live;</l>
                  <l>At once they promise what at once they give.</l>
                  <l>So sweet the Air, so moderate the Clime,</l>
                  <l>None sickly lives, or dies before his Time.</l>
                  <l>Heav'n sure has kept this Spot of Earth uncurst,</l>
                  <l>To shew how all things were created first.</l>

               </q>—<hi>In page</hi> 32, <hi>the Author when recommending the</hi> Georgia <hi>Adventure to Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of decayed Circumstances, who must labour at home or do worse, states the following Objection,</hi>

               <q>If such People can't get Bread here for their Labour, how will their Condition be mended in GEORGIA?</q> 
               <hi>Which he solves in the following Manner,</hi>—<q>The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is easy; Part of it is well attested, and Part Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident; they have Land there for nothing, and that Land so fertile, that, as is said before, they receive an Hundredfold Increase, for taking a very little Pains. Give here in <hi>England</hi> ten Acres of good Land to one of those helpless Persons, and I doubt not his Ability to
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:004817_0014_0F5ED995820A7218"/>
make it sustain him, and by his own Culture, without letting it to another; but the Difference between no Rent and rack'd Rent, is the Difference between eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and starving.</q> 
               <hi>Page 32,</hi> 
               <q>These Trustees not only give Land to the Unhappy who go thither, but are also impowered to receive the voluntary Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of charitable Persons, to enable to furnish the poor Adventurers with all Necessaries for the Expence of their Voyage, occupying the Land, and supporting them till they find themselves comfortably settled; so that now the Unfortunate will not be obliged to bind themselves to a long Servitude to pay for their Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, for they may be carried <hi>gratis</hi> into a Land of Liberty and Plenty, where they immediately find them selves in the Possession of a competent Estate, in an happier Climate than they knew before, and they are unfortunate indeed, if here they cannot forget their Sorrows.</q>—<hi>Nay, as if such Assertions as these were not powerful enough to influence poor People, Calculations are subjoin'd, to demonstrate, that a Family consisting of one poor Man, his Wife, and Child of seven years old, may in</hi> Georgia <hi>earn sixty Pounds Sterling</hi> per Annum, <hi>and this abstracted from Silk, Wine,</hi> &amp;c.  <hi>Page 41,</hi> 
               <q>Now this very Family in <hi>Georgia,</hi> by raising Rice and Corn sufficient for its Occasions, and by attending the Care of their Cattle and Land (which almost every one is able to do in some tolerable Degree for himself) will easily produce in gross Value the Sum of sixty Pounds Sterling <hi>per Annum;</hi> nor is this to be wondred at, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the valuable Assistance it has from a fertile Soil and a Stock given <hi>gratis;</hi> which must always be remembred in this Calculation.</q>

We are hopeful, that an information founded upon the strictest Truth will effectually introduce any further Steps that Providence shall enable us to take towards procuring the Redress of our Grievances. While we had the least Hopes of Redress from our immediate Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors and Patrons, we would not; and when we began to despair of Relief by that Channel, we durst not make Application to any other Tribunal, unless we would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose ourselves to the dreadful Effects of the Resentment of those who had before reduced us to Poverty by Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression: And indeed, in all the Applications we made for Redress, we were brow-beat, obstructed, threatned, and branded with opprobrious Names, such as prou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Our late Retreat from that Confinement to a <hi>Land of Liberty</hi> puts it in our Power to speak the Truth; and tho' our Endeavours are too late to relieve the dead, the dying, and those many now dispersed in all the Corners of his Majesty's Dominions; yet they may be the Means of ushering in Sympathy and Assistance to the Survivors, and to Multitudes of Widows and Orphans of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased from the humane and generous.</p>

next after any Day of Payment on which the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came due, then the Land was forfeited, and returned to the Trustees; as it likewise did upon Failure in any of the Following Conditions, <abbr>

            <p>The First of <hi>February 1732-3,</hi> Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> arrived at <hi>Georgia</hi> with the first Embarkation, consisting of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> Families, making upwards of <hi>One hundred</hi> Persons, all brought over and supported at the publick charge. The FIRST Thing he did after he arrived in <hi>Georgia</hi> was to <hi>make</hi> a kind of <hi>solemn Treaty</hi> with a Parcel of <hi>Fugitive Indians,</hi> who had been formerly banished their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for some Crimes and Misdemeanors they had comm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itted, and who had, some Months before this, got Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from the Governor of <hi>South-Carolina</hi> to settle there <note n="*" place="bottom">They built a small Number of Huts on a Bluff called <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>amacraw. Savannah</hi> now stands on the same Bluss.</note> Some of these he afterwards carried home with him under <hi>the Title of Kings, &amp;c</hi> and all of them have been ever since maintained at the publick Charge, at vast Expence, when many poor <hi>Christians</hi> were starv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Colony for Want of Bread; and we may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm, (and appeal to the Store-books for the Truth of it) that a larger Sum of Money has been expended for the Support of those <hi>useless Vagrants,</hi> than ever was laid out for the Encouragement of Silk, Wine, or any other Manufacture in the Colony.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, He <hi>prohibited</hi> the <hi>Importation of Rum,</hi> under Pretence that it was destructive to the Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and an Incentive to Debauchery and Idleness. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever specious these Pretences might seem, a little Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience soon convinced as that this Restriction was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly opposite to the Well-being of the Colony: For in the <hi>first</hi> Place, we were cut off from the most imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and probable Way of exporting our Timber (the only poor Prospect of Export that we could ever flatter ourselves with) to the <hi>Sugar Islands,</hi> Rum being the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004817_0047_0F5ED9B1D8E6FC18"/>
Principal Return they make. In the <hi>Second</hi> Place, the Experience of all the Inhabitants of <hi>America</hi> will prove the Necessity of qualifying <hi>Water</hi> with some Spirit, (and it is very certain, that no Province in <hi>America</hi> yields <hi>Water</hi> that such a Qualification is more necessary to than <hi>Carolina</hi> and <hi>Georgia</hi>) and the Usefulness of this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment has been sufficiently evident to all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Georgia</hi> who could procure <hi>it,</hi> and use it with Moderation. A <hi>third</hi> Reason which made this Restri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction very hurtful to the Colony was, That tho' the Laws were in force against it, (which put it in the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Magistrates to lay Hardships upon every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who might be <hi>otherwise</hi> under their <hi>Resentment</hi>) yet great Quantities were imported <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> From <hi>Carolina</hi> and <hi>New England,</hi> who would take Money only</note>, only with this Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that in place of Barter or Exchange, the ready Money was drained from the <hi>Inhabitants:</hi> And likewise, as it is <hi>the Nature of Mankind</hi> in general, and of <hi>the common sort</hi> in particular, more <hi>eagerly</hi> to desire, and more <hi>immoderately</hi> to use those Things which are most restrained from them, such was the Case with Respect to Rum in <hi>Georgia,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The THIRD Thing he did was regularly to set out to each Freeholder in <hi>Savannah</hi> Lots of <hi>Fifty Acres, in three distinct Divisions, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> The <hi>Eight Part</hi> of One Acre for a House and Garden in the Town; <hi>Four</hi> Acres and 7 Eighths at a small Distance from the Town; and <hi>Forty five</hi> Acres at a considerable Remove from thence. No Regard was had to the <hi>Quality</hi> of the Ground in the Divisions, so that some were altogether Pine-Barren, and some swamp and Morass, far surpassing the Strength and Ability of the <hi>Planter:</hi> And indeed what could be done at any Rate with such small Parcels of Land Separate from one another? These Loss were likewise shaped in long pointed Triangles, which considerably increased
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004817_0048_0F5ED9B4289A39E0"/>
the Extent of Inclosure, and rendred great Part of each Lot entirely useless. But these and many other Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships were scarcely felt by the few People that came there, so long as Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> Staid, which was about <hi>Fifteen</hi> Months: They work'd hard indeed in building some Houses in Town; but then they labour'd in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and were likewise assisted by Negroes from <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi> who did the heaviest Work: But at <note n="*" place="bottom"> Before he departed, a Vessel with about <hi>twenty</hi> Families of Jews arrived, all of whom had Lots assigned them; and likewise a Vessel with <hi>Forty</hi> transported <hi>Irish</hi> Convicts, whom he purchased, although they had been before refused at Jamaica, and who afterwards occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned continual Disturbance, in the Colony.</note> Mr. <hi> Ogle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe's</hi> going to <hi>England,</hi> the growing Fame of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony was thereby greatly increased, so that, as it has been before observed, People in abundance from all parts of the World stock'd to <hi>Georgia.</hi> Then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to consider, and endeavour, every one according to his Genius or Abilities, how they might best subsist themselves: Some, with great Labour and Expence, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayed the <hi>making of</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom"> Mr. <hi>Causton,</hi> the Trustees Store-keeper, mostly at their Charge, made a Tar-kiln, which turned out to no Advan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

                     </gap>.</note> Tar: This, as it is well known to the Trustees, never quitted Costs: Others tried to <hi>make Plank</hi> and Saw-Boards;</hi> which, by the great Price they were obliged to sell them at, by reason of the great Expence of white Servants, was the chief Means of ruining those who thought to procure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Living by their Buildings in Town; for Boards of all kinds could always be bought in <hi>Carolina</hi> for half the Price that they were able to sell them at; but few were capable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission them from thence, and those who were so were prevented from doing it, upon pretence of discouraging the Labour of white People in <hi>Georgia.</hi> Those who had Numbers of Servants and Tracts of Land in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, went upon the <hi>Planting of Corn, Pease, Potatoes, &amp;c.</hi> and the Charge of these who succeeded the best, so
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004817_0049_0F5ED9B4E7C6C510"/>
far exceeded the Value of the Produce, that it would have saved <hi>three Fourths</hi> to have bought all from the <hi>Carolina</hi> Market. The <hi>Felling of Timber</hi> was a Task ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unequal to the Strength and Constitution of white Servants, and the <hi>Hoeing the Ground,</hi> they being expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the sultry Heat of the Sun, insupportable; and it is well known, that this Labour is one of the hardest upon the Negroes, even though their Constitutions are much stronger than white People, and the Heat no way disagreeable nor hurtful to them; but in us it created <hi>inflammatory Fevers</hi> of various kinds both <hi>continued</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent, wasting</hi> and <hi>tormenting Fluxes, most excruciate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cholicks,</hi> and <hi>Dry-Belly-A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hs; Tremors, Vertigoes, Palsies,</hi> and a long Train of <hi>painful</hi> and <hi>lingring nervous Distempers;</hi> which brought on to many a Cessation both from Work and Life; especially as <hi>Water</hi> without any Qualification was the Chief Drink, and <hi>salt Meat</hi> the only Provisions that could be had or afforded: And so general were these Disorders that during the hot Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which lasts from <hi>March</hi> to <hi>October,</hi> hardly one half of the Servants and working people were ever able to do their Masters or themselves the least Service; and the yearly Sickness of each Servant, generally speaking, cost his Master as much as would have maintained a Negroe for <hi>four</hi> Years. These Things were represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Trustees in Summer 1735, in a Petition for the Use of Negroes, signed by about <hi>Seventeen</hi> of the better sort of People in <hi>Savannah:</hi> In this Petition there was also set forth the great disproportion betwixt the Maintenance and Cloathing of white Servants and Negroes. This Petition was carried to <hi>England</hi> and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the Trustees by Mr. <hi>Hugh Stirling,</hi> an experienced Planter in the Colony; but no Regards was had to it, or to what he could say, and great Resentment was even shewn to Mr. <hi>Thompson,</hi> the Master of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel in which it went.</p>
            <p>Whilst we laboured under those Difficulties in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting

ourselves, our <hi>Civil Liberties</hi> received a more <hi>terrible </hi> Shock: For, instead of such a free Government as we had Reason to expect, and of being judged by the Laws of our Mother Country, a <note n="*" place="bottom"> Mr. THOMAS C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Dictator,</hi> (under the Title of <hi>Bailiff</hi> and <hi>Store-keeper</hi>) was appointed and lest by Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> at his Departure, which was in <hi>April</hi> 1734 whose <hi>Will and Pleasure</hi> were the only Laws in <hi>Georgia:</hi> In regard to this Magistrate, the others were entirely nominal, and in a Manner but Cyphers: sometimes he would ask in publick their Opinion, in order to have the Pleasure of showing his Power by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting them. He would often threaten Juries, and especially when their Verdicts did not agree with his Inclination or Humour. And in order the more fully to establish his <hi>absolute</hi> Authority, the Store and Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal of the Provisions, Money and publick Places of Trust, were committed to him; by which Alteration in his State and Circumstances he became in a Manner <hi>infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated,</hi> being before that a Person of no Substance or Character, having come over with Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the first <hi>Forty,</hi> and left <hi>England</hi> upon account of something committed by him concerning his Majesty's Duties: However, he was sit enough for a great many Purposes, being a Person naturally <hi>proud, covetous, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> and <hi>deceitful,</hi> and would bring his Designs about by all possible Ways and Means.</p>
            <p>As his <hi>Power</hi> increased so did his <hi>Pride, Haughtiness</hi> and <hi>Cruelty,</hi> insomuch that he caused <hi>eight</hi> Freeholders, with an Officer, to attend at the Door of the Court eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day it sat, with their Guns and Bayonets, and they were commanded by his Orders to <hi>rest their Firelocks</hi> as soon as he appeared; which made People in some Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner afraid to speak their Minds, or Juries to act as their Consciences directed them. He was seldom or never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered on the Bench, not even when an Oath was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004817_0051_0F5ED9B66E4FF118"/>
and being perfectly <hi>intoxicated</hi> with Power and Pride, he threatned every Person without Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Rich and Poor, Strangers and Inhabitants, who in the least opposed his <hi>arbitrary</hi> Proceedings, or claimed their just Rights and Privileges, with the <hi>Stocks, Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Post</hi> and <hi> Log-House,</hi> and many times put those Threatnings in Execution; so that the <hi>Georgia Stocks, Whipping-Post</hi> and <hi>Log-House,</hi> soon were famous in <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi> and every where else in <hi>America</hi> where the Name of the Province was heard of, and the very Thoughts of coming to the Colony became a Terror to People's Minds. And now the Province of <hi>Carolina,</hi> who had, in private and publick Donations, given us upwards of 1300 <hi>l. Sterling,</hi> seeing these Things, and how the publick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was thrown away, began to despise the Colony, and out of a Regard to the Welfare of their Fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, disswaded every Body they could from settling in it. That this <hi>absolute</hi> Power might be exercised with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least Interruption, the other Magistrates were such, that they either were unable or incapable to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it: It is true, in <hi>December 1734,</hi> Mr. <hi>Causton</hi> met with a little Interruption; for the Trustees then sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to <hi>savannah</hi> one Mr. <hi>Gordon,</hi> as chief Magistrate, who being a person of a very winning Behaviour, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>able and fluent in Speech, soon got the Good-will of every Body, and a great many of the People laid their Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and Hardships open to him, which seem'd a little to eclipse Mr. <hi>Causton;</hi> but he soon found out an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to remove this Adversary, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> by refusing him Provisions from the Store, which in a little Time ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him incapable to support himself and Family, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was obliged, after about <hi>six</hi> Weeks Stay, to leave the Place, <hi>in order,</hi> as he said, <hi>to represent our Grievances to the Trustees,</hi> and soon after returned to <hi>London;</hi> but he did not perform his Promise, for what Reason we shall not pretend to determine; and some time thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he either resigned or was dismissed from his Office of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004817_0052_0F5ED9B72080B978"/>
First Bailiff, and Mr. <hi>Causton</hi> was appointed in his stead. As to Mr. <hi>Henry Parker,</hi> who was appointed Third Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff when Mr. <hi>Gordon</hi> came over, he was, in the <hi>first</hi> Place, a Man who had nothing to support himself and large Family but his Day-Labour, which was Sawing, and consequently as soon as his Time was otherwise emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyed he must be entirely dependent on the Store for his Subsistance. In the <hi>second</hi> Place, he was a Man of no Education; so that Mr. <hi>Causton </hi> soon moulded him to his own liking, and infused into him what Notions he Pleased. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he was and is an <hi>absolute</hi> Slave to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and he who plies him most with it (which <hi>Causton</hi> always took care to do, and whose Example has been since followed by his Successor <hi>Jones</hi>) has him, right or wrong, on his Side. As to Mr. <hi>Christie</hi> the Recorder, he was easily over-ruled by the other two, and the same Practice was always continued; for he who was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Third Bailiff after <hi>Gordon's</hi> Dismission or Resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was one <hi>Darn,</hi> nigh <hi>Seventy</hi> Years of Age, crazed both in Body and Mind, who died not long after his Appointment, and his Successor <hi>R.

It we should allow our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to enter into a Detail of the Particular Instances of such Proceedings, we should exceed much our proposed Bounds; we shall therefore confine ourselves to <hi>two</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which may serve as a Specimen of the many others. ONE is that of Capt. <hi>Joseph Watson:</hi> This Person having incurred Mr. <hi>Causton's</hi> Displeasure, was indicated for stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up Animosities in the Minds of the <hi>Indians, &amp;c.</hi> tending to the Ruin and Subversion of the Colony. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Trial the Jury in their Verdict found him only guilty of <hi>some unguarded Expressions,</hi> (altho' twice retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and hectored by Mr. <hi>Causton,</hi> who acted both as Witness and Judge in the Matter) and verbally recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him by their Foreman to the Mercy of the

Court, imagining or supposing he might be lunatick; (however, as it afterwards appeared, it was represented to the Trustees that the Jury found him guilty of <hi>Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> in their Verdict) whereupon he was immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by Mr. <hi>Causton,</hi> (altho' sufficient Bail was offered) and kept Prisoner near <hi>three</hi> Years, without any Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. But, as we are informed this Affair now lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a proper Judicature, we shall say no more of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>other</hi> Instance is that of Mr. <hi>Odingsell,</hi> who was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus, while the Nation at home was amused with the Fame of the Happiness and Flourishing of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and of its being free from Lawyers of any kind, the poor miserable Settlers and Inhabitants were exposed to as <hi>arbitrary</hi> a Government as <hi>Turky</hi> or <hi>Muscovy</hi> ever felt.

Grievances be redressed, and still continued exhausting our Substance in pursuing an impracticable Scheme, namely cultivating Land to Advantage in such a Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate with white Servants only, not doubting but that the parliament, who yearly repeated their Bounty, would make up our Damages: But alas! their Bounty was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in <hi>Georgia</hi> rather to the Hurt than Benefit of the Colony, as we shall here briefly relate. First, a <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>House</hi> was set about; but before the Frame was erected it was almost half rotten, and has not been carried on any further, nor never even covered, which has like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise greatly contributed to its Decay; and now that lofty Fabrick, so highly useful to Vessels which make that Coast, is either fallen or must fall very soon. <hi>Log<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Houses</hi> and <hi>Prisons</hi> of various Sorts were built and era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed successively, and most Part of them were fitter for <hi>Dungeons</hi> in the <hi>Spanish Inquisition</hi> than <hi>British Goals, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, Whipping-Posts,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom"> It was a very usual Thing with General OGLETHORPE, when any Person had incurred his Displeasure, to threaten to hang them.</note> 
               <hi>Gibbets, &amp;c.</hi> were provided to keep the Inhabitants in perpetual Terror; for Innocence was no Protection; and for some time there were more Imprisonments, Whippings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of white People in that <hi>Colony of Liberty,</hi> than in all <hi>British America</hi> besides. <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mills, Saw-Mills, Public Roads, Trustees Plantations,</hi> (as they were called) <hi>Wells</hi> and <hi>Forts,</hi> in different Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were all set about, but, as is evident from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, with no Design to serve the Publick, but only to amuse the World, and maintain some Creatures who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in keeping their Neighbours in Subjection; for few or none of these Things were ever brought to Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; some of them were left off half finished, and of those that were finished some were erazed, (being found of no Service) and others fell of themselves for Want of proper Care. To carry on the Manufactures of <hi>Silk,</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> a Garden was planted with Mulberries and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:004817_0055_0F5ED9B9616DBD40"/>
Vines, which was to be a Nursery to supply the rest of the Province: But this was as far from answering the proposed End as every Thing else was; for it is situat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon one of the most barren Spots of Land in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, being only a large Hill of dry Sand: Great Sums of Money were thrown away upon it from Year to Year to no Purpose. This was remonstrated to the Trustees, and they seem'd to be sensible of the Error, and gave Order to chuse another Spot of Ground; but the <hi>rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Powers</hi> in <hi>Georgia</hi> took no Notice thereof. And now, after so great Time and Charge, there are not so many Mulberry-Trees in all the Province of <hi>Georgia</hi> as many one of the <hi>Carolina</hi> Planters have upon their Plantations, nor so much Silk made there in one Year as many of those Planters do make: Nor could they ever in that Garden raise one Vine to the Perfection of bearing Fruit. And here it may be observed, That the <hi>Silk</hi> Mr. <hi>Ogle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe</hi> carried over for a Present to Queen <hi>CAROLINE,</hi> was most of it, if not all, made in <hi>Carolina.</hi> Tho' no proper Measures were ever taken for advancing the <hi>Silk</hi> and <hi>Wine Manufactures,</hi> yet private Persons made seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Essay towards the Culture of <hi>European Grapes;</hi> but even such Attempts met with no suitable Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe,</hi> as will appear from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Fact. <hi>Abraham De Leon, a Few,</hi> who had been many Years a Vineron in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and a Freeholder in <hi>Savannah,</hi> cultivated several kinds of Grapes in his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and, amongst others, the <hi>Port<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Trustees were satisfied with the Security, and accepted the Proposal, and wrote him, <hi>That they had remitted the</hi> Two hundred Pounds <hi>by Mr.</hi> Oglethorpe <hi>for his Use;</hi> which he did not deny when applied to by the said Leon for the same, but said, that he could not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance more than <hi>Twenty</hi> or <hi>Thirty Pounds,</hi> in regard he had other Uses for the Money; and so that Design dropt.</p>
            <p>In <hi>February 1735-6</hi> Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> arrived in <hi>Georgia</hi> for the <hi>second</hi> Time, with great Numbers of People, in order to settle to the southward, where he soon after carried them. Upon the Island of <hi>St. Simons</hi> he settled a Town, which he called <hi>Frederica;</hi> and about <hi>five</hi> Miles Distance from thence, towards the Sea, he placed the independent Company which he removed from <hi>Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Royal</hi> in <hi>Carolina,</hi> their former Station. On one of the Branches of the <hi>Alatamaha</hi> he settled the <hi>Highlanders,</hi> in a Village which was called <hi>Darien.</hi> Then he settled a Fort on <hi>Cumberland,</hi> which he named <hi>St. Andrews;</hi> and some time after he caused a Garrison of about <hi>Fifty</hi> Men to be placed on a sandy Island (without fresh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) in the Mouth of St. <hi>John's</hi> River, opposite to a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Look-out,</hi> where Possession was kept for about <hi>six</hi> Months, and several Fortifications built; but at last he was obliged to abandon it, after several People had lost their Lives by the Inconveniencies of the Place, besides great Sums of Money thrown away in vain.</p>
            <p>Whilst Things thus passed in the southern Part of the Province, Mr. <hi>Causton</hi> was not idle at <hi>Savannah;</hi> and one would have thought, that he made it his particular Design further to exa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>perate the People of <hi>Carolina:</hi> He stopt their Boats who were going up to <hi>New-Windsor;</hi> and not content with that, he caused them to be search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and whatever Rum was found therein was directly staved, in pursuance of an Act, as he alledged, entituled, <hi>An Act against the Importation of Rum into the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of</hi> Georgia. To complain of this, and to represent the bad State of the <hi>Indian Trade,</hi> a Committee from
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004817_0057_0F5ED9BC968BFCE8"/>
the Assembly of <hi>South-Carolina</hi> arrived at <hi>Savannah</hi> in <hi>July 1736</hi> where Mr.<hi>Oglethorpe</hi> then was: But their coming was of little Consequence; for after this the Differences and Animosities betwixt the two Provinces rather encreased than diminished; and we shall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that one Thing is certain, that ever since Mr.<hi>Oglethorpe</hi> intermeddled in the <hi>Indian</hi> Trade, it has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed apace, and at this time is almost entirely <hi>good-for-nothing</hi> either to the one or the other Province.</p>
            <p>Thus while the Province of <hi>Carolina</hi> resented the bad Treatment they had met with from the Leading Powers in <hi>Georgia,</hi> against the Colony in general; the poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants were doubly unfortunate, being ill look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by their nearest Neighbours and Friends, for the Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their Governors, while they themselves were still the greatest Sufferers by those very Actings.</p>

Staid in <hi>Georgia</hi> until <hi>November 1736,</hi> most of which Time he spent to the Southward, and then embark'd for <hi>England,</hi> leaving Mr. <hi>Causton</hi> with the same Authority he had formerly invested him with, and in the same Power he then exercised, and the Colony under the same Difficulties and Hardships.</p>
            <p>In <hi>March</hi> thereafter we had Advice of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Intentions of attacking the Colony from the <hi>Havannah.</hi> This put the whole Province in great Consternation, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially the Town of <hi>Savannah;</hi> they having neither <hi>Fort, Battery,</hi> or any other Place to Shelter themselves in, in case of any actual Attack: Therefore they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately set about building a <hi>Wooden Fort,</hi> and all sorts of People labour'd continually until it was in some measure finish'd; only Mr. <hi>Causton</hi> never came to the Work, but did all he could to retard it, making light of the Information, altho' it was sent Express by Commodore <hi>Dent,</hi> with a Letter directed to the <hi>Commander in Chief of Georgia;</hi> and has since been put out of all manner of Doubt, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having at that time <hi>Four thousand</hi> Men embarqued and ready to sail, if an extraordinary Accident had not prevented<note n="*" place="bottom"> They were detain'd <hi>eight</hi> Days at the <hi>Havannah,</hi> by contrary Winds; (the Land Forces being on board all that Time) at the End of the which there came Orders from Old <hi>Spain,</hi> to forbear Frostilities, the Convention being then agreed upon. </note> them.

            <p>And <hi>Now</hi> to make our Subjection the more compleat, a new kind of Tyranny was this Summer begun to be imposed upon us; for Mr. <hi>John Wesly</hi> who had come over and was receiv'd by us a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1737.</note> soon discovered
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:004817_0059_0F5ED9BE2B91CF00"/>
that his Aim was to enslave our <hi>Minds,</hi> as a necessary Preparative for enslaving our <hi>Bodies.</hi> The Attendances upon Prayers, Meetings and Sermons inculcated by him, so frequently, and at improper Hours, inconsistent with necessary Labour, especially in an infant Colony, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to propagate a Spirit of Indolence, and a Hypocrisy amongst the most abandoned; it being much easier for such Person, by an affected Shew of Religion, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to Mr. <hi>Wesly's</hi> Novelties, to be provided by his Procurement from the publick Stores, than to use that Industry which <hi>true</hi> Religion recommends: Nor indeed could the Reverend Gentleman conceal the Designs he was so full of, having frequently declar'd <hi>That he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver desir'd to see</hi> Georgia <hi>a Rich, but a</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom"> According to his System.</note> 
               <hi>Religious Colony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At last all Persons of any Consideration came to look upon him as a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> for which the following Reasons seem'd pretty convincing. I<hi>st,</hi> Under an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected strict Adherence to the Church of <hi>England</hi> he most unmercifully damned all <hi>Dissenters</hi> of whatever Denomination, who were never admitted to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with him until they first gave up their Faith and Principles entirely to his Moulding and Direction, and in Confirmation thereof declared their Belief of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validity of their former Baptism, and then to receive a new one from him: This was done publickly on the Persons of <hi>Richard Turner,</hi> Carpenter, and his Son. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Instance was that of <hi>William Gaff,</hi> who had once communicated and always conformed to his Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but was at last found out by Mr. <hi>Wesly</hi> to have been baptized by a <hi>Presbyterian Dissenter,</hi> the same thing was propos'd to him; but Mr. <hi>Gaff</hi> not inclinable to go that length, was ever thereafter excluded from the Communion.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> While all Dissenters (whereof a considerable Number was in the Colony) were thus unmercifully
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:004817_0060_0F5ED9BE9755F7F0"/>
damned, and shut out from Religious Ordinances, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that Spirit of Moderation and Tenderness which the <hi>Church of England</hi> shews towards them; Person su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected to be <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> were received and caressed by him as his First-rate Saints.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> A third Confirmation of this Suspicion arose from his Endeavours to establish Confession, Penance, Mortifications, Mixing Wine with Water in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Suppressing in the Administration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament the Explanation adjoyned to the Words of the communicating by the <hi>Church of England,</hi> to shew that they mean a Feeding on Christ by Faith, Saying no more than "The Body of Christ; The Blood of Christ;" by appointing Deaconesses, with sundry other Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which he called <hi>Apostolick Constitutions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> As there is always a strict Connexion betwixt <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery;</hi> so the Design of all this fine Scheme seem'd to the most Judicious to be calculated to debase and depress the Minds of the People, to break any Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Liberty, and humble them with Fastings, Penan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Drinking of Water, and a thorough Subjection to the Spiritual Jurisdiction which he asserted was to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished in his Person; and when this should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished the Minds of People would be equally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the receiving Civil or Ecclesiastical Tyranny.</p>

            <p>Mr.<hi>Wesly</hi> at this time repulsed Mrs. <hi>Sophia Williamson,</hi> Neice to Mr. <hi>Causton,</hi> from the Sacrament. This young Lady was by her Friends put under the Ghostly Care of Mr. <hi>Wesly,</hi> who was pleased to make Proposals of Marriage to her: These she always rejected; and in some little time married Mr. <hi>William Williamson</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah,</hi> much contrary to Mr. <hi>Wesly's</hi> Inclinations: After the said Marriage Mr. <hi>Wesly</hi> used all Means to create a Misunderstanding betwixt Mrs. <hi>Williamson</hi> and her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, by persuading her, that Mr. <hi>Williamson</hi> had no Right to regulate her Behaviour as to conversing with him, or attending Meetings as formerly; but at last finding he could gain nothing upon her, and that Mr. <hi>Williamson</hi> had forbid him any conversation with his Wife out of his Presence; he took the foresaid Means, by repelling her from the Holy communion, of shewing his Resentment. Mr. <hi>Williamson</hi> thought himself well founded in an Action of Damages; and Mr. WESLY (being no longer supported by Mr. Causton, Who was highly nettled at the Affront put upon his Neice, and could now declaim as fluently against spiritual Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as any Person) was indicated before a GRAND JURY of <hi>Forty four</hi> Freeholders, and <hi>Thirteen</hi> Indictments were found against him; <hi>one</hi> concerned <hi>Mr. Williamson</hi> and his Spouse; the others concerning the Grievances we felt by his Measures, and the Exercise of his Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Functions, as above related: These last were given into the Magistrates, to be by them laid before the Trustees, that these our Grievances might in time co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming be properly redressed, (we having no other juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, either Civil or Ecclesiastical, that we could make Application to:) Then the Grand Jury began to

consider and think, that as it was not probable a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Number of the <hi>better Sort</hi> of People could ever be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally met together; so this was a fit Time to represent their Grievances and Hardships to the Trustees: which they did in the following Manner.</p>

                        <head>An Abstract of the Representation of the Grand Jury of SAVANNAH to the Honourable the Trustees.</head>
                        <p>We the Grand Jury duly sworn on the 22<hi>d</hi> of the last Month, and having divers Matters laid before us, which we humbly conceive cannot proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be presented to this Court, because several of the said Matters touch the Proceedings of the Magistrates of the said Court, and contain sundry Articles, setting forth many publick Necessities and Hardships, which can only be remedied by your Honours Authority: <hi>THEREFORE,</hi> We the said Grand Jury having exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined several Witnesses, do, upon our Oaths, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to your Honours the following <hi>Grievances, Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships</hi> and <hi>Necessities.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That as the Inhabitants of this Town and County have been and are still subject to many Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, for Want of a Body of the Laws and Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Province; it being exceeding difficult in many cases, both for Grand and Petit Juries, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge in a proper manner the great Duties that are incumbent on them by their Oaths; so we hope your Honours will assist us, that we may be enabled well and truly to execute our Duties as aforesaid.</p>
                        <p>That <hi>Thomas Causton,</hi> by his <hi>arbitrary</hi> Proceedings, hath endeavoured to render the Power and Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Grand Juries ineffectual, especially this Grand Jury, by intruding upon it when inclosed and about Business, and using the Members thereof with great Haughtiness and Ill-nature, and threatning to dissolve them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="45" facs="unknown:004817_0063_0F5ED9C10E9287A0"/>
That the said <hi>Thomas Causton,</hi> by his Office of Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, hath the dangerous Power in his Hands of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring weak minded People to comply with unjust Measures; and also over-awing others from making just Complaints and Representations to your Honours; and the known <hi>Implacability</hi> of the said <hi>Causton</hi> and his frequent <hi>threatning</hi> of such People, is to many weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded tho' well-disposed Persons, a strong Bulwark against their seeking Redress, by making proper Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and just Representations to You their <hi>Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Patrons</hi> and <hi>Protectors.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That the said <hi>Causton</hi> has made great Advancements on Provisions and Goods sold out of the Trustees Store to the Inhabitants, contrary to Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe's</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise when he first settled this Colony, and contrary, as we apprehend, to your Honours good Intentions, and greatly detrimental to the Prosperity of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and that he hath refused to pay the Publick Debts otherwise than in Provisions at those dear Rates, and sometimes bad and unwholsome, out of the Publick Store, whereby the Inhabitants were <hi>greatly</hi> distressed, and some have been obliged to leave the Province.</p>
                        <p>That whereas one <hi>John White,</hi> who had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for Felony, at the Suit of <hi>William Aglionby,</hi> and he the said <hi>Aglionby</hi> was bound to prosecute the same at next Court: Notwithstanding he the said <hi>white</hi> was removed before that time by a Warrant under the Hand and Seal of <hi>Thomas Christie,</hi> and as we think, by the Advice and Command of <hi>Thomas Causton;</hi> by which means we imagine the Criminal has escaped Justice, to the great Encouragement of enormous Offenders, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as we conceive, to the Laws of our Country, the Peace of our Sovereign Lord the King, his Crown and Dignity, and particularly to the Welfare of this your Colony.</p>
                        <p>That the said <hi>Causton,</hi> did greatly discourage the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this Town and County, in the Measures
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:004817_0064_0F5ED9C1A313D7D8"/>
they had taken for the Defence and Safety of this Place in the late Alarm from the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> for altho' almost every Body, Masters and Servants, labour'd continually in making a Fort to defend themselves, in case of Necessity; yet he the said <hi>Causton</hi> never came nigh the Work, but by his Words and Behaviour did all he could to prevent <hi>it;</hi> until at last the People were obliged to leave off the Work unfinished, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Welfare and Safety of this Colony.</p>
                        <p>That the said <hi>Causton</hi> hath greatly prevented and discouraged the <hi>Cultivation</hi> of <hi>Lands,</hi> by his hindring People to settle on the Tracts that were allotted to them by the Trustees; whereby several People have been greatly distressed, and some almost ruin'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary (as we humbly conceive) to your Honours good Intention, and the principal Part of your glorious Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</p>
                        <p>That the said <hi>Thomas Causton,</hi> in order to colour his illegal Proceedings, hath uttered Words to this or the like Purpose, <hi>we do not stand upon our Feet; we do not know either our Laws or Liberties, nor what the Trustees intend; a Magistrate cannot act to strict Forms, but may dismiss Matters of Petty Felony in the easiest Manner;</hi> thereby claiming to himself (as we humbly conceive) a dispending Power, fatal to the Liberties of <hi>British</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and contrary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Want of <hi>Publick Roads</hi> hath been greatly detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to many who have Settlements at any Distance from this Place; and some have lost, and are still liable to lose a great part of their Crops, through the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of passing to and from their Plantations.</p>
                        <p>That the great Want of <hi>Servants</hi> in this Town and Country, doth render the Freeholders thereof inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of proceeding with proper Vigour in the Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating their Lands; and as the Honourable <hi>James Oglethorpe,</hi> 
                           <abbr>Esq</abbr> did generously promise, that your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours would be pleas'd to give this Colony continual
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:004817_0065_0F5ED9C263BA31C8"/>
Assistance, by sending over Servants to the said Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders at reasonable Rates: <hi>Therefore,</hi> we do, with all Humility, lay before your Honours the great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Want of Servants in this Town and Country; not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>oubting your timely Assistance therein.</p>
                        <p>That the Town of <hi>Savannah</hi> stands in the utmost Need of having a good Wharff and Crane, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of both Strangers and Inhabitants, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>double</hi> Pains and Costs in landing and getting their Goods up the Bluff.</p>
                        <p>That the Light-House of <hi>Tybee,</hi> which with great Labour and, as we humbly conceive, vast Expence to your Honours, remains unfinish'd and uncover'd; by reason of which, that most necessary and lofty Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is subject to all the Injuries of Weather, and may totally decay if not in time prevented, which will be greatly detrimental to the Trade, Navigation and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of this Colony.</p>
                        <p>That the Inhabitants of this Town and County are at vast Expence in time of Sickness, especially they who have most Servants; it being a general Misfortune, that during the <hi>hot</hi> Season of the Year, hardly one half of the Servants are able to do their Masters any Work, by reason of the <hi>violent</hi> Sicknesses; which hath very much prevented the Inhabitants from making Improvements.</p>
                        <p>It is without the least personal Resentment to Mr. <hi>Causton,</hi> or any other person, that we do, with the most profound Respect and Duty, lay before your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours the foregoing <hi>Grievances, Hardships</hi> and <hi>Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> and it is not the Persons or personal Infirmities of any of the Magistrates we blame; but such of their Actions and Words as, we humbly conceive, tend to the Subversion of our Laws and Liberties; and we are firmly persuaded, that Mr. <hi>Causton</hi> would not have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pannelled <hi>this</hi> Grand Jury, on an Affair that so nearly concerned him as that of his Niece's did, if he had not believed the several Persons of this Grand Jury, to be
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:004817_0066_0F5ED9C31FA98F70"/>
Men of strict Integrity, and no way prejudiced against him; and as we the said Grand Jury are, for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, appointed for the solemn Representation of Truth, we humbly hope your Honours will consider <hi>this</hi> our <hi>Representation,</hi> as proceeding from a strict impartial and found Enquiry.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In Witness,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>this first Day of September, 1737.</hi>

            <p>The Original of this was signed by all the <hi>Forty four,</hi> and sent home; but was taken no notice of by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

stees for any thing ever we heard; and we hope it will appear evident to every judicious Reader, that his Jury was neither <hi>byassed</hi> nor <hi>intimidated</hi> by <hi>Causton,</hi> to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of any Person whatsoever, as Mr. <hi>Wesly</hi> asserts in his Journal printed at Bristol, 1739. He likewise says, <hi>there were a professed Atheist and Deist in the Number;</hi> but for our Parts we know of neither: But a Man of Mr. <hi>Wesly's</hi> Principles, who makes no Scruple of writing wilful Falshoods (as may be seen by any Body that compares <hi>this Narrative</hi> with <hi>his Journal)</hi> and of damning every Person of a contrary Opinion with himself, may, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> Hesitation, give People what Appellations come in his Head: However this put an End to any further Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of Mr. <hi>Wesly's</hi> Schemes; for soon after this, he departed the Colony privately by Night, and went to <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> and from thence to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wesly</hi> had Address enough (as he says in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Journal) to persuade several Persons who were Members of the Grand Jury, to retract (by some Paper which he drew up for them to sign) their former Sentiments; but this, it is was at all, proceeded entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the solemn Assurances which he gave them, <hi>that his main Design home was to represent the Grievances and Oppressions which the poor Colony laboured under;</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Account was charged with divers Letters and Papers from private Persons, relating to the Colony; which he undertook faithfully to deliver: But as we
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:004817_0067_0F5ED9C3DC919170"/>
have since found, that all Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe's</hi> Interest was employed to protect Mr.<hi>Wesly,</hi> it is no Wonder those Promises were never fulfilled; nor indeed could it ever be ascertained that even the private Letters which he carried were so much as delivered.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand Mr.<hi>Causton</hi> ever after bore a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Hatred to the Members of this Grand Jury, and took every Opportunity to shew his Resentment; and we doubt not but he prevailed upon <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> of them to make a Recantation, having either terrified or starv'd them into a Compliance: But we bore these Things the more patiently, as being satisfied the Trustees were Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who had our Interest at Heart, and who would hear and redress our Grievances in due Time, and that Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> might still be a Friends to the Colony; but at last we heard <hi>He</hi> had procured a Regiment for its Defence, of which he was made Colonel, and that <hi>He</hi> was likewise made General and Commander in chief over all his Majesty's Forces in <hi>South-Carolina</hi> and <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia.</hi> This News was confirmed by <hi>William Stephens,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> who was sent over as Trustees Secretary, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the State and Condition of the Colony as it really was, and to assist and consult with the Magistrates: But Mr. <hi>Causton</hi> soon found the Means to bring over the old Gentleman to his Interest, or at least to <hi>acquiesce</hi> in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thing he said or did; for he had still the Command of the Cash and Stores, and Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> had nothing to live upon but his Salary, which he could stop the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of at Pleasure; so our Secretary remained passive until <hi>Causton's</hi> Government ended.</p>
            <p>At last Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> comes over for the <hi>third</hi> time, in <hi>September</hi> with the Remainder of his Regiment, the other Part having come with Colonel <hi>Cochran</hi> in <hi>May;</hi> but alas! this Regiment was of no Service, otherwise than to strengthen us in case of an Attack; for we could neither furnish them in Cloaths, Provisions, nor any one Thing they wanted: And to put us out of all Hopes of
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:004817_0068_0F5ED9C49CC7EF68"/>
bettering our Condition, Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> was pleased to declare in the Court-house of <hi>Savannah That as long as he had any thing to do with the colony, there should neither be Allowance of Negroes, nor Alteration in the Titles of Land; and if any such thing should happen, he would have no farther Concern with it.</hi> The People thus seeing there was no Hope of Redress, left the Colony daily; and the Trustees Credit receiving a great Shock by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing Mr. <hi>Causton's</hi> certified Accounts, and an entire Stop being put to the publick Store, many poor Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches died of Hunger; for at this Time Mr. <hi>Causton</hi> was turned out of all his Places, and the Store was ordered to be sold, in order, as was said, to pay off the Trustees Debts. One <hi>Thomas Jones,</hi> a Favourite of Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe,</hi> whose Character we shall have Occasion to give after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, was put in his Place as Cash and Store-keeper, only with a different Title, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that of <hi>Magazine-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> for none but the Trustees Servants were to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied from it: But the contrary soon appeared; for the <hi>Sola Bills</hi> that were sent over were ordered to be issued out in the Names of <hi>William Stephens,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> Mr. <hi>Thomas Christie</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas Jones,</hi> or any <hi>two</hi> of them; but the other <hi>two</hi> agreeing together entirely excluded <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,</hi> and paid them to whom, and
for what purpose they thought convenient: They bought <hi>New-York</hi> Cargoes, and any other Commodities that could be got in Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, and put them into the Magazine, where they were sold out by <hi>Jones</hi> in Wholesale and Retail for ready Money, at <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xorlitant</hi> Rates. This Trade they have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on ever since to their vast Advantage, but to the no small Distress of the poor People, who are obliged to give at the Rate almost of <hi>cent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Per cent.</hi> for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions. Thus, under the Colour of <hi>no Store,</hi> these <hi>two</hi> keep as open a one as ever <hi>Causton</hi> did; and by having the publick Money at their Disposal, the Payment of all Salaries and Pensions coming through their Hands, they are become as <hi>absolute;</hi> with this Difference, that Mr.
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:004817_0069_0F5ED9C59FEE7BF8"/>
               <hi>Causton's</hi> Power in every Respect extended over the whole Colony, when it was most populous and Money most plenty; but <hi>theirs</hi> seems only to affect the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Remains of <hi>Savannah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We might have imagined that the Trustees were somewhat moved with our <hi>repeated</hi> Complaints, and that Mr. <hi>Causton's</hi> Removal was owing thereto; but alas! in this we were mistaken; nothing (as ever we could understand) was laid to his Charge on our Account; and it was of small Benefit to us whether the Misma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Money, which was the Reason of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, lies at his or Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe's</hi> Door: And we <hi>cannot but</hi> here take notice, that Mr. <hi>Causton's</hi> Cafe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies the common Observation, <hi>That those who prostitute themselves to carry on illegal and oppressive Schemes, when they have once stack in the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re, they are forsaken by their Employers, and despised by all the World besides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> staid not long at <hi>Savannah,</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Residence being at <hi>Frederica,</hi> where they had, in Imitation of us, built a few Houses, and cleared some Land; but finding Planting not answer, they left it off, and as soon as the Regiment came, almost every Body betook themselves to the keeping publick Houses; and in this Manner do the few that now remain live.</p>
            <p>All the publick Work being put a Stop to, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Land being found impracticable, by which most of us had ruined ourselves, we were in a miserable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and all Hope from Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> being at an End, we could hardly tell <hi>what to do:</hi> But still think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Trustees might be ignorant or misinformed of the present Condition of the Colony, we at last resolved to set forth our Grievances in a short and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Representation,</hi> to be signed by all the Freeholders in the Colony, of which the following is an exact Copy.</p>

The Land then, according to the present Constitution, not being capable to maintain the Settlers here, they must una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably have Recourse to, and depend upon Trade; but to our <hi>woful</hi> Experience likewise, the same Causes that prevented the <hi>first</hi> obstruct the <hi>latter;</hi> for tho' the Situation of this Place is exceeding well adapted for Trade, and, if it was encouraged, might be much more improved by the Inhabitants, yet the Difficulties and Restrictions which we <hi>hitherto have,</hi> and <hi>at present do</hi> labour under, debar us of that Advantage. Timber is the only Thing we have here which we might export, and notwithstanding we are obliged to fell it in planting our Land, yet we cannot manufacture it for a foreign Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket but at double the Expence of other Colonies: As for Instance, the <hi>River of May,</hi> which is but <hi>twenty</hi> Miles from us, with the Allowance of Negroes, load Vessels with that Commodity at one half of the Price that we can do; and what should induce Persons to bring Ships here, when they can be loaded with one Half of the Expence so near us? Therefore the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber on the Land is only a continual Charge to the Possessors of it, tho' of very great Advantage in all the Northern Colonies where Negroes are allowed, and consequently Labour cheap. We do not in the least doubt but that in time <hi>Silk</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> may be produced here, especially the former; but since the Cultivation of Land with white Servants only cannot raise Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

according to the <hi>present</hi> Constitution. It is very well known that <hi>Carolina</hi> can raise every thing that his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony can, and they having their Labour so much cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, will always ruin our Market, unless we were in some Measure on a Footing with them; and as in <hi>both</hi> the Land is worn out in <hi>four</hi> or <hi>five</hi> Years, and then fit for nothing but Pasture, we must be always at a great deal more Expence than they in clearing new Land for Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The <hi>Importation</hi> of the Necessaries of Life come to us at the most <hi>extravagant</hi> Rate, Merchants in general, especially of <hi>England,</hi> not being willing to supply the Settlers here with Goods upon Commission, because no Person here can make them any Security of their Lands or Improvements, as is very often practised in other Places to promote Trade, when some of the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Money is laid out in necessary Buildings and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements fitting for the Trade intended, without which it cannot be carried on: The Benefit of Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <hi>therefore</hi> is all to <hi>transient</hi> Persons, who do not lay out any Money amongst us, but on the contrary carry every Penny out of the Place; and their chief Reason for enhancing the Price is because they cannot get any Goods here either on Freight or Purchase for another Market: If the Advantage accruing from Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation centred in the Inhabitants, the Profit thereof would naturally circulate amongst us, and be laid out in Improvements in the Colony. Your Honours, we imagine, are not insensible of the Numbers that have left this Province, not being able to support themselves and Families any longer; and those still remaining, who had Money of their own and Credit with their Friends, have laid out most of the <hi>former</hi> in Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and lost the <hi>latter</hi> for doing it on such pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

It is true his Majesty has been graciously pleased to grant a Regiment for the Defence of this Province and our neighbouring Colony, which indeed will very much assist us in defending ourselves against all Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but otherwise does not in the least contribute to our Support; for all that part of their Pay which is expended here is laid out with transient People, and our Neighbours in <hi>Carolina,</hi> who are capable to supply them with Provisions and other Necessaries at a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Price, which we, as before observed, are not at all capable to do upon the present Establishment. This then being our present Condition, it is obvious what the Consequences must be.</p>
                  <p>But we for our Parts have entirely relied on, and confided in your good Intentions, believing you would redress any Grievances that should appear; and now by our long Experience, from Industry and continual Application to Improvement of Land here, do find it impossible pursue it, or even to subsist ourselves any longer, according to the <hi>present</hi> Nature of the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; and likewise believing you will agree to those Measures that are found from Experience capable to make this Colony succeed, and to promote which we have consumed our Money, Time and Labour; we do, from a sincere Regard to its Welfare, and in Duty both to you and ourselves, beg leave to lay before your immediate Consideration the <hi>Two</hi> following chief Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of these our <hi>present</hi> Misfortunes, and this <hi>deplorable</hi> State of the Colony, and which, we are certain, if granted, would be an infallible Remedy for <hi>both</hi>

We are very sensible of the Inconveniencies and Mischiefs that have already, and do daily arise from an unlimited Use of Negroes, but we are as sensible that these may be prevented by a due Limitation, such as so many; to each white Man, or so many to such a Quantity of Land, or in any other Manner which your Honours shall think most proper.</p>

And as for Persons who, from selfish Views, have imposed upon the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of the Honourable Trustees, by representing Things in Colours distant from Truth, it were super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous to curse them.

Trustees for remedying <hi>this</hi> Inconvenience, I know not; <hi>One</hi> only occurs to me, which is, the <hi>Admitting</hi> a certain Number of Negroes, sufficient to ease the white Servants from <hi>those</hi> Labours that are most fatal to a <hi>British Constitution:</hi> I am very sensible of the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of an <hi>unlimited</hi> Use of them in a Frontier Colony; but am as sensible, that <hi>those</hi> Inconveniences may be prevented by prudent <hi>Regulations;</hi> and their Admission for executing the more laborious Parts of Culture made the Means to <hi>attract</hi> Numbers of white Servants, who would otherwise fly the Place as a <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory</hi> or <hi>Charnel-House.</hi> If our Labour and Toil is not capable of producing mere Necessaries by <hi>Cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Land,</hi> much less by <hi>Trade:</hi> For as all the neighbouring Colonies, by reason of their Negroes, prosecute all Branches of it at a <hi>sixth</hi> Part of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence we can, they would for ever preclude us of any Benefit therefrom. And supporting what cannot, be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that the Nation would consent to give a <hi>prepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> Fund for making up <hi>all those</hi> Deficiencies, What Benefit could ever accrue to the Nation? or What to the Settlers but a present bare Sustenance? and What the certain Consequence but the bequeathing a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Legacy of Orphans to the Care of Providence, since no Period of Time can be affixed when such a Support would enable us to provide for ourselves?

                  <p>Hence it is clear, we can insist on demanding our Privileges as <hi>British Subjects</hi> from the Trustees Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; but we likewise claim them as<hi>Law, justice</hi> and <hi>Property.</hi> Your Excellency was pleased, in the Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>House of <hi>Savannah,</hi> to use a Comparison to satisfy the Minds of the People, of <hi>a Man who would lend his Horse but not his Saddle, which one refusing, another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of:</hi> This, I humbly take it, no ways meets the Case; the King's Majesty was Owner both of <hi>Horse</hi> and <hi>saddle,</hi> of <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Rights,</hi> and gave us both in his <hi>charter;</hi> we ask but what is <hi>there</hi> given us.

for <hi>Moorfields</hi> than <hi>Georgia.</hi> I must notice further, That not only are Parents incapable, for <hi>want of Credit,</hi> to provide for themselves, being necessitated to dispose of their Servants for want of Provisions; but if they could, only their eldest Son could reap the Benefit, their younger Children, however numerous, are left to be fed by Him who <hi>feeds the Ravens;</hi> and if they have no Children, their Labour and Substance descends to Strangers: How, <hi>sir,</hi> could you, or indeed any <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born</hi> Spirit, brook such a Tenor? Are not our young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Children and Daughters equally <hi>entitled</hi> to our Bowels and Affections? And does human Nature end with our First-born, and not extend itself to the rest of our Progeny and more distant Relations? And is it not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Order of Nature,<hi>that</hi> the eldest Son should not only enjoy a double Portion, but exclude all the younger Children? and having an Interest <hi>independant</hi> of the Parents, how natural is it he should withdraw that Obedience and Subjection which proceeds from <hi>paternal</hi> Authority and <hi>filial</hi> Dependance! The Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stees are but a Channel to convey to us the King's Rights, and <hi>cannot</hi> in Law or Equity, and, I dare say, <hi>will not</hi> abridge those Rights.

In all Places where Settlements were attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>English</hi> and found untenable, the Settlers were taken home upon publick Charge, their Losses recompensed, and they made otherwise useful to the Community; while we are neither allowed to do for ourselves here or elsewhere. As to the <hi>second</hi> Point, how the NATION would be affected by <hi>it,</hi> it is first obvious, that all the noble <hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Advantages</hi> they proposed are lost, and Sums of Money expended to no Purpose but to inform the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> of the Importance of a Pass which they would not fail to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess. It were impossible to make a <hi>second Settlement</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>present Plan,</hi> and if it is to be <hi>altered</hi> in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of others, why not of us who have risqued and spent our <hi>All</hi> in the <hi>Adventure?</hi> How the TRU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STESS may be affected by it in all Respects I shall not say; a <hi>Parliamentary</hi> Enquiry into their Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I no ways question but they could <hi>entirely satisfy;</hi> but all good Men will regret that so honourable a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy should lose <hi>that</hi> Glory and Fame which the Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Success of the Colony would have crowned them with. I have formerly asserted, that only the flourishing State of the Colony can support the MILI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TARY; and indeed without a Colony it were easier to maintain a Garrison in <hi>Tangier</hi> on the Coast of <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> than in the South of <hi>Georgia.</hi> One Regiment would

As to the INDIANS, what could we expect less than being scorned and despised? That <hi>they</hi> should immediately fall in with the tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Proffers of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and so <hi>Great Britain</hi> cut off from that valuable Branch of the <hi>Indian Trade;</hi> for how indeed could they expect <hi>Execution of Treaties</hi> or <hi>Protection</hi> from People who, <hi>without</hi> the Force of any Enemy, could <hi>not</hi> preserve their <hi>own</hi> Schemes of Government from falling to Pieces?

                        <p>THe Trustees for establishing the Colony of <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> have received by the Hands of Mr. <hi>Benjamin Ball of London,</hi> Merchant, an attested Copy of a Representation, signed by you the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and many of the Inhabitants of <hi>Savannah,</hi> on the 9th of <hi>December</hi> last, for altering the Tenure of the Lands, and introducing Negroes into the Province, transmitted from thence by Mr. <hi>Robert Williams.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Trustees are not surprized to find unwary Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple drawn in by crafty Men, to join in a Design of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torting by Clamour</hi> from the Trustees an Alteration in the fundamental Laws, framed for the Preservation of People, from those very Designs.</p>
                        <p>But the Trustees cannot but express their Astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that You the Magistrates, appointed by them to be Guardians of the People by putting those Laws in Execution, should so far forget your Duty, as to put yourselves at the Head of this Attempt.</p>
                        <p>However they direct you to give the Complainants this Answer from the Trustees, That they should deem themselves very unfit for the Trust reposed in them by his Majesty on their Behalf, if they could be prevailed upon, by such an irrational Attempt, to give up a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And the Trustees are the more confirmed in their Opinion of the Unreasonableness of this Demand, that they have received Petitions from the <hi>Darien,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parts of the Province, representing the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Danger which must arise to the good People of the Province from the Introduction of Negroes. And as the Trustees themselves are fully convinced, that, besides the Hazard attending that <hi>Introduction,</hi> it would destroy all Industry among the white Inhabitants; and that by giving them a Power to alien their Lands, the Colony would soon be too like its Neighbours, void of white Inhabitants, filled with Blacks, and reduced to be the Precarious Property of a few, equally expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to domestick Treachery and foreign Invasion; and therefore the Trustees cannot be supposed to be in any Disposition of granting this Request; and if they have not before this signified their Dislike of it, this Delay is to be imputed to no other Motives but the Hopes they had conceived, that Time and Experience would bring the Complainants to a better Mind: And the Trustees readily join Issue with them in their Appeal to Posterity, who shall Judge between them who were their best Friends, <hi>Those</hi> who endeavoured to preserve for them a Property in their Lands, by tying up the Hands of their unthristy Progenitors, or <hi>They</hi> who wanted a Power to mortgage or alien them: Who were the best Friends to the Colony, <hi>Those</hi> who with great Labour and Cost had endeavoured to form a Colony of his Majesty's Subjects, and persecuted <hi>Protestants</hi> from other Parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> had placed them on the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soil, and strove to secure them in their Possessions by those Arts which naturally tend to keep the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny full of useful and industrious People, capable both to cultivate and desend it; or <hi>Those</hi> who, to gratify the greedy and ambitious Views of a few Negroe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, would put it into their Power to become sole owners of the Province, by introducing their baneful

<pb n="74" facs="unknown:004817_0092_0F5ED9D820CACA68"/>
his Sentiments were never so just. And when the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heard that some People justly complained <hi>that the Trustees Commissions were of none effect,</hi> he threatned an armed Force if they refused to comply.</p>

               <abbr>Esq</abbr> Messrs. <hi>Thomas Christie</hi> and <hi>Thomas Jones.</hi> were likewise appointed to inspect into <hi>Causton's</hi> Accounts; but <hi>Christie</hi> was altogether reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the other <hi>two;</hi> nor did they ever do any thing to the Purpose: Indeed <hi>Jones</hi> would sometimes hector and domineer over <hi>Causton,</hi> in as haughty a Manner as ever he had formerly done over the meanest Person in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah.</hi>

            <p>We believe this Paper will perplex most People, who have not throughly studied the Law, to make Sense of it; and as there were no Lawyers in <hi>Georgia,</hi> it would seem as if it had been sent over with no other End, than that it should not be understood; and indeed it rather tended to add to the Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

that was consistent with their knowledge and Conscience:</hi> Then they were dismissed, and the next Day they were to know his Mind; <hi>that</hi> being come, two of his Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries were sent separately with Proposals, which they afterwards wrote in order to be signed, but refused a Copy thereof: These Proposals were to the following Effect, <abbr>

               </abbr> To acknowledge they were in the wrong for having any Hand in the making or signing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation; to ask the General's Pardon for so doing; and to assert that they believed the Colony might flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish according to the <hi>then</hi> present Constitution: These Things complied with, they should have what Money they were pleased to ask for, with Horses, Cattle and every Thing else they wanted, together with the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's perpetual Friendship and Assistance; if not compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, they might expect nothing but his highest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment.

                  <p>WE have received a Letter signed by your Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of the 25th <hi>March</hi> last, owning the Receipt of ours to the Trustees for establishing to Colony of <hi>Georgia,</hi> dated the 26th <hi>May</hi> 1739, in which we set
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:004817_0102_0F5ED7924E361790"/>
forth the Expence we had been at in prosecuting our Settlement on the <hi>Ogeeche</hi> River, together with the Impossibility of carrying on any settlement with suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in this Colony according to the present Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as an additional Confirmation of which we then presented your Honours With an Account current, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on from the Commencement of our Settlement on the <hi>Ogeeche,</hi> and continued till we were drove thence by the strongest Appearances of Destruction, arising from the having expended our <hi>All</hi> in the strenuous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of an impracticable Scheme: And here we must beg leave to observe, That it appears to us you have neither considered our Letter or Account, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise you never would have advised us to return to a Place on which we have already in vain consumed so much Time and Money.</p>
                  <p>We have seen and seriously considered every Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph of a printed Paper, entituled, <hi>The Answer of the Trustees for establishing the Colony of</hi> Georgia <hi>in</hi> America, <hi>to the Representation from the Inhabitants of</hi> Savannah; which, in our humble Opinion, is <hi>no Answer at all,</hi> but rather an <hi>absolute</hi> Refusal of Demands to which we are legally entitled, under the specious Pretences of Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianship and fatherly Care, without having answered <hi>one</hi> Sentence, or confuted by Strength of Argument <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> Part of our Assertions.</p>
                  <p>Because our neighbouring Province (of which you are pleased to take notice) has by an introduction of <hi>too</hi> great Numbers abused the Use of Negroes; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause an undoubted Property in out Land-Possessions might prove detrimental or hurtful to idle, profligate or abandon'd People; it does not at all follow that we should be debarred the Use of Negroes for the Field, or the more laborious Parts of Culture, under prudent Limitations; or that sober and virtuous Men Should be deprived of just Titles to their Properties.</p>
                  <p>We are surprized that your Honours mention the
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:004817_0103_0F5ED7948BDFFA60"/>
Representations of the People of the <hi>Darien,</hi> as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Unreasonableness of our Demands: For did your Honours know the Motives by which these People were induced to present you with one or more Petitions contradictory to our Representation, the Welfare of the Colony and their own Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we are petswaded you never would have offered them as Reasons for rejecting the Representation from <hi>Savannah.</hi> They were bought with a Number of Cattle, and extensive Promises of future Rewards; a little <hi>present</hi> Interest made them forget or neglect their <hi>Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> whereas the People of this Place, duly sensible of the Miseries and Calamities they have suffered, and do still labour under, <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>voluntarily</hi> put their Hands to the Representation of this Part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince: No <hi>artful</hi> Means were used to induce them to it; no <hi>artful</hi> Man or Men, Negro-Merchants or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, perswaded them to its: <hi>Dismal</hi> Poverty and the most <hi>absolute</hi> Oppression were the <hi>true</hi> Fountains from whence our Complaints proceeded. But how mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably were these <hi>inconsiderate</hi> deluded Wretches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded? They were soon after carried against <hi>St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> placed on a dangerous Post, where they were all or most of them cut off or taken Prisoners by the Enemy, which has put a Period to the Settlement of <hi>Darien,</hi> of which so many great Things have been fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reported.</p>
                  <p>With regard to our <hi>Representation,</hi> we shall only beg leave to make one Supposition, which it is almost impossible can have happened, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> That this and all the other <hi>Representations, Letters, Suits</hi> or <hi>Petitions,</hi> made to the Trustees by private or a joint Number of Persons, have been entirely false and groundless: What can have reduced the Colony to the <hi>Situation</hi> in which it now is? What can have reduced its Inhabitants to <hi>one sixth Part</hi> of the Number which we have known to reside here? Or, <hi>lastly,</hi> to what is the starving and

despicable <hi>Condition</hi> of the few are now left ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Is it not, as well as every other Matter which we have before urged, owing to, and occasioned by the unanswerable Reasons at different Times given and laid before your Honours, by honest Men (indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of you) who were and are the chief Sufferers in this Colony, and who could not be <hi>bribed</hi> to conceal, or <hi>terrified</hi> from declaring their Sentiments?</p>
                  <p> Your Honours may readily and safely join Issue with us in our Appeal to Posterity, <hi>who were their best</hi>

                  <p> We have likewise seen and read the Alterations Mr. <hi>Martyn</hi> mentions to have been made by your Honours with regard to the <hi>Tenure of</hi> Lands, together with a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitious Abridgment of the same affixed to the most publick Places at <hi>Savannah</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> Mr. <hi>Martyn</hi> in his Letter is pleased to tell us, <hi>That your Honours imagine we are satisfied therewith, as the rest of the Colony are.</hi> Some few perhaps may have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed themselves satisfied; but we will say no worse of such few, than that your Honours will soon be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that even <hi>they</hi> are Deceivers. It is true such <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations,</hi> and the Paper entituled, <hi>An Answer to our Representation</hi> above mentioned, are artfully penn'd, and will doubtless for a Time amuse even Men of the best Sense in <hi>Europe,</hi> or elsewhere, who are Strangers to the Colony of <hi>Georgia;</hi> but any Man of common Understanding, or the least Penetration, who by an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate</hi> Experience has been well acquainted with <hi>that</hi> Colony, can easily demonstrate that those very Papers are further Snares to increase our Miseries, as it is

im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible we can be enabled by these <hi>Alterations</hi> to subsist ourselves and Families any more than before, far less to put us in Capacity of recovering our already sunk Fortunes and Loss of Time. Some time in the Summer 1739, (whilst we still expected agreeable Alterations to have succeeded <hi>our Representation</hi>) we applied more than once to General <hi>Oglethorpe,</hi> as one of the Trustees, for the same Tract of Land which we have since been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused by your Honours; but our Petitions and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations were rejected; and for what Reason? because indeed we refused to <hi>contradict</hi> what we had before set forth in our <hi>Representation,</hi> and so become Villains, as, we have too much Reason to believe, some others on the same Occasion were: We would not accept of <hi>Settlements, Sums of Money, Horses, Cattle</hi> and <hi>other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Considerations,</hi> at the Expence of <hi>betraying our Country</hi> and <hi>contradicting our Consciences,</hi> by signing a Paper, which was prepared and offered to us, purport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Repentance of the Measures</hi> we had taken for our own and the Relief of other distressed <hi>British</hi> Subjects; and consequently an <hi>Approbation</hi> of a Scheme, which, by all Appearance, seems to have been calculated and prepared to form a Colony of Vassals, whole <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> were at <hi>all times</hi> to have been dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of at the Discretion or Option of their superiors.</p>
                  <p>Such and many other <hi>Methods of Corruption</hi> have been <hi>too often</hi> practised in this Colony; but we refused and scorned such Actions, from Principles of which every honest Man ought to be possessed.</p>
                  <p>We are not surprized to find, that we have in vain applied to your Honours in several Affairs, when we see you have been hitherto prepossessed by a Gentleman of superior Interest, with Informations and Assertions full of <hi>Resentment,</hi> and which we well kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>We are sensible of the Freedoms which have been used with our respective Characters in the <hi>Misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> sent your Honours by <hi>partial</hi> Men; nor are we less sensible that the Majority of the Trustees have been kept in the dark with regard to our <hi>just Complaints</hi> and <hi>Representations,</hi> or that such <hi>Complaints</hi> have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to them in Lights <hi>distant from Truth,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that we have Reason to believe <hi>two Thirds</hi> of the honourable Board are either misinformed of, or are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Strangers to the barbarous and destructive Schemes carried on in this miserable Colony.</p>
                  <p>We hope it will ere long appear to your Honours and the World, (whatever has been advanced to the contrary) that we are <hi>honest</hi> Men, free from any <hi>base</hi> Design, free from any <hi>mutinous</hi> Spirit, who have only <hi>stood firm</hi> for the Recovery of our <hi>lost Privileges,</hi> which have been secretly and under the most specious Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces withdrawn from us by some <hi>designing</hi> and <hi>self-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested</hi> Men.</p>

                  <p>Far be it from us in any Shape to reflect in general on the honourable Board, who we still believe are Gentlemen of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Reputation,</hi> who would not be accessory to any <hi>sinister</hi> or <hi>base</hi> Designs; but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help thinking that they are deluded, and brought to pursue Measures inconsistent with the Welfare and Prosperity of the Colony, by <hi>some</hi> who of the <hi>whole</hi> Corporation are only acquainted with the particular Situation of it, and who must therefore wilfully, and from Design, from and prepare destructive Schemes for the perishing Inhabitants of <hi>Georgia,</hi> and, by <hi>unfair</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations of Persons and Things, draw the <hi>Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the greater Part of the honourable Board to such Measures for the <hi>Oppression</hi> of his Majesty's Subjects, which they would, if they were impartially informed, scorn to think of, far less agree to.</p>
                  <p>General <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> with all his Forces has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to raise the Siege of <hi>St. Augustine,</hi> and we have Reason to believe the impending Ruin of this Colony will be thereby determined; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced, the General's Army harrassed and weakned, and the <hi>Indians</hi> provoked and discontented; so that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Thing <hi>looks</hi> with the <hi>most dismal</hi> Aspect.

            <p>About the latter End of <hi>May</hi> 1740, Mr. <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> set out with his Regiment for <hi>Florida,</hi> and soon after the <hi>Carolina</hi> Forces, consisting of about <hi>Six hundred</hi> Men, joined him, with about <hi>Three hundred Indians,</hi> and <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Highlanders</hi> Volunteers from <hi>Darien,</hi> who were buoyed up by the General with the mighty Hopes of Reward, besides several Stragglers and Boatmen from other Parts of the Province and elsewhere; so that, exclusive of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Men of War,</hi> there might be about <hi>Fifteen hundred</hi> effective Men assisting at the Siege, as it was called, of the Castle of <hi>St. Augustine.</hi> But we shall take no further Notice of this Affair, than as it has affected or may still affect the Colony of <hi>Georgia:</hi> The Place being alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the <hi>Highlanders,</hi> with some others, making in all <hi>One hundred and forty one Men,</hi> were posted at <hi>Musa,</hi> (this was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

attacked by a Superior Force of the Enemy, and a miserable Slaughter ensued, scarcely <hi>one Third</hi> of the Number escaping, the others being either killed or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Prisoners. Thus these poor People, who, at the Expence of their Consciences, signed a Representation contrary to their own Interest and Experience, and gave themselves entirely up to the General's Service, by their Deaths at once freed his Excellency from his Debts and Promises, and put an End to the Settlement of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien;</hi> for there are now in that Place not <hi>one Quarter</hi> Part of the Number who settled there at first, and <hi>that</hi> is made up chiefly of Women and Children; and a Scout-Boat is stationed before the Town to Prevent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them from going off.</p>
            <p>This Siege was raised about the Beginning of <hi>July;</hi> the General with the Remainder of his Regiment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Frederica;</hi> the <hi>Carolina</hi> Forces were shipped off for that Province; the few <hi>Georgians</hi> that were left repaired, as soon as they were allowed, to their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Homes in a miserable Condition; and the <hi>Indians</hi> marched towards their respective Countries, very much weakned and discontented; the <hi>Cherokees</hi> returned, as they came, by <hi>Savannah,</hi> and of <hi>One hundred and ten</hi> healthy Men only about <hi>Twenty</hi> got to their Nation, the rest either perished by Sickness or were slain: And thus ended the Campaign in <hi>Florida.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During these Transactions <hi>Savannah</hi> decayed apace; and in <hi>August</hi> and <hi>September</hi> the same Year People went away by <hi>Twenties</hi> in a Vessel, insomuch that one would have thought the Place must have been entirely forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; for in these <hi>two</hi> Months about <hi>One hundred</hi> Souls out of the County of <hi>Savannah</hi> left the Colony; many others have since left it, and, we believe, more will leave it very soon.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>GEORGIA</hi> lies in the 30 and 31 Degrees of North Latitude: The <hi>Air</hi> generally clear, the <hi>Rains</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much shorter as well as heavier than in <hi>England;</hi> the <hi>Dews</hi> are very great; <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightning</hi> are expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almost every Day in <hi>May, June, July,</hi> and <hi>August;</hi> they are very terrible, especially to a Stranger: During those Months, from <hi>Ten</hi> in the Morning to <hi>Four</hi> in the Afternoon, the <hi>Sun</hi> is extremely scorching; but the <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breeze</hi> sometimes blows from <hi>Ten</hi> till <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Four:</hi> The <hi>Winter</hi> is nearly of the same Length as in <hi>England;</hi> but the <hi>Mid-day Sun</hi> is always warm, even when the <hi>Mornings</hi> and <hi>Evenings</hi> are very sharp, and the <hi>Nights</hi> piercing cold.</p>

               <pb n="101" facs="unknown:004817_0111_0F5ED79A82F86BF8"/>
The Land is of <hi>Four</hi> Sorts, <hi>Pine-Barren, Oak-Land, Swamp</hi> and <hi>Marsh.</hi> The <hi>Pine</hi> Land is of far the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Extent, especially near the Sea-Coasts: The <hi>Soil</hi> of this is a dry whitish Sand, producing Shrubs of several Sorts, and between them a harsh coarse kind of Grass, which Cattle do not love to feed upon; but here and there is a little of a better kind, especially in the <hi>Savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> so they call the low watry Meadows which are usually intermixed with Pine Lands: It bears naturally <hi>two</hi> Sorts of Fruit, <hi>Hurtle-Berries</hi> much like those in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Chinquopin-Nuts,</hi> a dry Nut about the Size of a small Acorn: A labo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ious Man may in <hi>one</hi> Year clear and plant <hi>four</hi> or <hi>five</hi> Acres of this Land: It will produce the <hi>first</hi> Year from <hi>two</hi> to <hi>four</hi> Bushels of <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Corn,</hi> and from <hi>four</hi> to <hi>eight</hi> of <hi>Indian Pease per Acre;</hi> the <hi>second</hi> Year it usually bears much about the same; the <hi>third</hi> less; the <hi>fourth</hi> little or nothing. <hi>Peaches</hi> it bears well; likewise the <hi>White Mulberry,</hi> which serves to feed the Silk-Worms; the Black is about the Size of a <hi>Black Cherry,</hi> and has much the same Flavour.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Oak-Land</hi> commonly lies in narrow Streaks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Pine-Lands</hi> and <hi>Swamps, Creeks</hi> or <hi>Rivers:</hi> The <hi>Soil</hi> is a blackish sand, producing several Kinds of <hi>Oak, Bay, Laurel, Ash, Walnut, Sumach</hi> and <hi>Gum</hi> Trees, a sort of <hi>Sycamore Dog</hi> Trees and <hi>Hickory:</hi> In the Choicest Part of this Land grow <hi>Parsimon</hi> Trees, and a few <hi>Black Mulberry</hi> and <hi>American Cherry</hi> Trees: The Common <hi>wild Grapes</hi> are of <hi>two</hi> Sorts, both red; the <hi>Fox-Grape</hi> grow two or three only on a Stalk, is thick-Skin'd, large ston'd, of a harsh Taste, and of the Size of a small Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; the <hi>Cluster-Grape</hi> is of a harsh Taste too, and about the Size of a white Curran. This Land requires much Labour to clear; but when it is cleared, it will bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Grain for <hi>three, four</hi> or <hi>five</hi> Years sometimes without laying any Manure upon it: An Acre of it generally produces <hi>ten</hi> Bushels of <hi>Indian Corn,</hi> besides <hi>five</hi> of <hi>Pease,</hi> in a Year; so that this is justly esteemed the most valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

Land in the Province, white People being incapable to clear and cultivate the Swamps.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Swamp</hi> is any low watry Place, which is covered with Trees or Canes: They are here of <hi>three</hi> Sorts, <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, River</hi> and <hi>Cane</hi> Swamps: <hi>Cypress Swamps</hi> are most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly large Ponds, in and round which Cypresses grow. Most <hi>River Swamps</hi> are overflown on every Side by the River which runs through or near them; if they were drained they would produce good Rice; as would the <hi>Cane Swamps also,</hi> which in the mean time are the best Feeding for all Sorts of Cattle.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Marshes</hi> are of <hi>two</hi> Sorts; <hi>soft wet Marsh,</hi> which is all a Quagmire, and absolutely good for nothing, and <hi>hard Marsh,</hi> which is a firm Sand, but however at some seasons is good for feeding Cattle. Marshes of both Sorts abound on the Sea-Islands, which are very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and contain all Sorts of Land, and upon these chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly near Creeks and Runs of Water, Cedar Trees grow.</p>
            <p>We shall only add to the above, That considering no Land can be sowed (or at least what is sowed preserved) till the same is inclosed, that <hi>five</hi> Acres is the utmost a very able and laborious Man can propose to manage, this being the quantity allotted for the Task of a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro in the neighbouring Province, which Negro works <hi>four</hi> Hours each Day more than a white Man can do.</p>
            <p>It must next be noticed, that with regard to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Returns, (suppose a prosperous Season without Disappointments, which is not the Case in such small Improvements as can be expected in an infant Colony <hi>one</hi> Year in<hi>five</hi> either Drought burns, or Rain drowns the Corn, and makes the Pease fall out of the Pod; Dear, which no Fences can exclude, devour those little Settlements in a Night; Rats and Squirrels do the same; Birds eat the Seed out of the Ground, and dig up the Blade after it is spired; and Variety of Worms and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects devour the one half of it: But let us suppose none of

            <p>Let us next consider the Maintenance of every single white Servant <hi>per annum</hi> at the lowest Rate, and then the Reader will be able to judge whether white Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can get their Livelihood by planting Land in this Climate without Negroes; and the Allowance to the Trustees <hi>Dutch</hi> Servants being the least at which any white Servant could be maintained in <hi>Georgia,</hi> we shall therefore take our Estimation from it, which is <hi>Eight Pence Sterling per Day,</hi> or 12 <hi>l.</hi> 3 <hi>s. </hi> 4 <hi>d.

Charge, under the Direction of one Mr. <hi>Roger Lacy,</hi> being at that time Agent to the <hi>Cherokee</hi> Nation: It is principally, if not altogether, inhabited by <hi>Indian</hi> Traders and Store-keepers, the Number of whom may now be about <hi>thirty</hi> or upwards; and a considerable Quantity of Corn has been raised there. To account for this singular Circumstance, we shall only assign <hi>two</hi> Reasons; the first is the Goodness of the Land, which as so great a Distance from the Sea is richer than in the maritime Parts; the second and chief one is, that the Settlers there are indulged and connived at in the Use of Negroes, by whom they execute all the Laborious Parts of Culture; and the Fact is undoubted and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that upwards of <hi>eighty</hi> Negroes are now in the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements belonging to that Place: We do not observe this, as if it gives us any Uneasiness that our Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Planters are indulged in what is so necessary for their Well-being; but we may be allowed to regret, that we and so many <hi>British</hi> Subjects, who stood much more in need of them, should have been ruined for want of such Assistances.</p>

Mr. <hi>Fallowfield,</hi> then on the Bench, used what Arguments he could to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him, that it was reasonable every Person should represent his own Case to the Trustees, and he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the Design of the Trustees was such; but <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi> in a Passion said, <hi>Except they would sign this, they should have the publick Seal to no other Paper;</hi> so it was to no Purpose what either he or the Recorder Mr. <hi>John Py</hi> could urge, who very soon left the Court, declaring their Dislike and Abhorrence of such Proceedings; but immediately they, with the rest of the Inhabitants, to the Number of above <hi>sixty,</hi> drew up a Remonstrance to the Trustees, in which they fully set forth the <hi>true</hi> State of the Colony, with their own miserable Condition in it: This Paper, and soon after a Petition to the King and Council <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were lately transmitted to the Authors hereof, who immediately forwarded them for <hi>London;</hi> but as the Issue thereof is now depending, we do not think it proper to expose them to the Publick.</p>

in order to prevent the Fire from spreading, his Answer was, <hi>I can do nothing in it, I have no Orders concerning such Matters.</hi>

            <p>We have lately been informed from <hi>Frederica,</hi> that the General having stationed <hi>twelve</hi> Men upon the Place which was the Settlement of Messrs. <hi>Carr</hi> and <hi>Carteret</hi> before mentioned, they were attacked by <hi>Spaniards</hi> or <hi>Spanish Indians,</hi> and <hi>four</hi> were killed, <hi>four</hi> carried off, and <hi>two</hi> wounded.</p>
            <p>A good many of the People have come away from <hi>Frederica</hi> lately, and in order to get off were obliged to make use of Stratagems, such as going a hunting upon the Islands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We are informed that some Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have happened betwixt the General and some of the Magistrates there, and that in the Place of one of them he has appointed one of his Waiting-boys.

            <p>Having thus brought this historical <hi>NARRATIVE</hi> within the Compass proposed, and endeavoured to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Materials in as distinct a Method and Series as the necessary Conciseness would allow, we readily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that the Design is far from being complete. to have acquainted the World with all the Hardships and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions which have been exercised in the Colony of <hi>Georgia,</hi> must have required both a larger Volume than we are capable of publishing, and more Time than we could bestow: We therefore satisfy ourselves that we have with care and sincerity executed so much of the Design as may pave the Way to any others who can descend more minutely to Particulars; and those who are best acquainted with the Affairs of that Colony will be most capable of judging how tenderly we have tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched both Persons and Things.</p>
