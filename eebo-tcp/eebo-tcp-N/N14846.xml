         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776.</hi> A <hi>DECLARATION</hi> by the <hi>REPRESENTATIVES</hi> of the <hi>UNITED STATES</hi> of <hi>AMERICA,</hi> in <hi>General Congreſs Aſſembled.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHEN in the courſe of human e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, it becomes neceſſary for one people to diſſolve the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal bands which have connected them with another, and to aſſume among the powers of the earth, the ſeparate and equal ſtation to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent reſpect to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of mankind requires that they ſhould declare the cauſes which impel them to the ſeparation.</p>
            <p>We hold theſe truths to be ſelf-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rights, that among theſe are life, liberty and the purſuit of happineſs.—That to ſecure theſe rights governments are inſtituted among men, deriving their juſt powers from the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018828_0003_0FA81FAC8CA997A8"/>
conſent of the governed, that whenever any form of government becomes deſtructive of theſe ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to aboliſh it, and to inſtitute new government, laying its foundation on ſuch principles, and organizing its powers in ſuch form as to them ſhall ſeem moſt likely to effect their ſafety and happineſs. Prudence indeed will dictate, that governments long eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhould not be changed for light and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient cauſes, and accordingly all experience hath ſhewn, that mankind are more diſpoſed to ſuffer, while evils are ſufferable, than to right themſelves by aboliſhing the forms to which they are accuſtomed. But when a long train of abuſes and uſurpations purſuing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably the ſame object, evinces a deſign to reduce them under abſolute deſpotiſm, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off ſuch government, and to provide new guards for their future ſecurity. Such has been the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſufferance of the colonies; and ſuch is now the neceſſity which conſtrains them to alter their former ſyſtem of government. The hiſtory of the preſent King of Great-Britain, is a hiſtory of repeated injuries and uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all having in direct object, the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an abſolute tyranny over theſe ſtates. To prove this let facts be ſubmitted to a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did world.</p>
            <p>He has refuſed his aſſent to laws, the moſt
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018828_0004_0FA81FAD4C498DB8"/>
wholeſome and neceſſary for the public good.</p>
            <p>He has forbidden his Governors to paſs laws of immediate and preſſing importance, unleſs ſuſpended in their operation till his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſhould be obtained; and when ſo ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</p>
            <p>He has refuſed to paſs other laws for the accommodation of large diſtricts of people, unleſs thoſe people would relinquiſh the right of repreſentation in the legiſlature; a right ineſtimable to them, and formidable to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants only.</p>
            <p>He has called together legiſlative bodies at places unuſual, uncomfortable, and diſtant from the depoſitory of their public records, for the ſole purpoſe of fatiguing them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to compliance with his meaſures.</p>
            <p>He has diſſolved repreſentative houſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly, for oppoſing with manly firmneſs his invaſions on the rights of the people.</p>
            <p>He has refuſed for a long time, after ſuch diſſolutions, to cauſe others to be elected; whereby the legiſlative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large, for their exerciſe; the ſtate remaining in the mean time expoſed to all the dangers of invaſion from without, and convulſions within.</p>
            <p>He has endeavoured to prevent the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of theſe States; for that purpoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018828_0005_0FA81FAE1215DA30"/>
the laws for naturalization of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners; refuſing to paſs others to encourage their migrations hither, and raiſing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of new appropriations of lands.</p>
            <p>He has obſtructed the adminiſtration of juſtice, by refuſing his aſſent to laws for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing judiciary powers.</p>
            <p>He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their ſalaries.</p>
            <p>He has erected a multitude of new offices, and ſent hither ſwarms of officers to harraſs our people, and eat out their ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>He has kept among us, in times of peace, ſtanding armies, without the conſent of our legiſlatures.</p>
            <p>He has affected to render the military in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of, and ſuperior to, the civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p>He has combined with others to ſubject us to a juriſdiction foreign to our conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and unacknowledged by our laws; giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his aſſent to their acts of pretended legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</p>
            <p>For quartering large bodies of troops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us:</p>
            <p>For protecting them, by a mock trial, from puniſhment for any murders which they ſhould commit on the inhabitants of theſe ſtates:</p>
            <p>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:018828_0006_0FA81FAED2079DA8"/>For impoſing taxes on us without our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:</p>
            <p>For depriving us in many caſes, of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of trial by jury:</p>
            <p>For tranſporting us beyond ſeas to be tries for pretended offences:</p>
            <p>For aboliſhing the free ſyſtem of Engliſh laws in a neighbouring province, eſtabliſhing therein an arbitrary government, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging its boundaries, ſo as to render it at once an example and fit inſtrument for intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the ſame abſolute rule into theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies:</p>
            <p>For taking away our Charters, aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our moſt valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</p>
            <p>For ſuſpending our own legiſlatures, and declaring themſelves inveſted with power to legiſlate for us in all caſes whatſoever.</p>
            <p>He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging war againſt us.</p>
            <p>He has plundered our ſeas, ravaged our coaſts, burnt our towns, and deſtroyed the lives of our people.</p>
            <p>He is, at this time, tranſporting large ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death, deſolation and tyranny, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begun with circumſtances of cruelty and perfidy, ſcarcely paralleled in the moſt
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018828_0007_0FA81FAFC1D16C70"/>
barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</p>
            <p>He has conſtrained our fellow citizens, taken captive on the high ſeas, to bear arms againſt their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themſelves by their hands.</p>
            <p>He has excited domeſtic inſurrections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the mercileſs Indian ſavages, whoſe known rule of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare is an undiſtinguiſhed deſtruction, of all ages, ſexes and conditions.</p>
            <p>In every ſtage of theſe oppreſſions we have petitioned for redreſs, in the moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble terms: Our repeated petitions have been anſwered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whoſe character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</p>
            <p>Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our Britiſh brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature to extend an unwarrantable juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over us. We have reminded them of the circumſtances of our emigration and ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here. We have appealed to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive juſtice and magnanimity and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to diſavow theſe uſurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connection
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018828_0008_0FA81FB1399DE890"/>
and correſpondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of juſtice and of conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. We muſt, therefore, aquieſce in the neceſſity which denounces our ſeparation, and hold them as we hold the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, enemies in war; in peace, friends.</p>
            <p>We, therefore, the Repreſentatives of the United States in General Congreſs aſſembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World, for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the good people of theſe colonies, ſolemnly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and declare, That theſe United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, FREE and INDEPENDENT STATES; that they are abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from all allegiance to the Britiſh crown, and that all political connection between them and the ſtate of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally diſſolved; and that as free and Independent States, they have full pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to levy war, conclude peace, contract alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, eſtabliſh commerce, and to do all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acts and things which Independent States may of right do. And for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our ſacred honour.</p>

               <p>Art. 6. The moſt chriſtian king ſhall endeavour, by all means in his power, to protect and defend all veſſels and the effects belonging to the ſubjects, people or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the ſaid united ſtates, or any of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his ports, havens, or roads, or on the ſeas is near

               <p>Art. 7. In like manner the ſaid united ſtates, and their ſhips of war ſailing under their authority, ſhall protect and defend, conformably to the preceding arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, all the veſſels and effects belonging to the ſubjects of the moſt chriſtian king, and uſe all their endeavours to recover, and cauſed to be reſtored, the ſaid veſſels and effects that ſhall have been taken within the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the ſaid united ſtates, or any of them.</p>
               <p>Art. 8.

chriſtian king's ſubjects ſhall not fiſh in the havens, bays, creeks, roads, coaſts or places, which the ſaid united ſtates hold, or ſhall hereafter hold; and in like manner the ſubjects, people and inhabitants of the united ſtates, ſhall not fiſh in the havens, bays, creeks, roads, coaſts or pieces, which the moſt chriſtian king poſſeſſes, or ſhall hereafter poſſeſs; and if any ſhip or veſſel ſhall be found fiſhing, contrary to the tenor of this treaty, the ſaid ſhip or veſſel with its lading, (proof being made thereof) ſhall be confiſcated; it is however underſtood that the excluſion ſtipulated in the preſent article, ſhall take place only ſo long and ſo far, as the moſt chriſtian king or the united ſtates ſhall not in this reſpect have granted an exemption to ſome other nation.</p>
               <p>Art. 10. The united ſtates, their citizens and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, ſhall never diſturb the ſubjects of the moſt chriſtian king in the enjoyment and exerciſe of the right of fiſhing on the banks of Newfoundland, nor in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite and excluſive right which belongs to them on that part of the coaſt of that iſland which is deſigned by the treaty of Utrecht, nor in the right relative to all and each of the iſles which belong to his moſt chriſtian majeſty, the whole conformable to the true ſenſe of the treaties of Utrecht and Paris.</p>
               <p>Art. 11. The ſubjects and inhabitants of the ſaid united ſtates, or any one of them, ſhall not be reputed <hi>Aubains</hi> in France, and conſequently ſhall be exempted from the <hi>Droit d' Aubaine,</hi> or other ſimilar duty, under what name ſoever; they may by teſtament, donation, or otherwiſe, diſpoſe of their goods, moveable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, in favour of ſuch perſons as to them ſhall ſeem good, and their heirs, ſubjects of the united ſtates, reſiding whether in France or elſewhere, may ſucceed them, <hi>ab inteſtat,</hi> without being obliged to obtain let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of naturalization, and without having the effect of this conceſſion conteſted or impeded, under pretext of any rights or prerogatives of provinces, cities, or private perſons; and the ſaid heirs, whether by ſuch particular title, or <hi>ab inteſtat,</hi> ſhall be exempt from all duty called <hi>Droit de detraction,</hi> or other duty or the ſame kind; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

The ſubjects of the moſt chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian king ſhall enjoy on their part, in all the dominions of the ſaid ſtates, an entire and perfect reciprocity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to the ſtipulations contained in the preſent arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle: But it is at the ſame time agreed, that its contents ſhall not affect the laws made, or that may be made hereafter in France, againſt emigrations, which ſhall remain in all their force and vigour; and the united ſtates, on their part, or any of them, ſhall be at liberty to erect ſuch laws, relative to that matter, as to them ſhall ſeem proper.</p>
               <p>Art. 12. The merchant ſhips of either of the parties, which ſhall be making into a port belonging to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the other ally, and concerning whoſe voyage and the ſpecies of goods on board her, there ſhall be juſt grounds of ſuſpicion, ſhall be obliged to exhibit, as well upon the high ſeas, as in the ports and havens, not only her paſſports, but likewiſe certificates, expreſsly ſhewing that her goods are not of the number of thoſe which have been prohibited as contraband.</p>
               <p>Art. 13. If by exhibiting of the above-ſaid certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, the other party diſcover there are any of thoſe ſorts of goods which are prohibited and declared contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and conſigned for a port under the obedience of his enemy, it ſhall not be lawful to break up the hatches of ſuch ſhip, or to open any cheſt, coffers, packs, caſks, or any other veſſels found therein, or to remove the ſmalleſt parcels of her goods, whether ſuch ſhip belong to the ſubjects of France, or the inhabitants of the ſaid united ſtates, unleſs the lading be brought on ſhore, in the preſence of the officers of the court of admiralty, and an inventory thereof made; but there ſhall be no allowance to ſell, exchange, or alienate the ſame in any manner, until that after due and lawful proceſs ſhall have been had againſt ſuch prohibited goods, and the court of admiralty ſhall, by a ſentence pronounced, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving confiſcated the ſame, ſaving always as well the ſhip itſelf, as any other goods found therein, which by this

treaty are to be eſteemed free; neither may they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained on pretence of their being as it were infected by the prohibited goods, much leſs ſhall they be confiſcated as lawful prize; but if not the whole cargo, but only part thereof ſhall conſiſt of prohibited or contraband goods, and the commander of the ſhip ſhall be ready and willing to deliver them to the captor who has diſcovered them, in ſuch caſe the captor having received thoſe goods, ſhall forthwith diſcharge the ſhip; and not hinder her by any means freely to proſecute the voyage on which ſhe was bound. But in caſe the contraband merchandizes cannot be all received on board the veſſel of the captor, then the captor may, notwithſtanding the offer of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering him the contraband goods, carry the veſſel into the neareſt port, agreeable to what is above directed.</p>
               <p>Art. 14. On the contrary it is agreed, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall be found to be laden by the ſubjects and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of either party on any ſhip belonging to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the other, or to their ſubjects, the whole, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not of the ſort of prohibited goods, may be confiſcated in the ſame manner as if it belonged to the enemy, except ſuch goods and merchandize as were put on board ſuch ſhip before the declaration of war, or even after ſuch declaration, if ſo be it were done without knowledge of ſuch declaration; ſo that the goods of the ſubjects and people of either party, whether they be of the nature of ſuch as are prohibited or otherwiſe, which, as is aforeſaid, were put on board any ſhip belonging to an enemy before the war, or after the declaration of the ſame, without the knowledge of it, ſhall no ways be liable to confiſcation, but ſhall well and truly be reſtored without delay to the proprietors demanding the ſame; but ſo as that if the ſaid merchandizes be contraband, it ſhall not be any ways lawful to carry them afterwards to any port belonging to the enemy. The two contracting parties agree, that the terms of two months being paſſed after the declaration of war, their reſpective ſubjects, from whatever part of the world they come, ſhall not plead the ignorance mentioned in this article.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:018828_0017_0FA81FB94E3D4380"/>Art. 15. And that more effectual care may be taken for the ſecurity of the ſubjects and inhabitants of both parties, that they ſuffer no injury by the men of war or privateers of the other party, all the commanders of the ſhips of his moſt chriſtian majeſty and of the ſaid united ſtates, and all their ſubjects and inhabitants, ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid doing any injury or damage to the other ſide; and if they act to the contrary they ſhall be puniſhed, and ſhall moreover be bound to make ſatisfaction for all matter of damage, and the intereſt therof, by reparation, under the pain and obligation of their perſons and goods.</p>
               <p>Art. 16. All ſhips and merchandize of what nature ſoever, which ſhall be reſcued out of the hands of any pirates or robbers on the high ſeas, ſhall be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome port of either ſtate, and ſhall be delivered to the cuſtody of the officers of that port, in order to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red intire to the true proprietor, as ſoon as due and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proof ſhall be made concerning the property there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Art. 17. It ſhall be lawful for the ſhips of war of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party, and privateers, freely to carry whitherſoever they pleaſe, the ſhips and goods taken from their enemies, without being obliged to pay any duty to the officers of the admiralty, or any other judges; nor ſhall ſuch prizes be arreſted or ſeized when they come to and enter the port of either party; nor ſhall the ſearchers or other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of thoſe places ſearch the ſame, or make examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning the lawfulneſs of ſuch prizes; but they may hoiſt ſail at any time, and depart and carry their prizes to the places expreſſed in their commiſſions, which the commanders of ſuch ſhips of war ſhall be obliged to ſhew: On the contrary, no ſhelter or refuge ſhall be given in their ports to ſuch as ſhall have made prize of the ſubjects, people, or property of either of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but if ſuch ſhall come in, being forced by ſtreſs of weather, or the danger of the ſea, all proper means ſhall be vigorouſly uſed, that they go out and retire from thence as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
               <p>Art. 18. If any ſhip belonging to either of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, their people, or ſubjects, ſhall, within the coaſts or

dominions of the other, ſtick upon the ſands, or be wrecked or ſuffer any other damage, all friendly aſſiſtance and relief ſhall be given to the perſons ſhipwrecked, or ſuch as ſhall be in danger thereof. And letters of ſafe conduct ſhall likewiſe be given to them for their free and quiet paſſage from thence, and the return of every one to his own country.</p>
               <p>Art. 19. In caſe the ſubjects and inhabitants of either party, with their ſhipping, whether public and of war, or private and of merchants, be forced through ſtreſs of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, purſuit of pirates or enemies, or any other urgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, for ſeeking of ſhelter and harbour, to retreat and enter into any of the rivers, bays, roads, or ports belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the other party, they ſhall be received and treated with all humanity and kindneſs, and enjoy all friendly protection and help; and they ſhall be permitted to refreſh and provide themſelves at reaſonable rates with victuals, and all things needful for the ſuſtenance of their perſons, or reparation of their ſhips, and conveniency of their voyage, and they ſhall no ways be detained or hindered from returning out of the ſaid ports or roads, but may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move and depart when and whither they pleaſe, without any let or hindrance.</p>
               <p>Art. 20. For the better promoting of commerce on both ſides, it is agreed, that if a war ſhould break out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſaid two nations, ſix months, after the procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of war, ſhall be allowed to the merchants in the cities and towns where they live, for ſelling and tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their goods and merchandizes; and if any thing be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them, or any injury be done them within that term, by either party, or the people or ſubjects of either, full ſatisfaction ſhall be made for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Art. 21. No ſubject of the moſt Chriſtian King ſhall apply for or take any commiſſion or letters of marque for arming any ſhip or ſhips to act as privateers againſt the ſaid united ſtates or any of them, or againſt the ſubjects, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or inhabitants of the ſaid united ſtates, or any of them, or againſt the property of any of the inhabitants of any of them from any prince or ſtate with which the united ſtates ſhall be at war; nor ſhall any citizen, ſubject, or

               <p>Art. 22. It ſhall not be lawful for any foreign priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, not belonging to the ſubjects of the moſt chriſtian king, nor citizens of the ſaid united ſtates, who have commiſſions from any other prince or ſtate, at enmity with either nation, to fit their ſhips in the ports of either the one or the other of the aforeſaid parties, to ſell what they have taken, or in any other manner whatſoever to exchange their ſhips, merchandiſes or any other lading; neither ſhall they be allowed even to purchaſe victuals, except ſuch as ſhall be neceſſary for their going to the next port of that prince or ſtate from which they have commiſſions.</p>
               <p>Art. 23. It ſhall be lawful for all and ſingular the ſubjects of the moſt chriſtan king, and the citizens, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and inhabitants of the ſaid united ſtates, to ſail with their ſhips with all manner of liberty and ſecurity, no diſtinction being made who are the proprietors of the merchandize laden thereon, from any port to the places of thoſe who now are or hereafter ſhall be at enmity with the moſt chriſtian king or the united ſtates. It ſhall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be lawful for the ſubjects and inhabitants aforeſaid, to ſail with the ſhips and merchandizes aforementioned, and to trade with the ſame liberty and ſecurity from the places, ports and havens of thoſe who are enemies of both or either party, without any oppoſition or diſturbance whatſoever, not only directly from the places of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my aforementioned to neutral places, but alſo from one place belonging to an enemy, to another place belonging to an enemy, whether they be under the juriſdiction of the ſame prince, or under ſeveral. And it is hereby ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated, that free ſhips ſhall alſo give a freedom to goods, and that every thing ſhall be deemed free and exempt,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018828_0020_0FA81FBDD849A6C0"/>
which ſhall be found on board the ſhips belonging to the ſubjects of either of the confederates, although the whole lading or any part thereof ſhould appertain to the ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies of either, contraband goods being always excepted.

the ſaid treaty, ſhould break the peace with France, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by direct hoſtilities, or by hindering her commerce and navigation in a manner contrary to the rights of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the peace ſubſiſting between the two crowns. And his Majeſty and the ſaid United States having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in that caſe, to join their councils and efforts againſt the enterprizes of their common enemy.</p>
               <p>The reſpective plenipotentiaries empowered to concert the clauſes and conditions proper to fulfil the ſaid inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, have, after the moſt mature deliberation, conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and determined on the following articles:</p>
               <p>ARTICLE I.</p>
               <p>IF war ſhould break out between France and Great-Britain, during the continuance of the preſent war between the United States and England, his Majeſty and the ſaid United States ſhall make it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe, and aid each other mutually with their good offices, their counſels and their forces, according to the exigence of conjunctures, as becomes good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful allies.</p>
               <p>Art. 2. The eſſential and direct end of the preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive alliance is, to maintain effectually the liberty, ſovereignty and independence abſolute and unlimited, of the ſaid United States, as well in matters of government as of commerce.</p>
               <p>Art. 3. The two contracting parties ſhall, each on his own part, and in the manner it may judge moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, make all the efforts in its power againſt their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy, in order to attain the end propoſed.</p>
               <p>Art. 4. The contracting parties agree, that in caſe either of them ſhould form any particular enterprize in which the concurrence of the other may be deſired, the party whoſe concurrence is deſired, ſhall readily and with good faith join to act in concert for that purpoſe, as far as circumſtances and its own particular ſituation will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and in that caſe, they ſhall regulate by a particular convention, the quantity and kind of ſuccour to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and the time and manner of its being brought
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018828_0027_0FA81FC30EE3EB90"/>
into action, as well as the advantages which are to be in compenſation.</p>
               <p>Art. 5. If the United States ſhould think fit to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the reduction of the Britiſh power, remaining in the northern parts of America, or the iſlands of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudas, thoſe countries or iſlands, in caſe of ſucceſs, ſhall be confederated with, or dependent upon ſaid Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States.</p>
               <p>Art. 6. The Moſt Chriſtian King renounces forever the poſſeſſion of the iſlands of Bermudas, as well as of any part of the continent of North-America, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the treaty of Paris, in 1763, or in virtue of that treaty, were acknowledged to belong to the crown of Great-Britain, or to the United States, heretofore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Britiſh colonies, or which are at this time, or have lately been under the power of the King and Crown of Great Britain.</p>
               <p>Art. 7. If his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty ſhall think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to attack any of the iſlands ſituated in the Gulph of Mexico, or near that Gulph, which are at preſent under the power of Great-Britain, all the ſaid iſles, in caſe of ſucceſs, ſhall appertain to the crown of France.</p>
               <p>Art. 8. Neither of the two parties ſhall conclude ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truce or peace with Great Britain, without the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal conſent of the other firſt obtained; and they mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally engage not to lay down their arms, until the indpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the United States ſhall have been formally or tacitly aſſured, by the treaty or treaties that ſhall termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the war.</p>

               <p>Art. 10. The Moſt Chriſtian King and the United States agree, to invite or admit other powers, who may have received injuries from England to make common cauſe with them, and to accede to the preſent alliance,

               <p>Art. 12. In order to fix more preciſely the ſenſe and application of the preceding article, the contracting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties declare, that in caſe of a rupture between France and England, the reciprocal guarantee declared in the ſaid article, ſhall have its full force and effect, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuch war ſhall break out; and if ſuch rupture ſhall not take place, the mutual obligations of the ſaid gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantee, ſhall not commence until the moment of the ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the preſent war, between the United States and England, ſhall have aſcertained their poſſeſſions.</p>
               <p>Art. 13. The preſent treaty ſhall be ratified on both ſides, and the ratifications ſhall be exchanged in the ſpace of ſix months, or ſooner, if poſſible.</p>

            <opener>WHEREAS in purſuance of a Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary commiſſion, given on the twenty-ninth day of December, one thouſand ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eighty, to the Honourable JOHN ADAMS, Eſq. a Treaty of Amity and Commerce between their High Mightineſſes the States-General of the United Netherlands, and the United States of America, was, on the eighth day of October, one thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty-two, concluded by the ſaid JOHN ADAMS, with Plenipotentiaries named for that purpoſe by their ſaid High Mightineſſes, the States-General of the United Netherlands: And whereas the ſaid Treaty hath been this day approved and ratified by the United States in Congreſs aſſembled, as the ſame is contained in the words following, to wit.</opener>
            <head>A TREATY of AMITY and COMMERCE, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their HIGH MIGHTINESSES the STATES-GE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NERAL of the UNITED NETHERLANDS, and the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, to wit, NEW-HAMP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHIRE, MASSACHUSETTS, RHODE-ISLAND and PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIDENCE PLANTATIONS, CONNECTICUT, NEW-YORK, NEW-JERSEY, PENNSYLVANIA, DELAWARE, MARYLAND, VIRGINIA, NORTH-CAROLINA, SOUTH-CAROLINA and GEORGIA.</head>

deſiring to aſcertain, in a permanent and equitable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the rules to be obſerved, relative to the commerce and correſpondence which they intend to eſtabliſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their reſpective States, countries and inhabitants, have judged that the ſaid end cannot be better obtained, than by eſtabliſhing the moſt perfect equality and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procity for the baſis of their agreement, and by avoiding all thoſe burthenſome preferences which are uſually the ſources of debate, embarraſſment and diſcontent; by leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo each party at liberty to make, reſpecting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and navigation, ſuch ulterior regulations as it ſhall and moſt convenient to itſelf, and by founding the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of commerce ſolely upon reciprocal utility, and the juſt rules of free intercourſe, reſerving withall, to each party, the liberty of admitting at its pleaſure, other nations to a participation of the ſame advantages.</p>
            <p>On theſe principles their ſaid High Mightineſſes the States-General of the United Netherlands, have named for their Plenipotentiaries, from the midſt of their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, Meſſieurs their Deputies for the Foreign Affairs; and the ſaid United-States of America, on their part, have furniſhed with full powers Mr. John Adams, late Commiſſioner of the United States of America at the Court of Verſailles, heretofore Delegate in Congreſs from the State of Maſſachuſetts-Bay, and Chief Juſtice of the ſaid State; who have agreed and concluded as follow, to wit:</p>
            <p>ART. I. There ſhall be a firm, inviolable and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal peace and ſincere friendſhip between their High Mightineſſes, the Lords, the States-General of the United Netherlands, and the United States of America; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſubjects and inhabitants of the ſaid parties, and between the countries, Iſlands, cities and places, ſituated under the juriſdiction of the ſaid United Netherlands and the ſaid United States of America, their ſubjects and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of every degree, without exception of perſons or places.</p>
            <p>ART. II. The ſaid ſubjects of the States-General of the United Netherlands, ſhall pay in the ports, havens, roads, countries, Iſlands, cities or places of the United States of America, or any of them, no other nor greater

And the two contracting parties ſhall provide each one in his juriſdiction, that their reſpective ſubjects and inhabitants may hence forward obtain the requiſite certificates in caſes of deaths in which they ſhall be intereſted.</p>

            <p>ART. VI. The ſubjects of the contracting parties may on one ſide and on the other, in the reſpective countries and ſtates, diſpoſe of their effects by teſtament, donation or otherwiſe; and their heirs, ſubjects of one of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and reſiding in the country of the other, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, ſhall receive ſuch ſucceſſions even <hi>ab inteſtato,</hi> whether in perſon or by their attorney or ſubſtitute, even although they ſhall not have obtained letters of naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation, without having the effect of ſuch commiſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted under pretext of any rights or prerogatives of any province, city or private perſon; and if the heirs, to whom ſuch ſucceſſion may have fallen, ſhall be minors, the tutors, or curators, eſtabliſhed by the judge domici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary, of the ſaid minors, may govern, direct, adminiſter, ſell, and allienate the effects falling to the ſaid minors, by inheritance, and in general, in relation to the ſaid

ſucceſſions and effects, uſe all the rights and fulfil all the functions, which belong by the diſpoſition of the laws, to guardians, tutors, and curators: Provided nevertheleſs, that this diſpoſition cannot take place, but in caſes where the teſtator ſhall not have named guardians, tutors, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators by teſtament, codicil, or other legal inſtrument.</p>
            <p>ART. VII. It ſhall be lawful and free for the ſubjects of each party, to employ ſuch advocates, attornies, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, ſolicitors or factors, as they ſhall judge proper.</p>
            <p>ART. VIII. Merchants, maſters and owners of ſhips, mariners, men of all kinds, ſhips and veſſels, and all merchandizes, and goods in general, and effects of one of the confederates, or of the ſubjects thereof, ſhall not be ſeized or detained in any of the countries, lands, iſlands, cities, places, ports, ſhores, or dominations whatſoever of the other confederate, for any military ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, public or private uſe of any one, by arreſts, violence, or any colour thereof: Much leſs ſhall it be permitted to the ſubjects of either party, to take or extort by force, any thing from the ſubjects of the other party, without the conſent of the owner: Which however is not to be underſtood of ſeizures, detentions and arreſts, which ſhall be made by the command and authority of juſtice, and by the ordinary methods on account of debts or crimes, in reſpect whereof, the proceedings muſt be, by way of law according to the forms of juſtice.</p>
            <p>ART. IX. It is further agreed and concluded, that it ſhall be wholly free for all merchants, commanders of ſhips and other ſubjects and inhabitants of the contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parties, in every place ſubjected to the juriſdiction of the two powers reſpectively, to manage themſelves, their own buſineſs: And moreover as to the uſe of interpreters or brokers, as alſo in relation to the loading or unloading of their veſsels, and every thing which has relation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, they ſhall be on one ſide and on the other, conſidered and treated upon the ſooting of natural ſubjects or at leaſt upon an equality with the moſt favoured nation.</p>
            <p>ART. X. The merchant ſhips of either of the parties coming from the port of an enemy, or from their own or a neutral port, may navigate freely towards any port of
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:018828_0047_0FA81FD5CA4424B0"/>
an enemy of the other ally: They ſhall be, nevertheleſs, held, whenever it ſhall be required, to exibit, as well upon the high ſeas as in the ports, their ſea-letters and other documents, deſcribed in the twenty-fifth article, ſtating expreſsly that their effects are not of the number of thoſe, which are prohibited as contraband: and not having any contraband goods, for an enemy's port, they may freely and without hindrance, purſue their voyage towards the port of an enemy. Nevertheleſs it ſhall not be required to examine the papers of veſſels convoyed by veſſels of war, but credence ſhall be given to the word of the officer, who ſhall conduct the convoy.</p>
            <p>ART. XI. If by exhibiting the ſea-letters, and other documents deſcribed more particularly in the twenty-fifth article of this treaty, the other party ſhall diſcover there are any of thoſe ſorts of goods, which are declared prohibited and contraband, and that they are conſigned for a port under the obedience of his enemy, it ſhall not be lawful to break up the hatches of ſuch ſhip, or to open any cheſt, coffer, packs, caſks, or other veſſel found therein, or to remove the ſmalleſt parcel of her goods, whether the ſaid veſſel belongs to the ſubjects of their High Mightineſſes the States-General of the United Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands, or to the ſubjects or inhabitants of the ſaid United States of America, unleſs the lading be brought on ſhore, in preſence of the officers of the Court of the Admiralty, and an inventory thereof made, but there ſhall be no allowance to ſell, exchange, or alienate the ſame until after that due and lawful proceſs ſhall have been had againſt ſuch prohibited goods or contraband, and the Court of Admiralty by a ſentence pronounced ſhall have confiſcated the ſame, ſaving always as well the ſhip itſelf as any other goods found therein, which are to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed free, and may not be detained on pretence of their being infected by the prohibited goods, much leſs ſhall they be confiſcated as lawful prize: But on the contrary when by the viſitation at land, it ſhall be found there are no contraband goods in the veſſel, and it ſhall not appear by the papers that he who has taken and carried in the veſſel, has been able to diſcover any there, he ought
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:018828_0048_0FA81FD8D23FA568"/>
to be condemned in all the charges, damages and intereſt of them, which he ſhall have cauſed both to the owner of veſſels and to the owners and freighters of cargoes, with which they ſhall be loaded, by his demerity in taking and carrying them in, declaring moſt expreſsly the free veſſels ſhall aſsure the liberty of the effects with which they ſhall be loaded, and that this liberty ſhall extend it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf equally to the perſons who ſhall be found in a free veſſel, who may not be taken out of her, unleſs they are military men, actually in the ſervice of an enemy.</p>
            <p>ART. XII. On the contrary it is agreed, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ill all be found to be laden by the ſubjects and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of either party, on any ſhip belonging to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's of the other, or to their ſubjects, although it be not comprehended under the ſort of prohibited goods, the whole may be confiſcated, in the ſame manner as if it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the enemy, except nevertheleſs ſuch effects and merchandize, as were put on board ſuch veſſel, before the declaration of war or in the ſpace of ſix months after it, which effects ſhall not be in any manner ſubject to confiſcation, but ſhall be faithfully and without delay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored in nature to the owners, who ſhall claim them or cauſe them to be claimed, before the confiſcation and ſale, as alſo their proceeds, if the claim could not be made but in the ſpace of eight months, after the ſale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ought to be public: provided nevertheleſs that if the ſaid merchandizes are contraband, it ſhall by no means be lawful to tranſport them afterwards to any port belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enemies.</p>
            <p>ART. XIII. And that more effectual care may be taken for ſecurity of ſubjects and people of either party, that they do not ſuffer moleſtation from the veſſels of war, or privateers of the other party, it ſhall be forbidden to all commanders of veſſels of war, and other armed veſſels of the ſaid States-General of the United Netherlands, and the ſaid United States of America, as well as to all their officers, ſubjects and people, to give any offence or do any damage to thoſe of the other party: and if they act to the contrary, they ſhall be upon the firſt complaint which ſhall be made of it, being found guilty after a
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:018828_0049_0FA81FDA251633A0"/>
juſt examination, puniſhed by their proper judges, and moreover obliged to make ſatisfaction for all damages and intereſt thereof, by reparation, under pain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of their perſons and goods.</p>
            <p>ART. XIV. For further determining of what has been ſaid, all captains of privateers, or ſitters out of veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels armed for war, under commiſſion, and on account of private perſons ſhall be held before their departure, to give ſufficient caution before competent judges, either to be reſponſible for the malverſations which they may commit in their cruizes or voyages, as well as for the contraventions of their captains and officers, againſt the preſent treaty, and againſt the ordinances and edicts which ſhall be publiſhed in conſequence of, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to it, under pain of forfeiture and nullity of the ſaid commiſſion.</p>
            <p>ART. XV. All veſſels and merchandizes of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever nature, which ſhall be reſcued out of the hands of any pirates or robbers, navigating the high ſeas, without requiſite commiſſions, ſhall be brought into ſome port of one of the two ſtates, and depoſited in the hands of the officers of that port, in order to be reſtored entire to the true proprietor, as ſoon as due and ſufficient proof ſhall be made, concerning the property thereof.</p>
            <p>ART. XVI. If any ſhips or veſſels belonging to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the parties, their ſubjects or people ſhall within the coaſts or dominations of the other, ſtick upon the ſands or be wrecked, or ſuffer any other ſea damage, all friendly aſſiſtance and relief ſhall be given to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhipwrecked, or ſuch as ſhall be in danger thereof; and the veſſels, effects and merchandizes, or the part of them which ſhall have been ſaved, or the proceeds of them, if being periſhable they ſhall have been ſold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing claimed within a year and a day, by the maſters or owners, or their agents or attornies, ſhall be reſtored, paying only the reaſonable charges; and that which muſt be paid in the ſame caſe; for the ſalvage, by the proper ſubjects of the country: there ſhall alſo be delivered them ſafe conducts or paſſports for their free and ſafe paſſage from thence, and to return each one to his own country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:018828_0050_0FA81FDA5473A438"/>ART. XVII. In caſe the ſubjects or people of either party with their ſhipping, whether public and of war, or private and of merchants, be forced through ſtreſs of weather, purſuit of pirates or enemies, or any other ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent neceſſity, for ſeeking of ſhelter and harbour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat and enter into any of the rivers, creeks, bays, ports, roads or ſhores, belonging to the other party, they ſhall be received with all humanity and kindneſs, and enjoy all friendly protection and help, and they ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to refreſh and provide themſelves at reaſonable rates, with victuals and all things needful for the ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their perſons, or reparation of their ſhips; and they ſhall no ways be detained or hindered from return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the ſaid ports or roads, but may remove, and depart when and whither they pleaſe, without any let or hindrance.</p>
            <p>ART. XVIII. For the better promoting of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce on both ſides, it is agreed, that if a war ſhould break out, between their High Mightineſſes the States-General of the United Netherlands and the United States of America, there ſhall always be granted to the ſubjects on each ſide, the term of nine months, after the date of the rupture, or the proclamation of war; to the end that they may retire with their effects, and tranſport them where they pleaſe; which it ſhall be lawful for them to do, as well as to ſell or tranſport their effects and goods in all freedom, and without any hindrance, and without being able to proceed during the ſaid term of nine months, to any arreſt of their effects, much leſs of their perſons; on the contrary, there ſhall be given them, for their veſſels and their effects which they would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away, paſſports and ſafe conducts, for the neareſt ports of their reſpective countries; and for the time neceſſary for the voyage, and no prize made at ſea ſhall be adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lawful, at leaſt if the declaration of war was not or could not be known, in the laſt port, which the veſſel taken has quitted. But for whatever may have been taken from the ſubjects and inhabitants of either party, and for the offences which may have been given, them, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of the ſaid terms, a compleat ſatisfaction ſhall be given them.</p>

            <p>ART. XXIII. If at any time the United States of America, ſhall judge neceſſary to commence negociations with the King or Emperor of Morocco and Fez, and the Regencies of Algiers, Tunis or Tripoli, or with any of them, to obtain paſſports for the ſecurity of their navigation in the Mediterranean ſea; their High Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſes promiſe that upon the requiſition which the United States of America ſhall make of it, they will ſecond ſuch negociations in the moſt favourable manner, by means of their Conſuls reſiding near the ſaid King, Emperor and Regencies.</p>

the omiſſion of ſuch expreſſion cannot and ought not to cauſe a confiſcation.</p>
            <p>ART. XXVI. If the veſſels of the ſaid ſubjects, or inhabitants of either of the parties, ſailing along the coaſt or on the high ſeas, are met by a veſſel of war or privateer, or other armed veſſels of the other party, the ſaid veſſels of war, privateers or armed veſſels for avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all diſorder, ſhall remain without the reach of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, but may ſend their boats on board the merchant veſſels which they ſhall meet in this manner, upon which they may not paſs more than two or three men, to whom the maſter or commander ſhall exhibit his paſſport concerning the property of the veſſel according to the form annexed to this treaty; and the veſſel, after having exhibited ſuch a paſſport, ſea-letter and other documents, ſhall be free to continue her voyage, ſo that it ſhall not be lawful to moleſt her, or ſearch her in any manner, nor to give her chace, nor to force her to alter her courſe.</p>

               <head>A TREATY of AMITY and COMMERCE concluded between his Majeſty the King of SWEDEN and the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</head>
               <p>The King of Sweden, of the Goths and Vandals, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and the Thirteen United States of North-America, to wit, New-Hampſhire, Maſſachuſetts-Bay, Rhode-Iſland, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jerſey, Pennſylvania, the Counties of New-Caſtle, Kent, and, Suſſex, on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, South-Carolina, and Georgia, deſiring to eſtabliſh in a ſtable and permanent manner, the rules which ought to be obſerved relative to the correſpondence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce which the two parties have judged neceſſary to eſtabliſh between their reſpective countries, ſtates and ſubjects; his Majeſty and the United States have thought that they could not better accompliſh that end, than by taking for a baſis of their arrangements the mutual intereſts and advantage of both nations, thereby avoiding all thoſe
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:018828_0057_0FA81FDF8CE8D710"/>
burthenſome preferences, which are uſually ſources of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, embarraſſment and diſcontent, and by leaving each party at liberty to make, reſpecting navigation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, thoſe interior regulations which ſhall be moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to itſelf.</p>
               <p>With this view, his Majeſty the King of Sweden has nominated and appointed for his Plenipotentiary, Count Guſtavus Philip de Creutz, his Ambaſſador Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and Knight, Commander of his orders; and the United States, on their part have fully empowered Benjamin Franklin, their Miniſter Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiary to his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty; the ſaid Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiaries, after exchanging their full powers, and after mature deliberation in conſequence thereof have agreed upon, concluded and ſigned the following articles:</p>
               <p>ARTICLE I.</p>
               <p>There ſhall be a firm, inviolable and univerſal peace, and a true and ſincere friendſhip between the King of Sweden, his heirs and ſucceſſors, and the United States of America, and the ſubjects of his Majeſty and thoſe of the ſaid States, and between the countries, iſlands, cities and towns, ſituated under the juriſdiction of the King and of the ſaid United States, without any exception of perſons or places; and the conditions agreed to in this preſent treaty, ſhall be perpetual and permanent between the King, his heirs and ſucceſſors, and the ſaid United States.</p>
               <p>Art. 2. The King and the United States engage mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, not to grant hereafter any particular favour to other nations in reſpect to commerce and navigation, which ſhall not immediately become common to the other party, who ſhall enjoy the ſame favour freely, if the conceſſion was freely made, or on allowing the ſame compenſation, if the conceſſion was conditional.</p>
               <p>Art. 3. The ſubjects of the King of Sweden ſhall not pay in the ports, havens, roads, countries, iſlands, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and towns, of the United States or any of them, any other nor greater duties or impoſts of what nature ſoever they may be, than thoſe which the moſt favoured
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:018828_0058_0FA81FE2210AC938"/>
nations are or ſhall be obliged to pay; and they ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all the rights, liberties, privileges, immunities and exemptions in trade, navigation and commerce which the ſaid nations do or ſhall enjoy, whether in paſſing from one port to another of the United States, or in going to or from the ſame, from or to any part of the world whatever.</p>
               <p>Art. 4. The ſubjects and inhabitants of the ſaid United States ſhall not pay in the ports, havens, roads, iſlands, cities and towns under the dominion of the King of Sweden, any other or greater duties or impoſts of what nature ſoever they may be, or by what name ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever called, than thoſe which the moſt favoured nations are or ſhall be obliged to pay; and they ſhall enjoy all the rights, liberties, privileges, immunities and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions in trade, navigation and commerce, which the ſaid nations do or ſhall enjoy, whether in paſſing from one port to another of the dominion of his ſaid Majeſty, or in going to or from the ſame, from or to any part of the world whatever.</p>
               <p>Art. 5. There shall be granted a full, perfect and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire liberty of conſcience to the inhabitants and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of each party, and no perſon ſhall be moleſted on account of his worſhip, provided he ſubmits ſo far as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the public demonſtrations of it to the laws of the country: Moreover liberty ſhall be granted, when any of the ſubjects or inhabitants of either party die in the territory of the other, to bury them in convenient and decent places, which ſhall be aſſigned for the purpoſe: And the two contracting parties will provide each in its juriſdiction, that ſubjects and inhabitants reſpectively may obtain certificates of the death in caſe the delivery of them is required.</p>
               <p>Art. 6. The ſubjects of the contracting parties in the reſpective States, may freely diſpoſe of their goods and effects either by teſtament, donation or otherwiſe in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſuch perſons as they think proper; and their heirs in whatever place they ſhall reſide, ſhall receive the ſucceſſion even ab inteſtato, either in perſon or by their attorney, without having occaſion to take out letters of
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:018828_0059_0FA81FE3A9E85908"/>
naturalization. Theſe inheritances, as well as the capitals and effects, which the ſubjects of the two parties, in changing their abode, ſhall be deſirous of removing from the place of their abode, ſhall be exempted from all duty, called "droit de detraction," on the part of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the two States reſpectively. But it is at the ſame time agreed, that nothing contained in this article ſhall in any manner derogate from the ordinances pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in Sweden againſt emigrations, or which may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be publiſhed, which ſhall remain in full force and vigour. The United States on their part, or any of them, ſhall be at liberty to make reſpecting this matter, ſuch laws as they think proper.</p>
               <p>Art. 7, All and every the ſubjects inhabitants of the kingdom of Sweden, as well as thoſe of the United States, ſhall be permitted to navigate with their veſſels in all ſafety and freedom, and without any regard to thoſe to whom the merchandize and cargoes may belong, from any port whatever, and the ſubjects and inhabitants of the two ſtates ſhall likewiſe be permitted to ſail and trade with their veſſels, and with the ſame liberty and ſafety to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the places, ports and havens of powers, enemies to both or either of the contracting parties, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being in any wiſe moleſted or troubled, and to carry on a commerce not only directly from the ports of an enemy to a neutral port, but even from one port of an enemy, to another port of an enemy, whether it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the juriſdiction of the ſame or of different princes. And as it is acknowledged by this treaty with reſpect to ſhips and merchandizes that free ſhips ſhall make the merchandizes free, and that every thing which ſhall be on board of ſhips belonging to ſubjects of the one or the other of the contracting parties, ſhall be conſidered as free, even though the cargo or a part of it ſhould belong to the enemies of one or both; it is nevertheleſs provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that contraband goods ſhall always be excepted; which being intercepted, ſhall be proceeded againſt according to the ſpirit of the following articles. It is likewiſe agreed, that the ſame liberty be extended to perſons who may be on board a free ſhip, with this effect, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:018828_0060_0FA81FE4E29053E0"/>
they be enemies to both or either of the parties, they ſhall not be taken out of the free ſhip, unleſs they are ſoldiers in the actual ſervice of the ſaid enemies.</p>
               <p>Art. 8. The liberty of navigation and commerce ſhall extend to all kinds of merchandizes except thoſe only which are expreſſed in the following article and are diſtinguiſhed by the name of contraband goods.</p>
               <p>Art. 9. Under the name of contraband or prohibited goods ſhall be comprehended, arms, great guns, cannon balls, arquebuſes, muſquets, bombs, petards, granadoes, ſauciſſes, pitch, balls, carriages for ordinance, muſquet reſts, bandoliers, cannon powder, matches, ſalt-petre, ſulphur, bullets, pikes, ſabres, ſwords, morions, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, cuiraſſes, balbards, javelins, piſtols, holſters, belts, bayonets, horſes with their harneſs, and all other like kinds of arms and inſtruments of war for the uſe of troops.</p>
               <p>Art. 10. Theſe which follow ſhall not be reckoned in the number of prohibited goods, that is to ſay, all ſorts of cloaths, and all other manufactures of wool, flax, ſilk, cotton or any other materials, all kinds of wearing apparel together with the things of which they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made; gold, ſilver coined or uncoined, braſs, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, lead, copper, latten, coals, wheat, barley and all ſorts of corn or pulſe, tobacco, all kinds of ſpices, ſalted or ſmoaked fleſh, ſalted fiſh, cheeſe, butter, beer, oil, wines, ſugar, all ſorts of ſalt and proviſions which ſerve for the nouriſhment and ſuſtenance of man; all kinds of cotton, hemp, flax, tar, pitch, ropes, cables, ſails, ſail cloth, anchors, and any parts of anchors, ſhip-maſts, planks, boards, beams and all ſorts of trees and other things proper for building or repairing ſhips; nor ſhall any goods be conſidered as contraband, which have not been worked into the form of any inſtrument or thing for the purpoſe of war by land or by ſea, much leſs ſuch as have been prepared or wrought up for any other uſe. All which ſhall be reckoned free goods, as likewiſe all others which are not comprehended and particularly mentioned in the foregoing article; ſo that they ſhall not, by any pretended interpretation be comprehended
<pb facs="unknown:018828_0061_0FA81FE58F7A7A88"/>
among prohibited or contraband goods: on the contrary they may be freely tranſported by the ſubjects of the King and of the United States, even to places belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an enemy, ſuch places only excepted as are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, blocked or inveſted, and thoſe places only ſhall be conſidered as ſuch, which are nearly ſurrounded by one of the belligerent powers.</p>
               <p>Art. 11. In order to avoid and prevent on both ſides all diſputes and diſcords, it is agreed that in caſe one of the parties ſhall be engaged in a war, the ſhips and veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels belonging to the ſubjects or inhabitants of the other ſhall be furniſhed with ſea-letters or paſſports, expreſſing the name, property and port of the veſſel, and alſo the name and place of abode of the maſter or commander of the ſaid veſſel, in order that it may thereby appear that the ſaid veſſel really and truly belongs to the ſubjects of the one or the other party.—Theſe paſſports which ſhall be drawn up in good and due form, ſhall be renewed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very time the veſſel returns home in the courſe of the year. It is alſo agreed that the ſaid veſſels when loaded ſhall be provided not only with ſea-letters, but alſo with certificates containing a particular account of the cargo, the place from which the veſſel ſailed and that of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, in order that it may be known, whether they carry any of the prohibited or contraband merchandizes, mentioned in the 9th article of the preſent treaty; which certificates ſhall be made out by the officers of the place from which the veſſel ſhall depart.</p>
               <p>Art. 12. Although the veſſels of the one and the other party may navigate freely and with all ſafety, as is explained in the 7th article, they ſhall nevertheleſs be bound at all times when required, to exhibit as well on the high ſeas as in port, their paſſports and certificates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned. And not having contraband merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize on board for an enemy's port, they may freely and without hindrance purſue their voyage to the place of their deſtination. Nevertheleſs the exhibition of papers ſhall not be demanded of merchant ſhips under convoy of veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of war, but credit ſhall be given to the word of the officer commanding the convoy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:018828_0062_0FA81FE65BBD2688"/>Art. 13. If on producing the ſaid certificates, it be diſcovered, that the veſſel carries ſome of the goods which are declared to be prohibited or contraband, and which are conſigned to an enemy's port, it ſhall not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be lawful to break up the hatches of ſuch ſhips, not to open any cheſt, coffers, packs, caſks or veſſels, nor to remove the ſmalleſt part of the merchandizes, until the cargo has been landed in the preſence of officers appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the purpoſe, and until an inventory thereof has been taken; nor ſhall it be lawful to ſell, exchange or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienate the cargo or any part thereof, until legal proceſs ſhall have been had againſt the prohibited merchandizes, and ſentences ſhall have paſſed, declaring them liable to confiſcation; ſaving, nevertheleſs, as well the ſhips them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as the other merchandizes, which ſhall have been found therein, which by virtue of this preſent treaty, are to be eſteemed free, and which are not to be detained on pretence of their having been loaded with prohibited merchandize, and much leſs confiſcated as lawful prize. And in caſe the contraband merchandize be only a part of the cargo and the maſter of the veſſel agrees, conſents and offers to deliver them the veſſel, that has diſcovered them, in that caſe the latter, after receiving the merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes which are good prize, ſhall immediately let the veſſel go and ſhall not by any means hinder her from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing her voyage to the place of her deſtination. When a veſſel is taken and brought into any of the ports of the contracting parties, if upon examination ſhe be found to be loaded only with merchandizes declared to be free, the owner or he who has made the prize ſhall be bound to pay all coſts and damages to the maſter of the veſſel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly detained.</p>
               <p>Art. 14. It is likewiſe agreed that whatever ſhall be found to be laden by the ſubjects of either of the two contracting parties on a ſhip belonging to the enemies of the other party, the whole effects, although not of the number of thoſe declared contraband, ſhall be confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as if they belonged to the enemy, excepting never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſuch goods and merchandizes as were put on board before the declaration of war, and even ſix months after
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:018828_0063_0FA81FE716D33B30"/>
the declaration, after which term none ſhall be preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ignorant of it, which merchandizes ſhall not in any manner be ſubject to confiſcation, but ſhall be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and ſpecifically delivered to the owners who ſhall claim, or cauſe them to be claimed before confiſcation and ſale, as alſo their proceeds, if the claim be made within eight months and could not be made ſooner after the ſale, which is to be public: provided nevertheleſs, that if the ſaid merchandizes be contraband, it ſhall not be in anywiſe lawful to carry them afterwards to a port belonging to the enemy.</p>
               <p>Art. 15. And that more effectual care may be taken for the ſecurity of the two contracting parties, that they ſuffer no prejudice by the men of war of the other party, or by privateers; all captains and commanders of ſhips of his Swediſh Majeſty, and of the United States, and all their ſubjects, ſhall be forbidden to do any injury or damage to thoſe of the other party, and if they act to the contrary, having been found guilty on examination by their proper judges, they ſhall be bound to make ſatisfaction for all damages, and the intereſt thereof, and to make them good, under pain and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their perſons and goods.</p>
               <p>Art. 16. For this cauſe, every individual who is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of fitting out a privateer ſhall, before he receives letters patent or ſpecial commiſſion, be obliged to give bond with ſufficient ſureties: before a competent judge, for a ſufficient ſum to anſwer all damages and wrongs which the owner of the privateer, his officers or others in his employ may commit during the cruiſe, contrary to the tenor of this treaty, and contrary to the edicts publiſhed by either party, whether by the King of Sweden, or by the United States, in virtue of this ſame treaty, and alſo under the penalty of having the ſaid let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters patent and ſpecial commiſſion revoked and made void.</p>
               <p>Art. 17. One of the contracting parties being at war, and the other remaining neuter, if it ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that a merchant ſhip of the neutral power be taken by the enemy of the other party, and be afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:018828_0064_0FA81FE7E47BB0F0"/>
by a ſhip of war or privateer of the power at war, alſo ſhips and merchandizes of what nature ſoever they may be when recovered from a pirate or ſea rover, ſhall be brought into a port of one of the two powers, and ſhall be committed to the cuſtody of the officers of the ſaid port, that they may be reſtored entire to the true proprietor as ſoon as he ſhall have produced full proof of the property. Merchants, maſters and owners of ſhips, ſeamen, people of all ſorts, ſhips and veſſels, and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, all merchandizes and effects of one of the Allies or their ſubjects, ſhall not be ſubject to any embargo, nor detained in any of the countries, territories, iſlands, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, towns, ports, rivers or domains whatever of the other Ally, on account of any military expedition, or any public or private purpoſe whatever, by ſeizure, by force, or by any ſuch manner; much leſs ſhall it be lawful for the ſubjects of one of the parties to ſeize or take any thing by force from the ſubjects of the other party, without the conſent of the owner. This, however, is not to be underſtood to comprehend ſeizures, detenſions, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, made by order and by the authority of juſtice, and according to the ordinary courſe for debts or faults of the ſubject, for which proceſs ſhall be had in the way of right, according to the forms of juſtice.</p>
               <p>Art. 18. If it ſhould happen that the two contracting parties ſhould be engaged in a war at the ſame time, with a common enemy, the following points ſhall be obſerved on both ſides.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. If the ſhips of one of the two nations retaken by the privateers of the other, have not been in the power of the enemy more than twenty-four hours, they ſhall be reſtored to the original owner on payment of one third of the value of the ſhip and cargo. If on the contrary, the veſſel retaken has been more than twenty-four hours in the power of the enemy, it ſhall belong wholly to him who has retaken it.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. In caſe, during the interval of twenty-four hours, a veſſel be retaken by a man of war of either of the two parties, it ſhall be reſtored to the original owner on pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a thirtieth part of the value of the veſſel and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:018828_0065_0FA81FE88D2BE708"/>
and a tenth part of it has been retaken after the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four hours, which ſums ſhall be diſtributed as a grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication among the crew of the men of war that ſhall have made the recapture.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. The prizes made in manner above-mentioned, ſhall be reſtored to the owners after proof made of the property, upon giving ſecurity for the part coming to him who has recovered the veſſel from the hands of the enemy.</p>
               <p n="4">4th. The men of war and privateers of the two nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall reciprocally be admitted with their prizes into each others ports; but the prizes ſhall not be unloaded or ſold there until the legality of a prize made by Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh ſhips ſhall have been determined according to the laws and regulations eſtabliſhed in Sweden, as alſo that of the prizes made by American veſſels, ſhall have been determined according to the laws and regulations eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the United States of America.</p>
               <p n="5">5th. Moreover the King of Sweden, and the United States of America, ſhall be at liberty to make ſuch regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations as they ſhall judge neceſſary reſpecting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct which their men of war and privateers reſpectively ſhall be bound to obſerve with regard to veſſels which they ſhall take and carry into the ports of the two Powers.</p>
               <p>Art. 19. The ſhips of war of his Swediſh Majeſty and thoſe of the United States, and alſo thoſe which their ſubjects ſhall have armed for war, may with all freedom conduct the prizes which they ſhall have made from their enemies into the ports which are open in time of war to other friendly nations, and the ſaid prizes, upon enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid ports, ſhall not be ſubject to arreſt or ſeizure, nor ſhall the officers of the places take cognizance of the validity of the ſaid prizes which may depart and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted freely and with all liberty to the places pointed out in their commiſſions, which the Captains of the ſaid veſſels ſhall be obliged to ſhow.</p>
               <p>Art. 20. In caſe any veſſel belonging to either of the two States, or to their ſubjects, ſhall be ſtranded, ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrecked, or ſuffer any other damage on the coaſts or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the dominion of either of the parties, all aid and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:018828_0066_0FA81FEB15E49188"/>
ſhall be given to the perſons ſhipwrecked, or who may be in danger thereof, and paſſports ſhall be granted to them to ſecure their return to their own country. The ſhips and merchandizes wrecked, or their proceeds, if the effects have been ſold, being claimed in a year and a day by the owners or their attorney, ſhall be reſtored, on their paying the coſts of ſalvage, conformable to the laws and cuſtoms of the two nations.</p>
               <p>Art. 21. When the Subjects and inhabitants of the two parties, with their veſſels, whether they be public and equipped for war, or private, employed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, ſhall be forced by tempeſt, by purſuit of priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers and of enemies, or by any other urgent neceſſity, to retire and enter any of the rivers, bays, roads or ports of either of the two parties, they ſhall be received and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all humanity and politeneſs, and they ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all friendſhip, protection, and aſſiſtance, and they ſhall be at liberty to ſupply themſelves with refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, proviſions, and every thing neceſſary for their ſuſtenance, for the repair of their veſſels, and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing their voyage; provided always, that they pay a reaſonable price, and they ſhall not in any manner be detained or hindred from ſailing out of the ſaid ports or roads, but they may retire and depart when and as they pleaſe without any obſtacle or hindrance.</p>
               <p>Art. 22. In order to favour commerce on both ſides as much as poſſible, it is agreed, that in caſe a war ſhould break out between the ſaid two nations, which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, the term of nine months, after the declaration of war, ſhall be allowed to the merchants and ſubjects reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectively on one ſide, and the other, in order that they may withdraw with their effects and moveables, which they ſhall be at liberty to carry off or to ſell where they pleaſe, without the leaſt obſtacle; nor ſhall any ſeize their effects and much leſs their perſons during the ſaid nine months, but on the contrary, paſſports which ſhall be valid for a time neceſſary for their return, ſhall be given them for their veſſels and the effects which they ſhall be willing to carry with them. And if any thing is taken from them, or if any injury is done to them by
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:018828_0067_0FA81FEC4ED499B0"/>
one of the parties, their people and ſubjects, during the term above preſcribed, full and entire ſatisfaction ſhall be made to them on that account. The above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paſſports ſhall alſo ſerve as a ſafe conduct againſt all inſults or prizes which privateers may attempt againſt their perſons and effects.</p>
               <p>Art. 23. No ſubject of the King of Sweden ſhall take a commiſſion or letters of marque, for arming any veſſel to act as a privateer againſt the United States of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, or any of them, or againſt the ſubjects, people or inhabitants of the ſaid United States, or any of them, or againſt the property of the inhabitants of the ſaid States, from any Prince or State whatever, with whom the ſaid United States ſhall be at war. Nor ſhall any citizen, ſubject or inhabitant of the ſaid United States, or any of them, apply for or take any commiſſion on letters of marque, for arming any veſſel to cruize againſt the ſubjects of his Swediſh Majeſty, or any of them, or their property, from any Prince or State whatever with whom his ſaid Majeſty ſhall be at war. And if any perſon of either nation ſhall take ſuch commiſſions or letters of marque, he ſhall be puniſhed as a pirate.</p>
               <p>Art. 24. The veſſels of the ſubjects of either of the parties coming upon any of the coaſts belonging to the other, but not willing to enter into part, or being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into port, and not willing to unload their cargoes, or to break bulk, ſhall not be obliged to do it, but on the contrary ſhall enjoy all the franchiſes and exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are granted by the rules ſubſiſting with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to that object.</p>
               <p>Art. 25. When a veſſel belonging to the ſubjects and inhabitants of either of the parties, ſailing on the high ſea, ſhall be met by a ſhip of war or privateer of the other, the ſaid ſhip of war or privateer, to avoid all diſorder, ſhall remain out of cannon ſhot, but may always ſend their boat to the merchant ſhip, and cauſe two or three men to go on board of her, to whom the maſter or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the ſaid veſſel ſhall exhibit his paſſport, ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the property of the veſſel, and when the ſaid veſſel ſhall have exhibited her paſſport, ſhe ſhall be at liberty
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:018828_0068_0FA81FECCD1AFEE8"/>
to continue her voyage, and it ſhall not be lawful to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt or ſearch her in any manner, or to give her chace or force her to quit her intended courſe.</p>
               <p>Art. 26. The two contracting parties granted mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the liberty of having each in the ports of the other Conſuls, Vice Conſuls, Agents and Commiſſaries, whoſe functions ſhall be regulated by a particular agreement.</p>
               <p>Art. 27. The preſent treaty ſhall be ratified on both ſides, and the ratifications ſhall be exchanged in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

we conſider the magnitude of the prize we contended for, the doubtful nature of the conteſt, and the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner in which it has terminated, we ſhall find the greateſt poſſible reaſon for gratitude and rejoicing: This is a theme that will afford infinite delight to every benevolent and liberal mind, whether the event in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation be conſidered as the ſource of preſent enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the parent of future happineſs—and we ſhall have equal occaſion to felicitate ourſelves on the lot which Providence has aſſigned us, whether we view it in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, political, or moral point of light.</p>
            <p>The citizens of America, placed in the moſt enviable condition, as the ſole lords and proprietors of a vaſt tract of continent, comprehending all the various ſoils and cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of the world, and abounding with all the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and conveniences of life, are now, by the late ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory pacification, acknowledged to be poſſeſſed of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute freedom and independency: They are from this period to be conſidered as the actors on a moſt conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous theatre, which ſeems to be peculiarly deſignated by Providence for the diſplay of human greatneſs and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. Here they are not only ſurrounded with every thing which can contribute to the completion of private and domeſtic enjoyment, but Heaven has crowned all its other bleſſings by giving a fairer opportunity for political happineſs, than any other nation has ever been favoured with. Nothing can illuſtrate theſe obſervations more forcibly, than a recollection of the happy conjuncture of times and circumſtances, under which our republic aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed its rank among the nations. The foundation of our empire was not laid in the gloomy age of ignorance and ſuperſtition, but at an epocha when the rights of mankind were better underſtood and more clearly defined than at any former period; the reſearches of the human mind, after ſocial happineſs have been carried to a great extent; the treaſures of knowledge, acquired by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of Philoſophers, Sages and Legiſlators, through a long ſucceſſion of years, are laid open for our uſe, and their collected wiſdom may be happily applied in the eſtabliſhment of our forms of government; the free cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation
<pb facs="unknown:018828_0086_0FA81FFFD07B48B8"/>
of letters, the unbounded extenſion of commerce, the progreſſive refinement of manners, the growing libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of ſentiment, and above all, the pure and benign light of revelation, have had a meliorating influence on mankind, and encreaſed the bleſſings of ſociety. At this auſpicious period the United States came into exiſtence as a nation, and if their citizens ſhould not be complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free and happy, the fault will be entirely their own.</p>
            <p>Such is our ſituation, and ſuch are our proſpects; but notwithſtanding the cup of bleſſing is thus reached out to us; notwithſtanding happineſs is ours if we have a diſpoſition to ſeize the occaſion and make it our own; yet it appears to me, there is an option, ſtill left to the United States of America, that it is in their choice, and depends upon their conduct, whether they will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable and proſperous, or contemptible and miſerable, as a nation. This is the time of their political probation; this is the moment when the eyes of the whole world are turned upon them: This is the moment to eſtabliſh or ruin their national character for ever; this is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable moment to give ſuch a tone to our foederal government as will enable it to anſwer the ends of its inſtitution; or this may be the ill-fated moment for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing the powers of the union, and annihilating the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the confederation, and expoſing us to become the ſport of European politics, which may play one ſtate againſt another to prevent their growing importance, and to ſerve their own intereſted purpoſes; for, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſyſtem of policy the ſtates ſhall adopt at this moment, they will ſtand or fall; and by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation or lapſe it is yet to be decided, whether the revolution muſt ultimately, be conſidered as a bleſſing or a curſe— a bleſſing or a curſe, not to the preſent age alone, for with our fate will the deſtiny of unborn mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions be involved.</p>
            <p>With this conviction of the importance of the preſent criſis, ſilence in me would be a crime; I will therefore ſpeak to your Excellency the language of freedom and of ſincerity without diſguiſe; I am aware, however, that thoſe who differ from me in political ſentiment may
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:018828_0087_0FA820008BAAE488"/>
perhaps remark, I am ſtepping out of the proper line of my duty, and they may poſſibly aſcribe to arrogance or oſtentation, what I know is alone the reſult of the pureſt intention; but the rectitude of my own heart, which diſdains ſuch unworthy motives, the part I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to acted in life, the determination I have formed of not taking any ſhare in public buſineſs hereafter, the ardent deſire I feel, and ſhall continue to manifeſt, of quietly enjoying in private life, after all the toils of war, the benefits of a wiſe and liberal government, will, I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf, ſooner or later convince my countrymen, that I could have no ſiniſter views in delivering, with ſo little reſerve, the opinions contained in this addreſs.</p>
            <p>There are four things which I humbly conceive are eſſential to the well-being, I may even venture to ſay, to the exiſtence of the United States as an independent power,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. An indiſſoluble union of the States under one foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral head.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. A ſacred regard to public juſtice.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The adoption of a proper peace eſtabliſhment. And,</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. The prevalence of that pacific and friendly diſpoſition among the people of the United States, which will induce them to forget their local prejudices and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies, to make thoſe mutual conceſſions which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to general proſperity, and in ſome inſtances, to ſacrifice their individual advantages to the intereſt of the community.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the pillars on which the glorious fabric of our independency and national character muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported: Liberty is the baſis; and whoever would dare to ſap the foundation or overturn the ſtructure, under whatever ſpecious pretexts he may attempt it, will merit the bittereſt execrations and the ſevereſt puniſhment which can be inflicted by his injured country.</p>
            <p>On the three firſt articles I will make a few obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, leaving the laſt to the good ſenſe and ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thoſe immediately concerned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:018828_0088_0FA8200199574248"/>Under the firſt head, although it may not be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or proper for me in this place to enter into a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diſquiſition of the principles of the union, and to take up the great queſtion which hath been frequently agitated, whether it be expedient and requiſite for the ſtates to delegate a larger proportion of power to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, or not—yet it will be a part of my duty and that of every true patriot, to aſſert without reſerve, and to inſiſt upon the following poſitions: That unleſs the ſtates will ſuffer Congreſs to exerciſe thoſe prerogatives they are undoubtedly inveſted with by the conſtitution, every thing muſt very rapidly tend to anarchy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion: That it is indiſpenſable to the happineſs of the individual ſtates, that there ſhould be lodged ſomewhere, a ſupreme power, to regulate and govern the general concerns of the confederate republic, without which the union cannot be of long duration: That there muſt be a faithful and pointed compliance on the part of every ſtate, with the late propoſals and demands of Congreſs, or the moſt fatal conſequences will enſue: That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever meaſures have a tendency to diſſolve the union, or contribute to violate or leſſen the ſovereign authority, ought to be conſidered as hoſtile to the liberty and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency of America, and the authors of them treated accordingly: And Laſtly, that unleſs we can be enabled by the concurrence of the States, to participate of the fruits of the revolution, and enjoy the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial benefits of civil ſociety, under a form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo free and uncorrupted, ſo happily guarded againſt the danger of oppreſſion, as has been deviſed and adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the articles of confederation; that it will be a ſubject of regret that ſo much blood and treaſure have been laviſhed for no purpoſe, that ſo many ſufferings have been encountered without compenſation, and that ſo many ſacrifices have been made in vain. Many other conſiderations might here be adduced to prove, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an entire conformity to the ſpirit of the union, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exiſt as an independent power—it will be ſufficient for my purpoſe to mention but one or two, which ſeem to me of the greateſt importance: It is only in our
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:018828_0089_0FA8200401D07E28"/>
united character as an empire, that our independence is acknowledged, that our power can be regarded, or our credit ſupported among foreign nations. The treaties of the European powers with the United States of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, will have no validity on a diſſolution of the union —we ſhall be left nearly in a ſtate of nature; or we may find by our own unhappy experience, that there is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and neceſſary progreſſion from the extreme of anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy to the extreme, of tyranny, and that arbitrary power <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> moſt eaſily eſtabliſhed on the ruins of liberty abuſed to licentiouſneſs.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond article which reſpects the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of public juſtice, Congreſs have, in their late addreſs to the United States, almoſt exhauſted the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: —They have explained their ideas ſo fully; and have enforced the obligations the ſtates are under to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der compleat juſtice to all the public creditors, with ſo much dignity and energy, that in my opinion no real friend to the honor and independency of America, can heſitate a ſingle moment reſpecting the propriety of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with the juſt and honourable meaſures propoſed: If their arguments do not produce conviction, I know of nothing that will have a greater influence; eſpecially when we recollect that the ſyſtem referred to, being the reſult of the collected wiſdom of the continent, muſt be eſteemed, if not perfect, certainly the leaſt objectionable of any that could be deviſed, and that if it ſhould not be carried into immediate execution, a national bankruptcy, with all its deplorable conſequences, will take place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any different plan can poſſibly be propoſed and adopted. So preſſing are the preſent circumſtances! and ſuch is the alternative now offered to the ſtates!</p>
            <p>The ability of the country to diſcharge the debts which have been incurred in its defence, is not to be doubted—an inclination, I flatter myſelf, will not be wanting; the path of our duty is plain before us: Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty will be found, on every experiment, to be the beſt and only true policy; let us then as a nation be juſt, let us fulfil the public contracts, which Congreſs had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a right to make for the purpoſe of carrying on
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:018828_0090_0FA82005844A4C10"/>
the war, with the ſame good faith we ſuppoſe ourſelves bound to perform our private engagements; in the mean time, let an attention to the cheerful performance of their proper buſineſs as individuals, and as members of ſociety, be earneſtly inculcated on the citizens of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; then will they ſtrongthen the hands of government; and be happy under its protection; every one will reap the fruit of his labours; every one will enjoy his own acquiſitions without moleſtation and without danger.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate of abſolute freedom and perfect ſecurity, who will grudge, to yield a very little of his property, to ſupport the common intereſts of ſociety, and enſure the protection of government? Who does not remember the frequent declarations at the commencement of the war, that we ſhould be compleatly ſatisfied, if at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of one half we could defend the remainder of our poſſeſſions; Where is the man to be found who wiſhes to remain indebted for the defence of his own perſon and property, to the exertions, the bravery and the blood of others, without making one generous effort to repay the debt of honor and of gratitude? In what part of the continent ſhall we find any man, or body of men, who would not bluſh to ſtand up and propoſe meaſures purpoſely calculated to rob the ſoldier of his ſtipend and the public creditor of his due? And were it poſſible that ſuch a flagrant inſtance of injuſtice could ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, would it not excite the general indignation, and tend to bring down upon the authors of ſuch meaſures, the aggravated vengeance of Heaven? If after all, a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of diſunion or a temper of obſtinacy and perverſeneſs ſhould manifeſt itſelf in any of the ſtates; if ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious diſpoſition ſhould attempt to fruſtrate all the happy effects that might be expected to ſlow from the union; if there ſhould be a refuſal to comply with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions for funds to diſcharge the annual intereſt of the public debts; and if that refuſal ſhould revive again all thoſe jealouſies, and produce all thoſe evils which are now happily removed. Congreſs who have in all their tranſactions ſhewn a great degree of magnanimity and juſtice, will ſtand juſtified in the ſight of God and man;
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:018828_0091_0FA82005CEFBC120"/>
and the ſtate alone which puts itſelf in oppoſition to the aggregate wiſdom of the continent, and follows ſuch miſtaken and pernicious councils, will be reſponſible for all the conſequences.</p>
            <p>For my own part, conſcious of having acted, while a ſervant of the public, in the manner I conceived beſt ſuited to promote the real intereſt of my country; having in conſequence of my fixed belief, in ſome meaſure pledged myſelf to the army, that their country, would finally, do them compleat and ample juſtice; and not wiſhing to conceal any inſtance of my official conduct from the eyes of the world, I have thought proper to tranſmit to your Excellency the encloſed collection of papers relative to the half-pay and commutation granted by Congreſs to the officers of the army; from theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutations, my decided ſentiments will be clearly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, together with the concluſive reaſons which induced me, at an early period, to recommend the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this meaſure in the moſt earneſt and ſerious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. As the proceedings of Congreſs, the army and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, are open to all, and contain, in my opinion, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient information to remove the prejudices and errors which may have been entertained by any, I think it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to ſay any thing more, than juſt to obſerve that the reſolutions of Congreſs now alluded to, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly as abſolutely, binding upon the United States as the moſt ſolemn acts of confederation or legiſlation. As to the idea, which I am informed has in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances prevailed, that the half-pay and commutation are to be regarded merely in the odious light of a penſion; it ought to be exploded forever—that proviſion ſhould be viewed, as it really was, a reaſonable compenſation offered by Congreſs, at a time when they had nothing elſe to give, to the officers of the army for ſervices then to be performed—it was the only means to prevent a total dereliction of the ſervice; it was a part of their hire; I may be allowed to ſay, it was the price of their blood and your independency; it is therefore more than a common debt: It is a debt of honor; it can never be
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:018828_0092_0FA8200693B4D0A8"/>
conſidered as a penſion or gratuity, nor can be cancelled until it is fairly diſcharged.</p>
            <p>With regard to a diſtinction between officers and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, it is ſufficient that the uniform experience of every nation of the world, combined with our own, proves the utility and propriety of the diſcrimination: Rewards in proportion to the aids the public derives from them, are unqueſtionably due to all its ſervants. In ſome lines, the ſoldiers perhaps have generally had as ample a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for their ſervices, by the large bounties which have been paid to them, as their officers will receive in the propoſed commutation: In others, if beſides the donation of lands, the payment of arrearages of cloathing and wages (in which articles all the component parts of the army muſt be put upon the ſame footing) we take into the eſtimate the bounties many of the ſoldiers have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and the gratuity of one year's full pay, which is promiſed to all, poſſibly their ſituation (every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance being duly conſidered) will not be deemed leſs eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible than that of the officers; ſhould a farther reward, however be judged equitable, I will venture to aſſert, no one will enjoy greater ſatisfaction than myſelf, on ſeeing an exemption from taxes for a limited time (which had been petitioned for in ſome inſtances) or any other ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate immunity or compenſation, granted to the brave defenders of their country's cauſe: But neither the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or rejection of this propoſition will in any manner affect, much leſs militate againſt the act of Congreſs, by which they have offered five years full pay, in lieu of the half pay for life which had been before promiſed to the officers of the army.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude the ſubject of public juſtice, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not omit to mention the obligations this country is under to that meritorious claſs of veteran non-commiſſioned of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and privates, who have been diſcharged for inability, in conſequence of the reſolution of Congreſs of the 23d of April, 1782, on an annual penſion for life; their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſufferings, their ſingular merits and claims to that proviſion, need only be known, to intereſt all the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:018828_0093_0FA820074D2C3CF8"/>
of humanity in their behalf—nothing but a punctual payment of their annual allowance can reſcue them from the moſt complicated miſery—and nothing could be a more melancholy and diſtreſſing ſight, than to behold thoſe who have ſhed their blood, or loſt their limbs in the ſervice of their country, without a ſhelter, without a friend, and without the means of obtaining any of the neceſſaries or comforts of life, compelled to beg their dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread from door to door; Suffer me to recommend thoſe of this deſcription, belonging to your ſtate, to the warmeſt patronage of your Excellency and your Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary to ſay but a few words on the third to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic which was propoſed, and which regards particularly the defence of the republic: As there can be little doubt but Congreſs will recommend a proper peace eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the United States, in which a due attention will be paid to the importance of placing the militia of the union upon a regular and reſpectable footing—if this ſhould be the caſe, I would beg leave to urge the great advantage of it in the ſtrongeſt terms: The militia of this county muſt be conſidered as the palladium of our ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the firſt effectual reſort in caſe of hoſtility—it is eſſential therefore, that the ſame ſyſtem ſhould pervade the whole; that the ſame formation and diſcipline of the militia of the continent ſhould be abſolutely uniform, and that the ſame ſpecies of arms, accoutrements and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary apparatus, ſhould be introduced in every part of the United States: No one who has not learnt it from experience, can conceive the difficulty, expenſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, which reſult from a contrary ſyſtem, or the vague arrangements which have hitherto prevailed.</p>
            <p>If in treating of political points, a greater latitude than uſual has been taken in the courſe of this addreſs, the importance of the criſis and the magnitude of the object in diſcuſſion, muſt be my apology. It is, however, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my wiſh or expectation, that the preceding obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould claim any regard, except ſo far as they ſhall appear to be dictated by a good intention, conſonant to
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:018828_0094_0FA8200838FD9980"/>
the immutable rules of juſtice, calculated to produce a liberal ſyſtem of policy, and founded on whatever expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience may have been acquired, by a long and cloſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to public buſineſs: Here I might ſpeak with the more confidence from my actual obſervations, and if it would not ſwell this letter (already too prolix) beyond the bounds I had preſcribed myſelf, I could demonſtrate to every mind open to conviction, that in leſs time, and with much leſs expence than has been incurred, the war might have been brought to the ſame happy concluſion, if the reſources of the continent could have been proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought forth; that the diſtreſſes and diſappointments which have very often occurred, have, in too many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, reſulted more from a want of energy in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental government, than a deficiency of means in the particular ſtates; that the inefficacy of meaſures, ariſing from the want of an adequate authority in the ſupreme power, from a partial compliance with the requiſitions of Congreſs in ſome of the ſtates, and from a failure of punctuality in others; while it tended to damp the zeal of thoſe which were more willing to exert themſelves, ſerved alſo to accumulate the expences of the war, and to fruſtrate the beſt concerted plans; and that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement occaſioned by the complicated difficulties and embarraſſments, in which our affairs were by this means involved, would have long ago produced the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of any army, leſs patient, leſs virtuous, and leſs perſevering, than that which I have had the honour to command: But while I mention theſe things, which are notorious facts, as the defects of our foederal conſtitution, particularly in the proſecution of a war, I beg it may be underſtood, that as I have ever taken a pleaſure in grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledging the aſſiſtance and ſupport I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from every claſs of citizens, ſo ſhall I always be happy to do juſtice to the unparalleled exertions of the individual States on many intereſting occaſions.</p>
            <p>I have thus freely diſcloſed what I wiſhed to make known before I ſurrendered up my public truſt to thoſe who committed it to me. The taſk is now accompliſhed,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:018828_0095_0FA8200AE35E90C0"/>
I now bid adieu to your Excellency as the chief magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of your State: At the ſame time I bid a laſt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel to the cares of office and all the employments of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic life. It remains then to be my final and only requeſt, that your Excellency will communicate theſe ſentiments to your Legiſlature at their next meeting, and that they may be conſidered as the legacy of one who has ardently wiſhed, on all occaſions, to be uſeful to his country, and who, even in the ſhade of retirement, will not fail to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the divine benediction upon it.</p>
            <p>I now make it my earneſt prayer, that God would have you, and the State over which you preſide, in his holy protection; that he would incline the hearts of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens to cultivate a ſpirit of ſubordination and obedience to government; to entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another, for their fellow citizens of the United States at large, and particularly for their brethren who have ſuffered in the field; and finally, that he would moſt graciouſly be pleaſed to diſpoſe us all, to do juſtice, to love mercy, and to demean ourſelves with that chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, humility, and pacific temper of mind, which were the characteriſtics of the Divine Author of our bleſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and without an humble imitation of whoſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in theſe things, we can never hope to be a happy nation.</p>
