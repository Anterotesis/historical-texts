            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ORATION.</head>
            <p>GOD alone is immortal—Jehovah alone liveth forever.—Were immortality the lot of man; were it not appointed unto man once to die; could the practice of the ſublim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt virtues; could the prayers of the pious, or the bleſſings of a grateful nation have averted the ſtroke of Death; we ſhould not, my fathers, friends, and fellow citizens, have met to mourn the death of our beloved WASHINGTON. We ſhould not, at this time, have attuned our voices to mournful melody, or raiſed our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for comfort to the Great Source of conſolation in this day of our ſorrow. For our nation would yet have rejoiced in his life;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:038684_0004_1015B996CD0CB2C0"/>
and our children's children would have ſeen the man who gave them that liberty, which, I truſt in a merciful God, our children's children will ever enjoy.</p>
            <p>BUT never ending length of days are not the laurels, with which the Supreme Being crowns virtue; and WASHINGTON, the great and the good, is mingled with the clod of the valley. That voice, which inſpired us with courage in the hour of danger, ſhall no more be heard in the land; and that invincible arm, ſo often raiſed for our protection, is laid low in the duſt. But, though his voice is forever ſilent, yet he ſhall forever ſpeak to us by his great example. Gather then ye children of our political father, around his tomb, and hear the inſtructive leſſon of your parent's life.</p>
            <p>TRUE, my friends, no children of his loins lifted their little arms and raiſed their ſuffuſed eyes around his dying bed, to catch a father's laſt bleſſing; but WASHINGTON was not childleſs; he was the father of his country, the parent of millions; and who is there ſo mean among you, that is not of the happy number?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:038684_0005_1015B99A54E7BEE0"/>
ON this day, ſacred to family ſorrow, let every jarring paſſion be huſhed; and let the tomb of WASHINGTON be the grave of political animoſity. Often, fellow citizens, may we turn the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric page, often may we read leſſons of virtue in the volumes of the moraliſt; but alas! a thouſand volumes are too few to teach us what is virtuous and honourable. But the life of WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON is a compendium of inſtruction. His life is a practical treatiſe of the cardinal virtues. Would you learn how, to live? Read his life. Would you learn how to die? Viſit his dying bed.</p>
            <p>HE taught us how to live, and oh! too high a price for human knowledge, taught us how to die. Point me out a virtue which adorns man, and I will ſhew it to you brilliantly illuminated in his life.</p>
            <p>WOULD our youth learn that vigour of mind which incites to deeds of pith and moment, ſee the youthful WASHINGTON, in the dawn of life, purſuing alone his hardy career through the trackleſs deſert, to avert the tomahawk of the ſavage from the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of his countrymen; or ſee him protect the baffled troops of the expiring Braddock on the banks of the Monongahela.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:038684_0006_1015B99C80EBD700"/>
WOULD our fellow citizens be ſoldiers? Are they ambitious to command the armies of their country? View WASHINGTON on the heights near Boſton, teaching the hands of the untutored yeoman to war, and his fingers to fight.</p>
            <p>WOULD you poſſeſs that martial courage which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ſucceſs? Paſs the Schuylkill with WASHINGTON, on that tremendous night, when, warring with the embattled ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſuperior forces, he led in triumph the troops of Heffer.</p>
            <p>WOULD you imitate that fortitude which ſuſtains the hero in the dreadful hour of adverſity? Follow WASHINGTON through the Jerſies, at the head of his diſcomfited troops, when the laſt ſpark of American hope was coruſcated from his freeled breaſt.</p>
            <p>WOULD you learn that Chriſtian, that divine grace of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to your enemies? See him ſave the youthful ASGIL from ignominy and a diſgraceful death.</p>
            <p>WOULD you poſſeſs that dignified virtue of equanimity, in the poſſeſſion of Dictatorial power, and humility in the reſignation of it? Purſue WASHINGTON to the tented field, and read his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of his high Commiſſion of Commander in Chief of the armies of the United States.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:038684_0007_1015B99EC30DB148"/>
WOULD you impreſs modeſty, that ſeal of all the Virtues, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all your actions? Peruſe his official Letters.</p>
            <p>WOULD you entwine the laurels of glory round deeds like theſe? Then, like him, ſerve your country without pecuniary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</p>
            <p>DOES civil life delight you? Are you ambitious of ſerving your country with reputation in the civil grades of Society? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that gloomy, diſtracting period, which ſucceeded the cloſe of our War with Great Britain, when Americans knew not how to enjoy, in peace, that Liberty and Independence which their valour had won in war; when our nerveleſs general govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could only recommend meaſures, and the States receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their recommendations with indifference or contempt; when our American Government was trampled upon at home, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted from abroad; when the jarring States loſt ſight of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional good in their own individual intereſt; when all was tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult and confuſion; then remember how WASHINGTON, like the fabled god of the Ocean, raiſed his majeſtic head amidſt the political ſtorm, and ſtilled the madneſs of the people. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how he aſſociated with the Fathers of our land; traced the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038684_0008_1015B9A04FCFF170"/>
principles of our Government with his pen; and ſigned that great Charter of our Freedom, the Federal Conſtitution; and, as the Firſt Preſident of the United States, reduced to practice the tranſcendent theory of Government, which his wiſdom had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: and when he retired to private life, to prepare to mount to a world more congenial with his ſpirit, remember how like the prophet Elijah he dropt his mantle upon us in his laſt legacy to the people. Would you learn the true intereſt of America? Study attentively this precious relic; and as you ſtudy, bleſs, gratefully bleſs, the ſainted lips which pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
            <p>WOULD you learn to devote your whole lives to the ſervice of your country? See Waſhington, when new dangers threatened our country, again iſſue from the peaceful ſcenes of domeſtic life, from the boſom of his family, and inſpired by a love for you, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain arm his aged limbs for battle, and cloſe his well ſpent life in your ſervice.</p>
            <p>BUT there are many in this aſſembly, who may deſpair of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating theſe illuſtrious deeds; but to the meaneſt of you, in the humbleſt walks of private life, I repeat, copy WASHINGTON;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038684_0009_1015B93BB2069460"/>
for he was not only the glory the wonder of public, but the brighteſt ornament of private life.</p>
            <p>IF it be not your ambition, my humble friends, to be elevated in the armies or the councils of your country, yet would you fill the minor offices of ſociety? I point you to the great WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, once the leader of our armies; once and again the Firſt Magistrate of our Union; with all his bluſhing honours thick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, ſelling the place of a common juryman at a State Court in Virginia, and humbly thanking his fellows for raiſing him to the importance of their foreman.</p>
            <p>WOULD you excel as farmers? See WASHINGTON, the huſbandman, following his own plough, and tracing the furrow in his native fields.</p>
            <p>WOULD you become eſtimable in married life? Would you be loved and reſpected as affectionate huſbands? Where ſhall I ſhew you a brighter example of conjugal excellence? Would you know what a huſband WASHINGTON was; go to the mournful halls of Mount Vernon; ſeek there the ſorrowing widowed mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, who, with our nation this day, deplores her mighty loſs.—Oh! ſhe will tell you that though the ſame of her hero, his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038684_0010_1015B9A4C40BC440"/>
in council, his might in battle, have delighted her ears; yet it was the milder virtues of the huſband which touched her heart.</p>
            <p>MINGLE your tears with hers, my fair country women. They are the tears of virtue: and they adorn the faireſt cheek. Man may admire her fortitude, but it is the female heart alone which can participate in her griefs. When ſhe loſt a huſband, you loſt a friend. It was his arm which protected you, and the helpleſs innocence of your babes in the rage of battle; he reſpected your ſex in the perſon of this amiable woman; and will you not ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize with her in her affliction and ſorrow? Some of you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have been ſeparated from excellent men by the ſtroke of death. Oh! at thoſe ſolitary moments, when buſy, meddling memory, in barbarous ſucceſſion, muſters up the fond endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your tender heart; at thoſe cheerleſs moments when you recollect preſſing the clay cold hand of a dying huſband, wiping the clammy ſweat from his forehead, while his fixed eye balls gave the laſt look of affection upon you, and cloſed forever; when you remember that heart rending hour, when you thought all happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs flown from you forever, and you felt yourſelf alone, and the world was a blank before you; then, while your agonized bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038684_0011_1015B9A90836F378"/>
throb with anguiſh at your own loſs; think on the pangs of her who mourns a WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>BUT, to return to the delightful theme of his virtues, would you, my friends, practiſe charity?</p>
            <l>"He had an eye ſuffus'd with pity's ſofteſt drops,</l>
            <l>And a hand open as day to melting charity."</l>
            <p>He was the kindeſt neighbour, the humaneſt maſter, and the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt friend the world ever ſaw. In a word, he loved his country and reverenced his God. His belief in the Chriſtian verity was not oſtentatiouſly diſplayed from his lips; but he conformed to the outward duties of Religion; he reverenced the holy miniſters of the Goſpel, and I truſt his deeds are recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life.</p>
            <p>SUCH was the man whom we lament; and ſuch was the man whom the world applauds. The would is filled with the fame of our departed hero; and the ſighs we this day raiſe, and the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation we utter, will be reechoed acroſs the broad Atlantic. The citizens of France will weep over the corſe of their great precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the ſchool of Liberty; and Britiſh generoſity, in ſpite of Britiſh pride, will deplore the death of the man who, with ſtrong
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038684_0012_1015B9AB66E77900"/>
arm rent aſunder their empire.—While on the diſtant ſhores of Africa, if they are ſaddened with the report of his death, the ſooty native ſhall bleſs the memory of the man who, with his laſt breath, emancipated hundreds of their countrymen from the ſhackles of ſlavery. But though the world may do juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to his tranſcendent merit, it is we alone who can truly feel his loſs. Perhaps the ungenerous policy of European Courts may profit themſelves by our loſs; and ſudden invaſion may ſucceed his deceaſe. If, my fellow citizens, we of this generation ſhould be again expoſed to the ravages of foreign invaſion; if we ſhould again ſee our towns ſacked, and our wives and children again driven from their peaceful habitations by a ferocious, foreign ſoldiery; then ſhall we truly bemoan the death of WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON; for then, citizens of America, and then only, will you know the worth of the man you have loſt.</p>
            <p>BUT let us not ſpend our breath in unavailing ſorrow: let it be ours to profit by his great example.</p>
            <p>LET the aged among us, whoſe gray hairs give certain preſage that they ſhall ſoon follow him, conſole themſelves with the ſure and certain hope that they ſhall ſee him in the world of ſpirits.—</p>

LET thoſe, who are engaged in the active ſcenes of buſy life, when they would ſerve their generation, remember WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON: and though they may juſtly deſpair of imitating this great exemplar, let them reflect that the man who can achieve one ſolitary deed, or practiſe one virtue of WASHINGTON, will deſerve well of his country. Let our youth be taught to look to his conduct as their polar ſtar, in their paſſage through the boiſterous ocean of human life. And even, my little friends, who came with your parents to weep over the grave of your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical father; though you are too young to value his worth, or know your loſs; yet, if you would become the comfort of your parents, and the pride of your country, reflect, and let it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite your emulation, that this unrivalled hero, this delight of every heart, this matchleſs WASHINGTON was once an infant in the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. Thoſe lips, which ſpake a language which would have adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Roman Forum in Rome's proudeſt days, once liſped his native tongue with infantine accent. Once like you he was a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil of the ſchools, and his expanding virtues were marked only by his preceptors, and perhaps only appreciated by parental affection. Who, at that early day, could have foretold the revolution of our
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038684_0014_1015B9B0A7646190"/>
country? What prophetic ſpirit, "rapt into future times," could have pointed to the blooming boy, and ſaid, in that child you ſee the ſaviour of his country? Five millions of happy people ſhall bleſs him while he lives; a nation ſhall lament him when he dies.</p>
            <p>And who but the Omnifcient can declare that I do not, among the ſmalleſt of you, ſee ſome future ſtateſman who ſhall give energy to our public councils; ſome warrior who ſhall free our country from invaſion; or ſome little WASHINGTON, who, like his great predeceſſor, ſhall unite all talents and all hearts?</p>
            <p>THE hopes of our country, fellow citizens, are in the riſing gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration. In a few more haſty revolving years, the ſages, the warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, the ſtateſmen, who conducted our American revolution, will be numbered with the mighty dead. WASHINGTON is not; and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams ſtands on the ſummit of the age of man, plumes his wings, and prepares to mount to glory. Where are Greene, Warren, Mercer, and Montgomery? Where is the good Chittenden, who founded our ſtate? Alas! the places which once knew them ſhall know them no more. Where are the brave Starks and Warner, under whoſe banners many of you, who now hear me, fought the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038684_0015_1015B9B314718928"/>
battles of your country in yonder field of victory, and gave the firſt check to Britiſh ſuperiority in arms?</p>
            <p>WHERE are Fay and Walbridge; thoſe youthful heroes, who, when the deſolating Heſſians hung over you like a black cloud ſurcharged with deſtruction, though new in arms, girded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for war, and, in defence of your property, your wives, your little ones, this pleaſant town, and this temple went forth to the fight, fought like veterans, and ſealed their country's liberty with their blood. Their precious memory is embalmed in our hearts; but we ſhall ſee their faces no more. Their hope in the hour of diſſolution was fixed on God and the riſing generation. The conſolation of WASHINGTON in his dying hour was, that he ſaw the defenders of Liberty growing up around him—and that the Independence he had eſtabliſhed would be maintained by our poſterity to the lateſt generation.</p>
            <p>LET us not diſappoint his dying hopes. On this day, fellow citizens, on this wide extended continent, men of adverſe, politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſentiment have drowned their animoſity in the tears ſhed for our common loſs. On this day, good men, unhappily differing about the intereſts of their country, perhaps, equally dear to them
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038684_0016_1015B9B4972FAF28"/>
all, have forgotten their diſlike; and, like the children of one great family, are come to weep over their father's grave.</p>
            <p>THUS united in affliction, let us be united in love; and at this moment, while we recline over his bier, let us reſolve never more to ſeparate; but to inhabit the goodly heritage, which God has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us, like a band of brothers; and let it add to the glory of our lamented WASHINGTON, that he, who in his life, obtained for us Freedom and Independence, by his death bound us together in one bundle of fraternal love; "So,". ſhall it be ſaid of him as it was of the Ifraelitiſh man of might, "the dead which he ſlew at his death, were more than thoſe which he ſlew in his life."</p>
            <p>FINALLY, brethren, farewel—retire to your habitations; and if, perchance, your homes ſalute you with a father's honoured name; go, call your ſons; tell them of WASHINGTON; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them what a debt they owe their anceſtors, and make them ſwear to pay it, by tranſmitting down entire, thoſe ſacred rights which WASHINGTON obtained.</p>
