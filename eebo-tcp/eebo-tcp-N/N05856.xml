            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Edward</hi> the VIth being a Minor; Queen <hi>Mary</hi> being bent upon the Re-eſtabliſhment of Popery; and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being conſtantly employed in guarding againſt the Variety of Dangers to which the internal State of her own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, the Power of the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the general State of <hi>Europe,</hi> expoſed her. But notwithſtanding this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attention to <hi>North-America,</hi> and the little Regard <hi>England</hi> at firſt ſhewed to the Diſcovery of the CABOTS, I have ſhewed it to have been the earlieſt Diſcovery made; nor can it be annulled by any ſubſequent Diſcovery pretended by any other Country, nor by a neglect of the Improvement of it on our own part. However, as ſeveral <hi>European</hi> Treaties have ſince been made, eſtabliſhing by Stipulation that Right acquired at firſt by this Diſcovery to great Part of <hi>North-America,</hi> I ſhall not dwell upon the Effect of the Diſcovery, as confirming a Right, but proceed to ſtate the ſeveral <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi> Treaties, ſince made, relative to this Country; the Conveyances made to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> of Part of it by the Natives of the Country; the conſequential Grants of the <hi>Crown,</hi> and the Settlements made by his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Subjects.</p>

<note n="*" place="bottom">Nothing can be more impolitic, when we are engaged in a Confederacy againſt <hi>France,</hi> than to leave any Point to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined after the Concluſion of a Peace: for if we cannot get it conceded while the Confederacy ſtands and our Force is united, how can we obtain it when we are left alone upon the Diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Confederacy? The <hi>French</hi> have ſo often experienced the Benefit of this Imprudence on our ſide, that in all their Treaties they uſe every Artifice in their Power to obtain this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and they ſeldom miſs it. But when we recollect the weak and traiterous <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of this Country, who negociated the infamous Peace of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> we cannot wonder that the Intereſts of <hi>America,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould be referred to <hi>Commiſſaries</hi> after a Concluſion of a Peace.

But if prior Diſcovery and frequent Viſitation of a Country gives Title to it, we have an indubitable one to all that Country called <hi>New-Britain</hi> or <hi>Labradore,</hi> extending Southward from the before mentioned Promontory in N.

Three Years ago a Number of wealthy Merchants of the City of <hi>London</hi> peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for an excluſive Grant of this Country, for a Number of Years, on Terms that would have been very beneficial to the Public, as well as themſelves.

               <p>This <hi>New-England</hi> Company made many Grants of Land, one of which, in particular, in 1629, gives to Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorge</hi> and Captain <hi>Maſon</hi> all that Tract of Land lying from the Heads of <hi>Merrimack</hi> River, and <hi>Sagadaboc</hi> or <hi>Kenebeck</hi> River to the Lake <hi>Iroquois,</hi> now called by the <hi>French Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,</hi> and the River which empties itſelf from the ſaid Lake into St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> River oppoſite to St. <hi>Peter's Bay,</hi> to be called <hi>Laconia.</hi> Part of this Grant was afterwards ſold to the Agent of the <hi>Maſſachuſet's-Bay</hi> Province, and confirmed by the Crown in 1639.</p>
               <p>The <hi>London</hi> and <hi>New-England</hi> Companies, being diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in their Hopes of vaſt Wealth from their Projects, ſurrendered their Patents to the <hi>Crown</hi> in 1635.

Upon the Reſtoration of <hi>Charles</hi> II. thoſe Settlers petitioned for peculiar Grants, and had them; but it is not pertinent to my preſent Subject to trace Royal and other Grants for Lands to the Northward of 34 D. of Latitude any further.

Neither the Treaty of <hi>Breda,</hi> nor that of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> ſpecifies the Bounds of <hi>New-Netherlands,</hi> or <hi>New-Albion,</hi> but in general Terms cedes to <hi>England</hi> all the Rights and Poſſeſſions of the <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>North-America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Year the <hi>Dutch</hi> begun to ſettle in this Country, they entered into an Alliance with, and by Treaty did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Protection and Sovereignty of, the <hi>Five Nations</hi> of <hi>Indians</hi> then living on the South Side of St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> River, oppoſite to <hi>Montreal;</hi> who are known to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> under the Names of <hi>Mohawks, Oneydoes, Onondagas, Cayugas,</hi> and <hi>Senekas;</hi> and to the <hi>French</hi> by the general Name of <hi>Iroquois.</hi> This Alliance and Subjection continued without a Breach on either Side till 1664, when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> upon the taking

But as Treaties with the <hi>Natives</hi> of <hi>America</hi> by <hi>European</hi> Powers may not be thought ſufficient, or be admitted, in ſupport of a Claim to Property and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, in a <hi>European</hi> national Diſcuſſion, unleſs confirmed by a <hi>European</hi> Treaty between contending Nations for <hi>American</hi> Rights, I have not quoted any, or ſhall I, (though there are many ſubſiſting in almoſt every part of his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's North-American</hi> Dominions, as much to the Purpoſe of Property and Juriſdiction as thoſe of the <hi>Five Nations</hi>) but thoſe that relate to the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> becauſe they are fully and amply confirmed by <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> in the Treaties of <hi>Utrecht</hi> and <hi>Aix La Chapelle.</hi> They are there acknowledged to be Subjects of, and the Dominion over them is ceded to, the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> and it is ſtipulated that neither they, nor any other <hi>Indians,</hi> who were Friends to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould be moleſted by the <hi>French,</hi> but that the Subjects of both <hi>Crowns</hi> ſhould enjoy free Liberty of going and coming to the <hi>Colonies</hi> of either, for the Promotion of Trade as a common Benefit. But as the Treaties of <hi>Utrecht</hi> and <hi>Aix La Chapelle</hi> refer the Dominion of each <hi>Crown</hi> over all the <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>North-America,</hi> except the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> to be ſettled by Commiſſaries after the Ratifications were exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Treaties that have from time to time been made by his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Governments in <hi>North-America with the Indians,</hi>

               <p>Thoſe Ceſſions of the <hi>Five Nations</hi> confirmed by <hi>France to Great-Britain</hi> are of infinite more Importance than they appear to be at firſt ſight; for they are further and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive Proofs for the utter Excluſion of any <hi>French</hi> Pretenſions to the <hi>Five great Lakes, all the Country between the Lakes, all the River and Country of the</hi> Ohio, <hi>And a vaſt Extent of Territory beſides.</hi> But to have a nearer View, and to convey a more adequate Idea of the vaſt Importance of theſe Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, we muſt aſcertain what is the Extent of the <hi>Five Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> Hereditary and Conquered Country.</p>

               <p>The firſt Action after this Coalition happened upon the Banks of Lake <hi>Iroquois,</hi> and proved to the Diſadvantage of the <hi>Iroquois;</hi> for the <hi>French</hi> kept themſelves undiſcovered till the Moment they begun to join battle, and their Fire Arms ſurprized the <hi>Iroquois</hi> ſo much that they were put into Confuſion.

One Stratagem they made uſe of in this critical Conjuncture, was an Acceptance of an Offer made them by the Governor of <hi>Canada</hi> to ſend ſome <hi>French</hi> Prieſts among them; but as ſoon as they got them in their Poſſeſſion, they made no other Uſe of them than as Hoſtages to oblige the <hi>French</hi> to ſtand neuter.

But ſoon after they began to be in want of the <hi>European</hi> Commodities from the French, and in order to ſupply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they returned to <hi>Quebeck;</hi> and by this Means the Places of their Retreat was diſcovered to the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge not being yet ſatisfied, they immediately after attacked them in their new Settlements, and by the Year 1650 entirely extirpated or adopted all the Nations of <hi>Indians</hi> that reſided on both Sides the River St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> above <hi>Quebeck,</hi> and on both Sides the Lakes <hi>Ontario, Erie,</hi> and <hi>Huron:</hi> which they never could have accompliſhed had they not ſtrictly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed one Maxim formerly in uſe among the <hi>Romans, viz.</hi> the encouraging the People of other Nations to incorporate with them. Like them alſo when they have ſubdued any People and ſatiated their Revenge, by ſome cruel Examples, they adopt the reſt, who if they behave well enjoy the ſame Rank and Privileges with their own People, ſo that ſome of their Captives have afterwards become their greateſt <hi>Sachems</hi> and Captains. In 1672 they conquered and incorporated the <hi>Illinois Indians</hi> reſiding upon the River <hi>Illinois,</hi> which riſes near Lake <hi>Michigan,</hi> and diſembogues into the <hi>Miſſiſſipi.</hi> And they alſo then incorporated the <hi>Satanas</hi> that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly drove from the Lakes <hi>Ontario</hi> and <hi>Erie.</hi> And the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Illinois</hi> and <hi>Miſſiſſipi</hi> make the Weſtern Bounds of their Conqueſts, and of their Deed of Sale to the Crown of <hi>Great Britain</hi> in 1701.

The <hi>Twightwees,</hi> or <hi>Miamis,</hi> reſiding on the River <hi>Oubache</hi> or St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> they conquer'd in 1685.</p>
               <p>In ſhort the neareſt <hi>Indians,</hi> as they were attacked, fled to thoſe that were further off, where they followed them, and not only entirely ſubdued the vanquiſhed, but them that received them. And they carried their Arms and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts as far as <hi>New-England</hi> and the <hi>Utawawas</hi> River to

The <hi>Tuſearoras,</hi> that formerly lived in <hi>Carolina,</hi> upon their Expulſion from thence by the People of <hi>Carolina</hi> in 1711, fled to the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> and were incorporated with, and to this Day reſide among them.

               <p>For further Proof of their Right to the Country they have conquered, they have in all their Treaties with his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Governments reſpecting it, reſerved to themſelves a Right to demand a further Conſideration for all unſettled Lands that they, nor their Anceſtors, have not made particular Grants of to diſtinct Governments and received a valuable Conſideration for; and they always do demand a Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and have it, as our Settlements do extend further into their Country, before they will execute a Deed of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, inſiſting that the Country belongs to them in Right of Conqueſt, having bought it with their Blood, and taken it from their Enemies in fair War.

The Particulars of which Grants, and the <hi>Indian</hi> Manner of nogociating about Lands, with a full Account of their Treaties, may be ſeen in <hi>Colden</hi>'s judicious Hiſtory of the Five <hi>Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this Detail of hiſtorical Facts, it is plain that the Five <hi>Nations</hi> have a fair and indubitable Title to their hereditary and conquered Country, and they have on all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions availed themſelves of the Advantages reſulting from it.</p>
               <p>The Extent of their Right by Inheritance and Conqueſt is to the Eaſtward, on the South Side of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> the Weſtern Bounds of <hi>New-England,</hi> and on the North Side of that River, the <hi>Utawawas</hi> River and Lake <hi>Abitibis.</hi> Its South Weſtern Boundary is from Lake <hi>Abitibis</hi> to the North Eaſt End of Lake <hi>Michigan,</hi> and from thence thro' that Lake to the River <hi>Illinois,</hi> and from thence down that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the <hi>Miſſiſſipi.</hi> And its Weſtern Boundary is from the Confluence of the Rivers <hi>Illinois</hi> and <hi>Miſſiſſipi,</hi> as the latter runs South to <hi>Georgia.</hi> This is a vaſt Country, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending about twelve hundred Miles in Length from North to South, and from ſeven to eight hundred Miles in Breadth, where the Five <hi>Nations</hi> deſtroyed many Nations, of whom there are now no Accounts among the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But the French Geographers, <hi>D'Liſle, Du Fur, &amp;c.</hi> have in their late Maps limited their Rights Northward, to a South Weſt Line they have drawn from <hi>Montreal</hi> to Lake <hi>Toronto,</hi> where they alſo bound them to the Weſtward, and allow
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007434_0021_102D863DBB29A910"/>them only the Country between this Line and our Settlements. However, to point out the Miſtakes, or rather deſigned En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, of the Maps of <hi>America</hi> publiſhed in France, of late Years, by Authority, would be almoſt to copy the whole of them. Therefore it muſt give every <hi>Briton</hi> great Pleaſure to ſee our Countryman Dr. <hi>Mitchel,</hi> F. R. S. detecting their Miſtakes and deſigned Encroachments, and almoſt wholly reſtoring us to our juſt Rights and Poſſeſſions, as far as Paper will admit of it, in his moſt elaborate and excellent Map of <hi>North-America</hi> juſt publiſhed; which deſerves the warmeſt Thanks and Countenance from every good Subject in his Majeſty's Dominions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Five Nations</hi> never alienated any Part of their here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary or conquered Country to any but his <hi>Majeſty</hi> and his Subjects. But in 1672 the French, when at Peace with the Five <hi>Nations,</hi> perſuaded them to allow a Houſe to be built on the North Side of the Eaſt Entrance into Lake <hi>Ontario,</hi> under the Pretence of a Store for Merchandize. Under the ſame Pretence they built ſeveral other Houſes the next Year about the Lakes; but they ſoon converted theſe trading Houſes into ſuch Forts as the Five <hi>Nations</hi> could not reduce without Cannon and knowing how to uſe them. However they complained to the Governor of <hi>Canada</hi> of this Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and told him, <q>They could place no Confidence in the French, for under the Pretence of building Houſes that might be a Rendezvous for Merchants, and that only <hi>Beavers</hi> and Merchandize ſhould enter them, they had made them Places of Retreat for <hi>Soldiers,</hi> and for <hi>Arms and Ammunition</hi> of War; whereby they had ſtopped the Growth of the Tree of Peace that had been planted, and prevented its Branches from covering their Countries.</q> And the Governor of <hi>New-York</hi> proteſted alſo againſt theſe Forts as Encroachments upon the King of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>'s Territories. But notwithſtanding this, in 1684, the Year a Rupture broke out again with the French and Five Nations, they built another Fort, with four Baſtions, at <hi>Naigara</hi> Falls in the Streight between Lakes <hi>Ontario</hi> and <hi>Erie;</hi> which was alſo proteſted againſt by the Governor of <hi>New-York</hi> as <hi>P.

Lat. and from thence due Weſt to the <hi>Pacific Ocean,</hi> no Chriſtian Prince or People intervening, by the Name of <hi>Carolina.</hi> This Grant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the preſent Provinces of <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South Carolina</hi> and <hi>Georgia,</hi> and all the Province of <hi>Louiſiana,</hi> ſince uſurped by the <hi>French.</hi> In 1698 Col. <hi>Welch</hi> travelled from <hi>Charles-Town, South-Carolina,</hi> to the <hi>Miſſiſſipi</hi> River juſt below <hi>Old

In 1698 alſo, Sir <hi>Daniel Cox</hi> intended to revive a dormant Title to the Country granted as above to Sir <hi>Robert Heath,</hi> but finding the Eaſtern Coaſt already planted, he ſent two Ships into the Gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> under the Command of Capt. <hi>William Bond,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the South Coaſt of <hi>Carolina,</hi> and to make a Settlement there. One of the Ships entered the Miſſiſſipi River, and aſcended it above one hundred Miles, taking Poſſeſſion of the Country in the King's Name, leaving in ſeveral Places the Arms of <hi>England</hi> for a Memorial thereof. And Capt. <hi>Bond</hi> took ſeveral Draughts of the Coaſt and River as far as he diſcovered. And it was not till the Year following, when Sir <hi>Daniel Cox</hi> was ſoliciting a new Patent in <hi>England,</hi> that M. <hi>D' Iberville</hi> on the Part of <hi>France</hi> hit upon the Mouths of the Miſſiſſipi, and built a Fort at one of the Entrances, as would have been done the Year before by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> if one of their Ships had not deſerted them. From theſe Particulars relating to the South Coaſt we derive a further Right to the Country lying between the 29 and 36 D. 30 M. N. Lat. And on the Weſtern Side of it that is bounded by the <hi>Pacific Ocean,</hi> we ſtill have a further Right, founded on the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> in 1578, who explored the whole Sea Coaſt, took formal Poſſeſſion for <hi>England,</hi> and called the Country <hi>New-Albion.</hi>

Therefore in 1738, when the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> claimed a vaſt Tract of Country to the Northward of this River to prevent our ſettling it, as the Colony of <hi>Georgia</hi> was forming, it was ſtipulated between the two Crowns that <hi>Great-Britain</hi> ſhould not extend her Settlements to the Southward of the South Branch of St. <hi>John</hi>'s River.

But if they ſhould not further encroach on the Spaniards in <hi>New-Mexico,</hi> if they ſettle St. <hi>Bernard's-Bay,</hi> there cannot be any Doubt but they will avail themſelves of the greateſt Part of the Trade of New-Mexico; for by their Settlements at the Miſſiſſipi, they are come into a pretty handſome Share of it already, as fully appeared by the Capture of the <hi>Golden Lion</hi> from the Miſſiſſipi in the late War, which Ship had an immenſe Sum of Money on Board that ſhe took in at the Miſſiſſipi. And this could not come from thence if the <hi>French</hi> had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed their <hi>European</hi> Manufactures for it with the <hi>New-Mexicans.</hi> Therefore it is of the utmoſt Importance to <hi>Spain</hi> to deprive them of that Part of <hi>New-Mexico</hi> which they claim; and why they did not oblige <hi>France</hi> to annihilate this Claim at the Treaty of <hi>Utretcht</hi> is very eaſily accounted for, when we recollect <hi>Louis</hi> XIV. had juſt put his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on the Throne of <hi>Spain.</hi>

                  <q>Though our Claims may be valid againſt <hi>France,</hi> how came we by thoſe Rights and Poſſeſſions? They did not come to us by Inheritance? Prior Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and Pre-occupancy gives only a Right to derelict Lands, which thoſe of <hi>North-America</hi> were not, being full of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, who undoubtedly had as good a Title to their own Country as the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans</hi> have to theirs. Nor could our Right ariſe from Conqueſt, if we did conquer the Natives; as it is hard to conceive how a Conqueſt, where there was no preceding Injury or Provocation, could create a Right. Therefore all a <hi>European</hi> Power could give, was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive Grant to particular Subjects for negociating and purchaſing from the natural Lords and Proprietors, and thereupon a Power of Juriſdiction. We fear the firſt Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers of our Provinces never treated the <hi>Savages</hi> well, but encroached upon their Lands by Degrees till they fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently or forcibly turned them out of all, uſing the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Methods, in ſome meaſure, practiſed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi>

In ſhort, there is not one Work yet publiſhed to the World in our Language that in any Degree deſerves the Title of a <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>North-America,</hi> but <hi>Smith's Hiſtory of</hi> Virginia, <hi>and</hi> Douglas<hi>'s Summary, Hiſtorical and Political, of the firſt Planting, progreſſive Improvements, and preſent State of the</hi> Britiſh <hi>Settlements in</hi> North-America, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> publiſhed a few Years ago at <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>New-England.</hi> And this laſt is valuable for being the beſt Collection of Facts in general, for a future Hiſtorian, that was ever made or publiſhed.

Therefore I am ſorry to ſee the Author of the <hi>State of the</hi> Britiſh <hi>and</hi> French <hi>Colonies,</hi> &amp;c. who, I am confident, wrote with a View to inform and ſerve his Country, attempting to prove the Independency of the <hi>Five Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of <hi>Indians,</hi> who in almoſt every Treaty they ever made with his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Governments have acknowledged themſelves the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and have yielded their Dominions to the Sovereignty of this <hi>Crown;</hi> tho' it is true ſome of their Great Men, when they have been exaſperated on particular Occaſions, have inſiſted in Debate that they were born free, and would be ſo. And this is the only Authority, with a few of them having gone over to the <hi>French,</hi> that can be produced for their denying their Subjection, ſince it took place in 1664, or of their diſputing his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Right to their Territories ſince their Deed of Sale for them in 1701, except when the Conditions of their Deed has not been complied with, which ſometimes has happened till a Congreſs could be held by the Provinces with them. This Author has alſo propoſed a Plan for ſettling the Limits of <hi>North America</hi> with the <hi>French,</hi> whereby he gives the <hi>French</hi> Two Thirds of the Whole, for the Sake of enjoying the other Third in Peace and Quiet. Now can any Man, upon cool Reflection, imagine, that if the <hi>French</hi> are ſuffered to avail themſelves of, and ſettle, Two-Thirds of <hi>North-America,</hi> we ſhall enjoy the other Third in Peace? No; if we ſubmit to this, and may judge of the future by what is paſt, they will ſoon have the other Third alſo. And by making ſuch Propoſals, does it not look as if we doubted the Validity of our Right to the Whole of our Claim? Good God! why ſhould we give up an Inch of that Territory which is our juſt Right, when we are not only able to ſecure it to ourſelves, but to make the <hi>French</hi> hold what properly belongs to them by no other Tenure than that of the Mercy of the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Great-Britain?</hi> Therefore may Perdition ſeize every Propoſal that gives them an Acre of his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s juſt Rights and Poſſeſſions.</p>

                  </note> ſought to gain the Natives by ſtrict Juſtice in their Dealings with them, as well as by all the Endearments of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Humanity. To lay an early Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for a firm and laſting Friendſhip, they aſſured the <hi>Americans</hi> that they did not come among them as Invaders but Purchaſers, and therefore called an Aſſembly of them together to enquire who had the Right to diſpoſe of their Lands; and being told it was their <hi>Sachems</hi> or Princes, they thereupon agreed with them for what Diſtricts they bought, publickly and in open Market. If they did not pay a great Price for their Purchaſes, yet they paid as much as they were worth. For it muſt be conſidered that Lands were of little Uſe to the Natives, and therefore but of little Value. They lived chiefly on Fiſh and Fowl and Hunting, becauſe they would not be at the Pains to clear and break up the Ground. And as for their Meadows and Marſhes, they were of no Uſe at all, for want of Neat Cattle
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:007434_0034_102D865A2FBCDB10"/>to feed them, of which there were none in thoſe Parts of the World. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> had no ſooner made ſome neceſſary Proviſion for themſelves, than they applied their Cares for the Benefit of the <hi>Indians,</hi> by endeavouring to bring them from their wild Manner of Life to the civil and polite Cuſtoms of <hi>Europe.</hi> For this Purpoſe they marked out Land to build <hi>Indian</hi> Towns, ſupplied them with all proper Utenſils for Building, preſcribed to them Forms of Government, and above all omitted no Pains to bring them acquainted with the Goſpel; for whatever the firſt <hi>Adventurers</hi> to <hi>North-America</hi> might be, the firſt real <hi>Settlers</hi> were induſtrious, peaceable, conſcientious Perſons, diſſenting from the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of the eſtabliſhed Church, though agreeing with it in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> who removed into thoſe remote Regions, upon no other View than to enjoy the Liberty of their Conſciences without Hazard to themſelves, or Offence to others; they were not Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, nor were they neceſſitous; nor had they, with their Brethren, made any Attempt to overthrow the Church and State at Home, and being diſappointed therein went to <hi>America</hi> to ſecure a Retreat for their Brethren, as the high-flying Mr. <hi>Salmon</hi> vainly imagines, and moſt falſely and injuriouſly aſſerts they did. And what I ſay of them, their uniform proper Conduct, and meek Principles of Obedience, on all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, fully prove. After they were arrived ſome time, and it was found neceſſary, they made Laws to forbid any Perſon purchaſing Lands without the Approbation of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to prevent the Natives being over-reached, or ill uſed in their private Bargains: And thoſe Lands, lying moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for them, have in moſt of our Colonies been made unalienable, and never to be purchaſed out of their Hands, than which nothing could more demonſtrate the Colonies Care and Concern for the Natives. And this their Conduct to them is fully and concluſively proved by the Laws of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every one of our <hi>North-American</hi> Colonies. Yet nothing could oblige the <hi>Indians</hi> to Peace and Friendſhip in ſome of our Provinces. They were alarmed with ſtrong Jealouſies of the growing Power of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> therefore began a War with a Reſolution to extirpate them, before they had too well
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:007434_0035_102D865BC4223658"/>eſtabliſhed themſelves, which forced our People to purſue them through all their Receſſes, till they obliged them to enter into a ſolemn Treaty of Peace. Such however was the perfidious Nature of ſome of the <hi>American</hi> Savages, that they ſoon renewed their Hoſtilities, though to their own fatal Coſt. And ever ſince the Settlement of the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Canada,</hi> many Tribes of <hi>Indians</hi> have almoſt conſtantly, both in Peace and War with the <hi>Two Crowns,</hi> been animated and aſſiſted by them to war againſt ſome one or other of our Colonies, and have given them but few Intervals of Peace, and thoſe very ſhort ones, to this Day.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all the wiſe, juſt, and humane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our Colonies, in a legiſlative Character, which has alſo been extended to all Dealings and Intercourſe with the Natives, I am ſenſible great Frauds and Abuſes have been impoſed upon the <hi>Indians</hi> by private People, in Defiance of the ſevereſt Laws, and the moſt punctual Execution of them on Offenders when detected. But Experience daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces us that in the wiſeſt and beſt regulated Societies, Laws framed with the greateſt Care, and the niceſt Judgment, are eluded and violated; and therefore no wonder if Infant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ſhould find the ſame Diſregard to Laws, which is to be ſeen uncorrected under Governments of the longeſt Duration and moſt improved Policy. Conſequently there would be juſt as much Propriety in charging the People of <hi>Great Britain</hi> with being Sharpers, Thieves, Robbers, and Murderers, becauſe every Month a Dozen or two of Perſons in this Kingdom are convicted of, and puniſhed for, theſe Crimes, and many more eſcape both; as it is to charge the Colon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s with Frauds, Abuſes, Encroachments, and Murders upon the poor <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> becauſe a few among them have been ſo hardy and diabolical as to perpetrate ſuch Villainies, ſome of whom have been puniſhed, and ſome have eſcaped.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Claims in <hi>North-America</hi> are not only valid in Oppoſition to thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> but he alſo derives a Right from the <hi>native</hi> Proprietors of the Soil, his Subjects there having purchaſed part with their Money, and the reſt has been yielded to them by the true Owners, who
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:007434_0036_102D865F027034E0"/>have put themſelves and their Lands under the Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and Protection of the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> that they might be ſecured againſt the Encroachments and Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the <hi>French.</hi> And the Right reſulting from the Purchaſes and Ceſſions of the Natives, as much as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried and undervalued by ſome People, is in fact the only juſt and equitable one. Therefore I am extremely ſorry to ſee any of his Majeſty's Subjects, at this critical Conjuncture eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, endeavouring to prove that we derive no Title from the <hi>Natives,</hi> and that they are not the Subjects of the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> for it not only gives <hi>France</hi> a handle againſt us, but it makes many of his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s ſober and thinking Subjects doubt the Juſtice of our Cauſe, and when this is the Caſe they do not aſſiſt in the common Cauſe with that Spirit and Ability they otherwiſe would do, and which was never wanted to be exerted to the utmoſt, more than at this preſent Time.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> SHALL ſtate the <hi>French</hi> Encroachments and Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations in each of his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Provinces of <hi>North-America,</hi> as the Continent is now divided by the Authority of the <hi>Crown,</hi> beginning to the <hi>Northward;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſhall have a clearer Idea of their Situation and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and of the Propriety of the Meaſures hereafter to be humbly propoſed for extirpating the <hi>French</hi> and their <hi>Indians</hi> out of his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Territories.</p>
               <p>Since the Peace of <hi>Aix La Chapelle</hi> they have erected in <hi>Nova-Scotia</hi> one Fort at <hi>Beau baſſin</hi> in the Cod of the <hi>Bay of Fundy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">French <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments and Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations in his Majeſty's Province of</hi> Nova-Scotia</note> and on the South Side of the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of the South Eaſtern Peninſula. And another Fort at <hi>Baye Verte</hi> on the North Side of this <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> which is not more than twelve Miles wide between theſe two Forts. From hence they have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the <hi>Cape Sable,</hi> or <hi>Mickmac,</hi> and the <hi>Iſland</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Indians,</hi> who make about three hundred fighting Men, with Arms, Ammunition, Proviſions and Cloathing. Upon our Attempt to colonize this Province immediately after the late War with <hi>France,</hi> they ſpirited up theſe <hi>Indians</hi> to war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, by their ample Supplies; by their giving them a large Bounty for every <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoner they brought to them, and a much larger for every <hi>Engliſh</hi> Scalp they could produce;
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:007434_0041_102D866AC119FF68"/>by their promiſing to protect them in their Forts; and by diſguiſing themſelves and occaſionally joining the <hi>Indians</hi> in their Enterprizes againſt our Settlements. With theſe three hundred <hi>Indians</hi> they have conſtantly harraſſed our infant Colony of <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> ſo that we have made no Settlements but what have been fortified and picketed all round, which has been attended with vaſt Expence. Indeed it is hard to conceive what Diſtreſs this handful of <hi>Indians</hi> have reduced this Colony to. They cannot clear and break up the Ground, nor plant nor ſow without their Pickets, nor go from one Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage to another for Relief without imminent Danger, from ſkulking <hi>Indians,</hi> of being killed and having their Scalps car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away for the French Bounty, or of being taken and either put to Death in the moſt cruel Torments that ſavage Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality can invent, or of being carried away Captive to the French, who have afterwards inſiſted on a Price for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, equal to the Price <hi>black Slaves</hi> are ſold for in our Colonies, under the ſpecious Pretence of their having paid it to the <hi>Indians</hi> to ſave from being put to Death. Thus the French have made us pay the very Bounty they gave the <hi>Indians</hi> for captivating our People. The <hi>Indians</hi> ſurprized the Village of <hi>Dartmouth</hi> one Night, and altho' it had a Guard of Soldiers and was picketed in, they burnt the Houſes, and put both Men, Women and Children to death. And from our firſt Attempt to ſettle it ſince the late War with <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> have been killing or captivating our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whenever Opportunity preſented.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> alſo, as ſoon as they had built thoſe two Forts, threatened to deſtroy all the <hi>French</hi> Subjects of his <hi>Majeſty</hi> and burn their Settlements without their Forts on the Peninſula, if they did not retreat into the Country within their Forts; therefore they, who have always inclined to the <hi>French</hi> on account of their Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho' ever indulged in the free Exerciſe of that and every thing elſe, burnt their Houſes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed their Plantations, and went under the Prorection of the <hi>French,</hi> who aſſured them of ample Amends for their Loſſes and Sufferings. Here they are protected and nouriſhed in an Antipathy to his Majeſty, his Government, and his
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:007434_0042_102D866D4E1FA578"/>People, and prove as good Subjects to the <hi>French King</hi> as any he has in <hi>America.</hi> Theſe People became the Subjects of the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> when <hi>Nova-Scotia</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in 1710, upon Condition they did not take up Arms for, nor againſt us. But, contrary to their Oaths of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, many of them have been detected in joining the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> both in Peace and War againſt his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Subjects. There may be in this Province about ten thouſand of theſe <hi>French Neutrals,</hi> as they are called, though ſome make them amount to fifteen thouſand, and others but to ſeven thouſand. Thus the <hi>French</hi> have a powerful Colony in the Heart of this his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Province.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> have alſo re-built a Fort in this Province ſince the Peace of <hi>Aix La Chappelle,</hi> at the Entrance into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iver of St. <hi>John</hi>'s, on the Weſtern Side of the Bay of <hi>Fundy</hi> oppoſite to, and diſtant ten Leagues from <hi>Annapolis-Royal;</hi> by which they have the Command of the River St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Indians,</hi> being about an hundred and fifty fighting Men, whom they occaſionally iſſue upon the People of the North-Eaſt Parts of <hi>New-England.</hi> At the Entrance into this River there is a capacious Road for Ships of any Burthen, and on the North-Side of the Road is a Streight, not Piſtol Shot over, through which there is no paſſing but at the Top of the Tide when the Water is upon a Level, for at other times the Fall is ſo conſiderable, eſpecially at low Water, as to make a Deſcent of thirty Feet. This Entrance on which the <hi>French</hi> Fort ſtands, is lined on both Sides by a ſolid Rock, and has more than forty Fathom of Water in its Middle. When you have paſſed this Streight the River ſpreads itſelf half a Mile in Width, and with a gentle Current towards its Outlet admits a delightful Navigation for large Ships, ſixty Miles into the Country, and much further for ſmaller Veſſels; taking its Source from three parts of St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> River, one of which is directly oppoſite to <hi>Quebeck.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> have often conveyed Succours and Merchandize from <hi>Old France</hi> to <hi>Quebeck,</hi> both in Peace and War, up this River, to avoid the Difficulty and Riſque of the Navigation of St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> River. By this River alſo they, as Occaſion requires, convey
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:007434_0043_102D866F33F6A490"/>Troops and Stores from <hi>Quebeck</hi> to the <hi>Neutral French,</hi> the <hi>Indians,</hi> and their other Forces in <hi>Nova-Scotia.</hi> And if they are ſuffered to remain in Poſſeſſion of this River they may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have a Communication between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Canada</hi> in Winter, which they cannot have only from <hi>May</hi> to <hi>October</hi> by St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> River, and they will at all times have a much more ſafe and eaſy Conveyance to and from <hi>Canada</hi> than by St. <hi>Lawrence.</hi> But what is more material they will be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a Harbour, more commodiouſly ſituated for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noying the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies, by Men of War and Privateers in Time of War, than that <hi>American Dunkirk Louiſbourg</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and at all times a convenient Port near the Ocean for furniſhing Naval Stores to <hi>Old France,</hi> and their <hi>Sugar</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies with <hi>Lumber</hi> of all ſorts for the Conſtruction of Dwelling Houſes, Sugar Mills, and Caſk to contain their Iſlands pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, which is what they have long aimed at, but never could ſecure before. In ſhort there is not one Advantage we derive from the four Provinces of <hi>New-England,</hi> that they will not reap from this River when the Country comes to be fully ſettled by them. And they are bent upon ſecuring a Footing upon or near the <hi>Atlantic</hi> Ocean, as they have not one Port, or any Territory in their own <hi>North-American</hi> Colonies near it, but the Iſlands in the Gulf of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> which yield them nothing but a Security for their Fiſhery, and a Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to diſtreſs and annoy our Colonies, and their Trade and Navigation, in Time of War. The <hi>French</hi> alſo deny our Right to navigate or viſit any Part of <hi>Nova-Scotia</hi> in the Gut of <hi>Canſo</hi> and Gulf of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> or to viſit and ſettle <hi>Canſo,</hi> which we ſettled ſoon after the Peace of <hi>Utrecht</hi> as part of <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> and carried on our principal Fiſhery at, till the late War when they took it from us; but Sir <hi>William Pepperell</hi> recovered it in his way to the Siege of <hi>Louiſbourg.</hi> And every Year ſince the Peace of <hi>Aix La Chapelle</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> and the Commanders in Chief of the Men of War that have been ſtationed there, have given public Notice that they will ſeize and confiſcate all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſels they find at <hi>Canſo,</hi> the Gut of <hi>Canſo,</hi> or in the Gulf of St. <hi>Lawrence.</hi>

By thoſe three Forts they have availed themſelves of all the Province of <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> except the <hi>South-Eaſtern</hi> Penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula. And although they do not diſpute our Right to this, except <hi>Canſo</hi> and the Harbours in the Gulf of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> they have not ſuffered us to enjoy it ſince the Peace of <hi>Aix La Chapelle,</hi> but by their Encroachments and Depredations have ſo annoyed and diſtreſſed us, that we have not been able to do any more towards ſettling, even the Peninſula, than to eſtabliſh four ſmall Towns, and build four ſmall Forts, which has been accompliſhed with vaſt Expence of Blood and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. I think the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> have granted ſince the late War 450,000 <abbr>

                  </abbr> for ſettling and ſecuring <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> and all we have to ſhew for this immenſe Sum is the above four Towns or Villages, and four Forts.</p>
               <p>Since the Peace of <hi>Utrecht</hi> the French have ſettled ſeven Villages in the Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſets-Bay</hi> on the South Banks of St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> River between the Iſle of <hi>Orleans</hi> and the Mouth of <hi>Iroquois,</hi> or <hi>Sorrel</hi> River.

Theſe <hi>Indians</hi> have, both in Peace and War with the French, been provoked by them to annoy and diſtreſs our young Settlements on the Eaſtern Frontier of this Province, and they have killed, ſcalped, and captivated many of our People, even ſince the Peace of <hi>Aix La Chapelle;</hi> but the Government of the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſets,</hi> by building two Forts laſt Year on <hi>Kennebec</hi> River, and poſting one hundred Men in each, keep them in great Awe, and they dare not act againſt us at preſent.

For the Management of Trade with them, a Commiſſary General is appointed by the Legiſlature, and convenient Store Houſes have been many Years built, where they may at all times be accommodated with every thing they require at no more than Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> advance upon the original Coſt at <hi>Beſton</hi> by wholeſale for ready Money, and they are allowed the full Price their <hi>Furs</hi> and <hi>Skins</hi> will yield at the <hi>Boſton Market,</hi> which is vaſtly more profitable to them than the French can poſſibly ſubmit to. But notwithſtanding all theſe wiſe and juſt Regulations, and frequent Subſidies, the Addreſs, Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, and unwearied Pains of the French Prieſts, who live among them, and conform to their Manner of Life in every reſpect, by which they are ſo diſguiſed as frequently to be taken for <hi>Indians,</hi> has proved ſuperior to all our Efforts, and they will do nothing without their Advice and Conſent, but when awed by Force; therefore the Governor of the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets</hi> carried one Thouſand Soldiers with him laſt Year to force them to renew Treaties, and permit the two Forts to be built, and nothing but a ſuperior Force will ever be able to rival French Prieſtcraft and Uſefulneſs, for moſt of theſe Prieſts are good Mechanics, and prove vaſtly ſerviceable to the <hi>Indians</hi> in the common Concerns of Life.</p>
               <p>Since the Peace of <hi>Aix La Chapelle</hi> the French have built a Fort at <hi>Cowaſs</hi> or <hi>Cohoſſer</hi> on <hi>Connecticut</hi> River in the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi>

               <p>Two hundred French <hi>Indians,</hi> accompanied by ſome <hi>Canadeans</hi> diſguiſed like <hi>Indians,</hi> made an Irruption into this Province laſt Year, ſurprized the Town of <hi>Houſack,</hi> ſacked and burnt it, and maſſacred and captivated both Men, Women and Children, except a very few that ran away.</p>

               <p>They have been continually, ſince the Peace of <hi>Aix La Chapelle,</hi> uſing every Artifice, and frequently Force, to draw off the <hi>Indians</hi> in this Province as well as in all the reſt from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt. Laſt Year they perſuaded one half of the <hi>Onondago Indians,</hi> one of the Five <hi>Nations,</hi> with ſeveral from the other Nations, to remove from the Place of their uſual Reſidence to a Place called <hi>Oſweegachic</hi> on the River <hi>Cadaraqui,</hi> where they have built them a Church and Fort. Many of the <hi>Senekas,</hi> the moſt numerous Nation of the Five, appear to be wavering and rather inclined to the French. In ſhort, a great Defection manifeſts itſelf among all the Five <hi>Nations,</hi> for not more than a hundred and fifty of the ſeveral Nations attended the Congreſs held at <hi>Albany</hi> laſt Year, though they had notice that all his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Governments would have Commiſſioners there with Preſents from moſt Provinces as well as from the <hi>King,</hi> and on all preceding like Occaſions there were never leſs than ſix or ſeven hundred. The utmoſt that could be obtained of them at this Meeting, was an Agreement to ſtand neuter in our Diſputes with the French, for they unanimouſly declared, that ſo far from acting againſt the French they ſhould be obliged to make the beſt Terms they could with them, in order to preſerve themſelves and their Country from being deſtroyed by their powerful Arms. The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they obſerved, would not fight for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and as for them they could not defend their own
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:007434_0048_102D867B01D1AED8"/>Country and that of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> too. But if they ſaw the <hi>Engliſh</hi> act powerfully, and that their own Country, Wives, and Children were ſafe while they went forth to War, they then ſhould be glad to meet the Governor of <hi>New-York</hi> and the Commiſſioners again, for it was againſt their Inclination to treat with the French, but Neceſſity compelled them. Therefore if ſome bold Stroke is not ſoon made to retrieve our loſt Reputation and the wonted Confidence and Friendſhip of this brave and faithful People, who upon all other Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have been our beſt Friends and have it in their Power to be our worſt Enemies, ſo as to act in our Favour and to influence their Allies and Tributaries, who, together with the Five <hi>Nations,</hi> make ſeventeen thouſand Men, to do the ſame, we ſhall not only loſe the Aſſiſtance of the whole <hi>Indian</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>North-America,</hi> but have it turned againſt us. For <hi>Indians,</hi> like more refined and politer Nations, will not join the Weakeſt, eſpecially when their own Country is in danger from the Strongeſt in the Field; and it is impoſſible for their <hi>Sachems</hi> to reſtrain their young Men, who delight in War more than any thing elſe, when all their Neighbours are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and the Sound of War echoes from Hill to Hill all around them.</p>

               <p>In 1730 they utterly extirpated the whole Tribe (except a few that eſcaped to the <hi>Chickaſaws</hi>) of <hi>Indians</hi> called <hi>Nautchee,</hi> that reſided about the Forks of the River <hi>Yaſou</hi> which riſes in this Province not very far from, and empties itſelf into, the Miſſiſſipi. The French did this when they were in profound Peace with theſe <hi>Indians</hi> under the Sanction of a formal Treaty; but finding they continued an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and Trade with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they fell upon them in the Night, and maſſacred Men, Women, and Children, not ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even thoſe they took alive, but put them to death in the moſt inhuman and cruel Torments. This Perfidy and
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:007434_0051_102D8680B2C4D768"/>Cruelty of the French being communicated to the <hi>Chickaſaw Indians</hi> who reſide a little to the Northward of the <hi>Nautchees</hi> Country, and they fearing the like Fate, as they were in the ſtricteſt Friendſhip and conſtantly traded with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they declared War againſt the French, and it has not been in the Power of all their own Force and Policy to prevail on them to make Peace to this Day, nor could they ever prevail on any other Indians to join againſt them, as they are remarkable for Faith and Bravery, as their War is eſteemed juſt and neceſſary, and as they are highly revered for their Military Atchievements. Theſe <hi>Chickaſaws</hi> have been as ſevere a Scourge to the French Colony of <hi>Louiſiani,</hi> as any of their <hi>Indians</hi> have been to any of our Colonies; but their long and conſtant Hoſtilities againſt the French have reduced them to four hundred fighting Men only, who continue the War with as much Spirit and Intrepidity as ever.</p>
               <p>The French of <hi>Louiſiani</hi> have entirely alienated the <hi>Chauctas</hi> from our Intereſt, who reſide in their Neighbourhood between the <hi>Mobile</hi> and <hi>Miſſiſſipi,</hi> and amount to five thouſand fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men.</p>
               <p>And by their Fort at <hi>Alibamous</hi> they have obtained ſuch Influence among the <hi>Upper Creek Indians,</hi> amounting to one thouſand two hundred Men, that they would have broke out againſt <hi>Carolina</hi> and <hi>Georgia</hi> ſeveral times, if it had not been for the Interpoſition of the <hi>Lower Creeks,</hi> who amount to one thouſand three hundred Men, and are our faſt Friends.</p>
               <p>From this Deduction of French Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it appears that they have drawn a Line,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> French <hi>have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded his Majeſty</hi>'s <hi>Colonies with Forts,</hi> &amp;c.</note> and have a Chain of Forts and Settlements, all along the Back of our Settlements from the Gulf of St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> to the Mouths of the Miſſiſſipi in the Gulf of <hi>Mexico,</hi> whereby they have accompliſhed their ancient Deſign of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding the <hi>Britiſh Northern Colonies</hi> Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of fortifying themſelves on the Back thereof, of taking Poſſeſſion of the moſt important Paſſes of the great Rivers and Lakes, and of drawing off the <hi>Indians</hi> to their Intereſt, who they have more or leſs conſtantly, both in Peace and War,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:007434_0052_102D86846810D600"/>iſſued from their Forts on our Frontier Settlements, ſome of which they have deſtroyed, others they have impeded the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of, and in moſt of our Provinces prevented the projecting or making new Eſtabliſhments. For there is nothing more terrible than <hi>Indian</hi> Wars, and whenever they happen the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants eat their Bread in continual Fear and Trembling; no Man is ſure when out of his Houſe of ever returning to it again; while they labour in the Fields they are under terrible Apprehenſions of being killed and ſcalped, or of being ſeized and carried to the <hi>Indian</hi> Country, there to end their Days in cruel Torments, or be turned over to the French to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed at the Price of <hi>Black Slaves.</hi> They are many times obliged to neglect both their Seed Time and Harveſt. The Landlord often ſees all his Land plundered, his Houſes burnt, and the whole Country ruined, while they can't think their Perſons ſafe in their Fortifications. In ſhort, all Trade, Buſineſs, and Commerce is at an entire Stand, while Fear, Deſpair, and Miſery appears in the Faces of the poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</p>
               <p>I ſay, this Conduct of the French is in Conſequence of an ancient Deſign or Syſtem, and it certainly is ſo, for all their Governors and Writers of the Northern Colonies have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly recommended it to the Court of France, who, we are now fatally convinced, have carried it ſyſtematically into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. And our Colonies have as conſtantly remonſtrated to the Court of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> theſe Encroachments and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations, and the further terrible Conſequences they had the utmoſt Reaſon to expect from them. But it is now too late in a great meaſure, and therefore to little Purpoſe, to enquire further why we neglected to exert the Power God and Nature put into our Hands to prevent theſe Evils, or to remove them whenever and wherever they appeared. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall enter into this Enquiry in the Courſe of theſe Sheets no further than by pointing out ſome of the Cauſes,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>His</hi> Majeſtys <hi>Colonies injuriouſly charged with Neglects,</hi> &amp;c.</note> which if removed, the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects will ceaſe, and to acquit his MAJESTY'S COLONIES of the cruel Accuſation, from Perſons of all Ranks almoſt in this Country,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:007434_0053_102D868644F345E0"/>of having neglected their own Defence, and, by other cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Conduct, having invited the Calamities they ſuffer. This has been very induſtriouſly propagated by ſome People, who have found it neceſſary to blame the Colonies, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to excuſe themſelves; and by others who have had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in their Clamours from a late Pamphlet called, a <hi>Brief State of the Province of Pennſylvania,</hi> which I ſhall ſay no more of at preſent than that it is calculated for private Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, at the Expence of a very reſpectable Body of People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> to whom this Country is more obliged than moſt People at preſent know or can imagine, and who will very ſoon be acquited, with Honour, of the exceptionable Conduct laid to their Charge. Some People would do well in never loſing ſight of this, being, of all others, the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper time to inflame the Paſſions and alienate the Hearts of even the moſt remote and inſignificant of his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and of its being the moſt proper and neceſſary Meaſure at this critical Conjuncture to reconcile all jarring Intereſts, and to pleaſe and oblige every Claſs of his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Subjects in every part of his Dominions, that they may act with their Heads, Hearts, Hands, and Purſes unanimouſly for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his juſt Rights, and for permanently ſecuring him in the Poſſeſſion of them.</p>
               <p>It is certain not any one of the Colonies are to blame, as will appear when I come to ſpeak of their Conduct, Temper, and Diſpoſition, ſo it muſt lay elſewhere.</p>

However this muſt make his People, with the other peculiar Diſtreſſes accompanying a War with us, very uneaſy; and his Power muſt be greatly enervated to what it would be if his uſual Revenues were unincumbered.

This was experienced in the late War by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Cape-Breton.</hi> And as this was the caſe by the ſingle Conqueſt of <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> when <hi>France</hi> was in Poſſeſſion of <hi>Madraſs</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> lay at their Mercy, with an infinitely ſuperior Army in the Field to that of the Allies, fluſhed with a long Courſe of uninterrupted Victories, what Terms cannot you command for yourſelves and your Allies, when you have all their <hi>American</hi> Colonies in your Poſſeſſion; which, with proper Conduct, and the Bleſſing of God, that we are the more intitled to expect from the Juſtice of our Cauſe, muſt be the Caſe in a few Years after War commences?</p>
               <p>To theſe Conſiderations it may not be mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a'propos to add,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Zeal and Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his</hi> Majeſty's <hi>Subjects, a further En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for us to go to War.</hi>
                  </note> that his <hi>Majeſty</hi> having ever made the Laws of the Land the Rule of his Actions, and exerciſed the Prerogatives of the Crown with that Mildneſs, Juſtice, and Propriety as on all Occaſions to make them, what they were by our excellent Conſtitution of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment intended for, a Bleſſing to the People; and his having employed for a Number of Years that upright, moderate, impartial, prudent and wiſe Miniſter, who was lately too ſuddenly ſnatched to Glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Therefore <hi>France,</hi> nor any other Enemy of his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> his Government, and theſe Kingdoms, cannot have the leaſt Encouragement to hope for a Rebellion in this Country, or the leaſt Countenance and aſſiſtance in invading it from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ourſelves. And a War with <hi>France</hi> muſt appear ſo juſt and neceſſary to every Man, and our Ability to carry it on ſo ſuperior to whatever it was at any other time, that it is impoſſible but the whole People ſhould be unanimous for it, and their whole Thoughts bent upon no other public En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, but revenging the Wrongs and Indignities impoſed

               <p>Upon the whole, ſuch is the State of our Affairs in every part of his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Dominions, the State of <hi>France,</hi> and the general State of <hi>Europe,</hi> that we never can expect ſuch another favourable Coincidence of ſuch a Variety of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations for entering into a War with <hi>France,</hi> to maintain our Honour and Influence, our Colonies, our Commerce and Riches, indeed our Lives and Liberties. And it is abſurd to ſuppoſe we ſhall ever be ſtronger for a War, in Proportion to the growing Power of <hi>France,</hi> than we are now.</p>
