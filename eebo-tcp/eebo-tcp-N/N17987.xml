            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ORATION.</head>
            <p>THE animated appearance of this numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous audience, the joy visible in every countenance, the universal display of satisfaction, pervading this Metropolis, speak the occasion for which we are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled.</p>
            <p>IN perusing the ample page of History, the eye is often led to survey the Revolutions of mighty States and Empires. The causes which have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced these great Phenomena are fraught with lessons instructive to mankind. Among others none is more conspicuous, than that Oppression has uniformly ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated a spirit of Freedom. Had this important maxim been remembered, Monarchs would not so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have tottered on their thrones, nor so large a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind at this day have tasted the blessings of Liberty. It is unnecessary to enter into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:023298_0004_0FBEE76A3B430158"/>
and end of civil government, to evince that men, though willing to surrender some of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral privileges, to enjoy the benefits of society, still reserved to themselves, certain rights, in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture sacred and unalienable. And though venal wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (nurtured in the idea that Kings are born to rule, and Men to obey) have treated the doctrine as the dream of visionary Democracy, the experience of modern times teaches, that when these rights are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed, brave men will never fail to resist.</p>
            <p>THE Declaration of American Independence is one of those great AEras in the history of mankind, pregnant with such important consequences as well to posterity as ourselves, that an inquiry into the causes which gave it birth, is naturally suggested. In doing this it may be useful to mark with precision the first dawnings of that spirit of oppression, which gradually ripening into acts of Tyranny, terminated in the dismemberment of a vast Empire. From the original emigration of our ancestors from <hi>Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> the policy of that country towards them for a long series of years, was founded solely on the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of commercial advantage. The right of regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trade so as best to sub serve the <note n="*" place="bottom">" 'Till the year 1764 the colonial regulations seem to have no other object, but the common good of the whole Empire." RAMSAY'S Hist. Revolution p. 43.</note> mutual interest
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:023298_0005_0FBEE76BE4D2E910"/>
of both countries, was all they pretended to claim.—This right however illegal was tacitly submitted to, as long as the good resulting from its exercise out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighed the evil. Until the arrival of the fatal peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od which induced a deviation from this policy, the commercial benefits she reaped from the Colonies, were immense; and we can scarcely believe that in the year <note n="†" place="bottom">See BURKE'S Speech in Parliament on moving his resolutions for concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the colonies, March 22d, 1775, where the calculation is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately stated.</note> 1772, her export trade to America was nearly equal to what she carried on at the beginning of the century with the whole world!</p>
            <p>AT this time <hi>Great-Britain</hi> had reached the zenith of national glory, her fleets rode triumphant in every quarter of the globe, and the terror of her arms kept the European world in awe.</p>
            <p>HAD she continued to keep in view, the means by which she had risen to that glory, she would not now deplore the loss of so valuable a portion of her Empire, nor should we, My Friends, so soon have had reason to rejoice, on an occasion so glorious as the present. But in the conduct of nations as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, we always discover the traits of human im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection. As early as the year 1764, when <hi>Great-Britain</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:023298_0006_0FBEE76ECB8BE6F0"/>
had scarcely emerged from a long and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive War, in which an enormous debt had accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, a weak, short-sighted Ministry, deluded by the suggestions of designing men in this country, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the fatal project of drawing from America, a revenue by direct internal taxation.</p>
            <p>FORGETTING in one moment the wise policy, under the influence of which they had seen the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies increase, with a rapidity unparalleled in the growth of any former country, <note n="*" place="bottom">In BURKE'S Speech, mentioned in a former note, speaking of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the colonies to GREAT-BRITAIN, he says, "NOTHING IN THE MISTORY OF MANKIND IS LIKE THEIR PROGRESS."</note> unmindful of the immense advantages of an exclusive trade; the nation listened to the wretched expedient.</p>

For the paltry advantage of being cased in a small degree of the weight of their debt, they consented to the violation of one of the first principles of their Constitution, "That no tax should be levied on the subject but by his consent or
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023298_0007_0FBEE7724E9A9A08"/>
that of his Representative in Parliament." Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and disgraceful were the expedients employed by the Ministry, to obtain the consent of the nation in the pursuit of this their favourite object.</p>
            <p>To an audience so well informed, it would be needless to enumerate the various oppressive acts of Parliament, framed in pursuance of the original plan, all grounded on the false idea of a right to bind us in all cases. In contempt of Petitions, dictated by the purest loyalty, in opposition to the sentiments of the wisest and best <note n="*" place="bottom">Among others, LORD CAMDEN in the House of Peers, and WILLIAM PITT, in the House of Commons.

An uniform system of arbitrary measures was invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably pursued on one side, and firmly resisted on the other.</p>
            <p>THE insulted colonies were compelled, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to regard <hi>Great-Britain</hi> as the kind parent who had boasted that she had reared and protected them; but saw her arm extended, to wrest from them those rights, which as Englishmen they had been taught to hold sacred.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:023298_0008_0FBEE773E0E280B8"/>
VARIOUS were the causes, which combined to produce an early resistance to these measures.</p>
            <p>OUR ancestors happily for us their posterity, left <hi>Great-Britain</hi> at a period of her history, when the slavish doctrines of non-resistance and passive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence were growing out of fashion; and brought with them those principles of Liberty, and that spirit of Freedom which afterwards enabled their descendants to check the first inroads of arbitrary power. This spirit thus early imbibed, was effectually aroused at the Stamp Act, and though at <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he repeal of that odious measure, it seemed for a moment to subside, it burst out afresh whenever new occasions called for its exertions.</p>
            <p>ACCUSTOMED, from their earliest establishment, to Forms of Government little short of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, subject only to checks, which being rarely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted, were scarcely felt, they were more readily alarmed at the slightest attempts on their liberties. Having felt the effects of civil and religious perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, they early saw the necessity of instilling principles of resistance into their offspring, and their excellent institutions for the education of youth, may be ranked among the most powerful causes that led to the Revolution.</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:023298_0009_0FBEE775452FE950"/>
BUT I pass to the more immediate causes which brought on the great Event we this day celebrate.</p>
            <p>THE tragick scene acted on the memorable plains of <hi>Lexington,</hi> taught Americans what they might expect, from a nation intoxicated with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and determined to enslave them. Hosts of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign mercenaries, the disgraceful tools of Tyrants, were employed to enforce their arbitrary edicts, and the Day rapidly advanced, in which we were compelled to withdraw our allegiance from that power, which had long before withdrawn its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>

               </gap>rity be informed, that on that day when our Country was invaded by one of the most powerful nations on earth, without foreign aid, or internal resource, a band of Patriots, the Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of an injured people, sanctioned the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree which gave existence to an Empire. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Declaration was not dictated by ambitious leaders grasping at supreme power; by men who meant to raise themselves on the ruins of that allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they had abjured; but by the unanimous voice of three millions of Freemen presering death to ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude.

As often as this great Event is brought to our view the <hi>distinguished Patriot</hi> who has so long and honorably presided in this Commonwealth, will call for our warmest acknowledgments. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous part he took at this all-important crisis has justly secured him the wreath of immortality.</p>
            <p>To detail the occurrences of the long and bloody war, which terminated so gloriously for our country, would be to open wounds already closed, but justice to the long train of HEROES who fought in defence of the dearest rights of men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the tribute of our grateful remembrance. May their illustrious atchievements in the cause of virtue endear them to posterity.</p>
            <p>NOR can we in calling to mind this eventful period withhold the tribute of applause from the <hi>Illustrious Man,</hi> under whose command our <hi>Patriot Army,</hi> were so often led to victory and success. The mingled sensations of gratitude and admiration which croud on the mind, at the recollection of his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant services, render it impossible to do justice to his exalted character. While gratitude retains her seat in the human breast; posterity shall enrol the name of WASHINGTON among the great Benefactors of Mankind!</p>

FROM the <hi>Treaty of Peace</hi> until the adoption of our present form of National Government, the affairs of <hi>America</hi> wore a gloomy aspect. The disjointed fabrick of our union was tending fast to dissolution. The Articles of Confederation, framed while we were young in the science of politicks, were ineffectual to secure us in the possession of those blessings, we had so nobly obtained. Disunion threatened us on all sides, and the friends of <hi>Liberty</hi> in both hemispheres anxiously dreaded the approaching catastrophe. But lights and shades are sound blended in the great Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait of human affairs. The glory of <hi>America</hi> though dimmed, was not <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="5 letters">

A <hi>Council</hi> was called, composed of <hi>Heroes,</hi> who had shed their blood in defence of Freedom, and <hi>Sages,</hi> who by their counsels had aided the same cause.</p>
            <p>THE result of their deliberations is well known. At this crisis <hi>America</hi> exhibited an example digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to human nature.

The pleasing aspect of our publick affairs is its best eulogium.</p>
            <p>IN a period short of three years, we have seen our country raised from contempt, to the important rank she now holds among the nations of the earth.
