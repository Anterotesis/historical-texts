            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HEY are the Words of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> and his celebrated Wiſdom ſhould give them the greater weight with us.</p>
            <p>'Tis obſervable, that among all the Sins and Luſts of the fleſh, the Royal Preacher takes the moſt notice of <hi>Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Drunkenneſs.</hi> He begins with the Whore in my Context, and deſcribes her by a deep ditch, and a narrow pit, that lyeth in wait, as for a prey, and increaſeth the Tranſgreſſors among Men. To this, he ſubjoins the words of my Text.—<hi>Look not thou upon the wine, when it is red, when it giveth his
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003357_0003_0FF819C2C6F90CA8"/>colour in the cup, when it moveth it ſelf aright.</hi>—Why not? Hath God made any thing in vain? Is not Wine ordained to cheer the heart of Man? to help his Stomach, and his often Infirmities? yes: every Creature of God is good, ſanctified by Prayer, and receiv'd with Thankſgiving; but it may not be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to feaſt our Luxury, and to quench our Drunken and Exceſſive thirſt. The abuſe is here forbidden, the Wine wherein is Exceſs; where Reaſon is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thron'd, and Paſſion become abſolute; where Men have loſt the command of their Appetites, and drink at irregular hours, and to an exceſſive degree.—Then they muſt not look upon it, when it is red <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But guard againſt it, and keep their diſtance.—Becauſe, at the laſt, <hi>it biteth like a Serpent, and ſtingeth like an Adder.</hi> (i. e.) 'Tis of pernicious conſequence to the Drunkard.</p>
            <p>In the Proſecution therefore of the Subject, I ſhall Conſider.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. The <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Conſequences</hi> of Wine, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Liqour, drank to Exceſs.</item>

            <p n="1">1. 'Tis of pernicious Conſequence to the <hi>Purſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be not amongſt Wine-bibbers, amongſt riotous Eaters of Fleſh; for the Drunkard, and the Glutton ſhall come to Poverty.</hi> What is ſaid of the Whore, is applicable enough to the Cup, that by Means thereof, a Man is brought to a piece of Bread. How often has this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion been verified in our Eyes? How uſual a Thing is it for Perſons addicted to Liquor, to ſet out in the World, with a good, improveable Intereſt, and to be reduced, by exceſſive Drinking, to Penury and Want; to ſee them naked and hungry, living on their Neighbours Charity, or ſpending their Days in Goals and Priſons: Of this we have, not one or two, but many Inſtances.
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003357_0004_0FF819C496F3E678"/>Men that have brought themſelves, and (which is more affecting) their innocent Families, to ſhameful Beggary:—Nor can it morally ſpeaking, be otherwiſe.</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1.) When the Liquor they ſwallow is ſo <hi>Expenſive.</hi> When their Expences run up to <hi>Hundreds,</hi> if not <hi>Thouſands</hi> in the year. Men need plentiful Eſtates, a large Fund, and great Incomes, to Ballance the Expence of ſuperfluous Liquors, abſtract from the Neceſſaries of Life.</item>
               <item>(2.) As their Liquor is Expenſive, ſo their <hi>Time</hi> is Conſumed. When they ſhould be at Home, then they are abroad at a Tavern, and drinking, when they ſhould attend their Buſineſs and Callings; and 'tis well, if their Cups have not the larger half of their Time: 'Tis notoriouſly ſo in too many Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; who Work one day, and, perhaps, Drink out two.</item>
               <item>(3.) They not only conſume their <hi>Time,</hi> but loſe their <hi>diſpoſition</hi> for Buſineſs.
<p>The Drunkard daily contracts ſlothful Habits, and a growing Averſion to his Work and Calling. He is unfit for Labour, and in his ſobereſt Hours, cannot ſo well project his Schemes, or diſpoſe his Affairs.</p>
               </item>
               <item>(4.) I might add, under the Head of Penury, how expoſed he ſtands to the <hi>Impoſitions</hi> of Knaves &amp; Cheats.</item>
            </list>
            <p>How often do they take the advantage of his Cups, and ſleeping Reaſon? to entice him into Contracts and Bargains that are injurious to his Intereſt; and ſometimes to ſubſcribe Papers to his ruine &amp; deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion? I am perſwaded, I need not help your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories here, nor Recollect for you. Theſe ſeveral ways, among others, does the Drunkard come to Poverty. An Argument, I have the longer inſiſted upon, becauſe it draws its force, from the inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the Sin, with the Riches and Profits of <hi>this</hi> World, which is moſt apt to affect the Minds of ſuch, as look not at the Things, which are unſeen and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.</hi> Nor is Poverty the only pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Cup. For,</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:003357_0005_0FF819C6B5CB02E8"/>
2. It ſtrikes the <hi>Reputation</hi> and <hi>Character.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men act below their Honour, and expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Wine, ſometimes by fooliſh, imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Queſtions and Anſwers, inconſiſtent with their ſober tho'ts and diſcretion; and ſometimes, by unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, if not immodeſt Actions; as <hi>Noah</hi> drank of the Wine, and was uncovered in his Tent. When <hi>Micah</hi> ſaw <hi>David</hi> dance before the Ark, tho' out of a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſpect and gladneſs, ſhe deſpiſed him in her Heart, and ſaid ſcoffing, <hi>How glorious did the King of Iſrael look to day, in the Eyes of his Servants &amp; Maidens!</hi> —Methinks, the Irony may more naturally, and with a more viſible Juſtice, be applied to the Drunkards. How glorious do they look in the Eyes of ſober Men! ſtaggering over the Plains; wandring out of their Way; their Mouths full of Bitterneſs and Curſing, and beaſtly Communication; their Eyes dim and drowſy; their Reaſon drowned, and the Man a Brute, in a different Shape. If this be an honourable Stroke in a Man's Character, the Drunkard may be ſure of Honour enough. And next to a Man's Life and Health, and before his Intereſt, is his Character. A good Name is as precious Ointment, but <hi>the Drunkard,</hi> is a dead Fly, which makes it ſtink in the Noſtrils of Fame.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Drunkenneſs is a <hi>leading</hi> Iniquity, a capital Crime, and draws a Complication of Sins after it.</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1.) It's direct Tendency is to all <hi>Uncleanneſs.</hi>
                  <p>The wiſe Man therefore connects them, and aſſigns impure Deſires, as the effect of the Cup. Thine Eyes ſhall behold ſtrange Women. Reaſon is then depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and Paſſion, abſolute enough before, receives an Incentive from Liquor, and burns up to an impure Fire: Witneſs <hi>Lot</hi>'s Inceſt with his two Daughters, after he had drank of the Wine. Theſe two <hi>Adepts</hi> in Wickedneſs, knew of no other Method, to reach their curſed Ends, but to make their Father drink Wine. I will not offend
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003357_0006_0FF819CB517FA128"/>a modeſt Audience, in deſcending too much into Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; I will only ſay, that Men (and why ſhould I leave out Women?) run to ſuch extravagant lengths of Uncleanneſs, in their Cups, as would make them bluſh, at the very mention, when their ſober Tho'ts and Reaſon return.</p>
               </item>
               <item>(2.) It directly leads to open <hi>Prophaneneſs.</hi>
                  <p>It corrupts the Language, and debauches the Tongue, which is then a Fire, ſet on Fire of Hell and Liquor, in union. What prophane Speeches, enough to make a ſober Ear tremble, drop from the <hi>Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> Mouth: Language, perhaps, he was never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to. How are all the Bonds of Profeſſion, and the Power of the ſtricteſt Education, forgot in a <hi>Tavern.</hi> Thoſe that paſs for <hi>Saints,</hi> and Men of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if captivated by the Cup, when it giveth his Colour, are as looſe and prophane, as the greateſt Practitioners.</p>
               </item>
               <item>(3.) It often runs into <hi>Murder</hi> it ſelf.
<p>A thouſand unhappy Proofs we have of this, and ſome very modern. Liquor inflames the Paſſions; then ariſes Contention, Heat and Blood; then Duelling, or private Attempts, and ſometimes the open Act of Murder. This is often the Iſſue with Men: And how often have we known the <hi>other Sex,</hi> firſt in their Cups, then prompted to Uncleanneſs, then to ſtifle their Conception, or to imbrew their Hands in the Blood of their Infants? The ſame Perſons the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Being and Death. Theſe <hi>three</hi> Sins, Drunkenneſs leads us to, by a natural and direct Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; and in a remoter Senſe, it is the Occaſion of <hi>all</hi> Sin. Our Saviour exhorts us, to watch and pray, leſt we enter into Temptation; but a Man in Drink, is unfit for both. Therefore, when the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> would commend <hi>Vigilance,</hi> he firſt exhorts to <hi>Sobriety.</hi> Be <hi>Sober,</hi> be <hi>Vigilant,</hi> for your Adverſary the Devil, as a roring Lyon, walketh about, ſeeking whom he may devour. All our Vigilance and Strength, are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003357_0007_0FF819CDA6FC3980"/>enough to guard us againſt him. What muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of us then, when Wine has thrown us upon our Backs, and lull'd us into a ſpiritual Lethargy! There is no Sin ſo unnatural, but a Drunkard may commit it; tho' it be to murder his <hi>Father,</hi> and to defile his <hi>Mother.</hi>
                  </p>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="4">4. The Sin of Drunkenneſs wounds the <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What bitter Reflections follow the Cup! At the laſt it <hi>biteth</hi> like a Serpent, and <hi>ſtingeth</hi> like an Adder. Nothing remains but Remorſe of Conſcience, and like <hi>John</hi>'s prophetick Book, the Wine that was ſweet in the Mouth, becomes bitter in the Belly. Or, if the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard be without this conſequent Remorſe, when his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon returns, his Caſe is yet worſe, and more to be pitied; 'tis an awful ſign his Conſcience is ſeared, and inſtead of warning, ſhall only awake to <hi>tear</hi> him in Hell, where the Worm dieth not.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Drunkenneſs unfits us for all <hi>publick</hi> Services.</p>
            <p>How may Perſons, diſtinguiſh'd by Nature, and otherwiſe qualified for Poſts of Honour, and the higheſt Stations in the civil Government, render themſelves incapable of ſuch important Truſts, only by indulging a brutiſh Appetite after the Cup. I ſay, incapable. For Men of <hi>Rule,</hi> and Juſtice, muſt be Men of Temperance, and <hi>Sobriety:</hi> 'Tis not for <hi>Kings</hi> to drink Wine, nor for <hi>Princes</hi> ſtrong Drink; leſt they drink and forget the Law, and pervert the Judgment of the afflicted. And the ſame holds good in <hi>ſacred</hi> Government. The <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and the <hi>Prophet</hi> have erred thro' ſtrong Drink; they are ſwallowed up of Wine, they are out of the Way, thro' ſtrong Drink; they err in Viſion, they ſtumble in Judgment. When Perſons at the Helm of any Government reel themſelves, how can we expect that Government ſhould be ſteady, or the Adminiſtrations of it Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular? So that the <hi>Sot,</hi> is at beſt, but an inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant <hi>Cypher</hi> in human Society, and of all Men, is the moſt unfit, to ſerve his Generation.</p>

6. It incapacitates Men for <hi>Church-Communion,</hi> and the Enjoyment of Special Ordinances.</p>
            <p>We cannot drink the Cup of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and the Cup of <hi>Devils.</hi> What fellowſhip hath <hi>Chriſt</hi> with <hi>Drunkards ?</hi> How dare we drink the Conſecrated Wine, and be filled with that wherein is <hi>Exceſs !</hi> To admit ſuch to the Table of the Lord, is to give that which is Holy unto Dogs; which we dare not do, at our utmoſt Perils: And, if there be any Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of <hi>our</hi> Communion, I ſolemnly Charge them, either to Repent or Abſent.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Drunkenneſs is an Enemy to the <hi>Life</hi> of Men.</p>
            <p>How frequently is it attended with Surfeits? And how does it impair the Conſtitution, and often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Original of Mortal Diſtempers? And who hath Wo? who hath Sorrow? who hath Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? who hath Wounds without cauſe? who hath redneſs of Eyes! They that tarry long at the Wine, they that go to ſeek mixt Wine. Wo unto them that riſe up early in the morning, that they may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Strong Drink; that continue until night, until Wine inflame them: Wo unto them, that are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to drink Wine, and Men of ſtrength, to mingle Strong Drink. How many Accidents are they expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to! They ſometimes fall from their Horſes, in returning from the <hi>Tavern,</hi> and ſometimes ſtumble on the dark Mountains, and break and bruiſe their Limbs, when they eſcape with their Lives. They are Objects of contempt and ſcorn, to their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſubject to the inſults of their Enemies. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> was drinking himſelf Drunk, in the houſe of <hi>Arka,</hi> when <hi>Zimri</hi> ſmote and killed him. <hi>Benhadad</hi> alſo was drinking himſelf Drunk, in the Pavilion, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> came and ſlew the <hi>Syrians.</hi> So, when Deſtruction was determined againſt <hi>Nabal,</hi> his heart was merry within him, for he was very Drunken. And, ſays <hi>Solomon,</hi> deſcribing the Drunkards ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in the moſt imminent Dangers, Thou ſhalt be as
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003357_0009_0FF819D1EAD6DF88"/>he that lyeth down in the midſt of the Sea, or as he that lyeth upon the Top of a Maſt; They have ſtricken me, ſhalt thou ſay, and I was not ſick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Drunkenneſs deſtroys the <hi>Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Drunkard drinks at infinite Expence; he parts with his Soul, to pleaſe his Palate; and will rather caſt his whole Body into Hell, then pluck out his right Eye. 'Tis a Sin that drowns Men in Perdition: For be not deceived, neither Fornicators, nor <hi>Drunkards,</hi> ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God. The works of the Fleſh are manifeſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Drunkenneſs, &amp;c. and ſuch like, of the which I tell you before, as I have alſo told you in times paſt, that they which do ſuch things, ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, therefore ye Drunkards, and weep and howl, all ye drinkers of Wine: Take heed to your ſelves, leſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, and the Day of the Lord come upon you unawares, and you drink of the wine of the Wrath of God, which is poured forth without mixture, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cup of His Indignation: for in the Hand of the Lord, is a Cup, and the Wine is red, and the Dregs thereof all the Wicked of the Earth ſhall drink.</p>
            <p>From the Character and <hi>Effects</hi> of exceſſive Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I paſs</p>
            <p n="2">II. To obſerve the <hi>Reaſons,</hi> why we ſhould abſtain and keep at the utmoſt Diſtance from the Cup. Or in the Words of my Text, not look upon the Wine when it is red. And here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Conſequences</hi> of it are to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>'Tis a good Reaſon, which is ſubjoined to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. Who would be fond of the Adder's Sting? Or would not avoid the Bite of the Serpent? <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs</hi> is the Serpent and the Adder; the Conſequences of it makes it ſo: They are very Pernicious; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003357_0010_0FF819D48C114B60"/>as I have deſcribed it, to the <hi>Purſe,</hi> reducing Men and their Families to Want and Poverty; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to their <hi>Reputation</hi> and Character; 'tis a <hi>lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> iniquity, attended with the complicated Crimes of <hi>Luſt, Prophaneneſs</hi> and <hi>Murder,</hi> and giving the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my every Advantage over us; a Sin, that wounds the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> fills it with Remorſe, or makes it Stupid and Uſeleſs; that unfits for <hi>publick</hi> Service, both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State;</hi> and that incapacitates us for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or a Right to his Ordinances; an Enemy to the Health and <hi>Life</hi> of Man, and in the Iſſue, deſtructive to his <hi>Soul.</hi> What greater Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration can we have, to keep our Diſtance &amp; Guard? The Argument is fetched from both Worlds; from Body and Soul; Self and Neighbour, and Family; Reputation, Life and Intereſt. If Men have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to theſe, what can prevail with them !</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe Temptations to Drunkenneſs, will never <hi>excuſe</hi> the Sin.</p>
            <p>When we are ſurpriz'd by Temptation, the Sin is ſo far extenuated, and of leſs Aggravation in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, but not wholly excuſeable; the Authority of <hi>God</hi> prohibiting, being infinitely Superiour to the Power of the <hi>Creature,</hi> tempting. But when we <hi>run</hi> into Temptation, I cannot ſee how the Power of it will, either excuſe, or extenuate a Fault. It will be no Plea for the Drunkard in the Day of Judgment, that he was <hi>tempted</hi> by the Cup. God may then ask him, What was the Rule of your Practice? Your own Appetite, or my Precept? Which ought to have had the <hi>firſt</hi> Influence upon you? The Authority of my Law, or the Perſwaſions of the Creature? Was I to be contemn'd? Was my Law to be undervalu'd? My Threatnings deſpiſed? And my Grace ſlighted? And my Son rejected? for a contemptible Cup, and a brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Gratification? Or, if the Temptations of Liquor were ſo powerful, and the Charms of the Cup ſo irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable, why did you Venture upon it? When your
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003357_0011_0FF819D8A2D04310"/>Experience told you, once and again, your own Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Inſufficiency, why did you not take the Warning? Why would you run again, among ſottiſh Companions to <hi>Taverns</hi> and Houſes of Perdition? If you could not forbear, nor moderate your Draught, you ſhould not have gone, nor have look'd upon the Wine when it was red, when it gave his Colour in the Cup. Such Queſtions as theſe will ſtrike the Drunkard <hi>Speechleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We ſhould keep our Diſtance from the Cup, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are ſo often <hi>conquer'd</hi> by it.</p>
            <p>Simply conſidered, it can be no Crime, to look upon the Wine when it is red, nor to drink it in Moderation. This <hi>Timothy</hi> himſelf might do; but the Conſequences of it make it Dangerous and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal. The Line of Diviſion between Vertue and Vice, Good and Evil, is very narrow, and ſoon ſtept over; and to venture, in ſome Caſes, to the Extremity of what is Lawful, is almoſt venturing upon what is otherwiſe. A Man that would not fall, muſt not go too near the Precipice. A Man that will run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a publick Houſe, is in Danger of looking upon the Wine; and he that looks upon the Wine, is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Drinking, and he that Drinks in danger of drinking to Exceſs. I appeal to the Experience of ſome Drunkards, whether they have not flatter'd themſelves, at firſt, with the Tho'ts of Moderation, and been ſufficiently guarded, in their own Conceit, againſt all Exceſſes, and yet been <hi>inſenſibly</hi> tempted, and drank away their Reaſon and Senſes: If we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be delivered from Evil, we muſt not be led into Temptation. This ſtands firſt in the <hi>Lord's Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I ſhewn the pernicious <hi>Conſequences</hi> of Drunkenneſs; and the <hi>Reaſons,</hi> why we ſhould avoid the moſt diſtant Temptations to it? I will not deny, but both the <hi>Propoſitions</hi> are directly, and <hi>deſignedly,</hi> levell'd againſt <hi>Taverns;</hi> not againſt Taverns in their
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003357_0012_0FF819DA99858DD8"/>
               <hi>original</hi> Deſign, when firſt ſet up to accommodate Strangers, and to provide againſt their Intruſion into private Families: But againſt Taverns <hi>degenerated</hi> from their firſt Deſign, and debauch'd and fill'd with ſottiſh <hi>Neighbours.</hi> To ſuch Houſes we owe all the foremention'd Effects of Drunkenneſs. <hi>Here</hi> 'tis, that the Wine looks red, and moveth it ſelf aright; <hi>Here</hi> 'tis that <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Art</hi> unite, and tempt the Palate, with agreeable Mixtures: Theſe are the Houſes, that make Men <hi>Beggars,</hi> that deſtroy the Funds of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and <hi>rob</hi> Families of their juſt and proper Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihoods. Theſe are the Houſes, that wound our <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> and Reputation; that lead into Acts of <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, Hoſtility, Murder</hi> and <hi>Prophaneneſs;</hi> that waſte and ſtupify our <hi>Conſciences;</hi> make us unfit for <hi>publick Service</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> Privileges: Theſe are the Houſes, that ſtrike at Men's <hi>Lives,</hi> Health and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; that make Merchandiſe of their <hi>Souls;</hi> and in a Word, deſtroy us for <hi>both</hi> Worlds. What a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Charge is this upon thoſe that keep them! Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands may curſe them in <hi>this</hi> World, and the Blood of Thouſands will cry againſt them in the next. If we are come to Hell, ſay they, <hi>You, you</hi> we may thank, in a great meaſure for it. Our Miniſters faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully warn'd us againſt the Sin of Drunkenneſs, and plainly told us the Conſequences of it; but you have tempted us into it; you firſt tempted us to your Houſes, and when you ſaw us drink to Exceſs, you never put the Knife to our Throat, nor deny'd us Liquor, nor confin'd us to proper Hours; the longer we ſtaid, and the more we drank, the greater was your Profit from us, and you valued your <hi>Purſe</hi> more than our <hi>Souls.</hi> Now, we curſe the Day, when we knew you; we curſe the Time, when we ſtepp'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your Threſhold, and the unhappy Hours we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd in <hi>Drinking</hi> at your Houſes. I know <hi>Tavern</hi>-keepers think little of this; and plead, <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> to the whole Charge. We never, ſay they, forced
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003357_0013_0FF819DCDE5BA6F8"/>any Man; every one had his Liberty to go or ſtay. But what Mockery is this! If they never <hi>forced,</hi> it was becauſe they could not: To <hi>tempt</hi> was all they could do, and this they did with all imaginable Art; and the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf is excuſed, by the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for he can only tempt, and has Power to force no Man: But if thoſe who keep ſuch Houſes regard not what I ſay, yet I expect ſome Regard from <hi>you,</hi> that hear me, and now ſolemnly warn you againſt Taverns.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I beſeech and charge you this Day, to exerciſe your Parental Affection, Authority, and Endeavours, to keep your <hi>Children</hi> from ſuch Houſes of Hell and Perdition.</p>
            <p>They are young, and paſſionate, and more eaſily tempted, than Age and Experience. Remember what hopeful Youths, have been deceived, and ruin'd by <hi>Taverns;</hi> Ruin'd I ſay, for <hi>Body</hi> &amp; <hi>Soul,</hi> for <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Eternity:</hi> And <hi>your</hi> Children are but <hi>Children</hi> of the ſame common nature and weakneſs with others, and it muſt be your Parental Care, and the Exerciſe of your Authority over them, under God, if <hi>they</hi> eſcape the Snare, and fall not into the ſame Ditch. Had not the Parents in this Place, been too Remiſs in this great Duty, ſo many of our Youth, 'tis probable, had not been ſo Vicious, as they are. —Let this negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, be never again reprov'd in you. If you have any regard to the intereſt of your Children in <hi>this</hi> World; If you value their <hi>Repute</hi> and Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; if you would preſerve a good <hi>Conſcience</hi> in them: If you have any compaſſion for their <hi>Souls</hi> or <hi>Bodies.</hi> If you would have them dedicated to <hi>God,</hi> and devoted to His Service <hi>here,</hi> or dwell with Him <hi>hereafter;</hi> And (I will ſay) if the intereſts of <hi>this</hi> Church, or that Religion, in general, which is pure and undefiled, have any weight with you; Keep them; Keep them from <hi>Taverns;</hi> Keep them at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt diſtance; Let them not go by the <hi>door</hi> of ſuch
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003357_0014_0FF819DF3578C050"/>Houſes, nor be found in ſuch Company, however civil and obliging, as would lead them <hi>there.</hi> Keep them, therefore, as much as may be, at <hi>Home,</hi> under the inſpection of your own Eye; for better follow your Children to their <hi>Graves,</hi> than ſee them run into Taverns.</p>
            <p n="2">2. With the ſame Solemnity, and Earneſtneſs, I beſeech and charge you to abſent <hi>your ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you are not ſo eaſily tempted as your Children, <hi>yet</hi> the Conſequences of your going are great, and you have no juſt <hi>Plea</hi> for it. Neither from the Command of your Paſſions; nor from the neceſſity of your <hi>Buſineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is no juſt plea for a Man to ſay, I am ſo well fortifyed by the Grace of God, and have my Paſſions in ſo juſt a ſubjection to my Reaſon, that for the ſake of agreeable Company, I may innocently enough fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent a <hi>Tavern.</hi> This I ſay, is not a juſt Plea. For,
<list>
                  <item>1. You ſtand by the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, and not by your own natural power. This you confeſs, and therefore ought to take heed, leſt you fall: If God withdraw His Grace, you will as ſoon loſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of your Paſſions, as another, and drink with the Drunken.</item>
                  <item>2. You <hi>tempt</hi> God, by going to withdraw His Grace. God's Grace never ſuperſedes Man's endeavours; they always act in concurrence; and when Grace is thus abuſed to wantonneſs, and pleaded as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Publick Houſes, 'tis a Sovereign wonder, if it be not withdrawn.</item>
                  <item>3. Suppoſing, God ſhould continue His Grace, and you ſhould have the command of your own Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; yet your example may embolden <hi>others,</hi> who perhaps, have not your Grace. They think 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to juſtify them for ever, when they can ſay, ſuch and ſuch a Man, an eminent <hi>Profeſſor,</hi> and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Chriſtian, frequents the Tavern as well as we; and they will prophanely improve your very
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003357_0015_0FF819E2B81E0B08"/>
                     <hi>Sobriety</hi> as a further Argument in favour of their Pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice. Why ſay they, do our Preachers thunder out their Anathema's, and pretend ſuch a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection betwixt Taverns and Drunkenneſs, when we ſee ſo many return from them <hi>ſober</hi> as they went? And ſo you deſtroy the Soul of your Brother for whom Chriſt dyed.</item>
                  <item>4. You <hi>Countenance</hi> the thing it ſelf, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally plead in vindication of thoſe, who keep ſuch Houſes, more than a <hi>Score,</hi> of the Prophane Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. They will too naturally think, that Tavern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping (in the very ſenſe which I intend) is not a Crime, when Men of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion</hi> thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage it.</item>
                  <item>5. You give needleſs occaſion of offence to them that are <hi>without.</hi>
                     <p>If you frequent a Tavern, behave your ſelves with the utmoſt Guard and Caution you can; malicious Tongues will make it a cover for their Slanders, and wound the Church of God thro' your ſides.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>6. 'Tis ſtrange and wonderful, how a <hi>Tavern</hi> ſhould afford agreeable Company to a Chriſtian, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Curſing, Swearing, and vain Babbling can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Sobriety, Modeſty, and Piety. And the Truth is, when a Man runs to a <hi>Tavern</hi> for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, 'tis a ſign, he has little of the <hi>Saint</hi> in him. So that an Argument from this Character, and the command of our Paſſions, will not bear the Teſt. Nor</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Will it anſwer better, to plead our <hi>Buſineſs.</hi> For, tis hard to conceive, why <hi>Taverns</hi> ſhould be made the Stage of Buſineſs. An improper place 'tis, I'm ſure for any Tranſactions of tho't, and conſequence; amidſt Clamour, Drinking, Gaming, and all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable confuſions. So that <hi>Buſineſs</hi> is a meer pretence. Thus have I endeavour'd to expoſe the vile and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Sin of <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> and warn'd you faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the <hi>Taverns.</hi> I have deliver'd my own Soul, and if you will not take the Warning, your Blood, and your Childrens Blood be upon your own Head.</p>
