            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CANDID RETROSPECT.</head>
            <p>THE political creed of America (for I make no eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of two parties, who taken together are a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority</hi> of the continent) may be compriſed in the twelve following articles.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Every nation has authority to frame ſuch a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for itſelf, as will, without injury to others, be moſt conducive to its own felicity.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The national ſovereignty under every form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment whether in the hands of one, or of many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or however modelled, is abſolute; for no State can exiſt, if any of its members may by force or fraud attempt its ſubverſion with impunity: And therefore, every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion puniſhes treaſon, or an attempt tending to overturn the conſtitution, as the higheſt crime of which a ſubject can be guilty.</p>
            <p n="3">III. No man can be innocent, even <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ro Conſcienti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> in an endeavour to change the government of his country, if the meditated revolution will light up a civil war, and the miſeries in proſpect are likely to exceed thoſe, which the community have been accuſtomed to endure.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The eſtabliſhments made in America by Engliſh emigrants and their aſſociates, <hi>might</hi> in the early day of the colonies, if the parent country had been ſo determined, have been prevented or broken up.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The Lords and Commons of England, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſant of the grants and charters of their Kings and Queens, for the encouragement of the colonies, and of the tranſactions under them; and afterwards co-operating
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:016729_0003_0F9DF04A2E194118"/>for regulating the plantations, rendering them ſecure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt foreign invaſions and uſeful to Great-Britain, they cannot therefore be conſidered as <hi>merely Royal,</hi> but Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amentary, or national eſtabliſhments.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The grants and charters to the colonies, and the poſterior ſettlements, regulations and uſages by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and with the knowledge or privity, and without the interdiction of Parliament, are inconteſtible proofs of a great national covenant between the Mother Country and the colonies, for her favours (which undeniably have been many and great) by inſpiring the Coloniſts with confidence, and expoſing them to hazardous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive undertakings, created rights; and gratitude never obliges to returns and ſurrenders, incompatible with thoſe rights which are eſſential to the felicity of the receiver of the benefits.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Before the year 1764, the King, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, were univerſally acknowledged to be the ſupreme law-givers of the whole empire; of which the colonies were members.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. The national c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>enant bound the parent country to protect and promote the colonies, according to the good faith implied in the grants and charters, and other royal and national acts in their favour, as far as was conſitient with the general weal of all the diſperſions of the nation; and it obliged the plantations to ſubmit to her authority, in all caſes not repugnant to their grants, charters and eſtabliſhments; and to ſuch acts aad contributions, as were neceſſary for the <hi>common</hi> defence and felicity of the empire.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Neither of the contracting parties may diſſolve this compact, as lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> as their joint aim in the union, to wit, <hi>their mutual</hi> proſperity, can be attained by it.</p>
            <p n="10">X. As no proviſion was made for conſtituting an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Judge between them, to bridle or correct the partiality or infidelity of either party, therefore their controverſies
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:016729_0004_0F9DF04CA5AB0930"/>are to be decided by negotiation and treaty, or on appeal by battle to the Lord of Hoſts; for neither is obliged to ſurrender its eſſential rights at the <hi>will</hi> of the other, and each is juſtifiable in exerting its own ſelf-preſerving powers.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. When one of them wants either will or ability to fulfil its engagements, the other, if not inſtrumental to this diſaffection or impotence, will be diſcharged from the original obligation. But,</p>
            <p n="12">XII. Since amongſt imperfect beings offences are inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, the contractors are by the laws of a judge who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deceived, reciprocally bound, upon exceptions ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to purſue every meaſure of a re-conciliatory nature, conſiſtent with the end of the union; and to ſuch mutual condeſcenſions, as tend to the re-eſtabliſhment of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral felicity, peace and harmony: And this is the more eminently their duty, ſince the empire conſiſts of <hi>other</hi> branches, which have offended neither of the parties at ſtrife, and will nevertheleſs be ruined if the controverſy ends in a ſeparation,</p>
            <p>In the application of theſe principles to the preſent quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, perhaps neither Great-Britain nor America will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be without blame.</p>
            <p>What a new and awful idea of the conſtitution did the Parent Country hold up to her Colonies, at the paſſing of the ſtamp act! Her language was this:</p>
            <p>"You Americans are abſolutely ours. We may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of your perſons, your commerce, your lands and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions as we pleaſe. You have no rights. The grants of our Kings to your anceſtors do not bind this nation. The privileges and ſecurities of Engliſhmen cannot be yours unleſs you return to the old realm. Our ancient indulgences were <hi>temporary</hi> permiſſions, from which you can deduce no title to <hi>permanent</hi> enjoyments. Your plea that our Commons are not of your electing, and that we and they are intereſted in the increaſe of your burdens,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016729_0005_0F9DF04D898CFA10"/>can come with propriety only from the mouth of a Britiſh inhabitant —All America is ſubject to our taxations; nor will we hear your complaints, until you firſt own our authority to deal with you as we pleaſe, and acknowledge that ſuch benefits as you requeſt, are to be expected not as of right, but of grace."</p>
            <p>Had England ſuch principles at the firſt emigrations, ſhe was bound to declare them to the adventurers, before they gave themſelves to the winds and the ſeas, to gain her a ſhare of the wealth and commerce of the new world, by which her iſland has been converted into a <hi>Nation of Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thus ſhe never did ſpeak till this memorable aera; and therefore the Colonies were in conſternation at the haughty tone, uttering this novel explanation of the nature of the union. They remonſtrated—they reſiſted —and the inſtant Great-Britain took off the new burden, America re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded her <hi>deeds</hi> more than her words, ſubmitting without cavalling, to that rational ſovereignty ſhe had formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, to the common advantage of the empire.</p>
            <p>The grand deſideratum of the moment in which the ſtamp-act was repealed (1766) was ſome plan for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in future the reaſonable contributions of the Colonies for the <hi>common defence,</hi> conſiſtent with the ſupremacy of Parliament and the freedom of America, either in the old or in ſome new and unexceptionable mode. If aſſemblies were <hi>no longer</hi> to be truſted, for grants on ſeperate requiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the Crown (though the Colonies had in this way the credit of having overacted their parts) an Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Parliament might have been conſtituted to <hi>inſure</hi> and <hi>quicken</hi> the ſupplies; or permanent funds might have been ſet a part in every plantation for their quotas to the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal charge, riſing and falling with the commerce of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, perfectly conſiſtent with <hi>their</hi> ſafety and the <hi>national ſupremacy,</hi> and requiſite for the union and direction of their
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016729_0006_0F9DF04DF0947A48"/>force: But to the aſtoniſhment of common ſenſe, Great-Britain, blind to futurity, and anxious only for preſent peace, contented herſelf with an empty declaration of her authority to bind the colonies <hi>in all caſes whatſoever;</hi> and as if this would have prevented America from indulging jealouſies, or have induced her to ſlide into ſecurity and confidence, ſhe abſurdly enrolled it among her laws. Eaſy themſelves, the miniſters of the day, deviſed nothing to counteract the poiſon adminiſtered by their predeceſſors, and ſeemed to be regardleſs of the durable intereſts of the Monarch they ſerved, and the nation who reſigned to their counſels. But to proceed, we remark,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the preſent animoſities are imputable to the pride and avarice of Great-Britain, in aſſuming an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, inconſiſtent with the compact by which the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire had been long proſperouſly united. The colonies had the merit of returning to their ſubmiſſion, as ſoon as they were diſburdened of the ſtamp-duties, the irritating aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a right to deſpotic ſovereignty over them notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. They remained quiet till Mr. Townſhend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived the old claim in a new form, by impoſing duties upon paper, paint, &amp;c. for raiſing a revenue, ſubverſive of the Colony Legiſlatures and the ancient cuſtoms of he empire.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Colonies were juſtifiable in cenſuring the new law deviſed to execute the tea duty act; for that aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enforce the claim of abſolute ſovereignty obliged to ſome conduct or declaration againſt an unconditional ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion—<hi>Perhaps</hi> it juſtified the open violation to which they reſorted.—Repreſentations and petitions having been tried without effect, what could be expected from the mere influence of diſſuaſions againſt the purchaſe of the dutied article? Had not the patriot diſſuader to apprehend pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution and ruin, unleſs when impriſoned, his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would riſe up againſt the government for his redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016729_0007_0F9DF04EB3837448"/>And which meaſure was leaſt exceptionable, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the commodity, or the rupture of gaols, for a deliverance of the priſoners in the confederacy, and the ſudden overturning of the Colony Government for defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>regular</hi> courſe of the law?</p>
            <p>That the reſentment of Great-Britain, on the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and expulſion of the tea cargoes, manifeſted in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive meaſures of 1774, by altering the charter of the Maſſachuſetts Bay, extinguiſhing the commerce of Boſton, collecting an army there, rendering the ſoldiery diſpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the ſhedding of blood, modelling the province of Quebec favourable to the deſigns of compulſion and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, was utterly unjuſtifiable, and an infraction of the league, which obliged Great-Britain to protect the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; and theſe ſeverities were the more inexcuſable, ſince to that moment her ſovereignty in <hi>all caſes</hi> (the matter of taxation excepted) had not been denied by the Colonies; but was by all their courts, and in all their proceedings, confeſſed or implied, adjudged, <hi>and</hi> ſupported.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the provinces were not blameable in forming a Congreſs, to unite their counſels and ward off danger, as they did in September 1774.</p>

                  <p>But the Congreſs conſented (a term properly uſed after the whole authority of Parliament had been denied) to be ſubject to the laws of trade; and with this the honeſt and ſimple hearted Americans were contented, for few of them were aware of the craft which tacked to every ſuch law, a condition to render it nugatory and void, unleſs while it continued the advantages of the commerce to Great-Britain, I ſhould ſay, of the external commerce of the whole Empire, it ſecured at the ſame time, the commercial benefits of its reſpective members. An inſidious addition, which brought ſome Delegates within doors, and thouſands without, to approve in terms, a ſentiment which in their hearts they abhorred. Is it in the underſtanding of man, to frame an act of trade, that will be proof againſt the cavils, to which ſuch an article gave an handle? And would not the aſſent to it as a fundamental of the union, have ſet every colony upon the high ground of a contracting potentate; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed to reſiſt by violence, what ſhe might not be able to prevent by diſſuaſion? It was only to ſhew that an act of Parliament was not ſo beneficial to the Empire, or any part of it, as it might have been, to be void, and as eaſy to foreſee that this principle admitted, it was impoſſible to pen a law, that would be valid in all or any of the Provinces. In ſhort, if Great-Britain had run into one extreme for aſſerting her right to bind the Colonies in all caſes whatſoever, was it not equally extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant to hold that ſhe could bind us in none? I ſhall not diſparage America, by aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there were no perſons here who diſcerned and deteſted at the day of theſe tranſactions, the deſign and tendency of this article of the declaration of rights; t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thouſands muſt be able to point to the men, once as loud in denying, as they are at preſent in owning, the intention of ſevering that Empire from the year 1774. They have my conſent for the fame they aſpire after, and that what they wiſhed to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, may never be queſtioned till that happy day, when themſelves ſhall find ſafety, in producing the proofs they now are deſirous to conceal.</p>

                  <p>The foundation of Engliſh liberty and of all free government, is a right in the people to participate in their Legiſlative Council. The Coloniſts are not, and from local and other circumſtances cannot, be repreſented as the inhabitants of the ancient realm are, in the Britiſh Parliament. If only the objects of the bounty and care, and not contributory to the burdens of the parent nation, they could not complain of their not participating in her councils. But the caſe was altered after the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God had enabled them to ſuſtain, and we called them to bear, a part of the general charge for the common defence of the Britiſh ſtock, now diſperſed in all quarters of the world. America has no unnatural deſire to ſhrink from the load, but declares herſelf willing to ſubmit to an equitable ratio. She expects it from the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and juſtice of the Parent State to ſet limits to her power, that Great-Britain will abſtain from all meaſures directly and indirectly tending to levy taxes, and from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Let a council be convoked to deliberate upon a ſettlement, to aſcertain what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions the Provinces ſhall afford in future, for the protection ſhe ought not to refuſe.</p>
                  <p>Such language as this could only have offended thoſe, who meant to ſubject us to deſpotiſm: And it muſt be confeſſed to the honour of Great-Britain, that ſhe threw out the firſt hint for an accommodation of differences by compact, in the reſolve of the 20th of February, 1775. It is at the ſame time the misfortune of the Colonies, that their leaders preferred a defiance of her power to the tenders of her love. Look at the ſullen anſwer to the conciliatory declaration, entered in the Congreſs minutes of the 31ſt of July, 1775, an anſwer too, unfairly ſuſpended from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding April, that the multitude might in the interval, be the better prepared to approve its inſidious contents. What incredible pains were taken to practiſe upon the Provincial Congreſſes, and inculcate the ludicrous idea uttered in Parliament, that liberty was ſet up at auction, to be ſold to the Provinces bidding higheſt? And how grateful the poiſon of that parricide, to an inflamed populace, gulled into a deſtructive war, by the hope of paying nothing towards the charge for ſupporting and defending the liberties they enjoyed!

                  <p n="3">3. That other duties for regulating trade, ſhould be paid into the Colony trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, and be ſubject to the diſpoſal of the Aſſembly, and.</p>
                  <p n="4">4thly, Great-Britain to renounce the claim of taxation, and depend for aids in all exigencies, upon the free gift of the Colonies.</p>
                  <p>It was alſo intimated that theſe points agreed, the repeal of the ſtatutes offenſive to America would follow; and ſuch a limitation propoſed for the quartering of troops, and the partition of them through the provinces, as to induce one of the then Delegates, to declare that he ſhould conſider them as hoſtages for the good behaviour of Great-Britain.</p>
                  <p>It was at the ſame interview candidly hinted, that the mother country would arm at all points in the ſpring, and precede her operations by overtures for a treaty; and as a means to prevent even the arrival of the intended armaments, Lord Drummond urged, that Congreſs ſhould declare themſelves on theſe propoſals, by ſpecial meſſengers of their own to go home immediately.</p>
                  <p>How this pacifick meſſage was received, the people of any Colony may know, if they have ſpirit and power left under their preſent tyrants, to call the Delegates of that day to an examination upon oath. It is aſſerted that a motion was made in Congreſs, to commit their Meſſengers to cloſe cuſtody; and certainly true, that they were not diſmiſſed till their paroles were exacted; and that much pains were taken to hide theſe momentous tranſactions from the publick eye. If the enquiry (which it imports every province to make into the conduct and fidelity of her agents) is not slovenly conducted, it will come out, that two of the Delegates ſought a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance from New-York to England upon this buſineſs in February 1776, and that the deſign was relinquiſhed, as ſoon as the news of an event in Virginia gave the party for the intended independency, advantages for ſubduing the common reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a great majority of the Continent, to advance to that dangerous precipice, from which they have launched ſo many of their credulous countrymen into the ocean of eternity; while ſcores of thouſands remain behind them, in all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated wretchedneſs of want and deſpair.</p>
                  <p>Such, America, was the patriotiſm of your leaders! Do you wonder that they who cheated you into ruin, have ever ſince practised the arts of deluſion, to ſcreen themſelves from a detection, that muſt expoſe them to your vengeance?</p>

We obſerved to his Lordſhip, that as our buſineſs was to hear, he might conſider us in what light he pleaſed, and communicate to us any propoſitions he might be authorized to make for the purpoſe mentioned; but that we could conſider ourſelves in no other character, than that in which we were placed by the order of Congreſs. His Lordſhip then entered into a diſcourſe of conſiderable length, which contained no explicit propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of peace, except one, viz. that the Colonies ſhould return to their allegiance and obedience to the Government of Great-Britain.—The reſt conſiſted principally of aſſurances, that there was an exceeding good diſpoſition in the King and Miniſters to make that government eaſy to us; with intimations, that in caſe of our ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they would cauſe the offenſive acts of Parliament to be revived, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to Governours to be re-conſidered; that ſo, if any juſt cauſes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint were found in the acts, or any errors in Government were perceived to have crept into the inſtructions, they might be amended or withdrawn.</p>
                                 <p>We gave it as our opinion to his Lordſhip, that a return to the domination of Great-Britain was not to be expected; we mentioned the repeated humble petitions of the Colonies to the King and Parliament, which had been treated with contempt, and anſwered only by additional injuries; the unexam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
