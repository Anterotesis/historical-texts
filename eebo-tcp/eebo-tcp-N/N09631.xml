         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>Now, my God, let, I beſeech thee, thine Eyes be open, and let thine Ears be attent unto the Prayer that is made in this Place.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore ariſe, O Lord God, into thy reſting Place, thou, and the Ark of thy Strength: Let thy Prieſts, O Lord God, be cloathed with Salvation, and let thy Saints rejoice in Goodneſs.</p>

            <p>THIS houſe being built to the honour of God's holy name, with much unanimity and diſpatch, through the favour of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence; and it being, from this time forward, to be devoted, ſet apart and dedicated, to the more ſolemn, public and immediate worſhip and ſervice of the one ſupreme Lord of the univerſe, was the reaſon of my chooſing theſe words of the wiſe King Solomon (uttered on a like occaſion) for your conſideration at this time.—My text is a part of that ſolemn and excellent prayer, which the wiſe man offered up to his maker, when he conſecrated to his ſacred ſervice an elegant and beautiful edifice, even that rich and magnificent Temple, which he had erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that noble purpoſe. And although the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip and ornamental glory of the houſe, in which we are now aſſembled, are incomparably beneath thoſe of Solomon's Temple; yet the words under conſideration, may be as properly uſed at the dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:012258_0006_0F8A6BEEDBD18178"/>
of this Houſe, as they were at the conſecration of that Temple. For the preſence of God is as neceſſary in this Sanctuary, as in that of Solomon: You <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> really need God's favourable attention to your prayers offered in this Church, as the Iſraelites did in their Temple. And if you <hi>worſhip in ſpirit and in truth,</hi> with ſincere devotion and hearty affection; the God of heaven will as mercifully hear, and anſwer with as bountiful a bleſſing, thoſe prayers you offer in this Church, and as readily afford you his gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and acceptance in this Houſe, as he did the Iſraelites in that ſplendid Temple, which was adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the wealth and art of a potent empire. For, under the Chriſtian oeconomy, <hi>Wherever two or three are gathered together in</hi> Chriſt<hi>'s name, there will</hi> he <hi>be in the midſt of them.</hi> A<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> notwithſtanding <hi>heaven, and the heaven of heavens, cannot contain</hi> God; yet he will afford his preſence to the faithful, in thoſe Houſes which are built for his honour, and devoted to his ſacred worſhip and ſervice. For, <hi>thus ſaith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, whoſe name is holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit, to revive the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. Thy way, O God, is in the ſanctuary,</hi> ſaith the royal Pſalmiſt. So that, although the magnificence of this Houſe will not compare with that of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's Temple; yet if you are properly qualified for the divine favour, and in theſe courts offer up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, pure and holy worſhip, God will in a peculiar and glorious manner be preſent with a bleſſing. And ſince the occaſion of our being now aſſembled together, is ſimilar to that upon which the words of my text were firſt uſed; let us conſider them, and
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:012258_0007_0F8A6BEFA78245E8"/>
attend to the peculiar inſtruction which they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to afford.</p>
            <p>Solomon entreateth the Lord God, that in caſe his people, for their ſins, ſhould be diſtreſſed by their <hi>enemies</hi>—by <hi>drought</hi>—by <hi>dearth—peſtilence—blaſting— mildew—locuſts—caterpillars</hi>—or any kind of ſickneſs, and ſhould repent and pray to God, in or toward that houſe, he would hear and except their prayer, forgive their ſin, and deliver them out of their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. And then, the wiſe King, drawing towards a concluſion, deſires that God would be ready to hear, and graciouſly anſwer, all the faithful prayers, which ſhould be offered up in that Houſe upon any occaſion whatſoever: <hi>Now, my God, let, I beſeech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.</hi> And then he requeſts of God to accept of that Houſe for his Sanctuary; his reſting place, where he might at all times be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly preſent: That he would direct and bleſs the endeavours of the prieſthood for the good of the people; and grant his faithful worſhippers great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to rejoice in his mercy, favour and protection: <hi>Now therefore ariſe, O Lord God, into thy reſting place; thou, and the ark of thy ſtrength: Let thy prieſts, O Lord God, be cloathed with ſalvation, and let thy ſaints rejoice in goodneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This text is one remarkable inſtance of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious cuſtom among God's people, in former ages, of ſetting apart, and dedicating Houſes to the ſolemn worſhip of their maker. This cuſtom, among the Jews, was under the direction and approbation of God: And performed by Solomon, with the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate aſſiſtance of the divine ſpirit. And this has been almoſt the univerſal cuſtom of Chriſtians, ever
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012258_0008_0F8A6BF0528E3A98"/>
ſince they have been ſuffered to erect decent houſes of worſhip. Hence we may infer from the text,</p>
            <p n="1">I. That God affords his more peculiar preſence in thoſe Houſes which are devoted to his ſacred worſhip; and hath a greater regard for them than for other places.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That God is treated with greater reſpect, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reverence, by the public worſhip of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and will more graciouſly hear and anſwer their grateful praiſes, and ſincere prayers, when offered up in <hi>his</hi> Sanctuary, than elſewhere. And,</p>
            <p n="3">III. The reſpect which is due from you to this Houſe, conſidered as the Temple of God; and how you ought always to behave when you tread the courts of the Lord's Houſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, then, we learn that God affords his more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar preſence in thoſe Houſes which are devoted to his ſacred worſhip; and hath a greater regard for them than for other places. <hi>Ariſe, O Lord God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy reſting place, thou, and the ark of thy ſtrength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That allwiſe providence of the ſupreme Lord of nature, which ſurveys, and conſtantly preſides over the whole univerſe, doth nevertheleſs fix its pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar attention upon ſome particular places <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide <hi>South</hi> in eundem.</note>. <hi>God hath loved the gates of Sion, more than all the dwellings of Jacob</hi>; ſaith the Pſalmiſt. Again, <hi>the Lord hath choſen Zion; he hath deſired it for his habitation. This is my reſt for ever: Here will I dwell; for I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired it.</hi> And accordingly, in the firſt ages of the Church, to have places ſet apart for religious worſhip, was the care of divine providence. The Patriarch Jacob was admoniſhed from heaven to build an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar to the Lord, in that place where he had before appeared to him in a dream, where the Patriarch had
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012258_0009_0F8A6BF11EE26EE0"/>
               <hi>ſet up a ſtone for a pillar,</hi> and <hi>vowed,</hi> that <hi>if God would be with him,—that ſtone ſhould be God's houſe:— This,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is the gate of heaven.</hi>—How particular were the directions which God gave to Moſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Tabernacle! And how exact was he about the Temple! Though David was a <hi>man after God's own heart,</hi> and had made a prodigious prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of materials, yet, becauſe he had ſhed blood, though it was the blood of the open enemies of the true God, he was not ſuffered ſo much as to lay the foundation of that ſacred building: But the whole glory of the work devolved upon Solomon; whoſe heavenly wiſdom, ſhining forth in a bleſſed time of uninterrupted peace and plenty, rendered him a more pleaſing and unexceptionable inſtrument for ſo noble a purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Again, when the Temple, for the ſins of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was levelled with the ground, by an Aſſyrian army, yet, after the chaſtiſement of a long captivity had fitted the Jews for the precious enjoyment of God's peculiar preſence among them again, how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully did God influence the heart of Cyrus, though a heathen Prince, to ſet forward the building of another Temple! And was not that ſhining miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous cloud, which was often ſeen in and over the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle and Temple, called, by the Jews, <hi>Shekina,</hi> or majeſtic divine preſence?—Was not this, I ſay, a moſt ſenſible and wonderful token of God's peculiar regard for, and ſpecial preſence in that Houſe, which was devoted wholly to his ſolemn worſhip?</p>
            <p>Neither the horrible ſchiſm and rebellion of Corah, and his company, nor the ſudden and awful ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of heaven upon them, could deſecrate or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallow their centers, becauſe they had been devoted to the ſervice of God. Said the Lord to Moſes, <hi>the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012258_0010_0F8A6BF1DA40B7E8"/>
cenſers of theſe ſinners againſt their own ſouls, let them make broad plates for a covering of the altar; for they offered them before the Lord, therefore they are hallowed.</hi> And the caſe is juſt the ſame with reſpect to places which are conſecrated to the worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>Again, that God is peculiarly preſent in, and hath a greater regard for Houſes and other things which are devoted to his ſervice, than for thoſe which are not, appears by the exemplary vengeance of God, executed upon the profaners and impious violators of them.</p>
            <p>Sacrilegious depredations have ever been attended by the ſecret curſe of God, and the inviſible ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of heaven <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide <hi>South</hi> in eundem.</note>. This kind of wickedneſs hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the families of Princes, demoliſhed thrones, and laid whole kingdoms waſte. When the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines routed the armies of Iſrael, and took from them the ark of God, what a dreadful curſe was it to them, like a devouring plague in their very bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els!—The vengeance of heaven ſtruck Uzzah dead in a moment, for touching the ark; becauſe, though he was zealous for its preſervation, yet he had no right to meddle with it. When God delivered the law to Moſes at Sinai, any beaſt that touched the mountain, was to be ſtruck through with a dart; and to fall a ſacrifice for a crime, which it was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unconſcious of. We read that in the reign of Rehoboam, King of Judah, Shiſhak, King of Egypt, came up to Jeruſalem, and took away the treaſures of Solomon's Temple, even thoſe utenſils which had been devoted to ſacred uſe: And we are told by Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus what happened to <hi>him,</hi> after this ſacrilegious robbery.—When he returned to Egypt, great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs befel his family; he burnt to death two of his
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012258_0011_0F8A6BF2EBB214B8"/>
children; his brother conſpired againſt him; and his ſon, who next poſſeſſed the throne, was ſtruck blind. Afterwards the great Nebuchadnezzar robbed God's Temple: And we alſo read what judgments followed his ſacrilege.—For being puffed up with his own greatneſs, and what he had done, we are told that his kingdom was taken from him; and he himſelf, by a judgment before unheard of, driven from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſociety, and made to feed on graſs with the beaſts of the field; his impiety rendering him more proper to aſſociate with brutes, than with thoſe who were capable of religion.—And when his ſon Belſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar became King, at an impious feaſt, he ſent for the ſacred veſſels, which had been taken from God's Temple in Jeruſalem, and made uſe of them to drink out of, in deriſion of their being devoted to the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſervice of the God of Iſrael: And while he was profaning and polluting them with his ſenſuality, he ſaw part of an hand upon the wall of his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the palace, and the fingers writing his doom there in legible characters, <hi>viz. God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finiſhed it.—Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.—Thy kingdom is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and given to the Medes and Perſians.</hi> And the prophet Daniel, immediately before he interpreted the ſentence, told him what this judgment was for: He declared to him, that though he knew the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of his father, yet he had <hi>not humbled his heart; but</hi> thou <hi>haſt lifted up thyſelf,</hi> ſaid the prophet, <hi>againſt the Lord of heaven, and they have brought the veſſels of his Houſe before thee, and thou and thy Lords, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them.</hi>— And we are informed that the ſentence was ſpeedily executed upon him; for that very night, Cyrus with his army broke into the city of Babylon, and took
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012258_0012_0F8A6BF36DF37550"/>
from Belſhazzar both his kingdom and his life. And many other remarkable inſtances of the execution of divine vengeance, upon the profaners, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious violators of thoſe things which were ſacred to God, under the Jewiſh oeconomy, might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
            <p>Under the Chriſtian diſpenſation alſo, hiſtory abounds with accounts of the ſame thing.
<q>There is nothing (ſays an ingenious <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. South.</note> author) that the united voice of all hiſtory proclaims ſo loud, as the certain unfailing curſe, that hath purſued and overtook ſacrilege.</q>
All this ſhows that God hath a peculiar regard for Houſes, and other things, that are religiouſly devoted to his worſhip and ſervice.</p>
            <p>I will now juſt mention ſome of the reaſons why God affords his more peculiar preſence in thoſe Houſes which are devoted to his ſacred worſhip, and hath a greater regard for them, than for other places.</p>
            <p>One reaſon is, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Johnſon</hi> in eundem.</note> that God eſteems himſelf peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly honoured by his people, when they pay him that reſpectful reverence, which the meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of conſiderable numbers in one place, and unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in religious homage, doth expreſs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is pleaſed to be more peculiarly preſent among them at ſuch times.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon is, that in Houſes wholly devoted to the worſhip of God, the minds of men, being in ſome meaſure ſeparated from all worldly objects, and removed from their temporal concerns, are leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be diverted from devotion.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon is, that Houſes devoted to God, and uſed only in his ſervice, do naturally inſpire the minds of men with reverence for God and religion;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012258_0013_0F8A6BF58E90E1C0"/>
which tends to fit them for the divine preſence and bleſſing.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon why God ſo peculiarly regards his Houſe, as commonly to puniſh the profaners and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olators of it with exemplary vengeance, is becauſe that ſuch proceedings tend to the diſrepute of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and are a daring inſult upon the majeſty of the inviſible God: For aſſaulting a man's houſe, is inſulting his perſon.</p>
            <p>The laſt reaſon I ſhall mention (and that not the leaſt of them) why God manifeſts a <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> South.</note> particular regard for Houſes and other things which are devoted to his ſervice, is becauſe they are peculiarly his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. There is no holineſs in theſe things, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in themſelves, that occaſions his regard for them; not even the moſt holy place in Solomon's Temple had inherently any more ſanctity than any other place; but it was relatively holy, being in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner God's property. Not but that God is the abſolute proprietor of all things; yet nevertheleſs thoſe things, which men have no right to uſe, except in his immediate ſervice, may be peculiarly called <hi>his</hi> property; while he hath granted to them the free uſe of all other things which come in their way, for their temporal comfort and ſupport.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are peculiarly the property of God, which he hath choſen, and ſet apart for his own uſe and ſervice. <hi>Of every tree of the garden thou mayeſt freely eat,</hi> ſaid God to Adam; <hi>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou ſhalt not eat.</hi>—Thus alſo God choſe the <hi>gates of Sion, and the tribe of Levi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is likewiſe the peculiar property of God, which men ſet apart and devote to his immediate
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012258_0014_0F8A6BF647D15F90"/>
ſervice. In this caſe, men give, or more properly return, as an offering to God, that which he hath firſt given to them. They relinquiſh, quit and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up to God, all their right or liberty to uſe thoſe things as their own property, as for any worldly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which God hath freely granted to them, for their own ſecular uſe. Upon which donation or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, the property of the things given, and the uſe of them, are alienated and abſolutely changed: So that men have no manner of right to the uſe of them, except in that immediate ſervice of God, to which they were appropriated. And God will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure no rival or competitor in them: But the man who profanes, invades or violates them, is guilty of a ſacrilegious uſurpation; for which the vengeance of heaven is armed againſt him, and the curſe of God will conſume him. Man's giving up, and devoting to the immediate ſervice of God, Houſes, or other things, is now, under the Chriſtian oeconomy, the foundation of his peculiar property in them.</p>
            <p>That man who takes upon him the office of a prieſt in Chriſt's Church, doth ſo give himſelf up to God and to his ſervice, that he hath no more right to diſpoſe of himſelf to any other employment, than he hath to command the ſervice of one who is ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to, and abſolutely independent of him. And Houſes given up to God, and devoted to his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſervice, are peculiarly his property. And men have no more right to appropriate them to any other uſe, than they have to diſpoſe of other mens eſtates: Nay, the crime is, almoſt beyond compariſon, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more aggravated, becauſe it is ſacrilege—an hoſtile robbery, perpetrated againſt the ſupreme ruler of the univerſe, who is an infinite benefactor,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012258_0015_0F8A6BF9524EA158"/>
in open contempt of his authority, and the inſtituted means of his grace.</p>
            <p>And conſidering with what bold and undaunted confidence men are ſometimes apt to invade the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of an inviſible, though almighty avenger, a religious and public dedication of Houſes to the ſacred worſhip and ſervice of God, as it doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a more ſenſible reſpect and reverence, a deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er awe and veneration upon the minds of the people, is certainly a matter of no ſmall importance.</p>
            <p>And for dedicating Houſes to the public worſhip of God, and imploring his preſence and favourable acceptance of the prayers and praiſes offered up in them, we have the expreſs warrant of ſcripture; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the account of Solomon's dedicating the Temple: For <hi>when Solomon had made an end of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (as a teſtimony of divine approbation) <hi>the fire came down from heaven, and conſumed the burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the ſacrifices; and the glory of the</hi> LORD <hi>filled the Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, ſome of the reaſons (beſides thoſe already mentioned) why God hath required, and is more eſpecially pleaſed with public worſhip, are theſe; <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Johnſon</hi> in eundem.</note> that as we are made ſocial beings, and are ſenſibly affected by each other, ſo we are commonly more zealouſly affected with what we tranſact in ſociety and fellowſhip one with another.—Again, as we all enjoy the ſame common bleſſings, both temporal and ſpiritual; ſo theſe enjoyments do moſt certainly demand a common and ſocial return of praiſe. And as we all, in general, have the ſame neceſſities; ſo for the attainment of what we all equally need, it is, in all reaſon, moſt fitting we ſhould make our joint addreſſes and ſupplications to God. And as public
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012258_0016_0F8A6BFC4E694520"/>
worſhip is our moſt reaſonable ſervice, and is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of peculiar reſpect and veneration; ſo nothing on earth is more beautiful and amiable, than an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of rational creatures, joining together with one heart, and one voice, in offering up their grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful homage to their ſupreme Lord and benefactor; as St. John, in the Revelations, repreſents the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of heaven, performed in the moſt perfect man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, before the throne of God.—Such ſocial and public worſhip tends to knit our hearts together in Chriſtian love and unity.</p>
            <p>On ſuch accounts as theſe, God doth require, and is, in an eſpecial manner, pleaſed with the public and united worſhip of his creatures: And this is what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned holy David to ſay, that <hi>one day ſpent in the Houſe of God, was better than a thouſand elſewhere.</hi>— Indeed that our Maker is to be worſhipped publicly, —that the more ſolemn, general and unanimous, our adorations and acknowledgments of him are, the more are they for his honour, and the more becoming our duty; is not only the voice of revelation, but even of nature and reaſon: Which appears by the univerſal conſent of mankind, in every age and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that there never have been any communities of men, who did not cultivate ſome kind of public religious worſhip. And from the earlieſt ages of Chriſtianity, it hath ever been the practice of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors (as appears from their conſtantly meeting on the firſt day of the week, to break bread) unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly to join, in devoting themſelves to God, in his ſolemn worſhip and ſervice. Accordingly St. Paul exhorts Chriſtians, <hi>not</hi> to <hi>forſake the aſſembling of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together.</hi>—And we read that the Apoſtles <hi>lifted up their voice to God with one accord</hi>; and our Church is ſo happy as to follow their excellent example. St.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012258_0017_0F8A6BFC875891C8"/>
Paul exhorts us, <hi>with one mind, and one mouth,</hi> to <hi>glorify God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then public worſhip requires ſome particular place for the performance of it. Private devotions may be performed in any place; though ſome are more convenient than others. We read that God is <hi>about our path, and about our bed:</hi> And the more ſolitary the place, the better we may perform ſuch addreſſes. But public worſhip demands a decent Houſe, a convenient reception for numbers to reſort to, at ſtated times; a building ſet apart and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from common uſe, to which we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from the world and its cares. And ſuch Houſes being given up by us, as an offering to God, and devoted to his immediate ſervice, ought to be as commodious, elegant, and magnificent, as our abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities will admit of.</p>
            <p>But if any are inclined to blame the cuſtom of the profeſſors of the Church of England, for expenſively adorning their Houſes of public worſhip, where they are able, I would aſk them, whether being ſparing in our offerings to God, doth not manifeſt, in <hi>us,</hi> as ungrateful, ſordid narrowneſs of ſoul, and as great diſreſpect to our Maker, as was ſhown by thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> of old, who <hi>offered</hi> up <hi>for ſacrifice the blind and the lame,</hi> whoſe offerings God abhorred? And is not a liberal offering to God, an indication of reſpect to him, and regard for the honour of religion? Did God, who changeth not, ever diſapprove of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious magnificence, and coſtly ornaments of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's Temple? And did he not, by the mouth of his prophet Haggai, ſeverely reprove his people for their ſparing contributions to the ſecond Temple? <hi>Is it time</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled houſes, and this Houſe lie waſte? Build the Houſe, and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012258_0018_0F8A6BFD69C7B978"/>
I will take pleaſure in it, and I will be glorified, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Houſe of God ſhould be at leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, decent, clean, and comely, is what we might reaſonably expect everyone would approve of, who pretends to any reverence for God or religion. Saith the pious and worthy Dean Stanhope,
<q>Far from us be all ornaments, miſbecoming the worſhip of a ſpirit, or the gravity of a Church. But ſure it hath a very ill aſpect, for men to be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly and ſordidly frugal, and to think <hi>that</hi> well enough in God's Houſe, which they would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, even in the meaneſt apartments of their own. Religion ſhould not be dreſſed in the habit of a wanton; but do not deny her that of a matron.— Let her be modeſt in her garb; but withal comely and clean; and allow her enough, not only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect her from ſhame and contempt, but to draw ſome reſpect too. If ſome have injured her by a falſe and too artificial beauty, this is no reaſon why we ſhould think it a virtue, to turn pious clowns and ſlovens, by running into the contrary extreme, and,</q>
inſtead of <hi>worſhipping the Lord in the beauty of holineſs,</hi> addreſs him "in the dirt and deformity" of ſlovenlineſs. If we are contented with meanneſs and uglineſs in the Houſe of God, and being able, are however penuriouſly unwilling to provide what is honourable for his worſhip, though it be under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of regarding only <hi>ſpiritual worſhip, heart wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and the like; yet do we not tempt, nay, even provoke mankind to diſtruſt and ridicule our profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of piety, and to deſpiſe the ſervice of God? And do we not alſo incur the peculiar indignation of heaven? <hi>If ye offer the blind for ſacrifice, is it not evil? And if ye offer the lame and ſick, is it not evil? Offer
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012258_0019_0F8A6BFE008656A0"/>
it now to thy Governor, will he be pleaſed with thee, or accept thy perſon? ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> If we are willing to enjoy the beſt of every thing ourſelves, and think any thing good enough for God's ſervice, we may call him <hi>Father, Lord,</hi> or <hi>Maſter,</hi> or what we pleaſe; yet theſe ſentiments and proceedings are plain indications, that he is not the ſupreme object of our love and reverence.</p>
            <p>In the next place, as no reaſon can be given, why God ſhould not be as graciouſly preſent in each Houſe, that we now dedicate to his worſhip, as he was in the one Jewiſh Temple; ſo theſe words of the Lord, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the Prophet Iſaiah (among many other teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of ſcripture) ſeem fully to evince it: <hi>My Houſe ſhall be called the Houſe of prayer for ALL peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> By which the introduction of the Gentiles into the Church of God, is plainly foretold; and that whatſoever Houſe they ſhould devote to his ſervice, and aſſemble in for worſhip, ſhould be called God's Houſe of prayer, as the Jewiſh Temple was. And agreeable to this, St. Paul wrote to Timothy, who was then at Epheſus, <hi>hoping,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to come unto thee ſhortly; but if I tarry long, that thou mayeſt know how thou oughteſt to behave thyſelf in the Houſe of God, which is the Church of the living God.</hi> Theſe words of the Apoſtle are a ſufficient explanation of thoſe recorded by the Prophet Iſaiah, which were juſt now mentioned.</p>
            <p>Accordingly it is the cuſtom of the Church of England, when Houſes are built and reſigned up to God for the purpoſes of his worſhip, to aſſemble in them, and to join, with one accord, in public prayers and praiſes; to have ſermons preached ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thoſe occaſions, in which public declarations are made, that thoſe Houſes are devoted to God,—
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012258_0020_0F8A6BFE95BD52A8"/>
dedicated to his religious worſhip and ſervice, and from that time forward are to be eſteemed ſacred to God and religion. The peculiar preſence of God is invoked, and his favourable attention to, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial bleſſing upon thoſe perſons, who ſhall faithfully ſeek him in thoſe places. This tends to make ſuch places venerable in the eyes of men, and to draw down a divine bleſſing on worſhipping aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould be inclined to cavil, and ſay, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what hath been offered, that ſuch form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al dedications are either needleſs or ſuperſtitious; I would recommend to their conſideration, the grand ſolemnity of dedicating Solomon's Temple, and the miraculous teſtimony of divine approbation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent thereupon. And why are ſuch dedications leſs proper now? <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide <hi>South</hi> in eundem.</note> Euſebius (the firſt Chriſtian hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian, after the Apoſtles) mentions the dedication of Churches, as generally practiſed by the primitive Chriſtians. He tells us the particular manner in which this ceremony was performed, and ſtiles it a cuſtom of the Church becoming God. In a word, all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions who have retained any venerable ſentiments of God and religion (whether Chriſtians, Jews, or even heathens) have ever practiſed ſolemn, formal dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when they ſet apart Houſes for religious worſhip and ſervice.</p>
            <p>But though, after our Churches are dedicated, we attribute no inherent holineſs to them, but only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, as being ſet apart from worldly uſes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted wholly to religious purpoſes, yet ſome are apt to accuſe us of having a ſuperſtitious regard for the Houſes themſelves. Are they not wood and ſtone, ſay they, as well as other buildings? I anſwer; this cavil is the language of that recent kind of refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012258_0021_0F8A6BFF5DB16CD8"/>
and ſpiritualized piety, to which Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles were utter ſtrangers. Our Lord had ſuch zeal for the honour of God's Houſe, that he himſelf drove out of it the buyers, ſellers, and other invaders of it. And St. Paul reproved the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, for profanely eating or feaſting in their Churches. <hi>Have ye not houſes to eat and drink in? Or deſpiſe ye the Church of God?</hi> ſaid he.—I have now done with the firſt general head of diſcourſe, and proceed to ſhow,</p>
            <p n="2">II. That God is treated with greater reſpect, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reverence, by the public worſhip of his people; and will more graciouſly hear and anſwer their grateful praiſes and ſincere prayers, when offered up in <hi>his</hi> Sanctuary, than elſewhere. <hi>Now, my God, let, I beſeech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place,</hi> ſaid So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, when he dedicated the Temple. And ſoon after God anſwered him, ſaying, <hi>now mine eyes ſhall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.</hi> And no reaſon can be given, why God ſhould not be as well pleaſed <hi>now,</hi> with public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in his own Houſe, as he was under the Jewiſh oeconomy; for numbers publicly to aſſemble, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to worſhip God, is evidently a token of reſpect and reverence for him: But it is ſtill more ſo, when they wait on him for that purpoſe, at his own Houſe. And conſequently God will more graciouſly hear and anſwer prayers and praiſes, when offered up in his Sanctuary, than elſewhere. Public worſhip, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral reaſons, is extremely neceſſary and becoming, (as I have ſhown under the preceding head of this diſcourſe) and ſo is peculiarly entitled to the divine attention and bleſſing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:012258_0022_0F8A6C002469BB48"/>I have already proved that God is peculiarly preſent in Houſes which are devoted to his worſhip: But what other valuable purpoſe can his peculiar preſence there anſwer, or what elſe can be meant by it, but his being peculiarly ready to hear, anſwer, and bleſs thoſe who worſhip him, as they ought to do, in his own Houſe? What elſe can the ſpecial preſence of God ſignify? The author and governor of all worlds is not a corporeal being: He cannot be confined within any place, or contained within any particular limits; <hi>for heaven, and the heaven of heavens, cannot contain him:</hi> But univerſal extent is filled with the immenſity of his preſence and exiſtence. The ſpecial preſence of God, in any particular place, muſt therefore ſignify, that he is, in that place, peculiarly gracious and merciful. Hence David prayed that God would <hi>ſend help from the Sanctuary</hi>—and declared that <hi>his way is in the Sanctuary</hi>—that <hi>from Mount Zion, the Lord commanded his bleſſing, even life for evermore.</hi>— And Chriſt hath told us, that <hi>where two or three are gathered together in his name</hi> (for public worſhip, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of him) <hi>there he is in the midſt of them.</hi>—From theſe obſervations it plainly appears, that God is treated with greater reſpect, honour, and reverence, by the public worſhip of his people; and will more graciouſly hear and anſwer their prayers and praiſes, when offered up in his Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, than elſewhere. But I proceed to ſhow, in the</p>
            <p n="3">III. And laſt place, the reſpect which is due from you to this Houſe, conſidered as the Temple of God; and how you ought always to behave when you tread the Courts of the Lord's Houſe.</p>
            <p>There is ſomething ſo great and affecting, ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and ſolemn, in the appearance of a congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, when united in religious worſhip, each one
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012258_0023_0F8A6C00E3868738"/>
joining both with heart and voice, in paying homage to the Almighty King of glory in his own Sanctuary; that nothing on earth beſides can ſo nearly reſemble the tranſcendently glorious exerciſes of heaven. For the bleſſed angels are repreſented as jointly paying, with united voices, their grateful, ſolemn, and joyous addreſſes, to the ſupreme governor of the univerſe, in ſuch a language as this, <hi>holy, holy, holy</hi> LORD GOD <hi>of hoſts, which was, and is, and is to come; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth are full of thy glory: Great and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous are thy works, O</hi> LORD GOD <hi>Almighty; juſt and true are thy ways, thou King of ſaints.—Bleſſing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that ſitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi>— What can be more delightful at preſent, than to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the worſhipping choirs of heaven, and to make that our pleaſing employment now, which hereafter is to be our buſineſs and delight for ever? If we hope to enjoy the company of pure and holy ſpirits above, is it not extremely proper and neceſſary for us to learn their bleſſed practice while here on earth, by habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating ourſelves to thoſe religious exerciſes, in which the happineſs of heaven conſiſts, and by which we ſhall become more and more fit <hi>to be partakers of the inheritance of the ſaints in light,</hi> until we are ready to join our kindred ſpirits above?</p>
            <p>And as this Houſe is built for the honour of the Deity, and given up to theſe religious exerciſes, ſo let it be devoted entirely to this uſe. And as it is now ſet apart for the convenience of public worſhip and religious ſervice, ſo take notice and remember, that it is dedicated to this holy purpoſe, and reſigned up to the ſupreme Majeſty of heaven. Let it therefore be, from this time forward, ſacred to ALMIGHTY GOD, by the name of TRINITY-CHURCH.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:012258_0024_0F8A6C019419FF00"/>Now then let us all heartily and devoutly addreſs the throne of grace, as Solomon did on a like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.—<hi>Ariſe, O Lord God, into thy reſting place: Let thy prieſts, O Lord God, be cloathed with ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and let thy ſaints rejoice in goodneſs. Let,</hi> we <hi>beſeech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent unto</hi> all <hi>the prayers that are made in this place.</hi> May the holy ſpirit of God attend the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of this Houſe, and the means of grace be ever ſucceſsful here. May the reading of the word of God, and the preaching of the goſpel in this Houſe, through the rich bleſſing of God, produce the heavenly fruit of holineſs, and lead many ſouls to eternal life. May all thoſe, that ſhall here be taken into the covenant of grace, by baptiſm, be ſanctified and conſtantly led by the bleſſed influences of the divine ſpirit: May they ſtedfaſtly adhere to their ſacred engagements;
<q>ever remain in the number of thy faithful and elect children; and be everlaſtingly rewarded by thee,</q>
O heavenly Father. And may all thoſe who ſhall here devote themſelves to God, in the participation of the Lord's ſupper, in commemoration of the death of their dear Redeemer, receive plentiful communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the divine ſpirit; never diſgrace their holy profeſſion, but faithfully perform their ſacred obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and <hi>grow up in holineſs and comfort through faith, unto eternal ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And grant, O heavenly Father, that thy people who ſhall wait upon thee, and devoutly offer up pure and holy worſhip, in this <hi>Houſe of prayer,</hi> may enjoy all the privileges, and bleſſings of the covenant of grace, <hi>which is in all things well ordered and ſure.</hi>— And <hi>when thy judgments are abroad in the earth,</hi> to puniſh the wickedneſs of men, and thy people in this place ſhall be diſtreſſed with mortal ſickneſs, or any

other ſore calamity, if they ſhall repent and turn to thee, <hi>then, whatſoever prayer or ſupplication ſhall be made by any man, or by all thy people,</hi> in this place, <hi>when</hi> any, or <hi>every one ſhall know his own ſore and his own grief, and ſhall ſpread forth his hands in this Houſe: Hear thou from heaven, thy dwelling place, and forgive</hi>; deliver them out of their calamity, ſend forth thy bleſſing upon them, grant thy mercy and favour unto all thoſe who implore it, through the atonement of thy Son; and cauſe <hi>the hearts of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to turn unto the wiſdom of the juſt; that thy people</hi> in this place <hi>may fear thee, and walk in thy ways.</hi> And being <hi>planted in the Houſe of the</hi> LORD, <hi>may</hi> they <hi>flouriſh in the courts of</hi> thy <hi>Houſe,</hi> O God, bring forth <hi>the fruit of thy ſpirit,</hi> even <hi>goodneſs, and righteouſneſs, and truth</hi>; and enjoy both the bleſſings of thy Houſe here, and life for evermore!</p>
            <p>Grant that this people may ſpeedily be ſupplied with an able, ſpiritual guide, who ſhall profitably explain to them <hi>the word of truth</hi>; be an ornament to his profeſſion, a worthy Ambaſſador of God, and Meſſenger of Chriſt, a bright ſhining light in this Sanctuary: And give thy people in this place occaſion to cry out, <hi>how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the goſpel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!</hi> Grant this, O Lord God, for Jeſus Chriſt's ſake, our only Mediator and Redeemer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Amen.</p>
            <p>And now, my brethren, you are to conſider this Houſe, as it truly is, the Temple of the living God: And to behave in it, at all times,
<q>as under God's more immediate preſence and obſervation.</q>
               <hi>How dreadful is this place! ſurely this is none other than the Houſe of God; this is the gate of heaven,</hi> ſaid the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Patriarch Jacob, when he aroſe from his dream
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012258_0026_0F8A6C035039EE40"/>
or viſion, in which the divine preſence appeared in a glorious view. What can be expreſſed with a more majeſtic ſolemnity than this ſentence which he utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? <hi>How dreadful!</hi> as much as to ſay, though this is a deſert which is wild and ſolitary, deſtitute of cultivation and the conveniences of life, where I have reclined my head on a pillow of ſtones; yet how awfully venerable is it, ſince the immortal God hath conſecrated it with his holy preſence! <hi>Surely the</hi> LORD <hi>is in this place,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and I knew it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When God appeared in viſions formerly, and whereſoever he was publicly worſhipped, his people had a powerful ſenſe of his preſence, and, when in ſuch places, always expreſſed the moſt awful vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. So, my brethren, ought you to behave, when you are in this Houſe. And to wait upon God here, ought to be your peculiar delight. LORD, <hi>I have loved the habitation of thy Houſe, and the place where thine honour dwelleth,</hi> ſaid holy David. And he knew no happineſs on earth, equal to that of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting to the Sanctuary of God: For when he was under the greateſt perſonal diſtreſſes; when his own children rebelled againſt him, and ſought his life, when his friends deſerted him, and his enemies tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly reviled him; no trouble ſeemed to be ſo deeply fixed in his heart, as his baniſhment from the Houſe of the Lord. <hi>My ſoul longeth,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>yea even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: My heart and my fleſh cry out for the living God.—O ſend out thy light and thy truth, let them lead me, let them guide me unto thy holy hill, and to thy Tabernacle! Then will I go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the altar of God; unto God, my exceeding joy: Yea upon the harp will I praiſe thee, O God! my God!</hi> How earneſtly did the Prophet Daniel entreat his Maker that the Temple might be rebuilt? <hi>Cauſe thy
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012258_0027_0F8A6C0697B8A990"/>
face to ſhine upon thy Sanctuary, that is deſolate. Thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants take pleaſure in her ſtones,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and favour the duſt thereof.</hi> They had a veneration for the very ruins of the Houſe of God; and loved the meer duſt and rubbiſh of Sion, more than all the ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous palaces of Babylon. So ought you to regard and reverence this Houſe, this Temple of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God.</p>
            <p>Now the very notion of reverential reſpect, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly includes two things: <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Warren</hi> in eundem.</note> An inward eſteem of what we regard or reverence, and the expreſſion of that eſteem by ſuitable external actions. No one can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to reverence any thing, unleſs from his heart he bears a regard to it. Without this, all outward ſhow is but meer hypocriſy. And the eſteem ought always to be in proportion to the worthineſs of the object. There is a degree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence due to God, which can be due to none <hi>but God:</hi> He juſtly claims our ſupreme veneration. But then his Houſe, and every thing beſides, that relates immediately to divine worſhip, claim a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree of our reverence and reſpect.</p>
            <p>In the preſent caſe, the reverence which we owe to this Houſe of God, doth not ariſe from the meer building itſelf; but from its being a place ſolemnly dedicated to religious worſhip; where we, as being his children, are to receive the bleſſings of the Father of ſpirits: And where, as being the work of his hands, we are to <hi>worſhip, fall down, and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</hi> The inward eſteem and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence which is due to the Houſe of God, is in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreſſed in the moſt affectionate language:— <hi>How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O Lord of hoſts!</hi> ſaid David. How hearty was the reſpect which our
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012258_0028_0F8A6C07C4827310"/>
Saviour paid to the Temple, when, with a pious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, <hi>he caſt out them that ſold and bought therein?</hi> And while we remember the pious regard and zeal of our bleſſed Lord, for <hi>his Father's Houſe of prayer,</hi> and reverence this Houſe only on God's account; we need not be afraid of carrying our veneration for it too high. The danger, my brethren, is that you will not retain in your minds ſuch a powerful ſenſe of the holineſs of this Houſe, and of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial preſence of God in it, as becomes you. You are always to remember that the lofty Majeſty of heaven is peculiarly preſent here; and that it is your duty to approach him with reſpectful awe; with godly fear and reverence, with an holy dread, and moſt profound ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>But this brings me to ſpeak of the other part of that reverence, which is due to the ſacred Majeſty of the inviſible God, and to this edifice, wherein he is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly preſent. This conſiſts in ſuch actions or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward behaviour, as are moſt expreſſive of your inward reſpect, and venerable regard for them. And I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you all to conſider, that whoſoever bears a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere regard to any thing, will not fail, on proper occaſions, to expreſs it, by his outward carriage and demeanour. When we ſee a man treat another with rudeneſs or indifference; we do not fail to conclude that he wants a real reſpect for him. And ſo, when you ſee a man behave in God's Houſe of prayer with an air of vanity and irreverence, you may alſo reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably conclude, that he regards neither the Houſe he is in, nor the preſence and authority of that being, who hath commanded him to <hi>keep his Sabbaths, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence his Sactuary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, for creatures ſo weak and degenerate, ſo mean and ſinful as we are, the moſt ſubmiſſive poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012258_0029_0F8A6C0A9B6CD020"/>
that we are capable of, are hardly low and humble enough, when we approach the ſupreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of heaven and earth, in his own Houſe; a God of infinite holineſs, in whoſe preſence the very angels, though a more noble order of beings than we are, and free from all guilt; yet are ſaid to <hi>veil their faces,</hi> to expreſs their ſolemn reſpect and reverence; and to <hi>bow down</hi> before him, in token of awful ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>Therefore, whenſoever you aſſemble in this Houſe for worſhip, as a public acknowledgment of the moſt high God, by no means allow yourſelves in any idle, inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, irreverend geſtures, leſt, under the hypocritical pretence of giving God your <hi>hearts,</hi> you afford him not even ſo much as the ſervice of your <hi>bodies.</hi> And I entreat all thoſe, who are fearful of ſhowing the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God of heaven too much outward reverence and reſpect, to remember that <hi>he</hi> is the creator of their bodies as well as their ſouls: That <hi>he</hi> preſerves and ſupports them both; and that <hi>he</hi> requires, and hath an equal right to the worſhip and ſervice of both. <hi>Glorify God in your body,</hi> ſaith St. Paul, <hi>and in your ſpirit, which are God's.</hi> And again ſaith he, <hi>I beſeech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice, holy and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto God, which is your reaſonable ſervice.</hi> Such a ſervice is very agreeable to reaſon, which teaches us, that he who made the body, hath a right to the worſhip and ſervice of it.</p>
            <p>One would think experience alone ſufficient to prove to a Chriſtian, the efficacy of a ſerious, humble, outward deportment of the body, in order to excite and cheriſh in the ſoul a ſincere and lively devotion. Chriſt, our bleſſed Redeemer, who did not come into the world to encourage ſuperſtition; yet, when he earneſtly prayed, juſt before his crucifixion, that <hi>if
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012258_0030_0F8A6C0B60074F70"/>
it were poſſible, that cup might paſs from him,</hi> did not refuſe the moſt humble poſture: but <hi>kneeled down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground.</hi> And can any who pretend to <hi>name the name of Chriſt,</hi> refuſe to follow his example? Will they preſume to addreſs God with leſs deference than his own Son our Lord and Maſter did! Will they dare to be ſo rude and indecent, ſo bold and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming, when they are in the ſpecial preſence of the ſacred Majeſty of heaven, as to compoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a ſleepy poſture, or behave themſelves as careleſly as though they were in their own houſes, without appearing to have the leaſt veneration for God's Sanctuary, and the worſhip of their Maker, who can deſtroy them in a moment, with the breath of his mouth! Is it not, my brethren, prodigious ſtrange, that men, while they pretend to honour God, ſhould affront him to his face! But it is ſtill more wonderful, if poſſible, that any of the profeſſors of Chriſtianity ſhould be deluded with ſuch falſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of reverence, as to imagine that their outward behaviour, ſuch as <hi>kneeling at prayers, bowing at the name of Jeſus,</hi> in the rehearſal of what they believe, <hi>ſtanding up</hi> when the Pſalms are read or ſung, and the like, is ſo far from being any part of religious reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or divine worſhip, as juſtly to deſerve the name of ſuperſtition! Not conſidering that the worſhip of the body, is as really our duty as that of the ſoul: And that it is abſolutely impoſſible for our ſouls to be well affected and piouſly devout, while we do <hi>wilfully</hi> or <hi>ſcornfully</hi> refuſe to honour and reverence God with our bodies, in the manner that St. Paul exhorts us to do.</p>
            <p>Therefore, my brethren, I do entreat you, by no means to neglect bodily worſhip, which is your indiſpenſable duty, and very uſeful to recall your
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012258_0031_0F8A6C0E0E500830"/>
wandering thoughts, to the exerciſes of inward devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to increaſe and keep up your religious zeal and piety. Be very careful to avoid all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent, careleſs, indifferent, lolling, ſlovenly geſtures, in the public worſhip of Almighty God. Do not ſtand up when you are commanded to kneel, nor ſit down when the rules of the common prayer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you to ſtand; but know aſſuredly, that all incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to oppoſe theſe rules and orders is irregular, and proceeds either from inattention, lazineſs, indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, a diſputatious temper of mind, or from that perverſe pride and obſtinacy, which are owing to the vile ſuggeſtions of the great enemy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>A mind truly pious and devout, will unavoidably ſhow its ſincerity, by an humble, religious, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verential deportment of body in the Houſe of God. And I think it muſt be morally impoſſible, for men, who have a ſincere regard for religion, to come to Church, without diſcovering, while in the peculiar preſence of their Maker, ſome tokens of religious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, in their bodily behaviour. A ſincerely good man is ſenſible of the great duty and advantage of waiting upon God in his Houſe: He ſo well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his own infirmities, and hath ſo ſolemn a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the divine preſence, that, while he is in the exerciſe of devotion, and all the time that he remains in the Houſe of God, he imagines no care nor cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection too great, for the ſuitable conduct both of body and ſoul. Whereas many people attend public worſhip in God's Sanctuary, with ſuch a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs indifference, as amounts to a ſtrong indication of a wicked and perverſe, of an obſtinate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane temper of mind: So that we have juſt reaſon to ſuſpect, and fear, that the inward diſpoſition of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012258_0032_0F8A6C0EF75F5E88"/>
their ſouls is of the very ſame caſt with the haughty negligence, and lazy indecency, of their bodily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment.</p>
            <p>But,
<q>in order to your duly reverencing this Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary</q>
of the moſt high God, you muſt behave in it
<q>with that inward piety, and that outward hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, which ſo auguſt a preſence, and ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous a concern, require of you.</q>
And that ye may do theſe things the better, you ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare yourſelves well beforehand: Which is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly proper for <hi>us</hi> of the Church of England, ſince we may know, before we begin, exactly what we have to do: And have therefore a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in preparing for the due performance of it.</p>
            <p>When you offer up your public addreſſes to God in this Houſe, though the words are ready prepared for you to utter, yet you have enough to employ you, in preſenting them to the throne of grace, with zealous attention and undiſturbed devotion. They only, who heartily and affectionately offer up to God the words which they uſe (whether by the aſſiſtance of a book, or without) can be truly ſaid to pray as they ought. But ſince we are <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ak and imperfect creatures, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to tranſact many things at one and the ſame time, it is evidently moſt proper for us, when we publicly worſhip God in his own Houſe, to have nothing elſe to do, for the exerciſe of the ſoul, but to employ it in offering up, with fervent devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what we have very often conſidered, and do well underſtand: That we may not ſpend our time in ſtudying how to tickle each other's ears, and rack our heads with invention, while our hearts ought to glow with the moſt ſolemn devotion: And that we may not be employed in conſidering the new peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which we hear, and whether they are fit for
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012258_0033_0F8A6C0F2B562D60"/>
us to join in, while we ought to do homage to God with our voices, and to reverence him with the warm affections of our hearts. He that uſeth our liturgy in public worſhip, with that holy devotion of ſoul which he ought,
<q>can never complain that forms of prayer ſtint the ſpirit, or make men lazy and idle.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To make you ſincerely good and pious, whether you will or no, is not in the power of the Church of England. All our Church can do, is to aſſiſt you, in the beſt manner, concerning your devotions, and to lead you in the ſureſt and moſt direct courſe to heaven. And this ſhe hath done with peculiar wiſdom and piety. And if you comply with her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, you will reap the bleſſed benefit, and rejoice in ſo great a privilege. But if you will not obſerve the rules preſcribed, and accordingly ſhould not receive any manner of <hi>good</hi> to your ſouls; yet that will not be the fault of the Church, but entirely your own.— Therefore I exhort and intreat you all, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Chriſtianity, for the glory of God, and for the benefit of your own immortal ſouls, to make a right uſe of our public liturgy. In order to which, you muſt often peruſe it; take care to underſtand it; and prepare yourſelves for the due performance of <hi>your part</hi> in it. And to aſſiſt you, I will now, in a few words, explain to you the right uſe of our morning and evening ſervice.</p>
            <p>Our public devotions begin with two or three ſhort ſentences of ſcripture, expreſſive of our wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and of the mercy of God: After which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the miniſter, "a ſerious exhortation to repentance;" that the minds of the people may be impreſſed with a humble ſenſe of their ſins, that they may recollect their many iniquities, and that they
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012258_0034_0F8A6C0FD6DEBC80"/>
may be properly diſpoſed to enter upon the great du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of repentance: Accordingly, then followeth a general confeſſion of ſins, imploring forgiveneſs; to be ſaid by the whole congregation, by miniſter and people alternately, with a ſolemn voice, <hi>all kneeling,</hi> and with a truly humble and penitent heart. After which, the prieſt alone uttereth the abſolution; which is a declaration that God will be merciful to all true penitents. And when this is performed, the remembrance of God's mercy will tend to make us ſubmiſſive, dutiful, and thankful. Then we may, with comfortable aſſurance, call God our Father, in that form which Chriſt hath taught us. Accordingly the miniſter and people, all as one, repeat the Lord's prayer. Thus the honeſt Churchman, the pious Chriſtian, receives divine comfort in the Houſe of God. For though he frequently offendeth through the infirmity of his nature; yet he doth as often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and always, when he is in the Sanctuary, implore pardon. And ſo, by conſtantly mortifying and bewailing his ſins, he obtains an habitual aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to them: And from the ſincerity of his repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, derives a joyful hope of pardon, and of the favour of his Maker, through the gracious medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of his kind Redeemer.</p>
            <p>The Pſalms, which conſiſt chiefly in praiſes, come next in our liturgy: And in order to the due per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this part of our worſhip, we muſt frequently and attentively conſider the Majeſty and goodneſs of God. And our minds, being properly affected therewith, will be prepared to hear, with dutiful attention, the portions of ſcripture read by the miniſter: And we ſhall be diſpoſed to receive them as ſpoken to ourſelves; ſince <hi>all ſcripture is given by inſpiration of God; and is profitable for doctrine, for
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012258_0035_0F8A6C108FDEF530"/>
reproof, for correction, and inſtruction in righteouſneſs.</hi> —And if we are thankful to God, as we ought to be, for the light of revelation, we ſhall be diſpoſed to utter, with a heavenly tranſport of joy and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, among others, that moſt divine anthem,
<q>we praiſe thee, O God, we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.</q>
Thus we ſhall <hi>ſerve the Lord with gladneſs,</hi> praiſe him publicly with chearfulneſs, and take peculiar delight in the courts of the Houſe of our God.</p>
            <p>The remaining part, both of our morning and evening ſervice, doth moſt intimately concern our temporal and eternal intereſt: And conſiſts in a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of petitions, for all thoſe good things which we need, relating both to <hi>this</hi> life, and to <hi>that</hi> which is to come. And that we may perform this part of our public ſervice to God's acceptance, and by his bleſſing obtain what we aſk for, it is abſolutely neceſſary that we pray with faith and humility: And be alſo well perſuaded, that we aſk for nothing but what is both lawful and expedient. And in order to this, we muſt frequently and ſeriouſly conſider what it is we pray for. Therefore it is very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for you to read and examine, with diligent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, the common prayers, and the ſeveral di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections contained in the rubricks. And I aſſure you, that the liturgy of the Church of England is the beſt collection, both of prayers, and rules for public worſhip, that can be found among all human compoſitions. And as you have the beſt aſſiſtance for publicly worſhipping the ſupreme Lord of the univerſe, that human wiſdom hath ever yet contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo it will greatly increaſe your condemnation, if you neglect to make a good uſe of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:012258_0036_0F8A6C1147A09F18"/>I ſhall not, at this time, undertake to conſider, in any particular manner, the caſe of thoſe who diſſent from our ſolemn and divine method of worſhip, for the ſake of extemporary prayers, and undigeſted effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Let me only obſerve, that thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that they cannot be religiouſly devout in our form of worſhip, will hardly be ſincerely ſo in their own.</p>
            <p>He that intimately knows the ſecrets of all hearts, ought not to be addreſſed with raſhneſs and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: Nor to be treated with idleneſs or wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But we muſt pray with faith and zealous attention, with humble reverence and ſincere devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in order to meet with divine acceptance. And he that is not affected with the humility, ſolemnity and piety of the public prayers of the Church of England, muſt, I am ſure, be either ſtupidly inattentive, or perverſely ſtubborn, or perhaps otherwiſe extremely vicious in his diſpoſition and behaviour.</p>
            <p>And as to bodily worſhip, it muſt be very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to leave every one to follow all the whims that can be ſtarted by his own private fancy, either to ſit, ſtand, or kneel, juſt as he pleaſes. Therefore, like a wife and good mother, tenderly concerned for the true intereſt of her ſpiritual children, our Church hath directed and commanded us, to behave in each part of our public worſhip, as ſhe judged to be moſt becoming. When we earneſtly implore the greateſt of mercies, ſuch as the forgiveneſs of our ſins, the influences of the divine ſpirit, deliverance from all calamities, the continual preſervation of our ſouls, of our bodies and eſtates, and the mercy and favour of God towards others, we are required to kneel. While the word of God is read or preached to us, we are allowed to ſit down, provided we are ſerious and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012258_0037_0F8A6C12085BA9E8"/>
attentive, and behave with proper decency. And when we are rehearſing the creeds, which contain the ſubſtance of our Chriſtian belief, or while ſome part of the goſpel, particularly adapted to the ſeaſon, is read to us, we are commanded to ſtand up, in token of reſpectful reverence. And, at all times, when we either read or ſing the praiſes of God, as they are contained in the Pſalms, or thoſe Hymns which we uſe, let us by no means refuſe to ſtand up, which is the moſt becoming poſture for thanſgiving and praiſe. David exhorts to <hi>praiſe the Lord</hi>—STANDING <hi>in the Lord's Houſe.</hi> And we read, concerning the worſhip at the dedication of Solomon's Temple, that when <hi>the Prieſts and Levites praiſed the Lord—all Iſrael</hi> STOOD. Therefore, my brethren, you ought ſtrictly to conform to all the rules and directions of the Church of England, reſpecting public worſhip, ſince they are agreeable to the higheſt reaſon, plainly warranted by ſacred ſcripture, and the moſt of them no leſs than divine commands.—I need not explain to you any more of the particulars of our worſhip: They are all to be found diſtinctly ſet down in the Common Prayer-Book; to that I refer you.</p>
            <p>After what hath been ſaid, is it not ſurpriſing, that any ſhould be ſo ſtubborn and diſobedient, as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the directions of our liturgy, which are ſo wiſe and rational; or from our method of worſhip, which is ſo eaſy and becoming, ſo pious and humble, ſo plain, beautiful and ſolemn? Since the worſhip of the Church of England doth agree ſo exactly with reaſon, with the commands, exhortations, and pious examples which are recorded in holy ſcripture; let it be ſuitably impreſſed on your minds, that if you wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully refuſe to comply with it, you will moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incur the vengeance of heaven, for diſobedience to
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012258_0038_0F8A6C14080BFF60"/>
your proper governors, both in Church and State: Becauſe your compliance with the liturgy, is required and commanded by the authority of both; whom you are bound to obey in every thing that they enjoin, which is not forbidden by the laws of God. But though I accuſe people of irreverence, for not ſtanding when public praiſes or thankſgivings are offered up, or for not kneeling in the time of ſolemn public prayer; yet I know very well, that many will ſpeak of theſe attitudes as matters of indifference, notwithſtanding they are both abſolutely commanded in holy writ, and are alſo agreeable to the conſtant example of all the ſcripture worthies. But ſuppoſe they were indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, one might reaſonably imagine, that no wiſe or good man would run the riſque of drawing upon himſelf the diſpleaſure of heaven, for not complying with the commands of lawful authority, in what is ſo eaſy to be performed, and in what he confeſſeth to be indifferent, and ſo not ſinful. <hi>Submit yourſelves,</hi> faith St. Peter, <hi>to every ordinance of man, for the Lord's ſake.</hi>—And to the ſame effect are the following words of St. Paul, <hi>let every ſoul be ſubject unto the higher power; for there is no power but of God: The powers that be are ordained of God. Whoſoever therefore reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God: And they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may, with very little trouble, ſtand and kneel in public worſhip, as you are commanded: But the evils which you incur by refuſing ſo to do, are great. A ſmall portion of knowledge, with an honeſt, humble, and obedient heart, renders us ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the ſpiritual graces of the Holy Ghoſt. But when we wilfully and ſtubbornly refuſe to comply with the ordinances both of God and men; and <hi>hew out</hi> for ourſelves <hi>broken ciſterns,</hi> by our own invention;
