            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>DANIEL XI. 30, 32.</bibl>
               <q>So ſhall he do, he ſhall even return, and have Intelligence with them that forſake the holy Covenant.—And ſuch as do wickedly againſt the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſhall be corrupt by Flatteries.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE cruel Tyrant here intended was ANTIOCHUS EPIPHANES, the little Horn in Daniel's Viſion, Chap. VIII. 9,—12. <q>And out of one of them came forth a little Horn, which waxed exceeding great toward the South, and toward the Eaſt, and toward the pleaſant Land. And it waxed great even to the Hoſt of Heaven; and it caſt down ſome of the Hoſt, and of the Stars to the Ground, and ſtamped upon them. Yea he mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified himſelf even to the Prince of the Hoſt, and by him the daily Sacrifice was taken away, and the Place of his Sanctuary was caſt down. And an Hoſt was given him againſt the daily Sacrifice, by Reaſon of Tranſgreſſion; and it caſt down the Truth to the Ground, and it practiſed and proſpered.</q> This is explained to the Prophet by the Angel, <hi>That in the latter Time of their Kingdom, when the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors are come to the full, a King of fierce Countenance, and Underſtanding dark Sentences, ſhall ſtand up. And his Power ſhall be mighty, but not by his own Power; and he ſhall deſtroy wonderfully, and ſhall proſper and practiſe, and ſhall deſtroy the mighty, and the holy People. And through his Policy alſo he ſhall cauſe Craft to proſper in his Hand, and he ſhall magnify himſelf on his Heart, and by Peace ſhall deſtroy many: He ſhall alſo ſtand up againſt the Prince of Princes; but he ſhall be broken without Hand.</hi>

Tyrant <hi>forſook the holy Covenant,</hi> the Covenant of the LORD GOD of their Fathers, and the Covenant they themſelves had made to ſerve the Lord, to keep his Laws, and maintain the Rights and Privileges of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

And no ſort of low Cunning, no Arts of Deceit and Falſhood were too much for them who had given themſelves over to Satan, and this great Officer of his curſed State and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>BUT we are to obſerve, that the Foundation of all their Wickedneſs was, their <hi>forſaking the holy Covenant.</hi> And this is the Occaſion and Ground of all abominable Practices in a Chriſtian Land.

               </gap>ſſaries of the Tyrant were among the Jews, what the Tories are in this Country in the preſent Day. They forſook the holy Covenant, and then they were corrupted by Flatteries to give Intelligence to one of the worſt of Men, and crueleſt of Tyrants that ever exiſted on this Side the infernal Regions. And how are ſuch Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-breakers corrupted ſtill by Bribes and Flatteries, to give the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and his Cut-throats Intelligence?</p>
            <p>WE ſhall endeavor to take a little larger View of our Subject, under the following Propoſitions, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>I. DESCRIBE, in a comparative View, the Perſons ſpoken of in the Text.</p>
            <p>II. WE ſhall endeavor to point out their heinous Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>III. SHEW the Danger of ſuch People in a State or Country.</p>
            <p>IV. MAKE Application.</p>
            <p>I. WE are to deſcribe, in a comparative View, the Perſons ſpoken of in the Text.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE firſt is a Tyrant, and he one of the greateſt and worſt that ever exiſted among thoſe that had the Name of Man. Antiochus, it would ſeem, aimed to be more than a Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander both. He was worſe by far than both of them, for he even abandoned all Religion and Virtue. Not only did he level his Oppoſition againſt the Religion of the Jews, the only true Religion then in the World, but even the Religion of Nature, all the Religion of the Gentiles, ſee Ver. 36, 37, of the Context. <q>And the King ſhall do according to his Will; and he ſhall exalt himſelf, and magnify himſelf above every
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017316_0004_103CECA9D27C8F28"/>
God; and he ſhall ſpeak marvellous Things againſt the God of Gods.—Neither ſhall he regard the God of his Fathers, nor the Deſire of Women, nor regard any God; for he ſhall magnify himſelf above all.</q> So he was a perfect and conſummate Athirſt. This was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common. Nebuchadnezzar was a Deiſt, and a Worſhipper of Idols. Yea he owned and acknowleged the only true God.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 3 28, 29. <hi>and</hi> 4. 2, 3, 37.</note> And ſo did moſt, if not all the old Tyrants. The leſs any Man has of Religion, the more he is of a Tyrant. Moreover this Antiochus ſtripped and plundered a great Part of the World of their natural Rights and Privileges, took away their Eſtates and Laws, and ſuch as eſcaped with their Lives were turned into a State of Poverty and Diſtreſs. v. 43 <hi>He ſhall have Power over the Treaſures of Gold and of Silver; and over all the precious Things of Egypt.</hi> And he plundered the Temple and the City of Jeruſalem.<note n="†" place="bottom">1 <hi>Maccabees,</hi> 1 <hi>Chap.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>FURTHERMORE, he uſed Chicanery and Flattery, corrupting and bribing People to favor and aſſiſt him in his wicked Practices. Thus this <hi>vile Perſon</hi> obtained the Kingdom by Flattery, ver. 21. And he corrupted by Flatteries looſe and wicked People to ſtand on his Side, and carry on his infernal Works of Rapine and Cruelty. What a lively Picture of later Tyrants. <q>He ſcattered among them the Prey and the Spoil and the Riches,</q> juſt as GEORGE the Third of England has among his corrupt Miniſtry, and his Vaſſals that he has flattered and cajoled to cut the Throats of this peaceable Country. How has he exhauſted the public Treaſury, and oppreſſed his loyal Subjects by moſt enormous Taxes, till they are in a great Meaſure ruined and bankrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the poor periſhing in the Streets, ſtill hardened againſt all their Cries, Prayers, Petitions and Remonſtrances, and perfectly callous to all Feeling of the Miſeries of his People, till the Nation, being thrown into the greateſt Ferment, has riſen againſt him and his corrupt Parliament.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, this impious Antiochus ſent Fire and Sword amongſt his Jewiſh Subjects, ver. 33. <q>Yet they ſhall fall by the Sword, and by Flame, by Captivity and by Spoil many Days.</q> This is exactly anſwered in his Antitype in England, who for theſe five or ſix Years has been laying many of our populous Towns in Aſhes, and pouring out the Blood of hundreds and thouſands of the peaceable Inhabitants by the Force of the Sword.</p>
            <p>ONCE more, Antiochus was a great Perſecutor of the Saints of the moſt High. <q>His Heart was againſt the holy Covenant,</q> ver. 28. And thoſe whom he deſtroyed by the Sword, Fire, Captivity and Spoil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many days, were ſuch as <hi>had Underſtanding, and inſtructed many</hi> in the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017316_0005_103CECAB8D258A20"/>
Things of God, ver. 33. He deſtroyed the mighty and the holy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſtood up againſt the Prince of Princes.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Chap</hi> 8 24 25</note> He changed their Laws, took away their Religion, and placed the Abomination of Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the holy Place, ver. 31.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See a particular amount of theſe things.</hi> I <hi>Mac.</hi> I. 44—63.</note>
            </p>
            <p>SIMILAR to this has the Tyrant of England begun his Perſecutions in this Land, by his notorious Quebec Bill, by which he eſtabliſhed Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery in the extended Province of Canada; and alſo by eſtabliſhing the Popiſh Religion in England laſt Year by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE other Sort of People ſpoken of in our Text, is the Tyrant's Minions and Vaſſals; his corrupt Party. No Man ſo vile and wicked but he will have Companions, both in this World and in the World to come.—Now theſe were,</p>
            <p n="1">1. SUCH as <hi>forſook the holy Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS was the Covenant God made with his People Iſrael. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob. It alſo included the Sinai Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which was founded on the Abrahamic. In this Covenant God promiſed to be their God, and took them to be his People.<note n="†" place="bottom">

               </note> Alſo in this Covenant, he gave them Statutes, Laws and Inſtitutions for them to walk in. And he commanded them to be ſeparate from all People in the World, not to ſymbolize with them in Religion, Cuſtoms, and Manners, for they were a holy People to himſelf. But theſe wicked Perſons could not endure the Strictneſs and Severity of the divine Rules that were given them. Their Religion was too pure and holy for their unſanctified Hearts; and their blind and carnal Reaſon falſely taught them that there was no Neceſſity of it; and therefore, though they had joined in the holy Covenant Profeſſion of Religion, they ſoon forſook it. Perhaps not all at once, but by Degrees they grew worſe and worſe, till they wholly abandoned the Profeſſion as well as Practice of Religion. And how is this like Multitudes of the preſent Generation, who have forſaken the holy Covenant, and the Purity of Doctrine and Worſhip maintained by their Fathers? And from this have proceeded to more Ungodlineſs and Licentiouſneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THESE People not only forſook, but <hi>did wickedly againſt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>—They broke the Covenant, and walked in direct Oppoſition to the holy Commands and I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. THESE People were the Tyrant's Spies, that gave him Intelligence. This was one of the moſt conſummate Pieces of their helliſh Wickedneſs and Hypocriſy. Theſe Covenant-breakers, that lived among the Jews, ſecretly informed Antiochus of all that paſſed, ſo that he knew how every Thing was going on in the Camp of the Maccabees, and the Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation they were in, whereby he was able to do according to his Will in many Reſpects. Our Tories, that live among us and in the Country, are not the firſt in ſuch an infernal Plan, who privately keep up their Correſpondence with the Enemy, and give them Intelligence of every Thing that may be to their Advantage.

            <p>WICKED Tyrants, to compaſs the Rights of Mankind, to deſtroy the righteous, and put an End to all who oppoſed their ambitious and haughty Deſigns, have ever had their cajoled and corrupted Minions, whom they have employed in watching and ſpying out good and honeſt People. So Saul had his Creatures to watch David; and Doeg was one of his Informers againſt him and the Prieſts of the Lord. The Phariſees watched our Saviour, and had their Spies, the Herodians, to watch and entangle him in his Talk. And how many have there been

And, how ſhocking and ſurpriſing is it to think that ſuch Children of the infernal Regions, whoſe League is with Death and Hell, ſhould be ſupported by our own Inhabitants, to bring the Enemy upon the defenceleſs, to commit their Ravages and Depopulations on the frontier Settlements, without any juſt Provocation! My Soul, come not thou into their Secret: unto their Aſſembly, mine Honor, be not thou united.</p>
            <p>WE proceed,</p>
            <p>II. To ſhew the <hi>Heinouſneſs</hi> of the Wickedneſs of ſuch People.</p>
            <p>AND, I. Breaking and forſaking the holy Covenant, is the Sin which ſtands in the Front of all, as big with the moſt heaven-daring Inſolence and Contempt of what is ſacred, and pregnant with every other Enormity.</p>
            <p>GOD's Covenant is a holy Covenant: And where the Goſpel comes, People have it, in all the rich Grace of it, brought and freely tendered to them. Many think they are not in that Covenant except they are converted, or have made a public and ſolemn Recognition of it. Such People do but deceive themſelves. It is true indeed, that the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted have not embraced the Mercy and Grace of the Covenant, and ſo are not intereſted in the internal and ſpecial Bleſſings of it. And ſuch as have not publicly recognized the Covenant, are not under perſonal Bonds of their own, to the Church, to attend the Seals of it. But they are under the Law of the Covenant to their Maker; becauſe his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority binds them in the ſtrongeſt Manner to be to him a People. The Children of Iſrael were in the Covenant, though they did not particularly and explicitly recognize it in but few Generations: and God conſidered them as his Covenant People. So now, my Brethren, you were born under the Covenant, and have it adminiſtred to you in a preached Goſpel. And you that do not heartily embrace it, do wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly againſt it in that, and in your ſlighting the Grace and Mercy of it, and in turning your Backs upon the Seals of it. You do wickedly againſt it in all your ſinful Words and Actions, and in all your Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to God and Conformity to this World. And this is what aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates your Sin, that it is againſt all the Mercy and Grace of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Had you never known the holy Covenant, your Wickedneſs had not been to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But this our Infidels do, and this all our wicked People do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is the very Caſe of our Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, Swearers and Sabbath-breakers, with our unclean Perſons, and all our unjuſt and extortionous People. And is it not, in a glaring Light, moſt aggravatedly the Caſe with our Tories? The Tories in the Time of the Maccabees were <hi>the Tranſgreſſors</hi> who forſook the holy Covenant, and gave Intelligence to the Tyrant, being corrupted by Flatteries. Our Tories have forſaken the Covenant, and given the Antiochus of England ſecret Intelligence. They are corrupted with Flatteries, the Flatteries of an arbitrary and blood-thirſty Tyrant, with Flatteries to betray their own Country, the Lives, Liberties and Fortunes of their Neighbours, into the Hands of the hardned Pharaoh of England. And if this is not Wickedneſs, then Wickedneſs is not to be found in Earth or Hell. Wickedneſs is merely ideal, and nothing but a Whim and Chimera of vapoury Brains and dreaming Fools.</p>
            <p>BREAKING and forſaking the Covenant of the Lord God of their Fathers, was the Sin which ruined Iſrael of old, by bringing all their fearful Judgments upon them, ſo as to make them an Aſtoniſhment and an H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

How much more when Men go on to this high Degree of Wickedneſs, of betraying and ſelling their Country into the Hands of the Banditti of England, as Judas did his Maſter into the Hands of Murderers?</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE great Wickedneſs of Tyrants and their Mercenaries is, that they are guilty of Murder. And their Emiſſaries are the Cauſes of the cruelleſt of Murders.

St. Paul gives a ſad Account of the State of Nature and Sin, <hi>For we,</hi> ſays he, <hi>were ſometimes fooliſh, diſobedient, deceived, ſerving diverſe Luſts and Pleaſures, living in Malice and Envy, hateful and hating one another.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. WE may ſee the Danger of breaking Covenant and forſaking Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. All Men have broken the firſt Covenant by the Fall; but God has graciouſly been pleaſed to make a ſecond Covenant, and has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a perfect Head and Mediator of it, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous. This Covenant is propoſed and offered to ſinful Man in the Goſpel; and thoſe that forſake it, and break over the Bonds of it, are moſt juſtly leſt of God to turn Traitors and Tyrants. Covenant-breakers are Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to God. They betray his Intereſt, Honor and Glory; and ſet up againſt him to ſupport the Devil's Kingdom, which is made up of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. And the Devil is not only a Tyrant ſeeking the Deſtruction of thoſe that are in Oppoſition to him, as all good People are, but alſo to his own Subjects, who are his Slaves and Vaſſals, that he binds in his Iron Chains, and drags along to cruel Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>BUT now how ſurpriſing is it to behold People that are called Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, having been brought up under God's gracious Covenant, turn Tyrants and Traitors?—And how many Covenant-breakers are there who have not been leſt to turn Traitors againſt their Country, yet are pulling down the Judgments of God upon the Land?—God is very jealous for his holy Covenant, and has a tender regard for his own Glory, the Religion he has inſtituted and ſet up in the World. <hi>And his Power and Wrath is againſt all them that forſake him.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Ezra</hi> 8. 22.</note> What brought all the Judgments of God upon Iſrael, but their forſaking his Covenant? And when once they had done this, they threw down God's Altars, killed his Prophets, and eſtabliſhed a falſe Religion. Now although we have not killed the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt with the Sword, yet many have forſaken them, and forſaken Prayer in their Houſes, and public Worſhip,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017316_0013_103CECB8D0F38DC8"/>
denied the Baptiſm of their Children, turned their Backs on the Lord's Table, denied the Chriſtian Sabbath, the Lawfulneſs of a defenſive War, the Reſurrection of the Body, and the Day of Judgment. Some deny that there ſhould be any civil Government, and maintain that there ſhould not be any Magiſtrate or civil Law, and that no Murderer ſhould be put to Death, and that every Man ſhould do that which is right in his own Eyes. And ſome aſſert that they are perfect, and ſhall never die. And others that all Men every where and in all Ages ſhall be ſaved, that there is no Hell, or future State of Puniſhment for wicked Men, together with many other monſtrous and abſurd Notions and Opinions. Now all theſe in the firſt Place forſook the holy Covenant, and this opened the Door to every wild Imagination and Diſorder. And how can we ſuppoſe any other but that great is the Wrath of the Lord againſt this Land? Who fears? and whoſe Heart trembles for the Ask of God?</p>
            <p n="4">4. WE learn the Neceſſity of the Churches ſtrictly adhering to the holy Covenant; and for every Perſon to conſider the infinite Importance of the Covenant. This is a ſolemn Bond to God and one another, to maintain the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, and perform every civil and ſocial Duty. Take away this Bond and Obligation to our Maker, and we are at looſe Ends, and lie open to every Flatterer, to all Corruption and Iniquity; Corruption and Bribery from Tyrants, and from Satan; to be beguiled by his Wiles, and drawn away to eſpouſe his curſed Cauſe. And what will be the Iſſue? What, but the Ruin of Religion, the Ruin of our Country, yes, and the eternal Ruin of our own precious Souls?</p>
            <p>If Men are not ſenſible of Bonds to their Maker, they will not long be ſenſible of any to their fellow Creatures. All Bonds to one another are derived from our Bonds to our Creator. Leave all Covenant out with God, and all we have with Man ſoon comes to nothing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſee the Neceſſity of conſidering the Covenant in every view of it, and in all it's Extenſiveneſs and Glory, both as a Covenant of Grace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding, giving and promiſing all Grace to ſinful Men, and as a divine Conſtitution giving Law and laying Obligations on the reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to perform all Duty to God and one another</p>
            <p n="5">5. WE learn the Danger of the Love of this World. <hi>The Love of Money is the Root of all Evil.</hi>

with a Tyrant. And how will the Servants of Mammon bow and cringe, fawn and flatter for a little of the World? Yea, Men will ſell their Souls for Money. It has been ſtoried of ſome Men, that they have made a League with the Devil, and ſold their Souls to him for Money. The Story is too true with Reſpect to Worldlings; they virtually ſell their Souls, Chriſt and Heaven for the Things of this vain World, betray their Country and neareſt Friends to a Tyrant, for the empty Vanities of a Moment's <hi>Auri ſacra fames,</hi> ſaid the Heathen Poet, <hi>Curſed Love of Money.</hi>

               <p>SINCE the foregoing diſcourſe, were ſent to the preſs, ſome things remarkable have occurred, that, by the bleſſing of God, may awaken and alarm the country. Particularly the late infernal plot of the infamous <hi>Arnold</hi> for delivering up our truly worthy General, and the Army and important works at Weſt Point, into the hands of the enemy; whereby they might ſoon open a paſſage from New-York to Albany, and thence to Canada. Here was treaſon, curſed treaſon, and wickedneſs that wants a name, perhaps in hell as well as earth. And altho' heaven has, in a very won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful way, diſcovered and broke the ſnare, bleſſed be God forever and ever, yet all the miſchievous deſigns connected with the horrid plan are not ended. The late extraordinary movements and exertions of the Northern enemy. The taking, as we hear, of Fort-Ann, Fort William Henry, or Fort George and Fort Edward, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and plundering the towns and ſettlements in thoſe parts, and on Mohawk river, and killing and captivating the poor inhabitants, together with the deſolations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at Royalton, were moſt probably concerted in the aforeſaid infernal plot. Surely we cannot now heſitate a moment longer, whether it be not abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to awake and look about ourſelves, in good earneſt. We are, eſpecially on theſe long extended frontiers, and through the <hi>Grants,</hi> in jeopardy every hour. Every thing we hold dear and ſacred, is eminently expoſed to the ravages of a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant's me cenaries and ſavage cut throats!

And the ſituation of our whole country and our army is truly alarming.—My dear countrymen, what think you of theſe things?—Shall we after the moſt glorious ſtruggle for our liberties and our all, that ever the world behold, ſink down in a fatal lethargy, let the enemy take ALL, and enſlave me and our children forever? Why ſhould any call his houſes lands, money or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions his own, at ſuch a time as this?
