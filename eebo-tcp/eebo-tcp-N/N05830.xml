            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AN Hundred Years of Peace and Liberty in ſuch a World as this, is a very unuſual Thing; and yet our Country has been the happy Spot that has been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed with ſuch a long Series of Bleſſings, with little or no Interruption. Our Situation in the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies, and our Separation from the <hi>French,</hi> thoſe <hi>eternal</hi> Enemies of Liberty and <hi>Britons,</hi> on the one Side by the vaſt <hi>Atlantic,</hi> and on the other by a long Ridge of Mountains, and a wide, extended Wilderneſs, have for many Years been a Barrier to us; and while other Nations have been involved in War, we have not been alarmed with the Sound of the Trumpet, nor ſeen <hi>Garments rolled in Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now the Scene is changed: Now we begin to experience in our Turn the Fate of the Nations of the Earth. Our Territories are invaded by the Power and Perfidy of <hi>France;</hi> our Frontiers ravaged by mercileſs Savages, and our Fellow-Subjects there murdered with all the horrid Arts of <hi>Indian</hi> and Popiſh Torture.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007403_0003_102D819E8EFAA3F8"/>Our General <hi>unfortunately brave,</hi> is fallen, an Army of 1300 choice Men routed, our fine Train of Artillery taken, and all this (Oh mortifying Thought!) all this by 4 or 500 daſtardly, inſidious, Barbarians.</p>
            <p>Theſe Calamities have not come upon us without Warnings. We were long ago apprized of the ambitious Schemes of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and their Motions to carry them into Execution: And had we taken timely Meaſures, they might have been cruſhed, before they could arrive at ſuch a formidable Height. But how have we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally behaved in ſuch a critical Time; Alas! our Country has been ſunk in a deep Sleep: A ſtupid Security has unmanned the Inhabitants: They could not realize a Danger at the Diſtance of 2 or 300 Miles: They would not be perſuaded, that even <hi>French Papiſts</hi> could ſeriouſly deſign us an Injury: And hence little or nothing has been done for the Defence of our Country in Time, except by the Compulſion of Authority. And now, when the Cloud thickens over our Heads, and alarms every thoughtful Mind with its near Approach, Multitudes, I am afraid, are ſtill diſſolved in careleſs Security, or enervated with an effeminate, cowardly Spirit. When the melancholy News firſt reached us concerning the Fate of our Army, then we ſaw how natural it is for the Preſumptuous to fall into the oppoſite Extreme of unmanly Deſpondence and Conſternation; and how little Men could do in ſuch a Pannic for their own Defence. We have alſo <hi>ſuffered our poor Fellow-Subjects in the Frontier Counties to fall a helpleſs Prey to Blood-thirſty Savages, without affording them proper Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,</hi> which as Members of the ſame Body Politic, they had a Right to expect. They might as well have continued <hi>in a State of Nature,</hi> as be united <hi>in Society,</hi> if in ſuch an Article of extreme Danger, they are left to ſhift for themſelves. The bloody Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians have exerciſed on ſome of them the moſt unnatural and lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely Tortures; and others they have butchered in their Beds, or in ſome unguarded Hour. Can human Nature bear the Horror of the Sight! See yonder! the hairy Scalps, clotted with Gore! the mangled Limbs! the ript-up Women! the Heart and Bowels, ſtill palpitating with Life, ſmoking on the Ground! See the Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007403_0004_102D81A0DE3C1108"/>ſwilling their Blood, and imbibing a more outragious Fury with the inhuman Draught! Sure theſe are not <hi>Men;</hi> they are not <hi>Beaſts of Prey;</hi> they are ſomething worſe; they muſt be <hi>infernal Furies</hi> in human Shape. And have we tamely looked on, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to exerciſe theſe helliſh Barbarities upon our Fellow-Men, our Fellow-Subjects, our Brethren? Alas! with what Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror muſt we look upon ourſelves, as being little better than Acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to their Blood?</p>
            <p>And ſhall theſe Ravages go on unchecked? Shall <hi>Virginia</hi> incur the Guilt and the everlaſting Shame, of tamely exchanging her Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, her Religion, and her All, for arbitrary <hi>Gallic</hi> Power, and for Popiſh Slavery, Tyranny and Maſſacre? Alas! are there none of her Children, that enjoyed all the Bleſſings of her Peace, that will eſpouſe her Cauſe, and befriend her now in the Time of her Danger? Are <hi>Britons</hi> utterly degenerated by ſo ſhort a Remove from their Mother-Country? Is the Spirit of Patriotiſm entirely extinguiſhed among us? And muſt I give thee up for loſt, O my Country, and all that is included in that important Word? Muſt I look upon thee as a conquered, enſlaved Province of <hi>France,</hi> and the Range of <hi>Indian</hi> Savages? My Heart breaks at the Thought. And muſt ye, our unhappy Brethren in our Frontiers, muſt ye ſtand the ſingle Barriers of a ravaged Country, unaſſiſted, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended, unpitied? Alas! muſt I draw theſe ſhocking Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
            <p>No; I am agreeably checked by the happy, encouraging Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect now before me. Is it a pleaſing Dream? Or do I really ſee a Number of brave Men, without the Compulſion of Authority, without the Proſpect of Gain, voluntarily aſſociated in a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to march over horrendous Rocks and Mountains, into an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous Wilderneſs, to ſuccour their helpleſs Fellow-Subjects, and guard their Country? Yes, Gentlemen, I ſee you here upon this Deſign; and were you all united to my Heart by the moſt endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ties of Nature, or Friendſhip, I could not wiſh to ſee you engaged in a nobler Cauſe; and whatever the Fondneſs of Paſſion might carry me to, I am ſure my Judgment would never ſuffer me to perſuade you to deſert it. You all generouſly put your Lives in
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007403_0005_102D81A30287CFD8"/>your Hands; and ſundry of you have nobly diſengaged yourſelves from the ſtrong and tender Ties that twine about the Heart of <hi>a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> or <hi>a Husband,</hi> to confine you at home in inglorious Eaſe, and ſneaking Retirement from Danger, when your Country calls for your Aſſiſtance. While I have you before me, I have high Thoughts of a <hi>Virginian;</hi> and I entertain the pleaſing Hope that my Country will yet emerge out of her Diſtreſs, and flouriſh with her uſual Bleſſings. I am gratefully ſenſible of the unmerited Honour you have done me, in making Choice of me to addreſs you upon ſo ſingular and important an Occaſion: And I am ſure I bring with me a Heart ardent to ſerve you and my Country, though I am af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid my Inability, and the Hurry of my Preparations, may give you Reaſon to repent your Choice. I cannot begin my Addreſs to you with more proper Words than thoſe of a great General, which I have read to you: <hi>Be of good Courage, and play the Men, for your People, and for the Cities of your God; and the Lord do what ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My preſent Deſign is, to illuſtrate and improve the ſundry Parts of my Text, as They lie in order, which you will find rich in ſundry important Inſtructions, adapted to this Occaſion.</p>
            <p>The Words were ſpoken juſt before a very threat'ning Engagement by <hi>Joab,</hi> who had long ſerved under that pious Hero King <hi>David,</hi> as the General of his Forces, and bad ſhewn himſelf an Officer of true Courage, conducted with Prudence. The <hi>Ammonites,</hi> a neighbouring Nation, at frequent Hoſtilities with the <hi>Jews,</hi> had ungratefully offered Indignities to ſome of <hi>David's</hi> Courtiers whom he had ſent to condole their King upon the Death of his Father, and congratulate his Acceſſion to the Crown. Our holy Religion teaches us to bear <hi>perſonal</hi> Injuries without <hi>private</hi> Revenge: But <hi>national</hi> Inſults and Indignities ought to excite the <hi>public</hi> Reſentment. Accordingly King <hi>David,</hi> when he heard that the <hi>Ammoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> with their Allies, were preparing to invade his Territories, and carry their Injuries ſtill farther, ſent <hi>Joab</hi> his General, with his Army, to repel them and avenge the Affronts they had offered his Subjects. It ſeems the Army of the Enemy were much more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous than <hi>David</hi>'s: Their Mercenaries from other Nations were
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007403_0006_102D81A491BAD950"/>no leſs than 31,000 Men; and no Doubt the <hi>Ammonites</hi> themſelves were a ſtill greater Number. Theſe numerous Forces were diſpoſed in the moſt advantagious Manner, and ſurrounded <hi>Joab</hi>'s Men, that they might attack them both in Flank and Front at once, and cut them all off, leaving no Way for them to eſcape. Prudence is of the utmoſt Importance in the Conduct of an Army: And <hi>Joab,</hi> in this critical Situation, gives a Proof how much he was Maſter of it, and diſcovers the ſteady Compoſure of his Mind, while thus ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Danger. He divides his Army, and gives one Party to his Brother <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> who commanded next to him, and the other he kept the Command of himſelf, and reſolves to attack the <hi>Syrian</hi> Mercenaries, who ſeemed the moſt formidable; he gives Orders to his Brother in the mean Time to Fall upon the <hi>Ammonites;</hi> and he animates him with this noble Advice: <hi>Be of good Courage, and let us play the Men for our People and the Cities of our God,</hi> which are now at Stake: <hi>And the Lord do what ſeemeth him Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be of good Courage, and let us play the Men:</hi>—Courage is an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Character of a good Soldier:—Not a ſavage ferocious Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:—Not a fool-hardy Inſenſibility of Danger, or headſtrong Raſhneſs to ruſh into it:—Not the Fury of enflamed Paſſions, broke looſe from the Government of Reaſon: But calm, delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, rational Courage; a ſteady, judicious, thoughtful Fortitude; the Courage of a Man, and not of a Tyger: Such a Temper as <hi>Addiſon</hi> aſcribes with ſo much Juſtice to the famous <hi>Malborough</hi> and <hi>Eugene:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Whoſe Courage dwelt not in a troubled Flood</l>
                  <l>Of mounting Spirits, and fermenting Blood;—But</l>
                  <l>Lodg'd in the Soul, with Virtue over-rul'd,</l>
                  <l>Inflam'd by Reaſon, and by Reaſon cool'd <note n="*" place="bottom">The Campaign.</note>.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is true Courage, and ſuch as we ought all to cheriſh in the preſent dangerous Conjuncture. This will render Men vigilant and cautious againſt Surprizes, prudent and deliberate in concerting their Meaſures, and ſteady and reſolute in executing them. But
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007403_0007_102D81A6E3738408"/>without this they will fall into unſuſpected Dangers, which will ſtrike them with wild Conſternation: They will meanly ſhun Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that are ſurmountable, or precipitantly ruſh into thoſe that are cauſeleſs, or evidently fatal, and throw away their Lives in vain.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Men who <hi>naturally</hi> have this heroic Turn of Mind. The wiſe Creator has adapted the natural Genius of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, with a ſurprizing and beautiful Variety to the State in which they are placed in this World. To ſome he has given a Turn for intellectual Improvement, and the liberal Arts and Sciences; to others a Genius for Trade; to others a Dexterity in Mechanics, and the ruder Arts, neceſſary for the Support of human Life: The Generality of Mankind may be capable of tolerable Improvements in any of theſe: But it is only they whom the God of Nature has formed for them, that will ſhine in them, every Man in his own Province. And as God well knew what a World of degenerate, ambitious, and revengeful Creatures this is; as he knew that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence could not be protected, Property and Liberty ſecured, nor the Lives of Mankind preſerved from the lawleſs Hands of Ambition, Avarice and Tyranny, without the Uſe of the Sword; as he knew this would be the only Method to preſerve Mankind from univerſal Slavery; he has formed ſome Men for this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Work, and fired them with a martial Spirit, and a glorious Love of Danger. Such a Spirit, though moſt pernicious when ungoverned by the Rules of Juſtice, and Benevolence to Mankind, is a public Bleſſing, when rightly directed: Such a Spirit, under God, has often mortified the Inſolence of Tyrants, checked the Incroachments of arbitrary Power, and delivered enſlaved and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined Nations: It is as neceſſary in its Place, for our Subſiſtence in ſuch a World as this, as any of the gentler Genius's among Mankind; and it is derived from the ſame divine Original.

The moſt important Periods of our Exiſtence, my Brethren, lie Beyond the Grave; and it is a Matter of much more Concern to us, what will be our Doom in the World to come, than what becomes of us in this. We are obliged to defend our Country; and that is a ſneaking, ſordid Soul indeed that can deſert it at ſuch a Time as this: But this is not all; we are alſo obliged to take Care of an immortal Soul; a Soul that muſt exiſt, and be happy or miſerable, through the Revolutions of eternal Ages. This ſhould be our firſt Care: and when this is ſecured, Death, in its moſt Shocking Forms, is but a Releaſe from a World of Sin a Sorrows, and an Introduction into everlaſting Life and Glory. But how can this be ſecured? not by a Courſe of impenitent Sinning; not by a Courſe of ſtupid Careleſneſs and Inaction: But by vigorous and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſtriving; by ſerious and affectionate Thoughtfulneſs about our Condition, and by a conſcientious and earneſt Attendance upon the Means that God has graciouſly appointed for our Recovery. But <q>we are Sinners, heinous Sinners againſt a God of infinite Purity and inexorable Juſtice. Yes, we are ſo; and does not the Poſture of Penitents then become us? Is not Repentance, deep, broken-hearted Repentance,</q> a Duty ſuitable to Perſons of our Character? Undoubtedly it is: And therefore, O my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and particularly you brave Men that are the Occaſion of this Meeting, REPENT: Down upon your Knees before the provoked Sovereign of Heaven and Earth, againſt whom you have rebelled. Diſſolve and melt in penitential Sorrows at his Feet; and he will tell you <hi>Ariſe, be of good Chear; your Sins are forgiven you.</hi>

This I earneſtly recommend to all my Hearers, and eſpecially to you Gentlemen, and others, that are not about generouſly to riſque your Lives for your Country. Account this the beſt Preparative to encounter Danger and Death; the beſt Incentive to true, rational Courage. What can do you a laſting Injury, while you have a reconciled God ſmiling upon you from on high, a peaceful Conſcience animating you within, and a happy Immortality juſt before you! Sure you may bid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to Dangers and Death in their moſt ſhocking Forms. You have anſwered the End of this Life already by preparing for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and how can you depart off this mortal Stage more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, than in the Cauſe of Liberty, of Religion, and your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? But if any of you are perplexed with gloomy Fears about
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007403_0011_102D81B1006522A0"/>this important Affair, or conſcious you are entirely unprepared for Eternity, what muſt you do? Muſt you ſeek to prolong your Life, and your Time for Preparation, by mean or unlawful Ways, by a cowardly Deſertion of the Cauſe of your Country, and ſhifting for your little Selves, as though you had no Connection with So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety? Alas! this would but aggravate your Guilt, and render your Condition ſtill more perplexed and diſcouraging. FOLLOW THE PATH OF DUTY wherever it leads you, for it will be always the ſafeſt in the Iſſue. Diligently improve the Time you have to <hi>make your Calling and Election ſure,</hi> and you have Reaſon to hope for Mercy, and <hi>Grace to help in</hi> ſuch a <hi>Time of Need.</hi>—You will forgive me, if I have enlarged upon this Point, even to a Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for I thought it of great Conſequence to you all. I ſhall now proceed with more Haſte.</p>
            <p>It is alſo of great Importance to excite and keep up our Courage in ſuch an Expedition, that we ſhould be full ſatisfied we engage in a <hi>righteous</hi> Cauſe,—and in a Cauſe of <hi>great Moment;</hi> for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proſecute a ſuſpected or a wicked Scheme, which our own Minds condemn, but with Heſitation and timorous Apprehenſions; and we cannot engage with Spirit and Reſolution in a trifling Scheme, from which we can expect no Conſequences worth our vigorous Purſuit. This <hi>Joab</hi> might have in View in his heroic Advice to his Brother; <hi>Be of good Courage,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and let us play the Men, for our People, and for the Cities of our God.</hi> q. d. <hi>We are engaged in a</hi> righteous <hi>Cauſe; we are not urged on by an unbounded Luſt of Power or Riches, to encroach upon the Rights and Properties of others, and diſturb our quiet Neighbours: We act entirely upon the defenſive, repel unjuſt Violence, and avenge national Injuries; we are fighting</hi> for our People, and for the Cities of our God. <hi>We are alſo engaged in a Cauſe of the utmoſt</hi> Importance. <hi>We fight for</hi> our People; <hi>and what Endearments are included in that ſignificant Word! Our Liberty, our Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, our Lives! our King, our Fellow-Subjects, our venerable Fathers, our tender Children, the Wives of our Boſom, our Friends, the Sharers of our Souls, our Poſterity to the lateſt Ages! And who would not uſe his Sword with an exerted Arm, when theſe lie at State? But even theſe are not all: We fight</hi> for the Cities of our God. <hi>God has diſtinguiſhed us
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007403_0012_102D81B28F537640"/>with a Religion from Heaven; and hitherto we have enjoyed the quiet and unreſtrained Exerciſe of it: He has condeſcended to become a</hi> gentilitial God <hi>to our Nation; and honor'd our Cities with his gracious Preſence, and the Inſtitutions of his Worſhip, the Means of making us wiſe, good and happy: But now theſe moſt invaluable Bleſſings lie at Stake; theſe are the Prize for which we contend; and muſt it not excite all our active Powers to the higheſt Pitch of Exertion? Shall we tamely ſubmit to Idolatry and religious Tyranny? No, God forbid:</hi> Let us play the Men, <hi>ſince we take up Arms for our People, and the Cities of our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not tell you how applicable this Advice, thus paraphraſed, is to the Deſign of the preſent aſſociated Company. The Equity of our Cauſe is moſt evident. The <hi>Indian</hi> Savages have certainly no Right to murder our Fellow-ſubjects, living quiet and inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in their Habitations; nor have the <hi>French</hi> any Power to hound them out upon us, nor to invade the Territories belonging to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Crown, and ſecured to it by the Faith of Treaties. This is a clear Caſe. And it is equally clear, that you are engaged in a Cauſe of the utmoſt Importance. To protect your Brethren from the moſt bloody Barbarities—to defend the Territories of the beſt of Kings againſt the Oppreſſion and Tyranny of arbitrary Power, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the ineſtimable Bleſſings of Liberty, <hi>Britiſh Liberty,</hi> from the Chains of <hi>French</hi> Slavery—to preſerve your Eſtates, for which you have ſweat and toiled, from falling a Prey to greedy Vultures, <hi>Indians,</hi> Prieſts, Friers, and hungry <hi>Gallic</hi> Slaves, or not-more-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Flames—to guard your Religion, the pure <hi>Religion of Jeſus,</hi> ſtreaming uncorrupted from the ſacred Fountain of the Scriptures; the moſt excellent, rational and divine Religion that ever was made known to the Sons of Men; to guard ſuch a dear precious Religion (my Heart grows warm while I mention it) againſt Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, Superſtition, Idolatry, Tyranny over Conſcience, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre, Fire and Sword, and all the Miſchiefs, beyond Expreſſion, with which Popery is pregnant—to keep from the cruel Hands of Barbarians and Papiſts, your Wives, your Children, your Parents, your Friends—to ſecure the Liberties conveyed to you by your brave Fore-Fathers, and bought with their Blood, that you may tranſmit them uncurtailed to your Poſterity—theſe are the Bleſſings

I count myſelf happy that I ſee ſo many of yo engaged in ſuch a Cauſe; but when I view it in this Light, I cannot but be concerned that there are ſo few to join you. Are there but 50 or 60 Perſons in this large and populous County that can be ſpared from home for a few Weeks upon ſo neceſſary a Deſign, or that are able to bear the Fatigues of it? Where are the Friends of human Nature, where the Lovers of Liberty and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? Now is the Time for you to come forth, and ſhew your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

Ariſe, and march away; you had better be abſent from thoſe you love for a little while, than ſee them butchered before your Eyes, or doomed to eternal Poverty and Slavery. The Aſſociation now ſorming is not yet compleat; and if it were, it would be a glorious Thing to form another. Therefore, as an Advocate for your King, your Fellow-Subjects, your Country, Your Relatives, Your earthly All, I do invite and intreat all of you, who have not ſome very ſufficient Reaſon againſt it, voluntarily to enliſt, and go out with thoſe brave Souls, who
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007403_0014_102D81B72FF71D20"/>have ſet you ſo noble an Example. It will be more advantageous to go out in Time, and more honourable to go out as Volunteers, than to be compelled to it by Authority, when perhaps it may be too late.</p>
            <p>The Conſideration of the Juſtice and Importance of the Cauſe may alſo encourage You to hope, that the Lord of Hoſts will eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe it, and render its Guardians ſucceſsful, and return them in Safety to the Arms of their longing Friends. The Event howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is in his Hands; and it is much better there, than if it were in Yours.

Let us do all we can; but after all, the Iſſue is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; we know not, as yet, to what Side God will incline the Victory.</hi> Such Language as this, my Brethren becomes us in all our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings; it ſounds <hi>Creature-like,</hi> and God approves of ſuch ſelf-dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Humility. But to indulge ſanguine and confident Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Victory, to <hi>boaſt</hi> when we <hi>put on our Armour,</hi> as though we were <hi>putting it off,</hi> and to derive our high Hopes from our own Power and good Management, without any Regard to the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, this is too lordly and aſſuming for ſuch feeble Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; ſuch Inſolence is generally mortified, and ſuch a haughty Spirit, is the Fore-runner of a Fall. Therefore, though I do not apprehend Your Lives will be in any great Danger in Your preſent Expedition to range the Frontiers, and clear them of the ſkulking <hi>Indians;</hi> yet, I would not flatter You, my Brethren, with too high Hopes either of Victory or Safety. I cannot but entertain the pleaſing Proſpect of congratulating You will may of Your Friends, upon Your ſucceſsful Expedition, and ſafe Return: And yet it is very poſſible our next Interview may be in that ſtrange untried World beyond the Grave. You are, however, in the Hands of God, and he will deal with you as it <hi>ſeemeth him good:</hi> And I am perſuaded You would not wiſh it were otherwiſe; You would not now practically retract the Petition You have ſo often offered up, <hi>Thy Will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven.</hi>

2. This Language; <hi>The Lord do as ſeemeth him good,</hi> may be looked upon as expreſſive of a firm Perſuaſion that the Event of War entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depends upon the Providence of God. <hi>q. d.</hi> Let <hi>us</hi> do our beſt; but after all, let us be ſenſible that the Succeſs does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on <hi>us; that</hi> is entirely in the Hands of an <hi>all-ruling God.</hi> That God governs the World, is a fundamental Article of natural, as well as revealed Religion: It is no great Exploit of Faith, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this: It is but a ſmall Advance beyond Atheiſm, and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Infidelity. I know no Country upon Earth, where I ſhould be put to the Expence of Argument to prove this. The Heathens gave ſtriking Proofs of their Belief of it, by their Prayers, their Sacrifices, their conſulting Oracles, before they engaged in War; and by their coſtly Offerings and ſolemn Thankſgivings, after Victory. And ſhall ſuch a plain Principle as this, be diſputed in a Chriſtian Land? No; we all ſpeculatively believe it; but that is not enough; let our Spirits be deeply <hi>impreſſed</hi> with it, and our Lives <hi>influenced</hi> by it; Let us live in the World, as in a Territory of Jehovah's Empire. Carry this Impreſſion upon Your Hearts into the Wilderneſs, whither You are going. Often let ſuch Thoughts as theſe recur to your Minds, <hi>I am the feeble Creature of God; and bleſſed be his Name, I am not caſt off his Hand as a diſregarded Orphan to ſhift for myſelf. My Life is under his Care; the Succeſs of this Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is at his Diſpoſals Therefore, O thou all-ruling God, I implore thy Protection; I confide in this Care; I chearfully reſign myſelf, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of this Undertaking, to thee.</hi> Which leads me to obſerve,</item>

We are ſure he will do what is beſt, upon the whole; and it becomes us to acquieſce!</hi> Thus, my Friends, do You reſign and ſubmit your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Rules of the World in the preſent Enterprize. He <hi>will</hi> order Matters as he pleaſes; Oh! let him do ſo by Your chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conſent.

We cannot command Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; but let us do all in our Power to obtain it, and we have Reaſon to hope that in this Way we ſhall not be diſappointed: But if it ſhould pleaſe God to render all our Endeavours vain, ſtill we ſhall have the generous Pleaſure to reflects, that we have not been acceſſary to the Ruin of our Country, but have done all we could for its Deliverance.</hi> So You my Brethren have generouſly engaged in a diſintereſted Scheme for Your King and Country: God does generally crown ſuch noble Undertakings with Succeſs, and You have Encouragement to hope for it: But the Cauſe You have eſpouſed, is the Cauſe of a ſinful impenitent Country; and if God, in righteous Diſpleaſure, ſhould on this Account blaſt your Attempt, ſtill you will have the Pleaſure of reflecting upon Your generous Views and vigorous Endeavours, and that You have done Your Part conſcientiouſly.</item>

If You believe that God governs the World, if You do not abjure him from being the Ruler of Your Country, You muſt acknowledge that all the Calamities of War, and the threatening Appearances of Famine, are ordered by his Providence; <hi>There is no Evil in a City or Country, but the Lord hath done it.</hi> And if You believe that he is a juſt and Righteous Ruler, You muſt alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he would not thus puniſh a righteous or a penitent Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. We and our Countrymen are Sinners, aggravated Sinners: God proclaims that we are ſuch by his Judgments now upon us, by withering Fields and ſcanty Harveſts, by the Sound of the Trumpet and the Alarm of War. Our Conſciences muſt alſo bear witneſs to the ſame melancholy Truth. And if my Heart were properly affected, I would concur with theſe undoubted Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: I would cry aloud, and not ſpare, I would lift up my Voice like a Trumpet, to ſhew You Your Tranſgreſſions and Your Sins. O my Country, is <hi>not thy Wickedneſs great, and thine Iniquities infinite?</hi> Where is there a more ſinful Spot to be found upon our guilty Globe? Paſs over the Land, take a Survey of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, inſpect into their Conduct, and what do you ſee? what do you hear? You ſee gigantic Forms of Vice braving the Skies, and bidding Defiance to Heaven and Earth, while Religion and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is obliged to retire, to avoid public Contempt and Inſult— You ſee Herds of Drunkards ſwilling down their Cups, and drowning all <hi>the Man</hi> within them. You hear the Swearer vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Fury againſt God and Man, trifling with than Name which proſtrate Angels adore, and imprecating that Damnation, under which the hardieſt Devil in Hell trembles and groans. You ſee Avarice hoarding up her uſeleſs Treaſures, diſhoneſt Craft planning her Schemes of unlawful Gain, and Oppreſſion unmercifully grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Face of the Poor. You ſee Prodigality ſquandering her Stores, Luxury ſpreading her Table, and unmanning her Gueſts; Vanity laughing aloud, and diſſolving in empty, unthinking
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007403_0018_102D81BF0046C530"/>Mirth, regardleſs of God and our Country, of Time and Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Senſuality wallowing in brutal Pleaſures, and aſpiring with inverted Ambition, to ſink as low as her four-footed Brethren of the Stall. You ſee Cards more in Uſe than the Bible, the Back-Gammon Table more frequented than the Table of the Lord, Plays and Romances more read than the Hiſtory of the bleſſed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. You ſee trifling and even Criminal Diverſions become a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Buſineſs; the Iſſue of a Horſe-race, or a Cock-fight, more anxioſly attended to than the Fate of our Country. Or where theſe groſſer Forms of Vice and Vanity do not ſhock your Senſes, even there you often meet with the Appearances of more refined Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, which is equally dangerous. You hear the Converſation of reaſonable Creatures, of Candidates for Eternity, engroſſed by Trifles, or vainly waſted on the Affairs of Time: Theſe are the eternal Subjects of Converſation, even at the Threſhold of the Houſe of God, and on the ſacred Hours devoted to his Service. You ſee Swarms of Prayer-leſs Families all over our Land: Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, vicious Children, unreſtrained and untaught by thoſe to whom God and Nature hath entruſted their Souls. You ſee Thouſands of poor Slaves in a Chriſtian Country, the Property of Chriſtian Maſters, and they will be called, almoſt as ignorant of Chriſtianity, as when they left the Wilds of <hi>Africa.</hi> You ſee the beſt Religion in all the World, abuſed, neglected, diſobeyed and diſhonoured by its Profeſſors: And you hear Infidelity ſcattering her ambiguous Hints and Suſpicious, or openly attacking the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Cauſe with pretended Argument, with Inſult and Ridicule. You ſee Crowds of profeſſed Believers, that are practical Athieſts; nominal Chriſtians, that are real Heathens; many abandoned Slaves of Sin, that yet pretend to be the Servants of the Holy Jeſus. You ſee the Ordinances of the Goſpel neglected by ſome, profaned by others, and attended upon by the Generality with a trifling Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverence, and ſtupid Unconcernedneſs Alas! who would think that thoſe thoughtleſs Aſſemblies we often ſee in our Places of Worship, are met for ſuch ſolemn Purpoſes as to implore the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007403_0019_102D81C167628CD0"/>of their Sins from an injured God, and to prepare for an awful all-important Eternity? Alas! is that Religion for the Propagation of which the Son of God laboured, and bled, and died, for which his Apoſtles and Thouſands of Martyrs have ſpent their Strength and ſhed their Blood, and on which our eternal Life depends, is that Religion become ſuch a Trifle in our Days, that Men are hardly ſerious and in earneſt when they attend upon its moſt ſolemn Inſtitutions? What Multitudes lie in a dead Sleep in Sin all around us? You ſee them eager in the Purſuit of the Vanities of Time, but ſtupidly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned about the important Realities of the eternal World juſt before them: Few ſolicitous what ſhall become of them when all their Connections with Earth and Fleſh muſt be broken, and they muſt take their Flight into ſtrange unknown Regions: Few lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Sins: Few crying for Mercy and a new Heart: Few flying to Jeſus, or juſtly ſenſible of the Importance of a Mediator in a Religion for Sinners. You may indeed ſee ſome Degree of Civility and Benevolence towards Men, and more than enough of cringing Complaiſance of Worms to Worms, of Clay to Clay, of Guilt to Guilt: But Oh! how little ſincere Homage, how little affectionate Veneration for the great Lord of Heaven and Earth! You may ſee ſomething of Duty to Parents, of Gratitude to Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, and Obedience to Superiors: But if God <hi>be a Father, where is his Honour? If he be a Maſter, where is his Fear?</hi> If he be our Benefactor, where is our Gratitude to him? You may ſee here and there ſome Inſtances of proud, ſelf-righteous Virtue, ſome Appearances of Morality: But Oh! how rare is vital evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Religion, and true Chriſtian Morality, animated with the Love of God, proceeding from a new Heart, and a Regard to the divine Authority, full of Jeſus, full of a Regard to him as a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, on whoſe Account alone our Duties can find Acceptance? O bleſſed Redeemer! what little Neceſſity, what little Uſe do the Sinners of our Country find for thee in their Religion? How many Diſcourſes, how many Prayers, how many good Works are performed, in which there is <hi>ſcarce any Thing of Chriſt?</hi> And this Defect renders them all but <hi>ſhining Sins,</hi> glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007403_0020_102D81C3267202B0"/>Crimes. How few pant and languiſh for thee, Bleſſed Jeſus! and can never be contented with their Reformation, with their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, with their good Works, till they obtain an Intereſt in thy Righteouſneſs, to ſanctify all, to render all acceptable !—You may ſee Children ſenſible of their Dependance on their Parents for their Subſiſtence, you ſee Multitudes ſenſible of their Dependance on Clouds and Sun and Earth for Proviſion for Man and Beaſt: But how few ſenſible of their Dependance upon God, as the great Original, the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> of natural Cauſes, and the various Wheels of the Univerſe. You ſee even the dull <hi>Ox knows his Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and the ſtupid <hi>Aſs his Maſter's Crib:</hi> You ſee the Workings of Gratitude even in your Dog, who welcomes you home with a Thouſand fondling Motions: But how is Jehovah's Government and Agency practically denied in his own Territories! How few receive the Bleſſings of Life as from his Hand, and make him proper Returns of Gratitude? You ſee a withering, ravaged Country around you, languiſhing under the Frowns of an angry God; but how few earneſt Prayers, how few penitential Groans do you hear? Paſs rover the Land, and bring me Intelligence, is not this the <hi>general</hi> Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Country? I know there are ſome happy Exceptions; and I hope ſundry ſuch might be produce from among you: But is not this the prevailing Character of a great Majority? Does not one Part or other of it belong to the Generality? The moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Charity cannot hope the Contrary, if under any ſcriptural or rational Limitations. May it not be ſaid of the Men of <hi>Virginia,</hi> as well as thoſe of <hi>Sodom, They are wicked, and Sinners before the Lord exceedingly?</hi> And thus, alas! it has been for a long Time: Our Country has ſinned on ſecurely for above 150 Years, and one Age has improved upon the Vices of another. And can a Land always bear up under ſuch a Load of accumulated Wickedneſs? Can God always ſuffer ſuch a Race of Sinners to go on unpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Generation to Generation? May we not fear that our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are now juſt full, and that he is about to thunder out his aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Mandate to the Executioners of his Vengeance, <hi>Put ye in the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007403_0021_102D81C50AE84C20"/>Sickle; for the Harveſt is ripe; come get ye down, for the Preſs is full, the Vats overflow; for their Wickedneſs is great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is there no Relief for a ſinking Country? Or is it too late to adminiſter it? Is our Wound incurable, that refuſeth to be headed? No, bleſſed be God; if you now turn every one of you from your Evil Ways, if you mourn over your Sins, and turn to the Lord with your whole Hearts, then your Country will yet recover. God will appear for us, and give a proſperous Turn to our Affairs; he has aſſured us of this in his own Word, <hi>At what Inſtant,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy it; if that Nation, againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their Evil, I will repent of the Evil that I thought to do unto them,</hi> Jer. xviii. 7, 8. Therefore, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as we have all rebelled, let us all join in unanimous Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and a through Reformation. Not only your eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation requires it, but alſo the Preſervation of your Country, that is now bleeding with the Wounds you have given it by your Sins. The Safety of theſe our Friends, who are now engaged in ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous a Deſign, requires it: For an Army of Saints or of Heroes, cannot defend a guilty, impenitent People, ripe for the Judgments of God. If you would be everlaſtingly happy, and eſcape the Vengeance of eternal Fire, or (to mention what may perhaps have more Weight with ſome of you) if you would preſerve your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, your Families, you Poſterity, from Poverty, from Slavery, Ignorance Idolatry, Torture and Death; if you would ſave yourſelves and them from all the infernal Horrors of Popery, and the ſavage Tyranny of a mongrel Race of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors; in ſhort, if you would avoid all that is terrible, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy every Thing that is dear and valuable, REPENT, and turn to the Lord. This is the only Cure for our wounded Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and if you refuſe to adminiſter it in Time, prepare to periſh in its Ruins. If you go on impenitent in Sin, you may expect not only to be damned for ever, but (what is more terrible to ſome of you) to fall into the moſt extreme outward Diſtreſs. You will have
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007403_0022_102D81C6F1AFECC8"/>Reaſon to fear not only the Loſs of Heaven, which ſome of you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps think little of, but the Loſs of your Eſtates, that lie ſo near your Hearts. And will you not repent, when you are preſſed to it from ſo many Quarters at once?</p>
            <p>And now, My Brethren, in the laſt Place, I have a ſew parting Words to offer to you who are more particularly concerned in this Occaſion; and I am ſure I ſhall addreſs you with as much affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Benevolence as you could wiſh.</p>
            <p>My firſt and leading Advice to you is, Labour to conduct this Expedition in a Religious Manner. Methinks this ſhould not ſeem ſtrange Counſel to Creatures, entirely dependent upon God, and at his Diſpoſal. As you are an Independent Company of Volunteers under Officers of your own chuſing, you may manage your Affairs more according to your own Inclinations, than if you had enliſted upon the ordinary Footing: And I hope you will improve this Advantage for the Purpoſes of Religion. Let Prayer to the God of your Life be your daily Exerciſe. When Retirement is ſafe, pour out your Hearts to him in ſecret; and when it is practicable, join in Prayer together Morning and Evening in your Camp. How acceptable to Heaven muſt ſuch an <hi>unuſual Offering be,</hi> from that deſart Wilderneſs! Maintain a Senſe of divine Providence upon your Hearts, and reſign your ſelves and all your Affairs into the Hands of God. You are engaged in a good Cauſe, the Cauſe of your People, and the Cities of your God; and therefore you may the more boldly commit it to him, and pray and hope for his Bleſſing. I would fain hope, there is no Neceſſity to take Precautions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Vice among ſuch a ſelect Company: But leſt there ſhould, I would humbly recommend to you to make this one of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of your Aſſociation, before you ſet out, that every Form of Vice ſhall be ſeverely diſcountenanced, and if you think proper, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Offender to ſome pecuniary or corporal Puniſhment. It would be ſhocking indeed, and I cannot bear the Tho't, that a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany formed upon ſuch generous Principles, ſhould commit or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007403_0023_102D81C90A7A6B38"/>open Wickedneſs among them; and I hope this Caution is needleſs to you all, as I am ſure it is to ſundry of you.</p>
            <p>And now, my dear Friends, and the Friends of you neglected Country, <hi>In the Name of the Lord lift up your Banners: Be of good Courage, and play the Men for the People and the Cities of your God; and the Lord do what ſeemeth him god.</hi> Should I now give Vent to the Paſſions of my Heart, and become a Speaker for my Country, methinks I ſhould even overwhelm you with a Torrent of good Wiſhes, and Prayers from the Hearts of Thouſands. May the Lord of Hoſts, the God of the Armies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> go forth along with you! <hi>May he teach your Hands to War, and gird you with Strength to Battle!</hi> May he bleſs you with a ſaſe Return, and long Life, or a glorious Death in the Bed of Honour, and a happy Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality! May he guard and ſupport your anxious Families and Friends at home, and return you victorious to their longing Arms! May all the Bleſſings your Hearts can wiſh attend you wherever you go! Theſe are the Wiſhes and Prayers of my Heart; and Thouſands concur in them: And we cannot but cheerfully hope they will be granted, through Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Amen.</hi>
