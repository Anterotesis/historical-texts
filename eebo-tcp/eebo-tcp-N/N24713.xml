            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

—Not ſo, ſaid ſir Philip; it is now almoſt dark.—'Tis no matter, ſaid John, I can go it blindfold. Sir Philip then gave him a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the Baron in his own name, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him that he would pay his reſpects to him in the morning. John flew back the ſecond time, and ſoon returned with new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations from the Baron, and that he would expect him on the morrow. Sir Philip gave him an angel of gold, and praiſed his ſpeed and abilities.</p>
            <p>He ſupped with Wyatt and his family upon new-laid eggs and raſhers of bacon, with the higheſt reliſh. They praiſed the Creator for his gifts, and acknowledged they were unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the leaſt of his bleſſings. They gave the beſt of their two lofts up to Sir Philip, the reſt of the family ſlept in the other, the old woman and her daughter in the bed, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his two ſons upon clean ſtraw.

            <p>During his ſleep, many ſtrange and incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent dreams aroſe to his imagination. He thought he received a meſſage from his friend Lord Lovel, to come to him at the Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

The Baron agreed with him in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that a man was of much more ſervice to the world who continued in it, than one who retired from it, and gave his fortune for the church, whoſe ſervants did not always make the beſt uſe of it.

has many demands upon your generoſity: I can provide for this promiſing youth without doing injuſtice to any one; will you give him to me?—He is a fortunate boy, ſaid the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, to gain your favour ſo ſoon.—My lord, ſaid the knight, I will confeſs to you, that the firſt thing that touched my heart in his favour, is a ſtrong reſemblance he bears to a certain dear friend I once had, and his manner reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles him as much as his perſon; his qualities deſerve that he ſhould be placed in a higher rank; I will adopt him for my ſon, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce him into the world as my relation, if you will reſign him to me: What ſay you?—Sir, ſaid the Baron, you have made a noble offer, and I am too much the young man's friend to be a hindrance to his preferment. It is true, that I intended to provide for him in my own family; but I cannot do it ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as by giving him to you, whoſe generous affection being unlimited by other ties, may in time prefer him to a higher ſtation, as he ſhall deſerve it. I have only one condition to make; that the lad ſhall have his option; for I would not oblige him to leave my ſervice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his inclination.—You ſay well, replied ſir Philip; nor would I take him upon other t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> for Edmund hither. A ſervant was ſent to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> beſpoke him:—Edmund, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> obligations to this gentleman, who, perceiving in you a certain reſemblance to a
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032742_0020_0FF4D42BD5639600"/>
friend of his, and liking your behaviour, has taken a great affection for you, inſomuch that he deſires to receive you into his family: I cannot better provide for you than by diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of you to him; and, if you have no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, you ſhall return home with him when he goes from hence. The countenance of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund underwent many alterations during this propoſal of his lord; it expreſſed tenderneſs, gratitude, and ſorrow, but the laſt was predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant; he bowed reſpectfully to the Baron and Sir Philip, and after ſome heſitation ſpoke as follows:—I feel very ſtrongly the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I owe to this gentleman, for his noble and generous offer; I cannot expreſs the ſenſe I have of his goodneſs to me, a peaſant boy, only known to him by my lord's kind and partial mention; this uncommon bounty claims my eternal gratitude. To you, my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured lord, I owe every thing, even this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's good opinion: you diſtinguiſhed me when nobody elſe did: and, next to you, your ſons are my beſt and deareſt benefactors, they introduced me to your notice. My heart is unalterably attached to this houſe and family, and my utmoſt ambition is to ſpend my life in your ſervice: But if you have perceived any great and grievous faults in me, that makes you wiſh to put me out of your family, and if you have recommended me to this gentleman in order to be rid of me, in that caſe I will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to your pleaſure, as I would if you ſhould ſentence me to death.</p>

               </gap>ut if you prefer my ſervice to his, I will not part with you. Upon this Edmund kneeled to the Baron; he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced his knees—My dear lord! I am and will be your ſervant, in preference to any man living; I only aſk permiſſion to live and die in your ſervice.—You ſee, Sir Philip, ſaid the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, how the boy engages the heart; how can I part with him?—I cannot aſk you any more anſwered Sir Philip, I ſee it is impoſſible, but I eſteem you both ſtill higher than ever: the youth for his gratitude, and your Lordſhip for your noble mind and true generoſity: bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings attend you both!—Oh, ſir, ſaid Edmund, preſſing the hand of Sir Philip, do not think me ungrateful to you, I will ever remember your goodneſs, and pray to heaven to reward it; the name of Sir Philip Harclay ſhall be engraven upon my heart, next to my lord and his family, for ever, Sir Philip raiſed the youth and embraced him, ſaying,—If ever you want a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

deſerve it. Edmund bowed low, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, with his eyes full of tears of ſenſibility and gratitude. When he was gone, Sir Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip ſaid, I am thinking, that although young Edmund wants not my aſſiſtance at preſent, he may hereafter ſtand in need of my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. I would not wonder if ſuch rare quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as he poſſeſſes, ſhould one day create envy and raiſe him enemies; in which caſe he might come to loſe your favour, without any fault of yours or his own.—I am obliged to you for the warning, ſaid the Baron, I hope it will be unneceſſary; but if ever I part with Edmund you ſhall have the refuſal of him. I thank your lordſhip for all your civilities to me, ſaid the knight; I leave my beſt wiſhes with you and your hopeful family, and I humbly take my leave.—Will you not ſtay one night in the caſtle? returned my lord; you ſhall be as welcome a gueſt as ever.—I acknowledge your goodneſs and hoſpitality, but this houſe fills me with melancholy recollections; I came hither with a heavy heart, and it will not be lighter while I remain here. I ſhall always remember your lordſhip with the higheſt reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and eſteem; and I pray God to preſerve you and increaſe your bleſſings!</p>

               </gap> to Wyatt's cottage, he found <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> aſſembled together. He told them
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032742_0023_0FF50A059249A400"/>
he would take another night's lodging there, which they heard with great pleaſure: for he had familiariſed himſelf to them in the laſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening's converſation, inſomuch that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to enjoy his company. He told Wyatt of the misfortune he had ſuſtained by looſing his ſervant on the way, and wiſhed he could get one to attend him home in his place. Young John looked earneſtly at his father, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned a look of approbation. I perceive one in the company, ſaid he, that would be proud to ſerve your honour; but I fear he is not brought up well enough. John colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with impatience, he could not forbear ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—Sir, I can anſwer for an honeſt heart, a willing mind, and a light pair of heels; and though I am ſomewhat aukward, I ſhall be proud to learn to pleaſe my noble maſter, if he will but try me—You ſay well, ſaid Sir Philip, I have obſerved your qualifications, and if you are deſirous to ſerve me, I am equally pleaſed with you; if your father has no objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I will take you.—Objection, Sir! ſaid the Old man; it will be my pride to prefer him to ſuch a noble gentleman; I will make no terms for him, but leave it to your honour to do for him as he ſhall deſerve.—Very well, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aid Sir Philip, you ſhall be no loſer by that; I will charge myſelf with the care of the young man. The bargain was ſtruck, and Sir Philip purchaſed a horſe for John, of the Old man. The next morning they ſet out; the Knight left marks of his bounty with the good couple,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032742_0024_0FF50A11FB0102D0"/>
and departed, laden with their bleſſing and prayers. He ſtopped at the place where his faithful ſervant was buried, and cauſed maſſes to be ſaid for the repoſe of his ſoul; then, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing his way by eaſy journeys, arrived in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at home. His family rejoiced at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; he ſettled his new ſervant in attendance upon his perſon; he then looked round his neighbourhood for objects of his charity; when he ſaw merit in diſtreſs, it was his delight to raiſe and ſupport it: he ſpent his time in the ſervices of his Creator, and glorified him in doing good to his creatures. He reflected frequently upon every thing that had befallen him in his late journey to the weſt; and at his leiſure, took down all the particulars in writing.</p>
            <p>[Here follows an interval of four years, as by the manuſcript; and this omiſſion ſeems intended by the writer. What follows is in a different hand, and the character is more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern.]</p>
            <p>ABOUT this time the prognoſtics of Sir Philip Harclay began to be verified; that Edmund's good qualities might one day ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite envy and create him enemies. The ſons and kinſmen of his patron began to ſeek oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to find fault with him, and to depreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate him to others. The Baron's eldeſt ſon
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032742_0025_0FF50A2359680740"/>
and heir, Maſter Robert, had ſeveral conteſts with Maſter William, the ſecond ſon, upon his account: this youth had a warm affection <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Edmund, and whenever his brother and kinſman treated him ſlightly, he ſupported him againſt their malicious inſinuations. Mr. Richard Wenlock, and Mr. John Markham, were the ſiſters ſons of the Lord Fitz-Owen; and there were ſeveral other more diſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, who, with them, ſecretly envied Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund's fine qualities, and ſtrove to leſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>en him in the eſteem of the Baron and his family. By degrees they excited a diſlike in maſter Robert, that in time was fixed into habit, and fell little ſhort of averſion.</p>
            <p>Young Wenlock's hatred was confirmed by an additional circumſtance; he had a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſion for the lady Emma, the Baron's only daughter; and, as love is eagle-eyed, he ſaw, or fancied he ſaw, her caſt an eye of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Their ill-will towards Edmund was ſo well concealed, that his patron had not diſcovered it: but it was whiſpered among the ſervants, who are generally cloſe obſervers of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their principals. Edmund was a favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite with them all, which was a ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that he deſerved to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Edmund was cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, but not familiar with them; and, by this means, gained their affections without ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting them. Among them was an old ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, called Joſeph Howell; this man had formerly ſerved the old Lord Lovel, and his ſon; and when the young Lord died, and Sir Walter ſold the caſtle to his brother-in-law, the Lord Fitz-Owen, he only of all the old ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants was left in the houſe, to take care of it, and to deliver it into the poſſeſſion of the new proprietor, who retained him in his ſervice: he was a man of few words, but much reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, without troubling himſelf about o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people's affairs, went ſilently and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about his own buſineſs; more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

This old man would ſix his eyes upon Edmund, whenever he could do it without obſervation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſometimes he would ſigh deeply, and a tear would ſtart from his eye, which he ſtrove to conceal from obſervation. One day Edmund

ſurpriſed him in this tender emotion, as he was wiping his eyes with the back of his hand:—Why, ſaid he, my good friend, do you look at me ſo earneſtly and affectionately?—Becauſe I love you.

the diſtreſſes of his fellow creatures in general; humble but not ſervile, to his patron and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors. Once, when he with a manly ſpirit juſtified himſelf againſt a malicious imputation, his young Lord Robert taxed him with pride and arrogance to his kinſmen. Edmund de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the charge againſt him with equal ſpirit and modeſty. Maſter Robert anſwered him ſharply—How dare you contradict my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins? do you mean to give them the lye?—not in words, ſir, ſaid Edmund; but I will behave ſo as that you ſhall not believe them. Maſter Robert haughtily bade him be ſilent, and know himſelf, and not preſume to contend with men ſo much his ſuperiors in every reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. Theſe heart burnings, in ſome degree ſubſided, by their preparations for going to France.

The Baron granted Edmund's requeſt; and, being freed from ſervitude to the reſt, he was devoted to that of his beloved maſter William, who treated him in public as his principal domeſtic, but in private as his choſen friend and brother.</p>
            <p>The whole cabal of his enemies conſulted together in what manner they ſhould vent their reſentment againſt him; and it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that they ſhould treat him with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and neglect, till they ſhould arrive in France: and when there, they ſhould contrive to render his courage <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

            <p>The young men of Baron Fitz-Owen's houſe were recommended particularly to the Regent's notice.

And mine, ſaid Markham; and ſo ſaid all. The next day the affair was publickly mentioned; and Hewſon, as he promiſed, provoked Edmund to the trial: ſeveral young men of family offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; among the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> danger of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize in the ſtrongeſt colours. At laſt Sir Robert complained of the tooth-ach, and was confined to his tent; Edmund waited on him; and judging by the ardour of his own cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, of that of his patron, thus beſpoke him:—I am greatly concerned, dear ſir, that we cannot have your company at night; but as I know what you will ſuffer in being abſent, I would beg the favour of you to let me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

In a few hours they were ready to ſet out. Wenlock and Markham, and their depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants found themſelves engaged in honour to go upon an enterprize they never intended: and ſet out, with heavy hearts to join the party. They marched in ſilence in the horrors of a dark night, and wet roads; they met the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy where they expected, and a ſharp engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enſued. The victory was ſometime doubtful; but the moon riſing on the backs of the Engliſh, gave them the advantage. They ſaw the diſpoſition of their enemies, and availed themſelves of it. Edmund advanced the foremoſt of the party; he drew out the leader on the French ſide; he ſlew him. Mr. William preſſed forward to aſſiſt his friend; Sir Robert, to defend his brother; Wenlock and Markham, from ſhame to ſtay behind.</p>
            <p>Thomas Hewſon and his aſſociates drew back on their ſide; the French perceived it, and purſued the advantage. Edmund puſhed them in front, the young nobles followed him; they broke through the detachment, and ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the waggons. The officer who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the party, encouraged them to go on; the defeat was ſoon complete, and the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions carried in triumph to the Engliſh camp.</p>

Approach, young man, ſaid the Regent, that I may confer upon you the honour of knighthood, which you have well deſerved. Mr. Wenlock could no longer forbear ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: knighthood, ſaid he, is an order belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to gentlemen, it cannot be conferred on a peaſant.—What ſay you, Sir? returned the Regent; is this youth a peaſant?—He is, ſaid Wenlock, let him deny it if he can. Edmund, with a modeſt bow, replied,—It is true indeed I am a peaſant, and this honour is too great for me: I have only done my duty. The duke of York, whoſe pride of birth equalled that of any man living or dead, ſheathed his ſword immediately.—Though, ſaid he, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reward you as I intended, I will take care that you ſhall have a large ſhare in the ſpoils of this night; and I declare publickly, that you ſtand firſt in the liſt of gallant men in this engagement.</p>
            <p>Thomas Hewſon and his aſſociates made a poor figure in their return; they were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly reproved for their backwardneſs. Hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was wounded in body, and more in mind for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

FROM the time the young men return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from France, the enemies of Edmund em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their utmoſt abilities to ruin him in the Baron's opinion, and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t him diſmiſſed from the family. They inſinuated a thouſand things againſt him, that happened, as they ſaid, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his reſidence in France, and therefore could not be known to his maſter; but, when the Baron privately enquired of his two elder ſons, he found there was no truth in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports. Sir Robert, though he did not love him, ſcorned to join in untruths againſt him. Mr. William ſpoke of him with the warmth of fraternal affection. The Baron perceived that his kinſmen diſliked Edmund; but his own good heart hindered him from ſeeing the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theirs. It is ſaid, that continual drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping will wear away a ſtone; ſo did their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant reports, by inſenſible degrees, produce a coolneſs in his patron's behaviour towards him. If he behaved with manly ſpirit, it was miſconſtrued into pride and arrogancy; his generoſity was imprudence; his humility was hypocriſy, the better to cover his ambition. Edmund bore patiently all the indignities that were thrown upon him; and, though he felt them ſeverely in his boſom, ſcorned to juſtify his conduct at the expence even of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Perhaps his gentle ſpirit might at length have ſunk under this treatment, but Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence interpoſed in his behalf; and, by ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly accidental circumſtances, conducted him imperceptibly towards the criſis of his fate.</p>

Father Oſwald, who had been preceptor to the young men, had a ſtrong affection for Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund, from a thorough knowledge of his heart; he ſaw through the mean artifices that were uſed to undermine him in his patron's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>This good man uſed frequently to walk out with Edmund; they converſed upon various ſubjects, would lament to him the unhappineſs of his ſituation, and the peculiar circumſtances that attended him. The father, by his whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome advice, comforted his drooping heart; and confirmed him in his reſolution of bearing unavoidable evils with patience and fortitude, from the conſciouſneſs of his own innocence, and the aſſurance of a future and eternal reward.</p>
            <p>One day, as they were walking in a wood near the caſtle, Edmund aſked the father, what meant thoſe preparations for building, the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down tree, and burning of bricks?—What, ſaid Oſwald, have you not heard that my Lord is going to build a new apartment on the weſt ſide of the caſtle?—And why, ſaid Edmund, ſhould my Lord be at that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence when there is one on the eaſt ſide that is never occupied?—That apartment, ſaid the friar, you muſt have obſerved is always ſhut up.—I have obſerved it often, ſaid Edmund, but never preſumed to aſk any queſtions about it.—You had then, ſaid Oſwald, leſs curioſity, and more diſcretion, than is common at your

She fainted away at the relation; but, when ſhe revived, exerted the utmoſt reſolution; ſaying, it was her duty to bear this dreadful ſtroke with chriſtian fortitude and patience, eſpecially in regard to the child ſhe went with, the laſt remains of her beloved huſband, and the undoubted heir of a noble houſe. For ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days ſhe ſeemed an example of patience and reſignation; but then, all at once, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them, and broke out into paſſionate and frantic exclamations; ſhe ſaid that her dear Lord was baſely murdered; that his ghoſt had appeared to her, and revealed his fate: She called upon Heaven and earth to revenge her wrongs; ſaying, ſhe would never ceaſe complaining to God, and the King, for vengeance and juſtice.</p>
            <p>Upon this, Sir Walter told the ſervants that Lady Lovel was diſtracted, from grief for the death of her lord; that his regard for her was as ſtrong as ever; and that, if ſhe recovered, he would himſelf be her comforter, and marry her. In the mean time ſhe was confined in this very apartment, and in leſs than a month the poor Lady died. She lies buried in the family vault in St. Auſtin's church in the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage. Sir Walter took poſſeſſion of the Caſtle, and all the other eſtates, and aſſumed the title of Lord Lovel.</p>
            <p>Soon after, it was reported that the Caſtle was haunted, and that the ghoſts of Lord and Lady Lovel had been ſeen by ſeveral of the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:032742_0041_0FF50AA434DC7880"/>
ſervants. Whoever went into this apartment were terrified by uncommon noiſes, and ſtrange appearances; at length this apartment was wholly ſhut up, and the ſervants were forbid to enter it, or to talk of any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to it: However, the ſtory did not ſtop here; it was whiſpered about, that the new Lord Lovel was ſo diſturbed every night, that he could not ſleep in quiet; and, being at laſt tired of the place, he ſold the Caſtle and eſtate of his anceſtors, to his brother-in-law the Lord Fitz-Owen, who now enjoys it, and left this country.</p>
            <p>All this is news to me, ſaid Edmund; but father, tell me what grounds there were for the Lady's ſuſpicion that her Lord died un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairly!—Alas! ſaid Oſwald, that is only known to God. There were ſtrange thoughts in the minds of many at that time; I had mine; but will not diſcloſe them, not even to you. I will not injure thoſe who may be innocent: and I leave it to Providence, who will doubtleſs, in his own beſt time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, puniſh the guilty.

My dear child, put your truſt in God: He who brought light out of darkneſs, can bring good out of evil.—I hope and truſt ſo, ſaid Edmund: but, father, if my enemies ſhould prevail, if my Lord ſhould believe their ſtories againſt me, and I ſhould be put out of the houſe with diſgrace, what will become of me? I have nothing but my character to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon; if I loſe that, I loſe every thing; I ſee they ſeek no leſs than my ruin.—Truſt in my Lord's honour and juſtice, replied Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald; he knows your virtue, and he is not ignorant of their ill-will towards you.—I know my Lord's juſtice too well to doubt of it, ſaid Edmund; but would it not be better to rid him of this trouble, and the family of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance? I would gladly do ſomething for myſelf, but cannot without my Lord's recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation; and, ſuch is my ſituation, that I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

at the thought, and tells me I cannot be happy out of it: Yet I think I could return to a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant's life with cheerfulneſs, rather than live in a palace under diſdain and contempt.—Have patience a little longer, my ſon, ſaid Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald; I will think of ſome way to ſerve you, and to repreſent your grievances to my Lord, without offence to either: Perhaps the cauſes may be removed. Continue to obſerve the ſame irreproachable conduct; and be aſſured that Heaven will defend your innocence, and defeat the unjuſt deſigns of our enemies.—Let us now return home.</p>
            <p>About a week after this conference, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund walked out in the fields ruminating on the diſagreeable circumſtances of his ſituation. Inſenſible of the time, he had been out ſeveral hours without perceiving how the day wore away, when he heard himſelf called by name ſeveral times; looking backward, he ſaw his friend, Mr. William, and hallooed to him. He came running towards him; and leaping over the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tile, ſtood ſtill awhile to recover breath.—What is the matter, Sir? ſaid Edmund; your looks beſpeak ſome tidings of importance. With a look of tender concern and affection, the youth preſſed his hand and ſpoke:—My dear Edmund, you muſt come home with me directly; your old enemies have united to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you with my father; my brother Robert has declared that he thinks there will be no peace in our family till you are diſmiſſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> and told my father he hoped he would not
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:032742_0044_0FF50AC641CD5978"/>
break with his kinſmen rather than give up Edmund.—But what do they lay to my charge? ſaid Edmund.—I cannot rightly underſtand, anſwered William, for they make a great myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of it; ſomething of great conſequence, they ſay; but they will not tell me what: However, my father has told them that they muſt bring their accuſation before your face, and he will have you anſwer them publickly. I have been ſeeking you this hour, to inform you of this, that you might be prepared to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend yourſelf againſt your accuſers.—God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you, Sir, ſaid Edmund, for all your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me, be aſſured you ſhall have no cauſe to bluſh for your kindneſs and partiality to your Edmund.—I know it, I am ſure of it, ſaid William; and here I ſwear to you, as Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan did to David, I beſeech Heaven to bleſs me, as my friendſhip to you ſhall be ſteady and inviolable!—Only ſo long as I ſhall deſerve ſo great a bleſſing, interrupted Edmund. I know your worth and honour, continued William: and ſuch is my confidence in your merit, that I firmly believe heaven deſigns you for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary; and I expect that ſome great and unforeſeen event will raiſe you to the rank and ſtation to which you appear to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long: Promiſe me, therefore, that whatever may be your fate, you will preſerve the ſame friendſhip for me that I bear to you.—Edmund was ſo much affected that he could not anſwer but in broken ſentences.—Oh my friend, my ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="46" facs="unknown:032742_0045_0FF50AD21AE61FA8"/>
He kneeled down with claſped hands and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifted eyes: William kneeled by him, and they invoked the Supreme to witneſs to their friendſhip, and implored his bleſſing upon it: They then roſe up and embraced each other, while tears of cordial affection bedewed their cheeks.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they were able to ſpeak, Edmund conjured his friend not to expoſe himſelf to the diſpleaſure of his family out of kindneſs to him. I ſubmit to the will of Heaven, ſaid he, I wait with patience its diſpoſal of me: if I leave the caſtle, I will find means to inform you of my fate and fortunes.—I hope ſaid William, that things may yet be accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but do not take any reſolution, let us act as occaſions ariſe.</p>
            <p>In this manner theſe amiable youths confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, till they arrived at the caſtle. The Baron was ſitting in the great hall, on a high chair with a footſtep before, with the ſtate and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a judge: before him, ſtood father Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald as pleading the cauſe for himſelf and Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund.

I cannot properly call them crimes: I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to do juſtice between you and your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers; I ſhall therefore hear you as well as them; for no man ought to be condemned unheard.—My Lord, ſaid Edmund, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual modeſty and intrepidity, I demand my tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; if I ſhall be found guilty of any crimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my benefactor, let me be puniſhed with the utmoſt rigour: But if, as I truſt, no ſuch charge can be proved againſt me, I know your goodneſs too well to doubt that you will do juſtice to me, as well as to others; and, if it ſhould ſo happen, that by the miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my enemies (who have long ſought my ruin privately, and now avow it publicly) if by their artifices your Lordſhip ſhould be induced to think me guilty, I would ſubmit to your ſentence in ſilence, and appeal to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tribunal.—See, ſaid Mr. Wenlock, the confidence of the fellow! he already ſuppoſes that my Lord muſt be in the wrong if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns him; and then this meek creature will appeal to another tribunal: To whom will he appeal?

I am informed that Oſwald and you have made very free with me and my family, in ſome of your converſations; you were heard to cenſure me for the abſurdity of building a new apartment on the weſt ſide of the caſtle, when there was one on the eaſt ſide unin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Oſwald ſaid, that apartment was ſhut up becauſe it was haunted; that ſome ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing murder had been committed there; adding many particulars concerning Lord Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel's family, ſuch as he could not know the truth of, and, if he had known, was imprudent to reveal. But further, you complained of ill treatment here; and mentioned your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to leave the Caſtle, and ſeek your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune elſewhere. I ſhall examine into all theſe particulars in turn. At preſent I deſire you, Edmund, to relate all that you can remember of the converſation that paſſed between you and Oſwald in the wood laſt Monday.—Good God! ſaid Edmund, is it poſſible that any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could put ſuch a conſtruction upon ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent a converſation?</p>
            <p>Tell me then, ſaid the Baron, the particulars of it.—I will, my Lord, as nearly as my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory will allow me. Accordingly he related moſt of the converſation that paſſed in the wood; but in the part that concerned the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Lovel be abbreviated as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Oſwald's countenance cleared up, for he had done the ſame before Edmund <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. The Baron called to his eldeſt ſon,—You hear, Sir Robert, what both parties ſay, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:032742_0048_0FF50B03CB749A18"/>
queſtioned them ſeparately; neither of them knew what the other would anſwer, yet their accounts agree almoſt to a word.—I confeſs they do ſo, anſwered Sir Robert, but, Sir, it is very bold and preſuming for them to ſpeak of our family affairs in ſuch a manner; if my uncle, Lord Lovel, ſhould come to know it, be would puniſh them ſeverely; and if his honour is reflected upon, it becomes us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and to puniſh it. Here Mr. Wenlock broke out into a paſſion, and offered to ſwear to the accuſation. Be ſilent, Dick, ſaid the Baron; I ſhall judge for myſelf.—I proteſt, ſaid he to Sir Robert, I never heard ſo much as Oſwald has now told me concerning the deaths of Lord and Lady Lovel; I think it is beſt to let ſuch ſtories alone, till they die away of themſelves. I had, indeed, heard of an idle ſtory of the eaſt apartment's being haunted; when firſt I came hither, my brother adviſed me to ſhut it up till it ſhould be forgotten; but what has now been ſaid, has ſuggeſted a thought that may make that apartment uſeful in future. I have thought of a puniſhment for Edmund that will ſtop the mouth of his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers for the preſent; and, as I hope, eſtabliſh his credit with every body. Edmund, will you undertake this adventure for me?—What ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, my Lord? ſaid Edmund: there is nothing I would not undertake to ſhew my gratitude and fidelity to you. As to my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, I would ſhew that at the expence of my
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:032742_0049_0FF4D448AE23A540"/>
malicious accuſers, if reſpect to my Lord's blood did not tie up my hands; as I am ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, I beg it may be put to the proof in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever way is moſt for my maſter's ſervice.—That is well ſaid, cried the Baron: As to your enemies, I am thinking how to ſeparate you from them effectually; of that I ſhall ſpeak more hereafter. I am going to try Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund's courage; he ſhall ſleep three nights in the eaſt apartment, that he may teſtify to all whether it be haunted or not; afterwards I will have that apartment ſet in order, and my eldeſt ſon ſhall take it for his own; it will ſpare me ſome expence, and anſwer my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as well, or better: will you conſent, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund?—With all my heart, my Lord, ſaid Edmund, I have not wilfully offended God or man; I have, therefore, nothing to fear.—Brave boy! ſaid my Lord; I am not deceived in you, nor ſhall you be deceived in your reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on me. You ſhall ſleep in that apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to-night, and to-morrow I will have ſome private talk with you. Do you, Oſwald, go with me; I want to have ſome converſation with you. The reſt of you, retire to your ſtudies and buſineſs; I will meet you at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>Edmund retired to his own chamber, and Oſwald was ſhut up with the Baron; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="51" facs="unknown:032742_0050_0FF50B13F2056B80"/>
and Lady Lovel; and deſired Oſwald to be circumſpect in regard to what he had to ſay of the circumſtances attending them; adding, that he was both innocent and ignorant of any treachery towards either of them. Oſwald ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed himſelf for his communications to Edmund, ſaying they fell undeſignedly into the ſubject, and that he mentioned it in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to him only.</p>
            <p>The Baron ſent orders to the young men to come to dinner; but they refuſed to meet Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund at table: accordingly he a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e in the ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard's apartment. After dinner, the Baron tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reconcile his kinſmen to Edmund; but found it impoſſible. They ſaw their de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> were laid open; and, judging of him by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, thought it impoſſible to forgive or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e forgiven. The Baron ordered them to keep in ſeparate apartments; he took his eldeſt ſon for his own companion, as being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> moſt reaſonable of the malecontents, and ordered his kinſmen to keep their own apartment with a ſervant to watch their motions. Mr. William had Oſwald for his companion. Old Joſeph was bid to attend on Edmund; to ſerve him at ſupper; and, at the hour of nine, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct him to the haunted apartment. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund deſired that he might have a light and his ſword, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t his enemies ſhould endeavour to ſurprize him. The Baron thought his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt reaſonable, and complied with it.</p>
            <p>There was a great ſearch to find the key of the apartment; at laſt it was diſcovered by
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:032742_0051_0FF50B2282EF4050"/>
Edmund himſelf, among a parcel of old ruſty keys in a lumber-room. The Baron ſent the young men their ſuppers to their reſpective a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments. Edmund declined eating, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be conducted to his apartment. He was accompanied by moſt of the ſervants to the door of it; they wiſhed him ſucceſs, and prayed for him as if he had been going to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.</p>
            <p>The door was with great difficulty unlock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Joſeph gave Edmund a lighted lamp, and wiſhed him a good night; he returned his good wiſhes to them all with the utmoſt cheerfulneſs, took the key on the inſide of the door, and then diſmiſſed them.</p>
            <p>He then took a ſurvey of his chamber; the furniture, by long neglect, was decayed and dropping to pieces; the bed was devoured by the moths, and occupied by rats, who had built their n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ts there with impunity for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny generations. The bedding was damp, for the rain had forced its way thro' the ceiling; he determined therefore to lie down in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oaths. There were two doors on the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the room, with keys in them: being not at all ſleepy, he reſolved to examine them; he attempted one lock, and opened it with eaſe; he went into a large dining-room, the furniture of which was in the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> condition; out of this was a large <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with books in it, and hung round with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

houſe of Lovel; he amuſed himſelf here ſome minutes, and then returned into the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber.</p>
            <p>He recollected the other door, and reſolved to ſee where it led to; the key was ruſted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lock, and reſiſted his attempts; he ſet the lamp on the ground, and exerting all his ſtrength, opened the door, and at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant the wind of it blew out the lamp, and le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t him in utter darkneſs. At the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he heard a hollow ruſtling noiſe, like that of a perſon coming through a narrow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. Till this moment not one idea of fear had approached the mind of Edmund; but juſt then, all the concurrent circumſtances or his ſituation ſtruck upon his heart, and gave him a new and diſagreeable ſenſation. He pauſed a while; and recollecting himſelf, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out aloud—What ſhould I fear? I have not wilfully offended God or man! Why then ſhould I doubt protection? But I have not yet implored the divine aſſiſtance; how then can I expect it? Upon this, he kneeled down and prayed earneſtly, reſigning himſelf wholly to the will of heaven; while he was yet ſpeaking his courage returned, and he reſumed his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual confidence; again he approached the door from whence the noiſe proceeded; he thought he ſaw a glimmering light upon a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> before him. If, ſaid he, this apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is haunted. I will uſe my endeavours to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

He was preparing to deſcend the ſtaircaſe when he heard ſeveral knocks at the door by which he firſt entered the room; and ſtepping backward, the door was clapped to with great violence. Again fear attacked him; but he reſiſted it, and boldly cried out who is there?—A voice at the outer door anſwered—It's I, Joſeph your friend!—What do you want? ſaid Edmund.—I have brought you ſome wood to make a fire, ſaid Joſeph. I thank you kindly, ſaid Edmund; but my lamp is gone out; I will try to find the door, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. After ſome trouble, he found, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; and was not ſorry to ſee his friend Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, with a light in one hand, a flagon of beer in the other, and a faggot on his ſhoulder.—I come, ſaid the good old man, to bring you ſomething to keep up your ſpirits; the evening is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

You had better go to bed, however; if it is known that you viſit me here, it will be bad for us both.—So I will preſently: but, pleaſe God, I will come here again to-morrow night, when all the family are a-bed; and I will tell you ſomething that you never heard.—But pray tell me, ſaid Edmund, where does that door lead to?—Upon a paſſage that ends in a ſtaircaſe that leads to the lower rooms; and there is likewiſe a door out of that paſſage into the dining-room.—And what rooms are there below ſtairs, ſaid Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund?—The ſame as above, replied he.—Very well; then I wiſh you a good night, we will talk further to-morrow.—Aye, to-morrow night; and in this place, my dear maſter.—Why do you call me your maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? I never was, nor never can be, your maſter.—God only knows that, ſaid the good old man; good night, and Heaven bleſs you—Good night, my worthy friend!</p>
            <p>Joſeph withdrew, and Edmund returned to the other door, and attempted ſeveral times to open it in vain; his hands were benumbed and tired; at length he gave over. He made a fire in the chimney, placed the lamp on a table, and opened one of the window-ſhutters to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="56" facs="unknown:032742_0055_0FF50B5F1E2AD6E0"/>
himſelf to the divine protection, and threw himſelf upon the bed; he preſently fell aſleep, and continued in that ſtate, till the ſun ſalut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with his orient beams through the window he had opened.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he was perfectly awake, he ſtrove to recollect his dreams. He thought that he heard people coming up the ſtaircaſe that he had a glimpſe of; that the door open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and there entered a warrior, leading a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by the hand, who was young and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but pale and wan: The man was dreſt in a complete armour, and his helmet down. They approached the bed; they undrew the curtains. He thought the man ſaid,—Is this our child? The woman replied,—It is; and the hour approaches that he ſhall be known for ſuch. They then ſeparated, and one ſtood on each ſide of the bed; their hands met o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his head, and they gave him a ſolemn benediction. He ſtrove to riſe and pay them his reſpects, but they forbid him; and the lady ſaid—Sleep in peace, oh, my Edmund! for thoſe who are the true poſſeſſors of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment are employed in thy preſervation: Sleep on, ſweet hope of a houſe that is thought paſt hope!—Upon this, they withdrew, and went out at the ſame door by which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and he heard them deſcend the ſtairs.—After this, he followed a funeral as chief mourner; he ſaw the whole proceſſion, and heard the ceremonies performed. He was ſnatched away from this mournful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>at by his ſide; and his happineſs was complete. Every ſucceeding idea was happineſs without allay; and his mind was not idle a moment till the morning ſun awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened him. He perfectly remembered his dreams, and meditated on what all theſe things ſhould portend.—Am I then, ſaid he, not Edmund Twyford, but ſomebody of conſequence, in whoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He lay thus reflecting, when a ſervant knocked at the door, and told him it was paſt ſix o'clock, and that the Baron expected him to breakfaſt in an hour. He roſe immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; paid his tribute of thanks to heaven for its protection, and went from his chamber in high health and ſpirits.</p>
            <p>He walked in the garden till the hour of breakfaſt, and then attended the Baron.—Good morrow, Edmund! ſaid he; how have you reſted in your new apartment?—Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well, my Lord, anſwered he.—I am glad to hear it, ſaid the Baron; but I did not know your accommodations were ſo bad, as Joſeph tells me they are.—Tis of no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſaid Edmund; if they were much worſe. I could diſpenſe with them for three <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He came; the ſervants were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed: and the Baron ſpoke as follows:—Edmund, when firſt I took you into my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, it was at the requeſt of my ſons and kinſmen; I bear witneſs to your good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, you have not deſerved to loſe their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem; but nevertheleſs, I have obſerved for ſome years paſt, that all but my ſon William have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I want to think of ſome way to prefer you, that you may leave this houſe with honour; and I deſire both of you to give me your advice in this matter. If Edmund will tell me in what way I can employ him to his own honour and my advantage, I am ready to do it; let him propoſe it, and Oſwald ſhall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate between us.</p>
            <p>Here he ſtopped; and Edmund, whoſe ſighs almoſt choaked him, threw himſelf at the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's feet, and wet his hand with his tears. Oh, my noble, generous benefactor! do you condeſcend to conſult ſuch a one as me upon the ſtate of your family? Does your moſt amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and beloved ſon incur the ill-will of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and kinſmen for my ſake? What am I, that I ſhould diſturb the peace of this noble family? Oh, my Lord, ſend me away directly! I ſhould be unworthy to live, if I did not ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly endeavour to reſtore your happineſs. You have given me a noble education, and I truſt I ſhall not diſgrace it. If you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend me, and give me a character, I fear not to make my own fortune. The Baron wiped his eyes; I wiſh to do this, my child, but in what way?—My Lord, ſaid Edmund, I will open my heart to you. I have ſerved, with credit in the army, and I ſhould prefer a ſoldier's life.—You pleaſe me well, ſaid the Baron: I will ſend you to France, and give you a recommendation to the Regent; he knows you perſonally, and will prefer you, for my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

lord, you over whelm me with your goodneſs! I am but your creature, and my life ſhall be devoted to your ſervice.—But, ſaid the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, to diſpoſe of you till the ſpring?—That, ſaid Oſwald, may be thought of at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; I am glad that you have reſolved, and I congratulate you both. The Baron put an end to the converſation by deſiring Edmund to go with him into the Menage to ſee his horſes. He ordered Oſwald to acquaint his ſon William with all that had paſſed, and to try to perſuade the young men to meet Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund and William at dinner.</p>
            <p>The Baron took Edmund with him into his Menage to ſee ſome horſes he had lately pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed; while they were examining the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and defects of theſe noble and uſeful ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, Edmund declared that he preferred Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoc, a horſe he had broke himſelf, to any in my Lord's ſtables. Then, ſaid the Baron, I will give him to you; and you ſhall go upon him to ſeek your fortune. He made new acknowledgments for this gift, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared he would prize it highly for the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's ſake. But I ſhall not part with you yet, ſaid my Lord; I will firſt carry all my points with theſe ſaucy boys, and oblige them to do you juſtice.—You have already done that, ſaid Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund; and I will not ſuffer any of your lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's blood to undergo any further humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon my account. I think, with humble ſubmiſſion to your better judgment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> I go hence the better.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:032742_0060_0FF50B9D7B88D458"/>
While they were ſpeaking, Oſwald came to them, and ſaid, that the young men had abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refuſed to dine at the table, if Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund was preſent.—'Tis well, ſaid the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron; I ſhall find a way to puniſh their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy hereafter: I will make them know that I am the maſter here. Edmund and you, Oſwald, ſhall ſpend the day in my apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above ſtairs. William ſhall dine with me alone; and I will acquaint him with our determination: My ſon Robert, and his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, ſhall be priſoners in the great parlour. Edmund ſhall, according to his own deſire, ſpend this and the following night in the haunted apartment; and this for his ſake, and my own; for if I ſhall now contradict my former order, it would ſubject us both to their impertinent reflections.</p>
            <p>He then took Oſwald aſide, and charged him not to let Edmund go out of his ſight; for if he ſhould come in the way of thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable enemies, he trembled for the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. He then walked back to the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and the two friends returned into the houſe.</p>
            <p>They had a long converſation on various ſubjects; in the courſe of it, Edmund ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted Oſwald with all that had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and Joſeph the preceding night, the curioſity he had raiſed in him, and his promiſe to gratify it the night following. I wiſh, ſaid Oſwald, you would permit me to
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:032742_0061_0FF50BACC4D993C0"/>
be one of the party.—How can that be? ſaid Edmund: we ſhall be watched, perhaps; and, if diſcovered, what excuſe can you make for coming there? Beſide, if it were known, I ſhall be branded with the imputation of cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice; and, though I have borne much, I will not promiſe to bear that patiently.—Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fear, replied Oſwald, I will ſpeak to Joſeph about it; and, after prayers are over, and the family gone to bed, I will ſteal away from my own chamber and come to you. I am ſtrongly intereſted in your affairs: and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be eaſy until you will receive me into your company: I will bind myſelf to ſecreſy in any manner you ſhall enjoin.—Your word is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, ſaid Edmund; I have as much reaſon to truſt you, father, as any man living; I ſhould be ungrateful to refuſe you any thing in my power to grant: but ſuppoſe the apartment ſhould really be haunted, would you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution enough to purſue the adventure to a diſcovery?—I hope ſo, ſaid Oſwald: but have you any reaſon to believe it is?—I have, ſaid Edmund; but I have not opened my lips up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſubject to any creature but yourſelf. This night I purpoſe, if Heaven permit, to go all over the rooms; and, though I formed this deſign, I will confeſs that your company will ſtrengthen my reſolution. I will have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to you in any reſpect; I muſt put a ſeal upon your lips. Oſwald ſwore ſecreſy till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e ſhould be permitted to diſcloſe the myſteries of that apartment; and both of them waited,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:032742_0062_0FF50BB163C8F320"/>
in ſolemn expectation, the event of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching night.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, Mr. William was allowed to viſit his friend: An affecting interview paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between them: he lamented the neceſſity of Edmund's departure, and they took a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn leave of each other, as if they foreboded it would be long ere they ſhould meet again.</p>
            <p>About the ſame hour as the preceding even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Joſeph came to conduct Edmund to his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment. You will find better accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than you had laſt night, ſaid he, and all by my Lord's own order.—I every hour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome new proof of his goodneſs, ſaid Edmund. When they arrived, he found a good fire in the chamber, and a table covered with cold meats, and a flagon of ſtrong beer.—Sit down and get your ſupper, my dear maſter, ſaid Joſeph: I muſt attend my Lord; but as ſoon as the family are gone to bed, I will viſit you again.—Do ſo, ſaid Edmund; but firſt, ſee father Oſwald; he has ſomething to ſay to you: You may truſt him, for I have no reſerves to him.—Well, Sir, I will ſee him, if you deſire it: and I will come to you as ſoon as poſſible, So, ſaying, he went his way; and Edmund ſat down to ſupper.</p>
            <p>After a moderate refreſhment, he kneeled down, and prayed with the greateſt fervency; he reſigned himſelf to the diſpoſal of heaven: I am nothing, ſaid he, I deſire to be nothing but what thou, O Lord, pleaſeſt to make me: If it is thy will that I ſhould return to my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:032742_0063_0FF50BBEE4573518"/>
obſcurity, be it obeyed with cheerfulneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, if thou art pleaſed to exalt me, I will look up to thee, as the only fountain of honour and dignity. While he prayed, he felt an enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his heart beyond what he had ever experienced before; all idle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ars were diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and his heart glowed with divine love and affiance: he ſeemed raiſed above all the world and its purſuit. He continued wrapt up in mental devotion, till a knocking at the door obliged him to riſe, and let in his two friends, who came without ſhoes and on tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe, to viſit him.</p>
            <p>Save you, my ſon! ſaid the friar; you look chearful and happy.—I am ſo, father, ſaid Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund; I have reſigned myſelf to the diſpoſal of Heaven, and I find my heart ſtrengthened above what I can expreſs.—Heaven be praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! ſaid Oſwald: I believe you are deſigned for great things, my ſon.—What! do you too encourage my ambition? ſays Edmund; ſtrange occurrence of circumſtances! Sit down my friends; and do you, my good Joſeph, tell me the particulars you promiſed laſt night. They drew their chairs round the fire, and Joſeph began as follows.—</p>
            <p>You have heard of the untimely death of the late Lord Lovel, my noble and worthy Maſter; perhaps you may have alſo heard, that, from that time, this apartment was haunted. What paſſed the other day, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y Lord queſtioned you both on this head, brought all the circumſtances freſh into m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

mind. You then ſaid, there were ſuſpicions that he came not fairly to his end. I truſt you both, and will ſpeak what I know of it. There was a perſon ſuſpected of this murder; and who do you think it was?—You muſt ſpeak out, ſaid Oſwald.—Why then, ſaid Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, it was the preſent Lord Lovel.—You ſpeak my thoughts, ſaid Oſwald; but proceed to the proofs.—I will, ſaid Joſeph. From the time that my Lord's death was reported, there were ſtrange whiſperings and conſulations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the new Lord and ſome of the ſervants; there was a deal of private buſineſs carried on in this apartment: Soon after, they gave out that my poor Lady was diſtracted; but ſhe threw out ſtrong expreſſions that favoured no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of madneſs: ſhe ſaid, that the ghoſt of her departed Lord had appeared to her, and revealed the circumſtances of this murder. None of the ſervants but one, were permitted to ſee her. At this very time, Sir Walter, the new Lord, had the cruelty to offer love to her; he urged her to marry him; and one of her women overheard her ſay, ſhe would ſooner die than give her hand to the man who cauſed the death of her Lord: ſoon after this, we were told my Lady was dead. The Lord Lovel made a public and ſumptuous funeral for her.—That is true, ſaid Oſwald; for I was a novice, and aſſiſted at it.</p>
            <p>Well, ſays Joſeph, now comes my part of the ſtory. As I was coming home from the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:032742_0065_0FF50BCEF20DE378"/>
burial. I overtook Roger, our ploughman. Said he, What think you of this burying? What ſhould I think, ſaid I, but we have loſt the beſt maſter and lady we ſhall ever know? God he knows, quoth Roger, whether they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e living or dead; but if ever I ſaw my lady in my life, I ſaw her alive the night they ſay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he died. I tried to convince him that he was miſtaken<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but he offered to take his oath, that the very night they ſaid ſhe died, he ſaw her come out at the garden-gate into the fields; that ſhe often ſtopped, like a perſon in pain, and then went forward again until he loſt ſight of her. Now it is certain that her time was out, and ſhe expected to lie down every day: and they did not pretend that ſhe died in child-bed. I thought upon what I heard: but nothing I ſaid. Roger told the ſame ſtory to another ſervant: ſo he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to an account; the ſtory was huſhed up, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d the fooliſh fellow ſaid, he was verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded it was her ghoſt that he ſaw. Now you muſt take notice that, from this time, they began to talk about, that this apartment was troubled; and not only this, but at laſt the new Lord could not ſleep in quiet in his own room; and this induced him to ſell the caſtle to his brother-in-law, and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t out of this country as faſt as poſſible. He took moſt of the ſervants away with him, and Roger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt. As for me, they thought I knew nothing, and ſo they le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

but I was neither blind nor deaf, though I could hear, and ſee, and ſay nothing.</p>
            <p>This is a dark ſtory, ſaid Oſwald.—It is ſo, ſaid Edmund; but why ſhould Joſeph ſeem to think it concerns me in particular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>—Ah, dear Sir, ſaid Joſeph, I muſt tell you, though I never uttered it to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

            <p>At theſe words Edmund changed colour, and trembled; he clapped his hand upon his breaſt and looked up to Heaven in ſilence; his dream occurred to his memory, and ſtruck upon his heart. He related it to his attenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> auditors. The ways of Providence are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, ſaid Oſwald. If this be ſo, Heaven in its own time will make it appear.</p>
            <p>Here a ſilence of ſeveral minutes enſued when, ſuddenly, they were awakened from their reverie by a violent noiſe in the rooms underneath them. It ſeemed like the claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of arms, and ſomething ſeemed to fall down with violence.</p>
            <p>They ſtarted, and Edmund r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> took up
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:032742_0067_0FF50BE9B4C1F758"/>
a lamp, and went to the door that he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the night before. Oſwald followed with his roſary in his band, and Joſeph laſt, with trembling ſteps. The door opened with eaſe, and they deſcended the ſtairs in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſilence.</p>
            <p>The lower rooms anſwered exactly to thoſe above; there were two parlours and a large cloſet. They ſaw nothing remarkable in theſe rooms, except two pictures, that were turned with their faces to the wall. Joſeph took the courage to turn them: Theſe, ſaid he, are the portraits of my Lord and Lady.—Father, look at this face; do you know who is like it?—I ſhould think, ſaid Oſwald, it was done for Edmund!—I am, ſaid Edmund, ſtruck with the reſemblance myſelf: but let us go on: I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell myſelf inſpired with unuſual courage.—Let us open the cloſet-door.—Oſwald ſtopped him ſhort:—Take heed, ſaid he, leſt the wind of the door put out the lamp. I will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen this door. He attempted it without ſucceſs; Joſeph did the ſame, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: Edmund gave the lamp to Joſeph; he approached the door, tried the key, and it gave way to his hand in a moment.—This adventure belongs, ſaid he, to me only; that is plain; bring the lamp forward. Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald repeated his paternoſter, in which they all joined, and then entered the cloſet.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that preſented itſelf to their view, was a complete ſuit of armour, that ſeemed to have fallen down on an heap.
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:032742_0068_0FF50BECD1881D08"/>
Behold! ſaid Edmund; this made the noiſe we heard above. They took it up, and examined it piece by piece; the inſide of the breaſt-pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e was ſtained with blood.—See here, ſaid Edmund; what think you of this?—'Tis my Lord's armour, ſaid Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph; I know it well: Here has been bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy work in this cloſet! Going forward, he ſtumbled over ſomething; it was a ring with the arms of Lovel engraved upon it.—This is my Lord's ring, ſaid Joſeph; I have ſeen him wear it: I give it to you, Sir, as the right owner; and moſt religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly do I believe you his ſon.—Heaven on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knows that, ſaid Edmund; and, if it permits, I will know who was my father before I am a day older. While he was ſpeaking he ſhifted his ground, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the boards roſe up on the other ſide of the cloſet; upon farther examination, they found that the whole floor was looſe, and a table that ſtood over them concealed the circumſtance from a caſual obſerver.—I perceive, ſaid Oſwald, that ſome great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery is at hand.—God defend us ſaid Edmund, but I verily believe that the perſon that owned this armour lies bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

A ſolemn ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence enſued, and marks of fear were viſible upon all three; the groan was thrice heard: Oſwald made ſigns for them to kneel, and he prayed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

how to act; he alſo prayed for the ſoul of the departed, that it might reſt in peace. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, he aroſe; but Edmund continued kneeling: he vowed ſolemnly to devote him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the diſcovery of this ſecret, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging the death of the perſon there buried. He then roſe up.—It would be to no purpoſe, ſaid he, for us to examine further now; when I am properly authoriſed, I will have this place opened: I truſt that time is not far off.—I believe it, ſaid Oſwald; you are deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Heaven to be its inſtrument in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this deed of darkneſs to light. We are your creatures; only tell us what you would have us do, and we are ready to obey your commands.—I only demand your ſilence, ſaid Edmund, till I call for your evidence; and then, you muſt ſpeak all you know, and all you ſuſpect.—Oh, ſaid Joſeph, that I may but live to ſee that day, and I ſhall have lived long enough!—Come, ſaid Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund, let us return up ſtairs, and we will conſult further how I ſhall proceed: ſo ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he went out of the cloſet, and they followed him.

How, ſaid Edmund, is it poſſible that I ſhould be the ſon of Lord Lovel? for, however circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances have ſeemed to encourage ſuch a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what reaſon have I to believe it?—I am ſtrangely puzzled about it, ſaid Oſwald. It ſeems unlikely that ſo good a man as Lord Lovel ſhould corrupt the wife of a peaſant, his vaſſal: and, eſpecially, being ſo lately married to a lady with whom he was paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in love.—Hold there! ſaid Joſeph; my Lord was incapable of ſuch an action: If maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Edmund is the ſon of my Lord, he is alſo the ſon of my Lady.—How can that be? ſaid Edmund.—I don't know how, ſaid Joſeph; but there is a perſon who can tell if ſhe will: I mean Margery Twyford, who calls herſelf your mother.—You meet my thoughts, ſaid Edmund; I had reſolved, before you ſpoke, to viſit her, and to interrogate her on the ſubject: I will aſk my Lord's permiſſion to go this very day.—That is right, ſaid Oſwald; but be cautious and prudent in your inquiries—If you, ſaid Edmund, would bear me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, I ſhould do better; ſhe might think herſelf obliged to anſwer your queſtions; and, being leſs intereſted in the event, you would be more diſcreet in your interrogations.—That I will moſt readily, ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I am as impatient as you, ſaid Oſwald; but let us be ſilent as the grave, and let not a word or look indicate any thing knowing or myſterious.</p>
            <p>The day-light began to dawn upon their conference; and Edmund, obſerving it, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his friends to withdraw in ſilence. They did ſo, and left Edmund to his own recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. His thoughts were too much employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſleep to approach him; he threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the bed, and lay meditating how he ſhould proceed; a thouſand ſchemes offered themſelves, and were rejected: but he reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at all events, to leave Baron Fitz-Owen's family the firſt opportunity that preſented it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>He was ſummoned, as before, to attend my Lord at breakfaſt; during which, he was ſilent, abſent, and reſerved. My Lord obſerved it, and rallied him; inquiring how he had ſpent the night?—In reflecting upon my ſituation, my Lord; and laying plans for my future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Oſwald took the hint, and aſked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to viſit Edmund's mother in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and acquaint her with his intentions of leaving the country ſoon. He conſented free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but ſeemed unreſolved about Edmund's departure.</p>

Margery met them at the door, and aſked Edmund what wind blew him hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?—Is it ſo very ſurpriſing, ſaid he, that I ſhould viſit my parents?—Yes, it is, ſaid ſhe, conſidering the treatment you have met with from us; but ſince Andrew is not in the houſe, I may ſay I am glad to ſee you: Lord bleſs you, what a fine youth you are grown! 'Tis a long time ſince I ſaw you; but that is not my fault: many a croſs word, and many a blow, have I had on your account; but I may now venture to embrace my dear child.—Edmund came forward and embraced her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I will, ſaid ſhe. Juſt one-and twenty years ago, on that very day, I loſt my firſt-born ſon: I got a hurt by over-reaching myſelf, when I was near my time, and ſo the poor child died. And ſo, as I was ſitting all alone, and very melancholy, Andrew came from work: ſee, Margery, ſaid he, I have brought you a child inſtead of that you have loſt. So he gave me a bundle, as I thought; but ſure enough it was a child: a poor helpleſs babe, juſt born, and only rolled up in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And where did you find this? ſaid I.—Upon the foot-bridge, ſaid he, juſt below the clay field. This child, ſaid he, belongs to ſome great folk, and perhaps it may be inquired after one day, and may make our fortunes; take care of it, ſaid he, and bring it up as if it was your own.

            <p>He came, indeed, as faſt as his age would permit him. As ſoon as he was within hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he aſked them what news?

But I will be the firſt to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my young Lord, and I will live and die his faithful ſervant.

            <p>Oſwald gave them both time to recover their emotions, by acquainting Joſeph with Edmund's ſcheme for his departure. Joſeph w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

Son Robert, lay aſide your ill-humours, and behave to your father with the reſpect and affection his tenderneſs deſerves from you, and give me your advice and opinion on this alarming ſubject.—My Lord, ſaid Sir Robert, I am as much confounded as yourſelf: I can give no advice: let my couſins ſee the letter; let us have their opinion. They read it in turn; they were equally ſurpriſed: but when it came into Wenlock's hand, he pauſed and meditated ſome minute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

all that are concerned in it.—Do ſo, Dick, ſaid my Lord, and you ſhall have my thanks for it.—This letter, ſaid he, I imagine to be the contrivance of Edmund, or ſome ingenious friend of his, to conceal ſome deſigns they have againſt the peace of this family, which has been to often diſturbed upon that raſcal's account.—But what end could be propoſed by it? ſaid the Baron.—Why, one part of the ſcheme is to cover Edmund's departure, that is clear enough; for the reſt, we can only gueſs as it: Perhaps he may be concealed ſomewhere in that apartment, from whence he may ruſh out in the night, and either rob or murder us; or, at leaſt, alarm, and terrify the family. The Baron ſmiled?—You ſhoot beyond the mark, Sir, and overſhoot yourſelf, as you have done before now; you ſhew only your inveteracy againſt that poor lad, whom you cannot mention with temper: to what purpoſe ſhould he ſhut himſelf up there, to be ſtarved?—Starved? no, no! he has friends in this houſe (looking at Oſwald) who will not ſuffer him to want any thing: thoſe who have always magnified his virtues, and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated his faults, will lend a hand to help him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the time of need; and, perhaps, to aſſiſt his ingenious contrivances. Oſwald ſhrugged up his ſhoulders, and remained ſilent.—This is a ſtrange <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald offered to call him, but Wenlock ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him.—No, father, ſaid he, you muſt ſtay with us: we want your ghoſtly counſel and advice: Joſeph ſhall have no private confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with you—What mean you, ſaid Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald, to inſinuate to my Lord againſt me, or Joſeph? But your ill-will ſpares nobody. It will one day be known who is the diſturber of the peace of this family; I wait for that time and am ſilent.</p>
            <p>Joſeph came; when he was told whither they were going, he looked hard at Oſwald. Wenlock obſerved them:—Lead the way, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaid he; and Joſeph ſhall follow us. Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald ſmiled:—We will go where Heaven permits us, ſaid he; alas! the wiſdom of man can neither haſten, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>They followed the father up ſtairs, and went directly to the haunted apartment. The Baron unlocked the door: he bid Joſeph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the ſhutters, and admit the day-light which had been excluded for many years. They went over the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Wenlock tauntingly deſired father Oſwald, to introduce them to the ghoſt. The father, in reply, aſked them where they ſhould find Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund?—Do you think, ſaid he, that he lies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Do you think Edmund is concealed in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment?—No, Sir.—Do you think there is any myſtery in it?—No, my Lord.—Is it haunted, think you?—No, I think not.—Should you be afraid to try?—In what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, my Lord?—Why, you have ſhewn your wit upon the ſubject, and I mean to ſhew your courage: you, and Jack Markham, your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidant, ſhall ſleep here three nights, as Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund has done before.—Sir, ſaid Sir Robert, for what purpoſe? I ſhould be glad to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand why.—I have my reaſons, Sir, as well as your kinſmen there.—No reply, Sirs! I inſiſt upon being obeyed in this point. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, let the beds be well a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Oſwald, come with me; and the reſt may go where they liſt till dinner-time.</p>
            <p>The Baron went with Oſwald into the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Now, tell me father, ſaid he, do you diſapprove what I have done?—Quite the contrary, my Lord, ſaid he; I entirely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it—But you do not know all my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it. Yeſterday Edmund's behaviour was different from what I have ever ſeen it; he is naturally frank and open in all his ways; but he was then ſilent, thoughtful, abſent; he ſighed deeply, and once I ſaw tears ſtand in his eyes: Now, I do ſuſpect there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing uncommon in that apartment; that Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund has diſcovered the ſecret: and, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

appear to them, it is better that it ſhould only be known to my own family; if there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it, I ſhall put to the proof the courage and veracity of my two kinſmen, of whom I think very indifferently. I mean ſhortly to enquire into many things I have heard lately to their diſadvantage; and, if I find them guilty, they ſhall not eſcape with impunity.—My Lord, ſaid Oſwald, you judge like yourſelf; I wiſh you to make enquiry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, and believe the reſult will be to their confuſion, and your lordſhip will be enabled to re-eſtabliſh the peace of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
            <p>During this converſation, Oſwald was upon his guard, leſt any thing ſhould eſcape that might create ſuſpicion. He withdrew as ſoon as he could with decency, and leſt the Baron meditating what all theſe things ſhould mean: he feared that there was ſome misfortune im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending over his houſe, though he knew not from what cauſe.</p>
            <p>He dined with his children and kinſmen, and ſtrove to appear chearful; but a gloom was perceivable through his deportment. Sir <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

endeavoured to conciliate their affections, and engage their gratitude by kindneſs. Wenlock and Markham felt their courage abate as the night approached: at the hour of nine, old Joſeph came to conduct them to the haunted apartment: they took leave of their kinſmen, and went up ſtairs, with heavy hearts.</p>
            <p>They found the chamber ſet in order for them, and a table ſpread with proviſion and good liquor to keep up their ſpirits.—It ſeems, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Doll enough, ſaid Markham; I think the beſt thing we can do, is to go to bed, and ſleep it away.—Faith, ſays Wenlock, I am in no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to ſleep! Who would have thought the old man would have obliged us to ſpend the night here?—Don't ſay <hi>us.</hi> I beg of you; it was all your own doing, replied Markham.—I did not intend he ſhould have taken me at my word.—Then you ſhould have ſpoken more cautiouſly. I have always been govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by you, like a fool as I am; you play the braggart, and I ſuffer for it: But they begin to ſee through your fine-ſpun arts and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and I believe you will meet with your deſerts one day or other.—What now? do you mean to affront me, Jack?

            <p>As they ſtood with their fiſts clenched, on a ſudden they were alarmed with a diſmal groan from the room underneath. They ſtood like ſtatues, petrified by fear, yet liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening with trembling expectation: A ſecond groan increaſed their conſternation; and, ſoon after, a third compleated it.

Oſwald, who gueſſed the buſineſs, was the only one that could queſtion them; he aſked ſeveral times.—What is the matter?

            <p>The Baron deſired Oſwald to talk to the young men, and endeavour to quiet the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance. He came forward; he comforted ſome, he rebuked others; he bade the ſervants retire into the outward room: The Baron, with his ſons and kinſmen, remained in the bed-chamber.—It is very unfortunate, ſaid Oſwald, that this affair ſhould be made ſo public; ſurely theſe young men might have related what they had ſeen, without alarming the whole family: I am very much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon my Lord's account.—I thank you, father, ſaid the Baron; but prudence was quite overthrown here: Wenlock was half dead, and Markham half diſtracted; the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were alarmed without my being able to prevent it: But let us hear what thoſe poor terrified creatures ſay.

Wenlock lifted up his head, and ſpoke:—I believe, father, if you had been with us, you would not have ſtood upon ceremonies any more than we did. I wiſh my Lord would ſend you to parley with the ghoſt; for without doubt, you are better qualified than we.—My Lord, ſaid Oſwald, I will go thither, with your permiſſion: I will ſee that every thing is ſafe, and bring the key back to you: Perhaps this may help to diſpel the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Oſwald went into the outward room. I am going, ſaid he, to ſhut up the apartment: The young gentlemen have been more fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened than they had occaſion for; I will try to account for it. Which of you will go with me? They all drew back, except Joſeph, who offered to bear him company. They went into the bed-room in the haunted apartment, and found every thing quiet there. They put out the fire, extinguiſhed the lights, locked the door, and brought away the key. As they returned—I thought how it would be, ſaid Joſeph.—Huſh! not a word, ſaid Oſwald; you find we are ſuſpected of ſomething, though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>All is quiet in the apartment, ſaid Oſwald, as we can teſtify.—Did you aſk Joſeph to go with you, ſaid the Baron, or did he offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?—My Lord, I aſked if any body would go with me, and they all declined it but he: I thought proper to have a witneſs beſide my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for whatever might be ſeen or heard.—Joſeph, you was ſervant of the late Lord Lovel, what kind of a man was he?—A very comely man, pleaſe your Lordſhip.

Maſter, and promiſes to keep his ſecrets. What ſay you, father, is the ghoſt your maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or your friend? are you under any obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to keep his ſecrets?—Sir, ſaid Oſwald, I anſwer as Joſeph does; I would ſooner die than diſcover a ſecret revealed in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.—I thought as much, ſaid Sir Robert; there is a myſtery in father Oſwald's beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which I cannot comprehend.—Do not reflect upon the father, ſaid the Baron, I have no cauſe to complain of him; perhaps the myſtery may be too ſoon explained: but let us not anticipate evils. Oſwald and Joſeph have ſpoken like good men; I am ſatisfied with their anſwers: let us, who are innocent, reſt in peace; and let us endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore peace in the family; and do you, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, aſſiſt us.—With my beſt ſervices, ſaid Oſwald. He called the ſervants in: let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be mentioned out of doors, ſaid he, of what has lately paſſed within, eſpecially in the eaſt apartment; the young Gentlemen had not ſo much reaſon to be frightened as they apprehended; a piece of furniture fell down in the rooms underneath, which made the noiſe that alarmed them ſo much; but I can certify that all things in the rooms are in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and there is nothing to fear. All of you attend me in the chapel in an hour; do your duties, put your truſt in God, and obey your Lord, and you will find every thing go right as it uſed to do.</p>

They diſperſed; the ſun roſe, the day came on, and every thing went on in the uſual courſe: but the ſervants were not ſo eaſily ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; they whiſpered that ſomething was wrong, and expected the time that ſhould ſet all right.—The mind of the Baron was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in meditating upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that ſeemed to him the fore-runners of ſome great events: he ſometimes thought of Edmund; he ſighed for his expulſion, and lamented the uncertainty of his fate: but, to his family, he appeared eaſy and ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>From the time of Edmund's departure, the fair Emma had many uneaſy hours; ſhe wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inquire after him, but feared to ſhew any ſolicitude concerning him: The next day, when her brother William came into her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he took courage to aſk him a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Pray brother, can you give any gueſs what is become of Edmund?—No, ſaid he (with a ſigh;) why do you aſk me?—Becauſe, my dear William, I ſhould think if any body knew, it muſt be you; and I thought he lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you too well to leave you in ignorance; but don't you think he left the Caſtle in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange manner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>—I do, my dear; there is a myſtery in every circumſtance of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; nevertheleſs (I will truſt you with a ſecret) he did not leave the Caſtle without making a diſtinction in my favour.—I thought ſo, ſaid ſhe; but you might tell me what you know about him.—Alas! my dear Emma I know nothing: When I ſaw him laſt, he
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:032742_0110_0FF50A7609954AF8"/>
ſeemed a good deal affected, as if he were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king leave of me; and I had a foreboding that we parted for a longer time than uſual. Ah! ſo had I, ſaid ſhe, when he parted from me in the garden.—What leave did he take of you, Emma?—She bluſhed, and heſitated to tell him all that paſſed between them; but he begged, perſuaded, inſiſted, and, at length, under the ſtrongeſt injunctions of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, ſhe told him all. He ſaid, that Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund's behaviour on that occaſion was as myſterious as the reſt of his conduct, but now you have revealed your ſecret, you have a right to know mine. He then gave her the letter he found upon his pillow; ſhe read it with great emotion. Saint Winefred aſſiſt me! ſaid ſhe, what can I think? <q>The pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Edmund is no more, but there lives one,</q>—that is, to my thinking, Edmund lives, but is no peaſant.—Go on, my dear, ſaid William, I like your explanation.—Nay, brother, I only gueſs; but what think you? I believe we think alike in more than one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that he meant to recommend no other perſon than himſelf to your favour; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>. I doubt not; and perhaps, his

own fate may be involved with that of others. I am confident that what he ſaw and heard there, was the cauſe of his departure. We muſt wait with patience the unravelling this intricate affair: I believe I need not enjoin your ſecrecy as to what I have ſaid; your heart will be my ſecurity.—What mean you, brother? Don't affect ignorance, my dear; you love Edmund, ſo do I; it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be aſhamed of: It would have been ſtrange if a girl of your good ſenſe had not diſtinguiſhed a ſwan among a flock of geeſe.—Dear William, don't let a word of this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape you; but you have taken a weight off my heart. You may depend that I will not diſpoſe of my hand or heart till I know the end of this affair. William ſmiled: Keep them for Edmund's <hi>friend:</hi> I ſhall rejoice to ſee him in a ſituation to aſk them.—Huſh, my brother! not a word more; I hear footſteps. They were her eldeſt brother's, who came to aſk Mr. William to ride out with him, which finiſhed the conference,</p>
            <p>The fair Emma, from this time, aſſumed an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ir of ſatisfaction: and William frequently ſtole away from his companions to talk with his ſiſter upon their favourite ſubject.</p>
            <p>While theſe things paſſed at the Caſtle of Lovel, Edmund, and his companion, John Wyatt, proceeded on their journey to Sir Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Harclay's ſeat; they converſed together on the way, and Edmund found him a man o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="113" facs="unknown:032742_0112_0FF50AA116C9C168"/>
he alſo diſcovered that John loved his maſter, and reſpected him even to veneration; from him he learned many particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that worthy Knight. Wyatt told him that Sir Philip maintained twelve old ſoldiers, who had been maimed and diſabled in the wars, and had no proviſion made for them; alſo ſix old officers, who had been unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and were grown grey without prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he likewiſe mentioned the Greek Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, his maſter's captive and friend, as a man eminent for valour and piety; but beſide theſe, ſaid Wyatt, there are many others who eat of my Maſter's bread, and drink of his cup, and who join in bleſſings and prayers to Heaven for their noble benefactor; his ears are ever open to diſtreſs, his hand to relieve it, and he ſhares in every good man's joys and bleſſings.—Oh, what a glorious character! ſaid Edmund; how my heart throbs with wiſhes to imitate ſuch a man! Oh, that I might reſemble him, though at ever ſo great a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance! Edmund was never weary o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hearing the actions of this truly great man, nor Wyatt with relating them; and, during three day: journey, there were but few pauſes in their converſation.</p>
            <p>The fourth day, when they came within view of the houſe, Edmund's heart began to raiſe doubts of his reception.—If, ſaid he, Sir Philip would not receive me kindly, if he should reſent my long neglect, and diſown my
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:032742_0113_0FF50AB74176ADF8"/>
acquaintance, it would be no more than juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
            <p>He ſent Wyatt before, to notify his arrival to Sir Philip, while he waited at the gate full of doubts and anxieties concerning his recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wyatt was met and congratulated on his return by moſt of his fellow-ſervants; he aſked,—Where is my Maſter?—In the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.—Are any ſtrangers with him?—No, only his own family.—Then I will ſhew my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him. He preſented himſelf before Sir Philip.—So, John, ſaid he, you are welcome home! I hope you left your parents and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions well. All well, thank God! and ſend their humble duty to your Honour, and they pray for you every day of their lives: I hope your Honour, is in good health.—Very well.—Thank God for that! but, Sir, I have ſomething further to tell you; I have had a companion all the way home, a perſon who comes to wait on your Honour, on buſineſs of great conſequence, as he ſays.—Who is that, John?—It is Maſter Edmund Tyford, from the caſtle of Lovel.—Young Edmund! ſays Sir Philip, ſurpriſed: Where is he?—At the gate Sir.—Why did you leave him there?—Becauſe he bad me come before, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint your Honour, that he waits your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.—Bring him hither, ſaid Sir Philip: tell him I ſhall be glad to ſee him.</p>
            <p>John made haſte to deliver his meſſage, and Edmund followed him in ſilence into Sir Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip's preſence: He bowed low, and kept at a
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:032742_0114_0FF50AC7CB034A48"/>
diſtance. Sir Philip held out his hand, and bade him approach. As he drew near, he was ſeized with an univerſal trembling; he kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down, took his hand, kiſſed it, and preſſed it to his heart in ſilence.</p>
            <p>You are welcome, young man! ſaid Sir Philip; take courage, and ſpeak for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Edmund ſighed deeply; he at length broke ſilence with difficulty.—I am come thus far, noble Sir, to throw myſelf at your feet, and implore your protection. You are, under God, my only reliance.—I receive you, ſaid Sir Philip, with all my heart! Your perſon is greatly improved ſince I ſaw you laſt, and I hope your mind is equally ſo; I have heard a great character of you from ſome that knew you in France, I remember the promiſe I made you long ago, and am ready now to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil it, upon condition that you have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to diſgrace the good opinion I formerly entertained of you; and am ready to ſerve you in any thing conſiſtent with my own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Edmund kiſſed the hand that was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to raiſe him.—I accept your favour, Sir, upon this condition only; and if ever you find me to impoſe upon your credulity, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach on your goodneſs, may you renounce me from that moment! Enough, ſaid Sir Philip; raiſe, then, and let me embrace you: You are truly welcome!—Oh, noble Sir, ſaid Edmund, I have a ſtrange ſtory to tell you; but it muſt be by ourſelves, with only Heaven to bear witneſs to what paſſes between
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:032742_0115_0FF50AD543750668"/>
us.—Very well, ſaid Sir Philip; I am ready to hear you; But firſt, go and get ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment after your journey, and then come to me again: John Wyatt, will attend you.—I want no refreſhment, ſaid Edmund; and I cannot eat or drink till I have told my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to your Honour. Well, then, ſaid Sir Philip, come along with me. He took the youth by the hand, and led him into another parlour, leaving his friends in great ſurpriſe, what this young man's errand could be: John Wyatt told them all he knew relating to Edmund's birth, character and ſituation.</p>
            <p>When Sir Philip had ſeated his young friend, he liſtened in ſilence to the ſurpriſing tale he had to tell him. Edmund told him briefly the moſt remarkable circumſtances of his life, from the time when he ſaw and liked him, till his return from France: but from that aera, he related at large every thing that happened, recounting every intereſting particular, which was imprinted on his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory in ſtrong and laſting characters.—Sir Philip grew every moment more affected by the recital; ſometimes he claſped his hands together, he lifted them up to Heaven, he ſmote his breaſt, he ſighed, he exclaimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud; when Edmund related his dream, he breathed ſhort, and ſeemed to devour him with attention; and when he deſcribed the fatal cloſet, he trembled, ſighed, ſobbed, and was almoſt ſuffocated with his agitations: But when he related all that paſſed between
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:032742_0116_0FF50AE28EC3D4B8"/>
his ſuppoſed mother and himſelf, and finally produced the jewels, the proofs of his birth, and the death of his unfortunate mother—he flew to him, he preſſed him to his boſom, he ſtrove to ſpeak, but ſpeech was for ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes denied: He wept aloud; and, at length, his words found their way in broken excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations—Son of my deareſt friend! dear and precious relic of a noble houſe! child of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence!—the beloved of Heaven!—welcome! thrice welcome to my arms!—to my heart! I will be thy parent from henceforward, and thou ſhalt be indeed my child, my heir! My mind told me from the firſt moment I beheld thee, that thou wert the image of my friend! my heart then opened itſelf to receive thee, as his offspring. I had a ſtrange foreboding that I was to be thy protector. I would then have made thee my own; but Heaven orders things for the beſt; it made thee the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this diſcovery, and in its own time and manner conducted thee to my arms. Praiſe be to God for his wonderful doings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the children of men! every thing that has befallen thee is by his direction, and he will not leave his work unfiniſhed; I truſt I ſhall be his inſtrument to do juſtice on the guilty, and to reſtore the orphan of my friend to his rights and title. I devote myſelf to this ſervice, and will make it the buſineſs of my life to effect it.</p>
            <p>Edmund gave vent to his emotions, in rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of joy and gratitude. They ſpent ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:032742_0117_0FF50AF5C12A0110"/>
hours in this way, without thinking of the time that paſſed; the one inquiring, the other explaining and repeating, every particular of the intereſting ſtory.</p>
            <p>At length they were interrupted by the careful John Wyatt, who was anxious to know if any thing was likely to give trouble to his Maſter.—Sir, ſaid John, it grows dark, do you want a light?—We want no light but what Heaven gives us, ſaid Sir Philip; I hope your Honour has heard no bad tidings,—I—I—I hope no offence.—None at all, ſaid the good Knight; I am obliged to your ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for me: I have heard ſome things that grieve me, and others that give me pleaſure; but the ſorrows are paſt, and the joys remain.—Thank God! ſaid John; I was afraid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was the matter to give your Honour trouble.—I thank you, my good ſervant! You ſee this young gentleman; I would have you, John, devote yourſelf to his ſervice: I give you to him for an attendant on his perſon, and would have you ſhow your affection to me by your attachment to him.—Oh, Sir! ſaid John, in a melancholy voice, what have I done to be turned out of your ſervice?—No ſuch matter, John, ſaid Sir Philip; you will not leave my ſervice.—Sir, ſaid John, I would rather die than leave you.—And, my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

relation; my ſon by adoption, my heir!—And will he live with you, Sir?—Yes, John; and I hope to die with him.—Oh, then, I will ſerve him with all my heart and ſoul: and I will do my beſt to pleaſe you both.—I thank you, John, and will not forget your honeſt love and duty: I have ſo good an opinion of you, that I will tell you of ſome things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this gentleman that will entitle him to your reſpect.—'Tis enough for me, ſaid John, to know that your honour reſpects him, to make me pay him as much duty as yourſelf. But, John, when you know him better, you will reſpect him ſtill more; at preſent, I ſhall only tell you what he is not, for you think him only the ſon of Andrew Twyford.—And is he not, ſaid John?—No, but his wife nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, and he paſſed for her ſon.—And does old Twyford know it, Sir?—He does, and will bear witneſs to it: but he is the ſon of a near friend of mine, of quality ſuperior to my own, and as ſuch you muſt ſerve and reſpect him.—I ſhall, to be ſure, Sir; but what name ſhall I call him?—You ſhall know that hereafter; in the mean time bring a light, and wait on us to the other parlour.</p>
            <p>When John was withdrawn, Sir Philip ſaid, that is a point to be determined and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed immediately: It is proper that you ſhould aſſume a name till you can take that of your father; for I chooſe you ſhould drop that of your foſter father; and I would have you be called by one that is reſpectable.—In that, and
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:032742_0119_0FF50B15864CD2D0"/>
every other point, I will be wholly governed by you, Sir, ſaid Edmund.—Well then, I will give you the name of Seagrave: I ſhall ſay that you are a relation of my own; and my mother was really of that family.</p>
            <p>John ſoon returned, and attended them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other parlour: Sir Philip entered with Edmund in his hand.—My friends, ſaid he, this gentleman is Mr. Edward Seagrave, the ſon of a dear friend and relation of mine: he was loſt in his infancy, brought up out of pure humanity, and is but lately reſtored to his own family: The circumſtances ſhall be known hereafter: In the mean time, I have taken him under my care and protection, and will uſe all my power and intereſt to ſee him reſtored to his fortune, which is enjoyed by the uſurper who was the cauſe of his expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the death of his parents. Receive him as my relation and friend: Zadiſky, do you embrace him firſt. Edmund, you and this gentleman muſt love each other for my ſake; hereafter you will do it for your own. They all roſe, each embraced and congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the young man. Zadiſky ſaid, Sir, whatever griefs and misfortunes you may have endured, you may reckon them at an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd, from the hour you are beloved and protected by Sir Philip Harclay.—I firmly believe it, Sir, replied Edmund: and my heart enjoys, already, more happineſs than I ever ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="121" facs="unknown:032742_0120_0FF50B259D1D3F40"/>
his friendſhip is the earneſt Heaven gives me of its bleſſings hereafter.</p>
            <p>They ſat down to ſupper with mutual chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; and Edmund enjoyed the repaſt with more ſatiſfaction than he had felt a long time. Sir Philip ſaw his countenance brighten up, and looked on him with heart-felt pleaſure.—Every time I look on you, ſaid he, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds me of your father; you are the ſame perſon I loved twenty-three years ago: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice to ſee you under my roof. Go to your repoſe early, and to-morrow we will conſult farther. Edmund withdrew, and enjoyed a night of ſweet undiſturbed repoſe.</p>
            <p>The next morning, Edmund aroſe in perfect health and ſpirits; he waited on his benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. They were ſoon after joined by Zadiſky, who ſhewed great attention and reſpect to the youth, and offered him his beſt ſervices with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve. Edmund accepted them with equal reſpect and modeſty? and finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at eaſe, began to diſplay his amiable qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. They breakfaſted together; afterwards Sir Philip deſired Edmund to walk out with him.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they were out of hearing, Sir Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip ſaid,—I could not ſleep laſt night for think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your affairs; I laid ſchemes for you, and rejected them again. We muſt lay our plan before we begin to act. What muſt be done to this treacherous kinſman! this inhuman monſter! this aſſaſſin of his neareſt relation?
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:032742_0121_0FF50B4B5A9B2458"/>
I will riſk my life and fortune to bring him to juſtice. Shall I go to court and demand juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the King? or ſhall I accuſe him of the murder, and make him ſtand a public trial? If I treat him as a Baron of the realm, he muſt be tried by his Peers; if as a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he muſt be tried at the county aſſize: but we muſt ſhew the reaſon why he ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded from his title. Have you any thing to propoſe?—Nothing, Sir; I have only to wiſh that it might be as private as poſſible, for the ſake of my great benefactor, the Lord Fitz-Owen, upon whom ſome part of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily diſgrace would naturally fall; and that would be an ill return for his kindneſs and generoſity to me. That is a generous and grateful conſideration on your part; but you owe ſtill more to the memory of your injured parents. However, there is yet another way ſuits me better than any hitherto propoſed: I will challenge the traitor to meet me in the field; and, if he has ſpirit enough to anſwer my call, I will there bring him to juſtice, if not, I will bring him to a public trial.</p>
            <p>No, Sir, ſaid Edmund, that is my province. Should I ſtand by and ſee my noble, gallant friend expoſe his life for me, I ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to bear the name of that friend whom you ſo much lament. It would become his ſon to vindicate his name, and revenge his death.

I will deviſe the time, place, and manner, and ſatisfy all your ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Edmund offered to reply; but Sir Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip bade him be ſilent, and let him proceed his own way.</p>
            <p>He then led him over his eſtate, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him every thing deſerving his notice: he told him all the particulars of his domeſtic oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy; and they returned home in time to meet their friends at dinner.</p>
            <p>They ſpent ſeveral days in conſulting how to bring Sir Walter to account, and in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their friendſhip and confidence in each other. Edmund endeared himſelf ſo much to his friend and patron, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>After much conſideration, Sir Philip fixed his reſolutions, and began to execute his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. He ſet out for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Sir Philip preſented Edmund to Lord Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford and his family, as his near relation and preſumptive heir: they ſpent their evening in the pleaſures of convivial mirth and hoſpitable entertainment. The next day Sir Philip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to open his mind to Lord Clifford, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming him that both his young friend and himſelf had received great injuries from the preſent Lord Lovel, for which they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to call him to an account; but that, for many reaſons, they were deſirous to have proper witneſſes of all that ſhould paſs between them, and begging the favour of his Lordſhip to be the principal one. Lord Clifford ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the confidence placed in him; and beſought Sir Philip to let him be the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrator between them.

            <p>Zadiſky preſented the letter to the Lord Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, informing him that he was the friend of Sir Philip Harclay. He ſeemed ſurpriſed and confounded at the contents; but, putting on an haughty air; I know nothing, ſaid he, of the buſineſs this letter hints at: but wait a few hours, and I will give you an anſwer. He gave orders to treat Zadiſky like a gentleman, in every reſpect, except in avoiding his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: for the Greek had a ſhrewd and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating aſpect, and he obſerved every turn of his countenance. The next day he came and apologized for his abſence, and gave him the anſwer, ſending his reſpects to the Lord Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.

            <p>'Tis well, ſaid Sir Philip: I am glad to find <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e has the ſpirit to meet me; he is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy worthy of my ſword. Lord Clifford then propoſed, that all parties ſhould paſs the borders, and obtain leave of the warden of the Scottiſh marches to decide the quarrel in his juriſdiction, with a ſelect number of friends on both ſides. Sir Philip agreed to the propoſal; and Lord Clifford wrote in his own name to aſk permiſſion of Lord Graham, that his friends might come there; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, on condition that neither party, ſhould exceed a limited number of friends and followers.</p>
            <p>Lord Clifford ſent choſen meſſengers to Lord Lovel, acquainting him with the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and appointing the time place, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their meeting, and that he had been deſired to accept the office of judge of the
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:032742_0126_0FF50BAE4E478098"/>
field. Lord Lovel accepted the conditions, and promiſed to be there without fail. Lord Clifford notified the ſame to Lord Graham, warden of the marches, who cauſed a piece of ground to be encloſed for the liſts, and made preparations againſt the day appointed.</p>
            <p>In the interim, Sir Philip Harclay thought proper to ſettle his worldly affairs: he made Zadiſky acquainted with every circumſtance of Edmund's hiſtory, and the obligation that lay upon him to revenge the death of his friend, and ſee juſtice done to his heir. Zadiſky en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the cauſe with an ardour that ſpoke the affection he bore to his friend. Why, ſaid he, would you not ſuffer me to engage this traitor?—Your life is of too much conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to be ſtaked againſt his: but though I truſt that the juſtice of your cauſe muſt ſucceed, yet, if it ſhould happen otherwiſe, I vow to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge you; he ſhall never go back from us both: However, my hope and truſt is to ſee your arm the miniſter of juſtice. Sir Philip then ſent for a lawyer, and made his will, by which he appointed Edmund his chief heir, by the name of Lovel, alias Seagrave, alias Twyford; he ordered that all his old friends, ſoldiers, and ſervants, ſhould be maintained in the ſame manner during their lives; he left to Zadiſky an annuity of an hundred a year, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>He appointed Lord Clifford joint executor with Edmund, and gave his will into that noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's care, recommending Edmund to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and protection. If I live, ſaid he, I will make him appear to be worthy of it; if I die, he will want a friend. I am deſirous your Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aking for the great event that was to decide the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Edmund, his enemies, at the Caſtle of Lovel, were brought to ſhame for their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to him.</p>
            <p>The diſagreement between Wenlock and Markham had by degrees broug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> on an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of ſome part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of their conduct. Father Oſwald had often hinted to the Baron, Wenlock's envy of Edmund's ſuperior quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the artifices by which he had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch an influence with Sir Robert, as to
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:032742_0128_0FF4D44D5825ABD0"/>
make him take his part upon all occaſions. Oſwald now took advantage of the breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two incendiaries, to perſuade Markham to juſtify himſelf at Wenlock's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and to tell all he knew of his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: at length he promiſed to declare all he knew of Wenlock's conduct, as well in France as ſince their return, when he ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon: and, by him, Oſwald was enabled to unravel the whole of his contrivances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the honour, intereſt, and even life of Edmund.</p>
            <p>He prevailed on Hewſon, and Kemp, his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate, to add their teſtimony to the others. Hewſon confeſſed that he was touched in his conſcience, when he reflected on the cruelty and injuſtice of his behaviour to Edmund, whoſe behaviour towards him, after he had laid a ſnare for his life, was ſo noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that he was cut to the heart by it, and had ſuffered ſo much pain and remorſe, that he longed for nothing ſo much as an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to unburthen his mind; but the dread of Mr. Wenlock's anger, and the effects of his reſentment, had hitherto kept him ſilent, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways hoping there would come a time, when he might have leave to declare the whole truth.</p>
            <p>Oſwald conveyed this information to the Baron's ear, who waited for an opportunity to make the proper uſe of it. Not long after, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> two principal incendiaries came to an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="130" facs="unknown:032742_0129_0FF50BFB4FE2E118"/>
that he would ſhew his uncle what a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent he had harboured in his boſom. The Baron arreſted his words, and inſiſted upon his telling all he knew; adding, if you ſpeak the truth, I will ſupport you; but if you prove falſe, I will puniſh you ſeverely: As to Mr. Wenlock, he ſhall have a fair trial; and if all the accuſations I have heard are made good, it is high time I ſhould put him out of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. The Baron with a ſtern aſpect, bade them follow him into the great hall; and ſent for all the reſt of the family together.</p>
            <p>He then, with great ſolemnity, told them he was ready to hear all ſides of the queſtion. He declared the whole ſubſtance of his infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, and called upon the accuſers to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the charge. Hewſon and Kemp gave the ſame account they had done to Oſwald, offering to ſwear to the truth of their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; ſeveral of the other ſervants related ſuch circumſtances as had come to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.

and ardently wiſhed to know what was become of him.</p>
            <p>Sir Robert took the opportunity of coming to an explanation with his brother William; he took ſhame to himſelf for ſome part of his paſt behaviour. Mr. William owned his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to Edmund, and juſtified it by his merit and attachment to him, which were ſuch, that he was certain no time or diſtance could after them. He accepted his brother's acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, as a full amends for all that had paſſed, and begged that henceforward an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire love and confidence might ſubſiſt between them. Theſe new regulations reſtored peace, confidence, and harmony, in the Caſtle of Lovel.</p>
            <p>At length, the day arrived for the comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to meet. The Lord Graham, with twelve followers, gentlemen, and twelve ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, was ready at the dawn of day to receive them.</p>
            <p>The firſt that entered the field was Sir Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Harclay, Knight, armed completely, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting his head-piece; Hugh Rugby, his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, bearing his lance; John Bernard, his page, carrying his helmet and ſpurs; and two ſervants in his proper livery. The next came Edmund, the heir of Lovel, followed by his ſervant, John Wyatt; Zadiſky followed by his ſervant.</p>
            <p>At a ſhort diſtance came the Lord Clifford, as judge of the field, with his Eſquire, two
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:032742_0133_0FF50C5C08553978"/>
pages, and two livery ſervants; followed by his eldeſt ſon, his nephew, and a gentleman his friend, each attended by one ſervant: He alſo brought a ſurgeon of note, to take care of the wounded.</p>
            <p>The Lord Graham ſaluted them; and, by his order, they took their places without the liſts, and the trumpet ſounded for the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenger. It was anſwered by the defendant, who ſoon after appeared, attended by three gentlemen, his friends, with each one his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, beſide his own proper attendants.</p>
            <p>A place was erected for Lord Clifford, as judge of the field; he deſired Lord Graham would ſhare the office, who accepted it, on condition that the combatants ſhould make no objection; and they agreed to it with the greateſt courteſy and reſpect. They conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together on many points of honour and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony between the two combatants.</p>
            <p>They appointed a marſhal of the field, and other inferior officers, uſually employed on theſe occaſions. The Lord Graham ſent the marſhal for the challenger, deſiring him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the cauſe of his quarrel before his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Sir Philip Harclay then advanced, and thus ſpoke:</p>
            <p>
               <q>I, Philip Harclay, Knight, challenge Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, commonly called Lord Lovel, as a baſe, treacherous, and bloody man, who, by his wicked arts and devices, did kill, or cauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o be killed, his kinſman, Arthur Lord Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, my dear and noble friend. I am cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:032742_0134_0FF50C6B43116680"/>
upon, in an extraordinary manner, to revenge his death; and I will prove the truth of what I have affirmed at the peril of my life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Lord Graham then bade the defendant an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the charge. Lord Lovel ſtood forth before his followers, and thus replied:</p>
            <p>
               <q>I, Walter, Baron of Lovel, do deny the charge againſt me, and affirm it to be a baſe, falſe, and malicious accuſation of this Sir Philip Harclay, which I believe to be invented of himſelf, or elſe framed by ſome enemy, and told to him for wicked ends; but, be that as it may, I will maintain my own honour, and prove him to be a falſe traitor, at the hazard of my own life, and to the puniſhment of his preſumption</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then ſaid the Lord Graham,—Will not this quarrel admit of arbitration? No, replied Sir Philip; when I have juſtified this charge, I have more to bring againſt him. I truſt in God and the juſtice of my cauſe, and defy that traitor to then death! Lord Clifford then ſpoke a few words to Lord Graham, who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately called to the marſhal, and bade him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the liſts, and deliver their weapons to the combatants.</p>
            <p>While the marſhal was arranging the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants and their followers, Edmund ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached his friend and patron; he put one knee to the ground, he embraced his knees, with the ſtrongeſt emotions of grief and anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He was dreſſed in compleat armour, with
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:032742_0135_0FF50C7BA0869578"/>
his viſor down; his device was a hawthorn, with a graft of the roſe upon it, the motto—THIS IS NOT MY TRUE PARENT; but Sir Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip bade him take theſe words—E FRUCTU ARBOR COGNOSCITUR.</p>
            <p>Sir Philip embraced the youth with ſtrong marks of affection: Be compoſed, my child! ſaid he: I have neither guilt, fear, nor doubt in me; I am ſo certain of ſucceſs, that I bid you be prepared for the conſequence. Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſky embraced his friend, he comforted Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund, he ſuggeſted every thing that could confirm his hopes of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>The marſhal waited to deliver the ſpear to Sir Philip; he now preſented it with the uſual form.—Sir, receive your lance, and God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the right!—Sir Philip anſwered, Amen! in a voice that was heard by all preſent.</p>
            <p>He next preſented his weapon to Lord Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, with the ſame ſentence, who likewiſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Amen! with a good courage. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the liſts were cleared, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants began the fight.</p>
            <p>They contended a long time, with equal ſkill and courage; at length, Sir Philip un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſed his antagoniſt. The judges ordered, that either he ſhould alight, or ſuffer his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to re-mount; he choſe the former, and a ſhort combat on foot enſued. The ſweat ran off their bodies with the violence of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. Sir Philip watched every motion of his enemy, and ſtrove to weary him out, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:032742_0136_0FF50C8BAC3323C8"/>
to wound but not to kill him, unleſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged for his own ſafety.</p>
            <p>He thruſt his ſword through his left arm, and demanded, whether he would confeſs the fact? Lord Lovel enraged, anſwered, he would die ſooner. Sir Philip then paſſed the ſword through his body twice, and Lord Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel fell, crying out that he was ſlain.</p>
            <p>I hope not, ſaid Sir Philip, for I have a great deal of buſineſs for you to do before you die. Confeſs your ſins, and endeavour to atone for them, as the only ground to hope for pardon.—Lord Lovel replied, You are the victor, uſe your good fortune generouſly!</p>
            <p>Sir Philip took his ſword, and then waved it over his head, and beckoned for aſſiſtance. The judges ſent to beg Sir Philip to ſpare the life of his enemy.—I will, ſaid he, upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he will make an honeſt confeſſion.</p>
            <p>Lord Lovel deſired a ſurgeon and a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.—You ſhall have both, ſaid Sir Philip; But you muſt firſt anſwer me a queſtion or two. Did you kill your kinſman or not?—It was not my hand that killed him, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the wounded man.—It was done by your own order, however? You ſhall have no aſſiſtance till you anſwer this point.—It was, ſaid he, and Heaven is juſt!—Bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs all preſent, ſaid Sir Philip: he confeſſes the fact!</p>
            <p>He then beckoned Edmund, who approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—Take off your helmet, ſaid he: look on
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:032742_0137_0FF50C9BF12BD078"/>
that youth, he is the ſon of your injured kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.—It is himſelf! ſaid the Lord Lovel, and ſainted away.</p>
            <p>Sir Philip then called for a ſurgeon and a prieſt, both of which Lord Graham had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided: the former began to bind up his wounds, and his aſſiſtants poured a cordial into his mouth.—Preſerve his life, if it be poſſible, ſaid Sir Philip; for much depends upon it.</p>
            <p>He then took Edmund by the hand, and preſented him to all the company.—In this young man, ſaid he, you ſee the true heir of the houſe of Lovel! Heaven has in its own way made him the inſtrument to diſcover the death of his parents. His father was aſſaſſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by order of that wicked man, who now receives his puniſhment; his mother was, by his cruel treatment, compelled to leave her own houſe; ſhe was delivered in the fields, and periſhed herſelf in ſeeking a ſhelter for her infant. I have ſufficient proof of every thing I ſay, which I am ready to communicate to every perſon who deſires to know the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; Heaven, by my hand, has chaſtiſed him: he has confeſſed the fact I accuſe him of, and it remains that he make reſtitution of the fortune and honour he hath uſurped ſo long.</p>
            <p>Edmund kneeled, and with uplifted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> returned thanks to heaven, that his noble friend and champion was crowned with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>—The Lords and gentlemen gathered
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:032742_0138_0FF50CA9F671BA98"/>
round them, they congratulated them both; while Lord Lovel's friends and followers were employed in taking care of him. Lord Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford took Sir Philip's hand.—You have acted with ſo much honour and prudence, that it is preſumptuous to offer you advice; but what mean you to do with the wounded man?—I have not determined, ſaid he; I thank you for the hint, and bog your advice how to proceed.—Let us conſult Lord Graham, replied he.—Lord Graham inſiſted upon their going all to his caſtle; there, ſaid he, you will have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial witneſſes of all that paſſes. Sir Philip was unwilling to give ſo much trouble. The Lord Graham proteſted he ſhould be proud to do any ſervice to ſo noble a gentleman. Lord Clifford enforced his requeſt, ſaying, it was better upon all accounts to keep their priſoner on this ſide the borders till they ſaw what turn his health would take, and to keep him ſafely till he ſettled his worldly affairs.</p>
            <p>This reſolution being taken, Lord Graham invited the wounded man and his friends to his caſtle, as being the neareſt place where he could be lodged and taken proper care of, it being dangerous to carry him any further. They accepted the propoſal with many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments; having made a kind of litter of boughs, they all proceeded to Lord Graham's caſtle, where they put Lord Lovel to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, and the ſurgeon dreſſed his wounds and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> he might be kept quiet, not knowing at preſent whether they were dangerous or not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="unknown:032742_0139_0FF50CB6859EB880"/>
About an hour after, the wounded man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of thirſt; he aſked for the ſurgeon, and inquired if his life was in danger? The ſurgeon anſwered him doubtfully. He aſked—Where is Sir Philip Harclay?—In the caſtle—Where is that young man whom he calls the heir of Lovel?—He is here, too.—Then I am ſurrounded with my enemies. I want to ſpeak to one of my own ſervants, without witneſſes; let one be ſent to me.</p>
            <p>The ſurgeon withdrew, and acquainted the gentlemen below.—He ſhall not ſpeak to any man, ſaid Sir Philip, but in my preſence. He went with him into the ſick man's room. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſight of Sir Philip, he ſeemed in great agitation.—Am I not allowed to ſpeak with my own ſervant, ſaid he?—Yes, Sir, you may; but not without witneſſes.—Then I am a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner it ſeems.—No, not ſo, Sir; but ſome caution is neceſſary at preſent: But compoſe yourſelf, I do not wiſh for your death.—Then why did you ſeek it? I never injured you.—Yes, you have, in the perſon of my friend, and I am only the inſtrument of juſtice in the hand of Heaven; endeavour to make atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment while life is ſpared to you.—Shall I ſend the prieſt to you? perhaps he may convince you of the neceſſity of reſtitution, in order to obtain forgiveneſs of your ſins.</p>
            <p>Sir Philip ſent for the prieſt and the ſurgeon, and obliged the ſervant to retire with him. I leave you, Sir, to the care of theſe gentlemen; and whenever a third perſon is admitted, I
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:032742_0140_0FF50CC5676A60B8"/>
will be his attendant: I will viſit you again within an hour. He then retired, and conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his friends below: they were of opinion that no time ſhould be loſt.—You will then, ſaid he, accompany me into the ſick man's apartment in an hour's time.</p>
            <p>Within the hour, Sir Philip, attended by Lord Clifford and Lord Graham, entered the chamber. Lord Lovel was in great emotion; the prieſt ſtood on one ſide of the bed, the the ſurgeon on the other; the former exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to confeſs his ſins, the other deſired he might be left to his repoſe. Lord Lovel ſeemed in great anguiſh of mind; he trembled and was in the utmoſt confuſion. Sir Philip entreated him with the Piety of a confeſſor, to conſider his ſoul's health before that of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. He then aſked Sir Philip, by what means he knew that he was concerned in the death of his kinſman?—Sir, replied he, it was not merely by human means this fact was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. There is a certain apartment in the Caſtle of Lovel, that has been ſhut up theſe one-and-twenty years, but has lately been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened and examined into.</p>
            <p>Oh Heaven! exclaimed he, then Geoffry muſt have betrayed me!—No, Sir, he has not, it was revealed in a very extraordinary manner to that youth whom it moſt concerns.—How can he be the heir of Lovel?—By be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſon of that unfortunate woman, whom you cruelly obliged to leave her own houſe, to avoid being compelled to wed the murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:032742_0141_0FF50CE4618AB738"/>
of her huſband: we are not ignorant, moreover, of the fictitious funeral you made for her. All is diſcovered, and you will not tell us any more than we know already; but we deſire to have it confirmed by your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. The judgments of Heaven are fallen upon me! ſaid Lord Lovel. I am childleſs, and one is ariſen from the grave to claim my inheritance.—Nothing, then, hinders you to do juſtice and make reſtitution; it is for the eaſe of your conſcience; and you have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of making atonement for all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief you have done.—You know too much, ſaid the criminal, and I will relate what you do not know.</p>
            <p>You may remember, proceeded he, that I ſaw you once at my uncle's houſe?—I well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.—At that time my mind was diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the baleful paſſion of envy; it was from that root all my bad actions ſprung.—Praiſe be to God! ſaid the good prieſt, he hath touched your heart with true contrition, and you ſhew the good effect of his mercies; you will do juſtice, and you will be rewarded by the gift of repentance unto ſalvation.—Sir Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip deſired the penitent to proceed.</p>
            <p>My kinſman excelled me in every kind of merit, in the graces of perſon and mind, in all his exerciſes, and in every accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I was totally eclipſed by him, and I hated to be in his company; but what finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my averſion, was his addreſſing the lady upon whom I had fixed my affections: I ſtrove
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:032742_0142_0FF50CE77927AB08"/>
to rival him there, but ſhe gave him the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that indeed, was only his due; but I could not bear to ſee, or acknowledge it.</p>
            <p>The moſt bitter hatred took poſſeſſion of my breaſt, and I avowed to revenge the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed injury, as ſoon as opportunity ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. I buried my reſentment deep in my heart, and outwardly appeared to rejoice at his ſucceſs; I made a merit of reſigning my pretenſions to him, but I could not bear to be preſent at his nuptials; I returned to my father's ſeat, and brooded over my revenge in ſecret. My father died this year, and ſoon after my uncle followed him; within another year my kinſman was ſummoned to attend the King on his Welſh expedition.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I heard he was gone from home, I reſolved to prevent his return, exulting in the proſpect of poſſeſſing his title, fortune, and his Lady. I hired meſſengers, who were conſtantly going and coming, to give me intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of all that paſſed at the caſtle; I went there ſoon after, under pretence of viſiting my kinſman. My ſpies brought me an account of all that happened; one informed me of the event of the battle, but could not tell whether my rival was living or dead; I hoped the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that I might avoid the crime I meditated; I reported his death to his Lady, who took it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> heavily.</p>
            <p>Soon after a meſſenger arrived with tidings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at he was alive and well, and had obtained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ave to return home immediately.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="unknown:032742_0143_0FF50D0352B3F6C0"/>
I inſtantly diſpatched my two emiſſaries, to intercept him on the way. He made ſo much haſte to return, that he was met within a mile of his own caſtle: he had out rode his ſervants, and was alone: They killed him, and drew him aſide out of the highway. They then came to me with all ſpeed, and deſired my orders; it was then about ſunſet: I ſent them back to fetch the dead body, which they brought privately into the caſtle: They tied it neck and heels, and put it into a trunk, which they buried under the floor in the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet you mentioned. The ſight of the body ſtung me to the heart; I then felt the pangs of remorſe, but it was too late: I took every precaution that prudence ſuggeſted, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the diſcovery; but nothing can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the eye of Heaven.</p>
            <p>From that fatal hour, I have never known peace, always in fear of ſomething impending to diſcover my guilt, and to bring me to ſhame: at length I am overtaken by juſtice. I am brought to a ſevere reckoning here, and I dread to meet one more ſevere hereafter.</p>
            <p>Enough, ſaid the prieſt; you have done a good work, my ſon! truſt in the Lord; and now this burden is off your mind, the reſt will be made eaſy to you.</p>
            <p>Lord Lovel took a minute's repoſe, and then went on.—I hope by the hint you gave, Sir Philip, the poor Lady is yet alive?—No, Sir, ſhe is not: but ſhe died not till after ſhe brought forth a ſon, whom Heaven made its
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:032742_0144_0FF50D12A750AAB0"/>
inſtrument to diſcover and avenge the death of both his parents.—They are well avenged! ſaid he. I have no children to lament for me; all mine have been taken from me in the bloom of youth; only one daughter lived to be twelve years old; I intended her for a wiſe for one of my nephews, but within three months I have buried her. He ſighed, wept; and was ſilent.</p>
            <p>The gentlemen preſent, lifted up their hands and eyes to heaven in ſilence. The will of Heaven be obeyed! ſaid the prieſt. My penitent hath confeſſed all: what more would you require?—That he make atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſaid Sir Philip; that he ſurrender the title and eſtate to the right heir, and diſpoſe of his own proper fortune to his neareſt rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and reſign himſelf to penitence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for a future ſtate. For this time I leave him with you, father, and will join my prayers with yours for his repentance.</p>
            <p>So, ſaying, he left the room, and was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Barons and ſurgeon; the prieſt alone remaining with him. As ſoon as they were out of hearing, Sir Philip queſtioned the ſurgeon concerning his patient's ſituation; who anſwered, that at preſent, he ſaw no ſings of immediate danger, but he could not yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that there was none: If he were mortally wounded, ſaid he, he could not be ſo well, nor ſpeak ſo long without faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and, it is my opinion, that he will ſoon
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:032742_0145_0FF50D1F91BD4E38"/>
recover, if nothing happens to retard the cure. Then, ſaid Sir Philip, keep this opinion from him; for I would ſuffer the fear of death to operate on him, until he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſome neceſſary acts of juſtice: Let it only be known to theſe noblemen, upon whoſe honour I can rely, and I truſt they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove my requeſt to you, Sir.—I join in it, ſaid Lord Clifford, from the ſame motives.—I inſiſt upon it, ſaid Lord Graham; and I can anſwer for my ſurgeon's diſcretion.—My Lords, ſaid the ſurgeon, you may de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>end on my fidelity; and, after what I have juſt heard, my conſcience is engaged in this noble gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's behalf, and I will do every thing in my power to ſecond your intentions.—I thank you, Sir, ſaid Sir Philip, and you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on my gratitude in return. I preſume you will ſit up with him to-night: if any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhould ariſe, I deſire to be called imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; but, otherwiſe, I would ſuffer him to reſt quietly, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> may be prepared for the buſineſs of the following day.—I ſhall obey your directions, Sir, my neceſſary attendance will give me a pretence not to leave him, and thus I ſhall hear all that paſſes between him and all that viſit him.—You will oblige me highly, ſaid Sir Philip, and I ſhall go to reſt with confidence in your care.</p>
            <p>The ſurgeon returned to the ſick man's chamber, Sir Philip and the Baron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="147" facs="unknown:032742_0146_0FF50D211C24AA88"/>
combat. Sir Philip and his Edmund retired to their repoſe, being heartily fatigued; and the company ſtayed to a late hour, comment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the action of the day, praiſing the courage and generoſity of the noble Knight, and wiſhing a good event to his undertaking.</p>
            <p>Moſt of Lord Lovel's friends went away as ſoon as they ſaw him ſafely lodged, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of him, and of their appearance in his behalf; and the few that ſtayed were induced by their deſire of a further information of the baſe action he had committed, and to juſtify their own characters and conduct.</p>
            <p>The next morning, Sir Philip entered into conſultation with the two Barons, on the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods he ſhould take to get Edmund received and acknowledged as heir of the houſe of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. They were all of opinion, that the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſhould be kept in fear till he had ſettled his worldly affairs, and they had reſolved how to diſpoſe of him. With this determination, they entered his room, and inquired of the ſurgeon how he had paſſed the night? He ſhook his head, and ſaid but little.</p>
            <p>Lord Lovel deſired that he might be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his own houſe. Lord Graham ſaid, he could not conſent to that, as there was evident danger in removing him; and appealed to the ſurgeon, who confirmed his opinion. Lord Graham deſired he would make himſelf eaſy, and that he ſhould have every kind of aſſiſtance there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="unknown:032742_0147_0FF50D326A12EF60"/>
Sir Philip then propoſed to ſend for the Lord Fitz-Owen, who would ſee that all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble care was taken of his brother-in-law, and would aſſiſt him in ſettling his affairs. Lord Lovel was againſt it; he was peeviſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy, and deſired to be left with only his own ſervants to attend him. Sir Philip quitted the room with a ſignificant look: and the two Lords endeavoured to reconcile him to his ſituation. He interrupted them.—It is eaſy for men in your ſituation to adviſe, but it is difficult for one in mine to practice; wounded in body and mind, it is natural that I ſhould ſtrive to avoid the extremes of ſhame and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment: I thank you for your kind offices, and beg I may be left with my own ſervants—With them, and the ſurgeon, you ſhall, ſaid Lord Graham; and they both retired.</p>
            <p>Sir Philip met them below.—My Lords, ſaid he, I am deſirous that my Lord Fitz-Owen ſhould be ſent for, and that he may hear his brother's confeſſion; for I ſuſpect that he may hereafter deny, what only the fear of death has extorted from him: with your permiſſion, I am determinined to ſend meſſengers to day. They both expreſſed their approbation, and Lord Clifford propoſed to write to him, ſaying, a letter from an imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al perſon will have the more weight: I will ſend one of my principal domeſtics with your own. This meaſure being reſolved upon, Lord Clifford retired to write, and Sir Philip to prepare his ſervants for inſtant departure. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund

deſired leave to write to father Oſwald, and John Wyatt was ordered to be the bearer of his letter. When the Lord Clifford had finiſhed his letter, he read it to Sir Philip and his choſen friends, as follows:</p>

                  <p>I have taken upon me to acquaint your Lordſhip, that there has been a ſolemn combat at arms between your brother-in-law, the Lord Lovel, and Sir Philip Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay, Knt. of Yorkſhire. It was fought in the juriſdiction of the Lord Graham, who, with myſelf, was appointed judge of the field; it was fairly won, and Sir Philip is the conqueror. After he had gained the victory, he declared at large the cauſe of the quarrel, and that he had revenged the death of Arthur Lord Lovel, his friend, whom the preſent Lord Lovel had aſſaſſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, that he might enjoy his title and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. The wounded man confeſſed the fact: and Sir Philip gave him his life, and only carried off his ſword as a trophy of his victory. Both the victor and the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed were conveyed to Lord Graham's caſtle, where the Lord Lovel now lies in great danger. He is deſirous to ſettle his worldly affairs, and to make his peace with God and man. Sir Philip Harclay ſays, there is a male heir of the houſe of Lovel, for whom he claims the title and eſtate: but he is very deſirous that your

Let me entreat you, on the receipt of this letter, to ſet out imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately for Lord Graham's caſtle, where you will be received with the utmoſt reſpect and hoſpitality. You will hear things that will ſurpriſe you as much as they do me; you will judge of them with that juſtice and honour that ſpeaks your character; and you will unite with us in wondering at the ways of Providence, and ſubmitting to its decrees, in puniſhing the guilty, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtice to the innocent and oppreſſed.

            <p>Lord Fitz-Owen was in the parlour with his children. Father Oſwald was walking in the avenue before the houſe, when he ſaw three meſſengers, whoſe horſes ſeemed jaded and the riders fatigued, like men come a long journey.

               </gap>.—You are come in good time, ſaid the Baron. Read that letter, that my children may know the contents. He read it with faultering voice, and trembling limbs.

Sir Robert exclaimed—Is it poſſible? can my uncle be guilty of ſuch an action?—You hear, ſaid the Baron, he has confeſſed it!—But to whom? ſaid Sir Robert.—His father replied, Lord Clifford's honour is unqueſtionable, and I cannot doubt what he affirms.</p>

               </gap> Sir Philip Harclay long ago promiſed him his friendſhip? Edmund diſappears; and, ſoon after, this man chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges my Uncle. You know what paſſed here before his departure: he has ſuggeſted this affair to Sir Philip, and inſtigated him to this action. This is the return he has made for the favours he has received from our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, to which he owes every thing.—Softly, my ſon! ſaid the Baron; let us be cautious of reflecting upon Edmund: there is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hand in this buſineſs.

the boſom friend of the deceaſed. The my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of that apartment is diſcloſed, the woe to the guilty is accompliſhed; there is no reflection upon any one; Heaven effects its purpoſes in its own time and manner. I and mine are innocent; let us worſhip, and be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent!</p>
            <p>But what do you propoſe to do? ſaid Sir Robert.—To return with the meſſengers, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Baron. I think it highly proper that I ſhould ſee your Uncle, and hear what he has to ſay: My children are his heirs; in juſtice to them, I ought to be acquainted with every thing that concerns the diſpoſal of his fortune.—Your Lordſhip is in the right, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Sir Robert, it concerns us all. I have only to aſk your permiſſion to bear you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.—With all my heart, ſaid the Baron: I have only to aſk of you in return, that you will command yourſelf, and not ſpeak your mind haſtily; wait for the proofs before you give judgment, and take advice of your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon before you decide upon any thing: If you reflect upon the paſt, you will have reaſon to diſtruſt yourſelf. Leave all to me, and be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured I will protect your honour and my own.

            <p>As ſoon as he was gone, Mr. William broke ſilence.—My Lord, ſaid he, if you have no great objection, I beg leave alſo to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny you both.—You ſhall, my ſon, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

My ſon Walter ſhall be his ſiſter's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector in our abſence, and he ſhall be maſter here till we return.—I hope, my dear father, that will not be long; I ſhall not be happy till you come home, ſaid the fair Emma—It ſhall be no longer, my deareſt, than till this untoward affair is ſettled. The Baron de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know when the meſſengers were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to return. Oſwald took this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to retire; he went to his own apartment, and read the letter as follows:</p>

            <p>Oſwald then went to the meſſengers; he drew John Wyatt to a diſtance from the reſt, and got the information he wanted: he ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him till he was ſent for by the Baron, to whom he went directly and prevented his queſtions, by ſaying,—I have been talking with the meſſengers; I find they have travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led night and day to bring the letters with all ſpeed; they only require one night's reſt, and will be ready to ſet out with you to-morrow.—'Tis well, ſaid the Baron; we will ſet out as ſoon as they are ready.—My Lord, ſaid Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald, I have a favour to beg of you; it is that I may attend you: I have ſeen the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of this wonderful diſcovery, and I have a great deſire to ſee the concluſion of it; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps my preſence may be of ſervice in the courſe of your buſineſs.—Perhaps it may, ſaid the Baron; I have no objection, if you deſire to go.—They then ſeparated, and went to prepare for their journey.</p>

my laſt remains of life and ſtrength, to help my young Lord to his right and title; but do they not begin to ſuſpect who is the heir of Lovel?—Not in the leaſt, ſaid Oſwald; they think him concerned in the diſcovery, but have no idea of his being intereſted in the event.—Oh, father! ſaid Joſeph, I ſhall think every day a week till you return; but I will no longer keep you from your repoſe.—Good night, ſaid Oſwald; but I have another viſit to pay before I go to reſt.</p>
            <p>He left Joſeph, and went on tip-toe to Mr. William's room, and tapped at his door: he came and opened it.—What news, father?—Not much; I have only orders to tell you that Edmund is well, and as much your friend as ever.—I gueſſed, ſaid William, that we ſhould hear ſomething of him: I have ſtill another gueſs.—What is that my child? That we ſhall ſee or hear of him where we are going.—It is very likely, ſaid Oſwald; and I would have you be prepared for it: I am confident we ſhall hear nothing to his diſcredit.—I am certain of that, ſaid William, and I rejoice to ſee him: I conclude that he is under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Sir Philip Harclay.—He is ſo, ſaid Oſwald; I had my information from Sir Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip's ſervant, who is one of the meſſengers, and was guide to the others in their way hither—Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome further converſation they ſeparated, and each went to his repoſe.</p>
            <p>The next morning the whole party ſet out on their journey; they travelled by eaſy ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

on account of the Baron's health, which began to be impaired, and arrived in health and ſpirits at the caſtle of Lord Graham, where they were received with the utmoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and kindneſs by the noble Maſter.</p>
            <p>The Lord Lovel had recovered his health and ſtrength as much as poſſible in the time, and was impatient to be gone from thence to his own houſe. He was ſurpriſed to hear of the arrival of his brother and nephews, and expreſſed no pleaſure at the thoughts of ſeeing them. When Sir Philip Harclay came to pay his reſpects to Baron Fitz-Owen, the latter received him with civility, but with a cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that was apparent. Sir Robert left the room, doubting his reſolution. Sir Philip advanced, and took the Baron by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the cauſe of his reſentment againſt the Lord Lovel till the day of combat, that he might not prepoſſeſs the judges againſt him. He enlarged on his humanity to the vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on the deſire he expreſſed to have juſtice done to his heirs: finally, he mentioned his great reſpect for the Lord Fitz-Owen, and the ſolicitude he ſhewed to have him come to ſettle the eſtate of the ſick man in favour of his children.

            <p>Sir Philip then came forward.—My Lords, I ſhall take no notice of what this unhappy man has juſt now ſaid; I ſhall appeal to you, as to the honourable witneſſes of all that has paſſed: You ſee it was no more than neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I appeal to you for the motives of my treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him, before, at, and after our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I did not take his life, as I might have done; I wiſhed him to repent of his ſins, and to make reſtitution of what he unjuſtly poſſeſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. I was called out to do an act of juſtice; I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ad taken the heir of Lovel under my protection, my chief view was to ſee juſtice done to him; what regarded this man was but a ſecondary motive. This was my end, and I will never, never loſe ſight of it.</p>
            <p>Lord Lovel ſeemed almoſt choaked with paſſion, to ſee every one giving ſome mark of approbation and reſpect to Sir Philip. He called out,—I demand to know who is this pretended heir, whom he brings out to cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> my title and fortune?—My noble auditors, ſaid Sir Philip, I ſhall appeal to your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in regard to the proofs of my ward's birth and family; every circumſtance ſhall be laid before you, and you ſhall decide upon them.</p>
            <p>

Here is a young man, ſuppoſed the ſon of a peaſant, who, by a train of circumſtances that could not have happened by human con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, diſcovers not only who were his real parents, but that they came to untimely deaths. He even diſcovers the different places where their bones are buried, both out of conſecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ground, and appeals to their aſhes for the truth of his pretenſions. He has alſo living proofs to offer, that will convince the moſt incredulous. I have deferred entering into particulars, till the arrival of Baron Fitz-Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en: I know his noble heart and honourable character, from one that has long been an eye-witneſs of his goodneſs; ſuch is the opinion I have of his juſtice, that I will accept him as one of the judges in his brother's cauſe. I and my ward will bring our proofs before him, and the company here preſent; in the courſe of them, it will appear that he is the beſt qualified of any to judge of them, becauſe he can aſcertain many of the facts we ſhall have occaſion to mention: I will reſt our cauſe upon their deciſion.</p>
            <p>Lord Graham applauded Sir Philip's appeal, affirming his own impartiality, and calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Lord Clifford and his ſons, and alſo his own nephew who were preſent. Lord Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſaid, Sir Philip offers fairly, and like himſelf; there can be no place nor perſons more impartial than the preſent, and I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Lord Lovel can have no objection.—No objection! anſwered he; what, to be
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:032742_0160_0FF50D9524495650"/>
tried like a criminal, to have judges appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over me, to decide upon my right to my own eſtate and title? I will not ſubmit to ſuch a jurisdiction!—Then, ſaid Sir Philip, you had rather be tried by the laws of the land, and have them pronounce ſentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you? Take your choice, Sir; if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the one, you ſhall be certain of the other. Lord Clifford then ſaid,—You will allow Lord Lovel to conſider of the propoſal; he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult his friends, and be determined by their advice. Lord Fitz-Owen ſaid—I am very much ſurprized at what I have heard. I ſhould be glad to know all that Sir Philip Harclay has to ſay for his ward, that I may judge what my brother has to hope or fear; I will then give my beſt advice, or offer my mediation, as he may ſtand in need of them.—You ſay well, replied Lord Graham; and pray let us come directly to the point: Sir Philip, you will introduce your ward to this company, and enter upon your proofs.</p>
            <p>Sir Philip bowed to the company; he went out and brought in Edmund, encouraging him by the way; he preſented him to Baron Fitz-Owen, who looked very ſerious—Edmund Twyford, ſaid he, are you the heir of the houſe of Lovel?—I am, my Lord, ſaid Edmund, bowing to the ground; the proofs will appear; but I am at the ſame time, the moſt humble and grateful of all your ſervants, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

and was going to leave the room.—Son Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, ſtay, ſaid the Baron: If there is any fraud, you will be pleaſed to detect it, and if all that is affirmed be true, you will not ſhut your eyes againſt the light: you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this buſineſs: hear it in ſilence, and let reaſon be arbiter in your cauſe. He bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his father, bit his lip, and retired to the window. William nodded to Edmund, and was ſilent. All the company had their eyes fixed on the young man, who ſtood in the midſt, caſting down his eyes with modeſt reſpect to the audience: while Sir Philip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated all the material circumſtances of his life, the wonderful gradation by which he came to the knowledge of his birth, the adventures of the haunted apartment, the diſcovery of the fatal cloſet, and the preſumptive proofs that Lord Lovel was buried there. At this part of his narration, Lord Fitz-Owen interrupted him—Where is this cloſet you talk of? for I and my ſons went over the apartment ſince Edmund's departure, and found no ſuch place as you deſcribe.—My Lord, ſaid Edmund, I can account for it; the door is covered with tapeſtry, the ſame as the room, and you might eaſily overlook it; but I have a witneſs here, ſaid he, and putting his hand into his boſom, he drew out the key. If this is not the key of that cloſet, let me be deemed an impoſtor, and all I ſay a falſehood; I will riſk my pretenſions upon this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>of.</p>
            <p>And for what purpoſe did you take it away!
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:032742_0162_0FF50DB75BA4D010"/>
ſaid the Baron.—To prevent any perſon from going into it, replied Edmund; I have vowed to keep it till I ſhall open the cloſet before witneſſes appointed for that purpoſe.—Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, Sir, ſaid the Baron Fitz-Owen.—Sir Philip then related the converſation between Edmund and Margery Twyford, his ſuppoſed mother.—Lord Fitz-Owen ſeemed in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſurpriſe: He exclaimed,—Can this be true? ſtrange diſcovery! unfortunate child—Edmund's tears bore witneſs to his veracity; he was obliged to hide his face, he lifted up his claſped hands to heaven, and was in great emotions during all this part of the relation; while Lord Lovel groaned, and ſeemed in great agitation.</p>
            <p>Sir Philip then addreſſed himſelf to Lord Fitz-Owen. My Lord, there was another perſon preſent at the converſation between Edmund and his foſter-mother, who can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all that paſſed; perhaps your Lordſhip can tell who that was?—It was father Oſwald, replied the Baron; I well remember that he went with him at his requeſt; let him be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in. He was ſent for, and came immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. The Baron deſired him to relate all that paſſed between Edmund and his mother.</p>
            <p>Oſwald then began. Since I am now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called upon to teſtify what I know con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this young man, I will ſpeak the truth, without fear or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>our of any one; and I will ſwear by the rules of my holy order, to the truth of what I ſhall relate. He then gave a
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:032742_0163_0FF50DC73B7D08D0"/>
particular account of all that paſſed on that occaſion, and mentioned the tokens found on both the infant and his mother.—Where are theſe tokens to be ſeen? ſaid the Lord Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.—I have them here, my Lord, ſaid Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund, and I keep them as my greateſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. He then produced them before all the company.—There is no appearance of any fraud or colluſion, ſaid Lord Graham: if any man thinks he ſees any, let him ſpeak.—Pray, my Lord, ſuffer me to ſpeak a word, ſaid Sir Robert. Do you remember that I hinted my ſuſpicions concerning father Oſwald, the night our kinſman lay in the eaſt apartment?—I do, ſaid the Baron.—Well, Sir, it now appears that he did know more than he would tell us; you find he is very deep in all Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund's ſecrets, and you may judge what were his motives for undertaking this journey.—I obſerve what you ſay, anſwered his father, but let us hear all that Oſwald has to ſay: I will be as impartial as poſſible.—My Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Oſwald, I beg you alſo to recollect what I ſaid, on the night your ſon ſpeaks of, concerning ſecrecy in certain matters.—I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that alſo, ſaid the Baron; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.—My Lord, continued Oſwald, I knew more than I thought myſelf at liberty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe at that time, but I will now tell you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing. I ſaw there was ſomething more than common in the accidents that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>efel this young man, and in his being called out to ſleep in the eaſt apartment; I earneſtly deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

him to let me be with him on the ſecond night, to which he conſented reluctantly; we heard a great noiſe in the rooms underneath, we went down ſtairs together, I ſaw him open the fatal cloſet, I heard groans that pierced me to the heart, I kneeled down and prayed for the repoſe of the ſpirit departed; I found a ſeal, with the arms of Lovel engraven upon it, which I gave to Edmund, and he now has it in his poſſeſſion: He enjoined me to keep ſecret what I had ſeen and heard, till the time ſhould come to declare it. I conceived that I was called to be a witneſs of theſe things; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, my curioſity was excited to know the event; I, therefore, deſired to be preſent at the interview between him and his mother, which was affecting beyond expreſſion; I heard what I have now declared as nearly as my memory permits me. I hope no impartial perſon will blame me for any part of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; but if they ſhould, I do not repent it: If I ſhould forfeit the favour of the rich and great, I ſhall have acquitted myſelf to God and my conſcience. I have no worldly ends to anſwer; I plead the cauſe of the injured orphan; and I think, alſo, that I ſecond the deſigns of Providence.—You have well ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, father, ſaid the Lord Clifford: your teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony is indeed of conſequence.</p>
            <p>It is amazing and convincing, ſaid Lord Graham; and the whole ſtory is ſo well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, that I can ſee nothing to make us doubt the truth of it: But let us examine the
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:032742_0165_0FF50DE67964B408"/>
proofs. Edmund gave into their hands the necklace and ear-rings; he ſhewed them the locket with the cypher of Lovel, and the ſeal with the arms; he told them the cloak in which he was wrapped was in the cuſtody of his foſter-mother, who would produce it on demand. He begged that ſome proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons might be commiſſioned to go with him to examine whether or no the bodies of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were buried where he affirmed; adding, that he put his pretenſions into their hands with pleaſure, relying entirely upon their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and juſtice.</p>
            <p>During this intereſting ſcene, the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal covered his face, and was ſilent, but he ſent forth bitter ſighs and groans that denoted the anguiſh of his heart. At length, Lord Graham, in compaſſion to him, propoſed that they ſhould retire and conſider of the proofs; adding, Lord Lovel muſt needs be fatigued; we will reſume the ſubject in his preſence, when he is diſpoſed to receive us. Sir, ſaid he, I now leave you in the hands of your own relations; they are men of ſtrict honour, and I confide in them to take care of you, and of your concerns. They then went out of the room, leaving only the Lord Fitz-Owen and his ſons with the criminal. They diſcourſed of the wonderful ſtory of Edmund's birth, and the principal events of his life.</p>
            <p>After dinner, Sir Philip requeſted another conference with the Lords, and their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal friends. There were preſent alſo, father
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:032742_0166_0FF50E05D85537B0"/>
Oſwald, and Lord Graham's confeſſor, who had taken the Lord Lovel's confeſſion, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund, and Zadiſky. Now, gentlemen, ſaid Sir Philip, I deſire to know your opinion of our proofs, and your advice upon them.</p>
            <p>Lord Graham replied, I am deſired to ſpeak for the reſt: We think there are ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive proofs that this young man is the true heir of Lovel; but they ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and authenticated. Of the murder of the late Lord there is no doubt; the criminal hath confeſſed it, and the circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it; the proofs of his crime are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with thoſe of the young man's birth, that one cannot be public without the other. We are deſirous to do juſtice; and yet are unwilling for the Lord Fitz-Owen's ſake, to bring the criminal to public ſhame and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We wiſh to find out a medium; we therefore deſire Sir Philip to make propoſals for his ward, and let Lord Fitz-Owen anſwer for himſelf and his brother, and we will be moderators between them. Here every one expreſſed approbation, and called upon Sir Philip to make his demands.</p>
            <p>If, ſaid he, I were to demand ſtrict juſtice, I ſhould not be ſatisfied with any thing leſs than the life of the criminal; but I am a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſoldier, the diſciple of him who came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world to ſave ſinners; for his ſake, continued he (croſſing himſelf) I forego my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="168" facs="unknown:032742_0167_0FF50E18F4FDAC80"/>
it. It is my ward's particular requeſt, that I will not bring ſhame upon the houſe of his benefactor, the Lord Fitz-Owen, for whom he hath a filial affection and profound vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. My propoſals are theſe: Firſt, that the criminal make reſtitution of the title and eſtate, obtained with ſo much injuſtice and cruelty, to the lawful heir, whom he ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konwledge ſuch before witneſſes, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he ſhall ſurrender his own lawful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance and perſonal eſtate into the hands of Lord Fitz-Owen, in truſt for his ſons, who are his heirs of blood. Thirdly, that he ſhall retire into a religious houſe, or elſe quit the kingdom, in three months time; and, in either caſe, thoſe who enjoy his fortune ſhall allow him a decent annuity, that he may not want the comforts of life. By the laſt, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him from the means of doing further miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and enable him to devote the remainder of his days to penitence. Theſe are my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, and I give him four-and-twenty hours to conſider of them; if he refuſes to comply with them, I ſhall be obliged to proceed to ſeverer meaſures, and to a public proſecution: But the goodneſs of the Lord Fitz-Owen bids me expect, from his influence with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a compliance with propoſals made out of reſpect to his honourable character.</p>
            <p>Lord Graham applauded the humanity, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

the reſt gave tokens of approbation. Sir Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Fitz-Owen then roſe up—I beg leave to obſerve to the company, who are going to diſpoſe ſo generouſly of another man's proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that my father purchaſed the caſtle and eſtate of the houſe of Lovel: Who is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay him the money for it?</p>
            <p>Sir Philip then ſaid, I have alſo a queſtion to aſk. Who is to pay the arrears of my ward's eſtate, which he has unjuſtly been kept out of theſe one-and-twenty years? Let Lord Clifford anſwer to both points, for he is not intereſted in either.—Lord Clifford ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—I think, returned he, the firſt queſtion is anſwered by the ſecond, and that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concerned ſhould ſet one againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpecially as Lord Fitz-Owen's children will inherit the fortune, which includes the purchaſe-money. Lord Graham ſaid, This determination is both equitable and generous, and I hope will anſwer the expectations on all ſides.—I have another propoſal to make to my Lord Fitz-Owen, ſaid Sir Philip; but I firſt wait for the acceptance of thoſe already made.—Lord Fitz-Owen replied, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them to my brother, and acquaint the company with his reſolution to-morrow.</p>
            <p>They then ſeparated; and the Baron, with his ſons, returned to the ſick man's cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Sir Philip's propoſals, and obſerved on the wonderful diſcovery of his crime and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment that followed it. Your repentance, continued he, may be accepted, and your crime may yet be pardoned: If you continue refractory, and refuſe to make atonement, you will draw down upon you a ſevere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. The criminal would not confeſs, and yet could not deny the truth and juſtice of his obſervations. The Baron ſpent ſeveral hours in his brother's chamber; he ſent for a prieſt, who took his confeſſion; and they both ſat up with him all night, adviſing, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading, and exhorting him to do juſtice, and to comply with the propoſals. He was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to give up the world, and yet more ſo to become the object of public ſhame, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and puniſhment.</p>
            <p>The next day Lord Fitz-Owen ſummoned ſhe company into his brother's chamber, and there declared, in his name, that he accepted Sir Philip Harclay's propoſals; that, if the young man could, as he promiſed, direct them to the places where his parents were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and if his birth ſhould be authenticated by his foſter-parents, he ſhould be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the heir of the houſe of Lovel.

Lord Clifford to chuſe the commiſſioners, and gave Sir Philip and Edmund a right to add to them,—each, another perſon.</p>
            <p>Lord Graham named the eldeſt ſon of Lord Clifford, and the other, in return, named his nephew; they alſo choſe the prieſt, Lord Graham's confeſſor, and the eldeſt ſon of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron Fitz-Owen, to his great mortification. Sir Philip appointed Mr. William Fitz-Owen, and Edmund named father Oſwald; they choſe out ſervants to attend them, who were alſo to be witneſſes of all that ſhould paſs. Lord Clifford propoſed to Baron Fitz-Owen, that, as ſoon as the commiſſioners were ſet out, the remainder of the company ſhould adjourn to his ſeat in Cumberland, whither Lord Graham ſhould be invited to accompany them, and to ſtay till this affair was decided. After ſome debate, this was agreed to; and, at the ſame time, that the criminal ſhould be kept with them till every thing was properly ſettled.</p>
            <p>Lord Fitz-Owen gave his ſon William the charge to receive and entertain the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners at the caſtle: But, before they ſet out, Sir Philip had a conference with Lord Fitz-Owen, concerning the ſurrender of the Caſtle; in which he inſiſted on the furniture and ſtock of the farm, in conſideration of the arrears. Lord Fitz-Owen ſlightly mentioned the young man's education and expences. Sir Philip anſwered, you are right, my Lord, I had not thought of this point; we owe you, in this
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:032742_0171_0FF50E6855742830"/>
reſpect, more than we can ever repay: But you know not half the reſpect and affection Edmund bears for you. When reſtitution of his title and fortune are fully made, his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs will ſtill depend on you. How on me? ſaid the Baron.—Why, he will not be happy unleſs you honour him with your notice and eſteem; but this is not all, I muſt hope that you will ſtill do more for him.—Indeed, ſaid the Baron, he has put my regard for him to a ſevere proof; what further can be expected from me?—My dear Lord, be not offended, I have only one more propoſal to make to you; if you refuſe it, I can allow for you; and I confeſs it requires a greatneſs of mind, but not more than you poſſeſs to grant it.—Well, Sir, ſpeak your demand.—Say rather my requeſt; it is this caſe: Ceaſe to look upon Edmund as the enemy of your houſe; look upon him as a ſon, and make him ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.—How ſay you, Sir Philip? my ſon!—Yes, my Lord, give him your daughter: He is already your ſon in filial affection; your ſon William and he are ſworn brothers; what remains but to make him yours? He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſuch a parent, you ſuch a ſon; and you will, by this means, ingraft into your family, the name, title, and eſtate of Lovel, which will be entailed on your poſterity for ever. This offer requires much conſideration, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the Baron.—Suffer me to ſuggeſt ſome hints to you, ſaid Sir Philip. This match is, I think, verily pointed out by Providence,

which hath conducted the dear boy through ſo many dangers, and brought him within view of his happineſs; look on him as the precious relic of a noble houſe, the ſon of my deareſt friend! or look on him as my ſon and heir, let me, as his father, implore you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his marriage with your daughter. The Baron's heart was touched, he turned away his face.—Oh, Sir Philip Harclay, what a friend are you! why ſhould ſuch a man be our enemy?—My Lord, ſaid Sir Philip, we are not, cannot be enemies; our hearts are already allied; and I am certain we ſhall one day be dear friends. The Baron ſuppreſſed his emotions, but Sir Philip ſaw into his heart. I muſt conſult my eldeſt ſon, returned he.—Then replied Sir Philip, I foreſee much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; he is prejudiced againſt Edmund, and thinks the reſtitution of his inheritance an injury to your family: Hereafter he will ſee this alliance in a different light, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice that ſuch a brother is added to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; but, at preſent, he will ſet his face a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. However, we will not deſpair: vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and reſolution will ſurmount all obſtacles. Let me call in young Lovel.</p>
            <p>He brought Edmund to the Baron, and acquainted him with the propoſal he had been making in his name, my Lord's anſwers, and the objections he feared on the part of Sir Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert. Edmund kneeled to the Baron; he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

of men! of parents! of patrons! ſaid he, I will ever be your ſon in filial affection, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have the honour to be legally ſo or not; not one of your own children can feel a ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſenſe of love and duty.—Tell me ſaid the Baron, do you love my daughter?—I do, my Lord, with the moſt ardent affection; I never loved any woman but her: and, if I am ſo unfortunate as to be refuſed her, I will not marry at all. Oh, my Lord, reject not my honeſt ſuit! Your alliance will give me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence with myſelf, it will excite me to act worthy of the ſtation to which I am exalted: if you refuſe me, I ſhall ſeem an abject wretch, diſdained by thoſe whom my heart claims re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to: Your family are the whole world to me. Give me your lovely daughter! give me alſo your ſon, my beloved William; and let me ſhare with them the fortune Providence beſtows on me: but what is the title of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, if I am deprived of the ſociety of thoſe I love?</p>
            <p>Edmund, ſaid the Baron, you have a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble friend; but you have a ſtronger in my heart, which I think was implanted there by Heaven to aid its own purpoſes. I feel a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of emotions of different kinds, and am afraid to truſt my own heart with you. But anſwer me a queſtion; Are you aſſured of my daughter's conſent? Have you ſolicited her favour? have you gained her affections?—Never, my Lord! I am incapable of ſo baſe an action: I have loved her at an humble
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:032742_0174_0FF50E8C0F953A30"/>
diſtance; but, in my ſituation, I ſhould have thought it a violation of the laws of gratitude and hoſpitality to have preſumed to ſpeak the ſentiments of my heart.—Then you have acted with unqueſtionable honour on this, and I muſt ſay, on all other occaſions.—Your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, my Lord, is the firſt wiſh of my life; it is the ſeal of my honour and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Sir Philip ſmiled: My Lord Fitz-Owen, I am jealous of Edmund's preferable regard for you: it is juſt the ſame now as formerly Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund came to Sir Philip, he threw himſelf into his arms, he wept, he was overpowered with the feelings of his heart: he prayed to Heaven to ſtrengthen his mind to ſupport his inexpreſſible ſenſations. I am overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with obligation! ſaid he: oh, beſt of friends, teach me, like you, to make my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſpeak for me!—Enough, Edmund, I know your heart, and that is my ſecurity. My Lord, ſpeak to him, and bring him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; by behaving coldly to him, if you can. The Baron ſaid, I muſt not truſt myſelf with you, you make a child of me! I will only add, Gain my ſon Robert's favour, and be aſſured of mine: I owe ſome reſpect to the heir of my family; he is brave, honeſt, and ſincere; your enemies are ſeparated from him, you have William's influence in your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> a moment, ſaid he; I fly to obey your commands.</p>
            <p>Edmund went immediately to his friend William and related all that had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Baron, Sir Philip, and himſelf. William promiſed him his intereſt in the warmeſt manner: he recapitulated all that had paſſed in the Caſtle ſince his departure; but he guarded his ſiſter's delicacy, till it ſhould be reſolved to give way to his addreſs. They both conſulted young Clifford, who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an affection to Edmund for his amiable qualities, and to William for his generous friendſhip for him. He promiſed them his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, as Sir Robert ſeemed deſirous to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate his friendſhip. Accordingly, they both at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked him with the whole artillery of friendſhip and perſuaſion. Clifford urged the merits of Edmund, and the advantages of his alliance; William enforced his arguments by a retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Edmund's paſt life; and obſerved that every obſtacle thrown in his way had brought his enemies to ſhame, and increaſe of honour to himſelf.—I ſay nothing, continued he, of his noble qualities and affectionate heart: thoſe who have been ſo many years his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, can want no proofs of it.—We know your attachment to him, Sir, ſaid Robert; and in conſequence, your partiality.—Nay, replied William, you are ſenſible of the truth of my aſſertions; and, I am confident, would have loved him yourſelf, but for the inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his enemies: but if he ſhould make
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:032742_0176_0FF50EA0B6B7D000"/>
good his aſſertions, even you muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his veracity.—And you would have my father give him your ſiſter upon this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty?—No, Sir, but upon theſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.—But ſuppoſe he does not make them good?—Then I will be of your party, and give up his intereſt.—Very well, Sir; my father may do as he pleaſes; but I cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to give my ſiſter to one who has always ſtood in the way of our family, and now turns us out of our own houſe.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry, brother, you ſee his pretenſions in ſo wrong a light; but if you think there is any impoſture in the caſe, go with us, and be a witneſs of all that paſſes.—No, not I; if Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund is to be maſter of the caſtle, I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſet my foot in it.—This matter, ſaid Mr. Clifford, muſt be left to time, which has brought ſtranger things to paſs. Sir Robert's honour and good ſenſe will enable him to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due his prejudices, and to judge impartially. They took leave, and went to make prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for their journey.</p>
            <p>Edmund made his report of Sir Robert's inflexibility to his father, in preſence of Sir Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip; who, again, ventured to urge the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron on his favorite ſubject.—It becomes me to wait for the further proofs, ſaid he; but, if they are as clear as I expect, I will not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable to your wiſhes: ſay nothing more on this ſubject till the return of the commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. They were profuſe in their acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his goodneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="unknown:032742_0177_0FF50EB04F588338"/>
Edmund took a tender leave of his two paternal friends:—When, ſaid he, I take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of my inheritance, I muſt hope for the company of you both to complete my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.—Of me, ſaid Sir Philip, you may be certain; and, as far as my influence reaches, of the Baron.—He was ſilent, Edmund aſſured them of his conſtant prayers for their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Soon after, the commiſſioners, with Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund, ſet out for Lovel Caſtle: and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day the Lord Clifford ſet out for his own houſe, with Baron Fitz-Owen and his ſon. The nominal Baron was carried with them, very much againſt his will. Sir Philip Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay was invited to go with them by Lord Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, who declared his preſence neceſſary to bring things to a concluſion. They all joined in acknowledging their obligations to Lord Graham's generous hoſpitality, and beſought him to accompany them; he conſented, on condition they would allow him to go to and fro, as his duty ſhould call him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Lord Clifford received them with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hoſpitality, and preſented them to his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and three daughters, who are in the bloom of youth and beauty. They <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> declined company.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the commiſſioners pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on their journey. When they were within a day's diſtance from the caſtle, Mr.
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:032742_0178_0FF50EBF637CFDD0"/>
William and his ſervant put forward, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived ſeveral hours before the reſt, to make preparations for their reception. His ſiſter and brother received them with open arms, and inquired eagerly after the event of the journey to the North. He gave them a brief account of every thing that had happened to their uncle; adding, but this is not all: Sir Philip has brought a young man who he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends is the ſon of the late Lord Lovel, and claims his eſtate and title. This perſon is on his journey hither, with ſeveral others who are commiſſioned to inquire into certain parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, to confirm his pretenſions:—If he make good his claim my father will ſurrender the Caſtle and eſtate into his hands.—Sir Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip and my Lord have many points to ſettle; he has propoſed a compromiſe, that you, my ſiſter, ought to know, becauſe it nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns you.—Me! brother William; pray ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain yourſelf.—Why, he propoſes that, in lieu of arrears and, other expectations, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall give his dear Emma to the heir of Lovel, in full of all demands.—She changed colour.—Holy Mary! ſaid ſhe; and does my father agree to this propoſal? He is not very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to it; but Sir Robert refuſes his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: However, I have given him my intereſt with you.—Have you indeed? What! a ſtranger, perhaps an impoſtor, who comes to turn us out of our dwelling?—Have patience, my Emma! ſee this young man without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and perhaps you will like him as well
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:032742_0179_0FF50ED597830330"/>
as I do.—I am ſurprized at you, William!—Dear Emma, I cannot bear to ſee you uneaſy. Think of the man who of all others you would wiſh to ſee in a ſituation to aſk you of your father, and expect to ſee your wiſhes realized.—Impoſſible! ſaid ſhe!—Nothing is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, my dear: let us be prudent and all will end happily. You muſt help me to receive and entertain theſe commiſſioners. I expect a very ſolemn ſcene; but when that is once got over, happier hours than the paſt will ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. We ſhall firſt viſit the haunted apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; you, my ſiſter, will keep in your own till I ſhall ſend for you. I go now to give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the ſervants. He went and ordered them to be in waiting; and himſelf and his youngeſt brother, ſtood in readineſs to receive them.</p>
            <p>The ſound of the horn announced the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the commiſſioners; at the ſame inſtant a ſudden guſt of wind aroſe, and the outward gates flew open. They entered the court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and the great folding-doors into the hall were opened without any aſſiſtance. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Edmund entered the hall, every door in the houſe flew open; the ſervants all ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the hall, and fear was written on their countenances; Joſeph only was undaunted.—Theſe doors, ſaid he, open of their own accord to receive their maſter! this is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! Edmund was ſoon appriſed of what had happened.—I accept the omen! ſaid he. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, let us go forward to the apartment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="181" facs="unknown:032742_0180_0FF50EE6532C8DD8"/>
let us finiſh the work of fate! I will lead the way. He went on to the apartment, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all preſent.—Open the ſhutters, ſaid he, the day-light ſhall no longer be excluded here; the deeds of darkneſs ſhall now be brought to light.</p>
            <p>They deſcended the ſtair-caſe; every door was open, till they came to the fatal cloſet. Edmund called to Mr. William:—Approach, my friend, and behold the door your family overlooked! They came forward; he drew the key out of his boſom, and unlocked the door; he made them obſerve that the boards were all looſe; he then called to his ſervants, and bid them remove every thing out of the cloſet. While they were doing this, Edmund ſhewed them the breaſt-plate all ſtained with blood; he then called to Joſeph:—Do you know whoſe was this ſuit of armour?—It was my Lord's, ſaid Joſeph; the late Lord Lovel; I have ſeen him wear it.</p>
            <p>Edmund bade them bring ſhovels and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the earth. While they were gone, he deſired Oſwald to repeat all that had paſſed the night they ſat up together in that apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he did till the ſervants returned. They threw out the earth, while the by ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in ſolemn ſilence waited the event. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome time and labour they ſtruck againſt ſomething. They proceeded till they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a large trunk, which with ſome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they drew out. It had been corded round,
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:032742_0181_0FF50EF6BADCD130"/>
but the cords were rotted to duſt. They o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened it, and found a ſkeleton, which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been tied neck and heels together, and forced into the trunk.—Behold, ſaid Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund, the bones of him to whom I owe my birth! The prieſt from Lord Graham's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.—This is undoubtedly the body of Lord Lovel; I heard his kinſman confeſs the manner in which he was interred. Let this awful ſpectacle be a leſſon to all preſent, that though wickedneſs may triumph for a ſeaſon, a day of retribution will come! Oſwald ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,—Behold the day of retribution! of triumph to the innocent, of ſhame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the wicked.</p>
            <p>The young gentlemen declared that Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund had made good his aſſertions; what then, ſaid they, remains? I propoſe, ſaid Lord Graham's prieſt, that an account be written of this diſcovery, and ſigned by all the witneſſes preſent; that an atteſted copy be leſt in the hands of this gentleman, and the original be ſent to the Barons and Sir Philip Harclay, to convince them of the truth of it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Clifford then deſired Edmund to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in his own way.—The firſt thing I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſe to do, ſaid he, is to have a coffin made for theſe honoured remains; I truſt to find the bones of my other p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ent, and to inter them all together in conſecrated ground. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate pair! you ſhall at laſt reſt together! your ſon ſhall pay the laſt duties to your aſhes! He ſtopped to ſhed tears, and none preſent
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:032742_0182_0FF50EFB5B238668"/>
but paid this tribute to their misfortunes. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund recovered his voice and proceeded—My next requeſt is, that Father Oſwald and this reverend father, with whoever elſe the gentlemen ſhall appoint, will ſend for Andrew and Margery Twyford, and examine them concerning the circumſtances of my birth, and the death and burial of my unfortunate mother.—It ſhall be done, ſaid Mr. William; but firſt let me entreat you to come with me and take ſome refreſhment after your journey, for you muſt be fatigued: after dinner we will proceed in the inquiry.</p>
            <p>They all followed him into the great hall, where they were entertained with great hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality, and Mr. William did the honours in his father's name. Edmund's heart was deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected, and the ſolemnity of his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bore witneſs to his ſincerity; but it was a manly ſorrow, that did not make him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect his duty to his friends or himſelf. He inquired after the health of the Lady Emma.—She is well, ſaid William; and as much your friend as ever. Edmund bowed in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>After dinner the commiſſioners ſent for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew and his wife, and examined them ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and found their accounts agreed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and were in ſubſtance the ſame as Oſwald and Edmund had before related, ſeparately alſo. The commiſſioners obſerved, that there could be no colluſion between them, and that the proofs were indiſputable. They kept the
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:032742_0183_0FF50F04D05BBA98"/>
foſter parents all night; and the next day An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew directed them to the place where the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Lovel was buried, between two trees which he had marked for a memorial. They col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the bones and carried them to the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, where Edmund cauſed a ſtately coffin to be made for the remains of the unfortunate pair. The two prieſts obtained leave to look in the coffin buried in the church, and found nothing but ſtones and earth in it. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners then declared they were fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the reality of Edmund's pretenſions.</p>
            <p>The two prieſts were employed in drawing up a circumſtantial account of theſe diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, in order to make their report to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons at their return. In the mean time Mr. William took an opportunity to introduce Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund to his ſiſter.—My Emma, ſaid he, the heir of Lovel is deſirous to pay his reſpects to you. They were both in apparent confuſion; but Edmund's wore off, and Emma's increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—I have been long deſirous, ſaid he, to pay my reſpects to the Lady whom I moſt honour, but unavoidable duties have detained me; when theſe are fully paid, it is my wiſh to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote the remainder of my life to Lady Emma!—Are you, then, the heir of Lovel?—I am, Madam; and am alſo the man in whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half I once preſumed to ſpeak.—'Tis very ſtrange indeed!—It is ſo, Madam, to myſelf; but time, that reconciles us to all things, will I hope, render this change in my ſituation fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to you. William ſaid,—You are both
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:032742_0184_0FF50F096F3AA708"/>
well acquainted with the wiſhes of my heart; but my advice is, that you do not encourage a farther intimacy till my Lord's determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be fully known.—You may diſpoſe of me as you pleaſe, ſaid Edmund; but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help declaring my wiſhes; yet I will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to my Lord's ſentence, though he ſhould doom me to deſpair.</p>
            <p>From this period, the young pair behaved with ſolemn reſpect to each other, but with apparent reſerve. The young Lady ſometimes appeared in company, but oftner choſe to be in her own apartment, where ſhe began to believe and hope for the completion of her wiſhes. The uncertainty of the Baron's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, threw an air of anxiety over Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund's face: his friend William, by the moſt tender care and attention, ſtrove to diſpel his fears, and encourage his hopes; but he wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with impatience for the return of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, and the deciſion of his fate.</p>
            <p>While theſe things paſſed at the Caſtle of Lovel, the nominal Baron recovered his health and ſtrength at the houſe of Lord Clifford: In the ſame proportion he grew more ſhy and reſerved, avoided the company of his brother and nephew, and was frequently ſhut up with his two ſervants. Sir Robert Fitz-Owen made ſeveral attempts to gain his confidence, but in vain; he was equally ſhy to him as the reſt. M. Zadiſky obſerved his motions with the penetration for which his countrymen have
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:032742_0185_0FF50F277B5C74F8"/>
been diſtinguiſhed in all ages: He commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated his ſuſpicions to Sir Philip and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, giving it as his opinion, that the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal was meditating an eſcape. They aſked, what he thought was to be done? Zadiſky offered to watch him in turn with another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to lie in wait for him: he alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that horſes ſhould be kept in readineſs, and men to mount them, without knowledge of the ſervice they were to be employed in. The Barons agreed to leave the whole manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this affair to Zadiſky. He took his meaſures ſo well, that he intercepted the three fugitives in the fields adjoining to the houſe, and brought them all priſoners. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined them ſeparately, while the Lords and gentlemen conſulted how to diſpoſe of them.</p>
            <p>Sir Philip applied to Lord Fitz-Owen, who begged leave to be ſilent: I have nothing, ſaid he, to offer in favour of this bad man; and I cannot propoſe harſher meaſures with ſo near a relation. Zadiſky then begged to be heard. You can no longer have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance upon the word of a man who has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited all pretenſions to honour and ſincerity. I have long wiſhed to reviſit once more my native country, and to inquire after ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dear friends I left there: I will undertake to convey this man to a very diſtant part of the world, where it will be out of his power to do further miſchief, and free his relations from an ungrateful charge, unleſs you ſhould rather chuſe to bring him to puniſhment here.
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:032742_0186_0FF50F2AAB0EEB30"/>
Lord Clifford approved of the propoſal; Lord Fitz-Owen remained ſilent, but ſhewed no marks of diſapprobation.</p>
            <p>Sir Philip objected to parting with his friend; but Zadiſky aſſured him he had particular reaſons for returning to the Holy Land, of which he ſhould be judge hereafter. Sir Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip deſired the Lord Fitz-Owen to give him his company to the criminal's apartment, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we will have one more converſation with him, and that ſhall decide his fate. They found him ſilent and ſullen, and he refuſed to anſwer their queſtions.—Sir Philip then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke him—After the proofs you have given of your falſehood and inſincerity, we can no longer have any reliance upon you, nor faith in your fulfilling the conditions of our agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I will therefore, once more make you a propoſal that ſhall ſtill leave you indebted to our clemency. You ſhall baniſh yourſelf from England for ever, and go in pilgrimage to the Holy Land, with ſuch companions as we ſhall appoint; or ſecondly, you ſhall enter directly into a monaſtery, and there be ſhut up for life; or, thirdly if you refuſe both theſe offers, I will go directly to Court, and throw myſelf at the feet of my Sovereign, relate the whole ſtory of your wicked life and actions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand vengeance upon your head. The King is too good and pious to let ſuch villainy go unpuniſhed; he will bring you to public ſhame and puniſhment: And be you aſſured, if I begin this proſecution, I will purſue it to the

utmoſt. I appeal to your worthy brother for the juſtice of my proceeding. I reaſon no more with you, I only declare my reſolution. I wait your anſwer one hour, and the next I put in execution whatever you ſhall oblige me to determine. So ſaying, they retired, and left him to reflect and to reſolve. At the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of the hour they ſent Zadiſky to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his anſwer; he inſinuated to him the generoſity and charity of Sir Philip and the Lords, and the certainty of their reſolutions, and begged him to take care what anſwer he returned, for that his fate depended on it. He kept ſilent ſeveral minutes, reſentment and deſpair were painted on his viſage; at length <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e ſpoke:</p>
            <p>Tell my proud enemies that I prefer baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to death, infamy, or a life of ſolitude. You have choſen well, ſaid Zadiſky. To a wiſe man all countries are alike; it ſhall be my care to make mine agreeable to you.—Are you then the perſon choſen for my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion?—I am, Sir; and you may judge by that circumſtance, that thoſe whom you call your enemies, are not ſo in effect. Farewell, Sir; I go to prepare for our departure.</p>
            <p>Zadiſky went and made his report, and then ſet immediately about his preparations. He choſe two active young men for his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants; and gave them directions to keep a ſtrict eye upon their charge, for that they ſhould be accountable if he ſhould eſcape them.</p>
            <p>

In the mean time the Baron Fitz-Owen had ſeveral conferences with his brother: he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make him ſenſible of his crimes, and of the juſtice and clemency of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror; but he was moody and reſerved to him as to the reſt. Sir Philip Harclay oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to ſurrender his worldly eſtates into the hands of Lord Fitz-Owen: A writing was drawn up for that purpoſe, and executed in the preſence of them all. Lord Fitz-Owen engaged to allow him an annual ſum, and to advance money for the expences of his voyage. He ſpoke to him in the moſt affectionate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but he refuſed his embrace:—You will have nothing to regret, ſaid he, haughtily; for the gain is yours. Sir Philip conjured Zadiſky to return to him again; who anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,—I will either return, or give ſuch reaſons for my ſtay, as you ſhall approve. I will-ſend a meſſenger to acquaint you with my arrival in Syria, and with ſuch other particulars as I ſhall judge intereſting to you and yours. In the mean time remember me in your prayers, and preſerve for me thoſe ſentiments of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and eſteem, that I have always deemed one of the chief honours and bleſſings of my life.—Commend my love and duty to your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted ſon; he will more than ſupply my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and be the comfort of your old age. Adieu, beſt and nobleſt of friends!—They took a tender leave of each other, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tears on both ſides.</p>
            <p>The travellers ſet out directly for a diſtant
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:032742_0189_0FF50F500F5212C8"/>
ſea-port, where they heard of a ſhip bound for the Levant, in which they embarked and proceeded on their voyage.</p>
            <p>The commiſſioners arrived at Lord Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's a few days after the departure of the adventurers. They gave a minute account of their commiſſion, and expreſſed themſelves entirely ſatisfied of the juſtice of Edmund's pretenſions; they gave an account in writing of all that they had been eye-witneſſes to, and ventured to urge the Baron Fitz-Owen on the ſubject of Edmund's wiſhes. The Baron was already diſpoſed in his favour; his mind was employed in the future eſtabliſhment of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. During their reſidence at Lord Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's, his eldeſt ſon Sir Robert had caſt his eye upon the eldeſt daughter of that nobleman, and he beſought his father to aſk her in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage for him. The Baron was pleaſed with the alliance, and took the firſt opportunity to mention it to Lord Clifford; who anſwered him pleaſantly,—I will give my daughter to your ſon, upon condition that you will give yours to the heir of Lovel. The Baron look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſerious: Lord Clifford went on—I like that young man ſo well, that I would accept him for a ſon-in-law, if he aſked me for my daughter: and if I have any influence with you, I will uſe it in his behalf.—A powerful ſolicitor indeed! ſaid the Baron; but you know my eldeſt ſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> reluctance to it; if he conſents, ſo will I.—He ſhall conſent, ſaid Lord Clifford, or he ſhall have no daughter
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:032742_0190_0FF50F5D45B94948"/>
of mine. Let him ſubdue his prejudices, and then I will lay aſide my ſcruples.—But, my Lord, replied the Baron, if I can obtain his free conſent, it will be the beſt for all: I will try once more, and if he will not, I will leave it wholly to your management.</p>
            <p>When the noble company were all aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, Sir Philip Harclay revived the ſubject, and beſought the Lord Fitz-Owen to put an end to the work he had begun, by confirming Edmund's happineſs. The Baron roſe up and thus ſpoke:—The proofs of Edmund's noble birth, the ſtill ſtronger ones of his excellent endowments and qualities, the ſolicitations of ſo many noble friends in his behalf, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together determined me in his favour; and I hope to do juſtice to his merit, without detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to my other children: I am reſolved to make them all as happy as my power will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me to do. Lord Clifford has been ſo gracious to promiſe his fair daughter to my ſon Robert, upon certain conditions, that I will take upon me to ratify, and which will render my ſon worthy of the happineſs that awaits him. My children are the undoubted heirs of my unhappy brother, Lovel; you, my ſon, ſhall therefore immediately take poſſeſſion of your Uncle's houſe and eſtate, only oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you to pay to each of your younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the ſum of one thouſand pounds; on this condition, I will ſecure that eſtate to you and your heirs for ever. I will, by my own act and deed, ſurrender the Caſtle and eſtate
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:032742_0191_0FF5099730FC2558"/>
of Lovel to the right owner, and at the ſame time marry him to my daughter. I will ſettle a proper allowance upon my two younger ſons, and diſpoſe of what remains by a will and teſtament; and then I ſhall have done all my buſineſs in this world, and ſhall have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do but prepare for the next.</p>
            <p>Oh, my father! ſaid Sir Robert, I cannot bear your generoſity; you would give away all to others, and reſerve nothing for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.—Not ſo, my ſon, ſaid the Baron: I will repair my old caſtle in Wales, and reſide there. I will viſit my children, and be viſited by them: I will enjoy their happineſs, and by that means increaſe my own; whether I look backwards or forwards, I ſhall have nothing to do but rejoice, and be thankful to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that has given me ſo many bleſſings; I ſhall have the comfortable reflection of having diſcharged my duties as a citizen, a huſband, a father, a friend; and whenever I am ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned away from this world, I ſhall die con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>Sir Robert came forward with tears on his cheeks; he kneeled to his father—Beſt of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and of men! ſaid he; you have ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a heart that has been too refractory to your will: you have this day made me ſenſible how much I owe to your goodneſs and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with me. Forgive me what is paſt, and from henceforward diſpoſe of me; I will have no will but yours, no ambition but to be worthy of the name of your ſon.—And
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:032742_0192_0FF50F70F72DAFC8"/>
this day, ſaid the Baron, do I enjoy the true happineſs of a father! Riſe, my ſon, and take poſſeſſion of the firſt place in my affection with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve. They embraced with tears on both ſides: The company roſe, and congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated both father and ſon. The Baron preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſon to Lord Clifford, who embraced him, and ſaid,—You ſhall have my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for I ſee that you deſerve her.</p>
            <p>Sir Philip Harclay approached; the Baron gave his ſon's hand to the knight: Love and reſpect that good man, ſaid he; deſerve his friendſhip, and you will obtain it. Nothing but congratulations were heard on all ſides.</p>
            <p>When the joy was in ſome degree reduced to compoſure, Sir Philip propoſed that they ſhould begin to execute the ſchemes of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they had planned. He propoſed that my Lord Fitz-Owen ſhould go with him to the Caſtle of Lovel, and ſettle the family there. The Baron conſented; and both together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited ſuch of the company, as liked it, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

It was agreed that a nephew of Lord Graham's, another of Lord Clifford's, two gentlemen, friends of Sir Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Harclay, and father Oſwald, ſhould be of the party; together with ſeveral of Sir Philip's dependants and domeſtics, and the attendants on the reſt. Lord Fitz-Owen gave orders for their ſpeedy departure. Lord Graham and his friends took leave of them, in order to return to his own home; but, before he went he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:032742_0193_0FF50F73B51C86F0"/>
his eldeſt nephew and heir to the ſecond daughter of the Lord Clifford: Sir Robert of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf to the eldeſt, who modeſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his addreſs, and made no objection to his propoſal. The fathers confirmed their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.</p>
            <p>Lord Fitz-Owen promiſed to return to the celebration of the marriage; in the mean time he ordered his ſon to go and take poſſeſſion of his Uncle's houſe, and to ſettle his houſehold: He invited young Clifford and ſome other gentlemen, to go with him. The company ſeparated with regret, and with many promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of friendſhip on all ſides; and the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the North were to cultivate the good neighbourhood on both ſides of the borders.</p>
            <p>Sir Philip Harclay and the Baron Fitz Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with their friends and attendants, ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for the Caſtle of Lovel; a ſervant went before at full ſpeed, to acquaint the family of their approach. Edmund was in great anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mind, now the criſis of his fate was near at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>and: He inquired of the meſſenger, who were of the party? and finding that Sir Philip Harclay was there, and that Sir Robert Fitz-Owen ſtaid in the North, his hopes roſe above his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ears. Mr. William, attended by a ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, rode forward to meet them; he deſired Edmund to ſtay and receive them. Edmund was under ſome difficulty with regard to his behaviour to the lovely Emma: a thouſand times his heart roſe to his lips, as often he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his emotions; they both ſighed fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:032742_0194_0FF50F7D57D81870"/>
ſaid little, thought much, and wiſhed for the event. Maſter Walter was too young to partake of their anxieties, but he wiſhed for the arrival of his father to end them.</p>
            <p>Mr. William's impatience ſpurred him on to meet his father; as ſoon as he ſaw him he rode up directly to him: My dear father, you are welcome home! ſaid he.—I think not, Sir, ſaid the Baron, and looked ſerious.—Why ſo, My Lord? ſaid William.—Becauſe it is no longer mine but another man's home, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, and I muſt receive my welcome from him.—Meaning Edmund? ſaid William.—Whom elſe can it be?—Ah, my Lord! he is your creature, your ſervant; he puts his fate in your hands, and will ſubmit to your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in all things!—Why comes he not to meet us? ſaid the Baron.—His fears prevent him, ſaid William; but ſpeak the word and I will fetch him.—No, ſaid the Baron, we will wait on him.—William looked confuſed: Is Edmund ſo unfortunate, ſaid he, as to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred your diſpleaſure? Sir Philip Harclay advanced and laid his hand on William's ſaddle.—Generous impatience! noble youth! ſaid he; look round you, and ſee if you can diſcover in this company one enemy of your friend! Leave to your excellent father the time and manner of explaining himſelf; he only can do juſtice to his own ſentiments. The Baron ſmiled on Sir Philip: William's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance cleared up; they went forward and ſoon arrived at the caſtle of Lovel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="unknown:032742_0195_0FF50F7EE30FE420"/>
Edmund was walking to and fro in the hall, when he heard the horn that announced their arrival; his emotions were ſo great that he could hardly ſupport them. The Baron and Sir Philip entered the hall hand in hand; Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund threw himſelf at their feet, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their knees, but could not utter a word. They raiſed him between them, and ſtrove to encourage him: but he threw himſelf into the arms of Sir Philip Harclay, deprived of ſtrength and almoſt of life. They ſupported him to a ſeat, where he recovered by degrees, but had no power to ſpeak his feelings; he looked up to his benefactors in the moſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting manner, he laid his hand upon his boſom, but was ſtill ſilent. Compoſe yourſelf, my dear ſon, ſaid Sir Philip; you are in the arms of your beſt friends. Look up to the happineſs that awaits you; enjoy the bleſſings that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſends you; lift up your heart in gratitude to the Creator, and think leſs of what you owe to the creature! You will have time enough to pay us your acknowledgments hereafter.</p>
            <p>The company came round them, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants flocked into the hall, ſhouts of joy were heard on all ſides; the Baron came and took Edmund's hand: Riſe, Sir, ſaid he, and do the honours of your houſe! it is yours from this day: We are your gueſts, and expect from you our welcome! Edmund kneeled to the Baron, he ſpoke with a faultering voice—My Lord, I am yours! all that I have is at your devotion! diſpoſe of me as it pleaſes you
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:032742_0196_0FF50F80723F9A08"/>
beſt. The Baron embraced him with the greateſt affection: Look round you, ſaid he, and ſalute your friends; theſe gentlemen came hither to do you honour. Edmund revived, he embraced and welcomed the gentlemen, Father Oſwald received his embrace with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar affection, and gave him his benediction in a moſt affecting manner. Edmund exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—Pray for me, father! that I may bear all theſe bleſſings with gratitude and moderation! He then ſaluted and ſhook hands with all the ſervants, not omitting the meaneſt; he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed Joſeph by a cordial embrace, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him his dear friend: Now, ſaid he, I can return your friendſhip, and I am proud to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it! The old man with a faultering voice, cried out—Now I have lived long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough! I have ſeen my maſter's ſon acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for the heir of Lovel! the hall echoed with his words: Long live the heir of Lovel!</p>
            <p>The Baron took Edmund's hands in his own: Let us retire from this crowd, ſaid he; we have buſineſs of a more private nature to tranſact. He led to the parlour, followed by Sir Philip and the other gentlemen. Where are my other children? ſaid he. William re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, and preſently returned with his brother, and ſiſter. They kneeled to their father, who raiſed and embraced them.—He then called out, William!—Edmund!—come and receive my bleſſing alſo: They approached hand in hand, they kneeled, and he gave them a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:032742_0197_0FF50F820FC500A8"/>
benediction—Your friendſhip deſerves our praiſe, my children; love each other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways! and may heaven pour down its choiceſt bleſſings upon your heads! They roſe and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced in ſilent raptures of joy. Edmund pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his friend to Sir Philip: I underſtand you, ſaid he; this Gentleman was my firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of this family, he has a title to the ſecond place in my heart: I ſhall tell him, at more leiſure, how much I love and honour him for his own ſake as well as yours. He embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the youth, and deſired his friendſhip.</p>
            <p>Come hither, my Emma! ſaid the Baron. She approached, with tears on her cheeks, ſweetly bluſhing, like the damaſk roſe, wet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

You have known him long; conſult your own heart, and tell me whether you have any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to receive him for a huſband. I have promiſed to all this company to give you to him; but upon condition that you approve him: I think him worthy of you; and, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you accept him or not, he ſhall ever be to me a ſon; but Heaven forbid that I ſhould compel my child to give her hand where ſhe cannot beſtow her heart! Speak freely, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide this point for me and for yourſelf. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Emma bluſhed, and was under ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; her virgin modeſty prevented her ſpeaking for ſome moments. Edmund trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled;
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:032742_0198_0FF50F8C9A52D0B8"/>
he leaned upon William's ſhoulder to ſupport himſelf. Emma caſt her eye upon him, ſhe ſaw his emotion, and haſtened to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him; ſhe thus ſpoke, in a ſoft voice which gathered ſtrength as ſhe proceeded—My Lord and father's goodneſs has always prevented my wiſhes; I am the happieſt of all children, in being able to obey his commands, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering violence to my own inclinations: As I am called upon in this public manner, it is but juſtice to this gentleman's merit to declare, that, were I at liberty to chooſe a huſband from all the world, he only ſhould be my choice, who, I can ſay, with joy, is my father's alſo. Edmund bowed low, he advanced towards her; the Baron took his daughter's hand, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it to him; he kneeled upon one knee, he took her hand, kiſſed it, and preſſed it to his boſom: the Baron embraced and bleſſed them; he preſented them to Sir Philip Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay—Receive and acknowledge your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren! ſaid he.—I do receive them as the gift of heaven! ſaid the noble knight; they are as much mine as if I had begotten them: All that I have is theirs, and ſhall deſcend to their children for ever. A freſh ſcene of congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation enſued; and the hearts of all the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were too much engaged to be able ſoon to return to the caſe and tranquility of common life.</p>
            <p>After they had refreſhed themſelves, and recovered from the emotions they had ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this intereſting occaſion, Edmund thus
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:032742_0199_0FF50E076285B520"/>
addreſſed the Baron:—On the brink of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs I muſt claim your attention to a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſubject. The bones of both my parents lie unburied in this houſe; permit me, my honoured Lord, to perform my laſt duties to them, and the remainder of my life ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to you and yours.—Certainly, ſaid the Baron? why have you not interred them?—My Lord, I waited for your arrival, that you might be certified of the reality, and that no doubts might remain.—I have no doubts, ſaid the Baron: Alas! both the crime and puniſhment of the offender leave no room for them!—He ſighed.—Let us now put an end to this affair; and, if poſſible, forget them for ever.</p>
            <p>If it will not be too painful to you, my Lord, I would intreat you, with theſe gentlemen our friends, to follow me into the eaſt apartment, the ſcene of my parents woes, and yet the dawning of my better hopes.</p>
            <p>They roſe to attend him; he committed the Lady Emma to the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of her youngeſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, obſerving that the ſcene was too ſolemn for a Lady to be preſent at it. They proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the apartment; he ſhewed the Baron the fatal cloſet, and the place where the bones were found, alſo the trunk that contained them; he recapitulated all that paſſed before their arrival; he ſhewed them the coffin where the bones of the unfortunate pair were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited; He then deſired the Baron to give orders for their interment. No, replied he, it
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:032742_0200_0FF50D55A41B06D8"/>
belongs to you to order, and every one here is ready to perform it. Edmund then deſired father Oſwald to give notice to the Friars of the Monaſtery of St. Auguſtin, that with their permiſſion, the funeral ſhould be ſolemnized there, and the bones interred in the church. He alſo gave orders that the cloſet ſhould be floored, and the apartment repaired, and put in order. He then returned to the other ſide of the caſtle.</p>
            <p>Preparations being made for the funeral, it was performed a few days after. Edmund at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in perſon as chief mourner, Sir Philip Harclay as the ſecond; Joſeph deſired he might aſſiſt as ſervant to the deceaſed: They were followed by moſt of the people of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage. The ſtory was now become public, and every one bleſſed Edmund for the piety and devotion with which he performed the laſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to his parents.—Edmund appeared in deep mourning: the week after, he aſſiſted at a maſs for the repoſe of the deceaſed.</p>
            <p>Sir Philip Harclay ordered a monument to be erected to the memory of his friends, with the following inſcription:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Praye for the ſoules of Arthur Lord Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vele and Marie his wife, who were cut off in the flowere of theire youthe, by the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherye and crueltie of theire neare kinneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manne.

            </p>
            <p>The Sunday after the funeral, Edmund threw off his mourning, and appeared in a dreſs ſuitable to his condition. He received the compliments of his friends with eaſe and cheerfulneſs, and began to enjoy his happineſs. He aſked an audience of his fair miſtreſs, and was permitted to declare the paſſion he had ſo long ſtifled in his own boſom. She gave him a favourable hearing, and in a ſhort time confeſſed that ſhe had ſuffered equally in that ſuſpence that was ſo grievous to him. They engaged themſelves by mutual vows to each other, and only waited the Baron's pleaſure to complete their happineſs; every cloud was vaniſhed from their brows, and ſweet tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity took poſſeſſion of their boſoms. Their friends ſhared their happineſs; William and Edmund renewed their vows of everlaſting friendſhip, and promiſed to be as much toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as William's other duties would permit.</p>
            <p>The Baron once more ſummoned all his company together; he told Edmund all that had paſſed relating to his brother-in-law, his exile, and the pilgrimage of Zadiſky; he then related the circumſtances of Sir Robert's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to Lord Clifford's daughter, his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment in his Uncle's ſeat, and his own obligations to return time enough to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

at the marriage: But before I go, ſaid he, I will give my daughter to the heir of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and then I ſhall have diſcharged my duty to him and my promiſe to Sir Philip Harc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay.</p>
            <p>You have nobly performed both, ſaid Sir Philip, and whenever you depart I ſhall be your companion.—What, ſaid Edmund, am I to be deprived of both my fathers at once? My honoured Lord, you have given away two houſes, where do you intend to reſide?—No matter, ſaid the Baron; I know I ſhall be welcome to both.—My dear lord, ſaid Edmund, ſtay here and be ſtill the Maſter; I ſhall be proud to be under your command, and to be your ſervant as well as your ſon!—No, Edmund, ſaid the Baron, that would not now be proper; this is your caſtle, you are its Lord and Maſter, and it is incumbent on you to ſhew yourſelf worthy of the great things Providence hath done for you.—How ſhall I, a young man, acquit myſelf of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny duties as will be upon me, without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and aſſiſtance of my two paternal friends? Oh, Sir Philip, will you too leave me? once you gave me hopes—he ſtopped, greatly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Sir Philip ſaid, tell me truly, Edmund, do you realy deſire that I ſhould live with you?—As truly, Sir, as I deſire life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs!—Then, my dear child, I will live and die with you! They embraced with tears of affection, and Edmund was all joy and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. My good Lord, ſaid Sir Philip, you
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:032742_0203_0FF50D706E862800"/>
have diſpoſed of two houſes, and have none ready to receive you; will you accept of mine? it is much at your ſervice, and its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame county with your eldeſt ſon, will be an inducement to you to reſide there. The Baron caught Sir Philip's hand—Noble Sir, I thank you, and I will embrace your kind offer; I will be your tenant for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; my caſtle in Wales ſhall be put in repair, in the mean time; if I do not reſide there, it will be an eſtabliſhment for one of my young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſons: But what will you do with your old ſoldiers and dependants?—My Lord, I will never caſt them off. There is another houſe on my eſtate that has been ſhut up many years; I will have it repaired and furniſhed properly for the reception of my old men: I will endow it with a certain ſum to be paid annually, and will appoint a ſteward to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age their revenue; I will continue it dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lives of the firſt inhabitants, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I ſhall leave it to my ſon here, to do as he pleaſes.—Your ſon, ſaid Edmund, will make it the buſineſs of his life to act worthy of ſuch a father.—Enough, ſaid Sir Philip, I am ſatisfied that you will. I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to reſide myſelf in that very apartment which my dear friend your father inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I will tread in his footſteps, and think he ſees me acting his part in his ſon's family. I will be attended by my own ſervants; and, whenever you deſire it, I will give you my company; your joys, your griefs ſhall be
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:032742_0204_0FF50D7518F97A78"/>
mine, I ſhall hold your children in my arms, and their prattle ſhall amuſe my old age: And, as my laſt earthly wiſh, your hands ſhall cloſe my eyes.—Long, very long, ſaid Edmund (with eyes and hands lifted up) may it be ere I perform ſo ſad a duty!—Long and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py may you live together, ſaid the Baron! I will hope to ſee you ſometimes, and to claim a ſhare in your bleſſings. But let us give no more tears to ſorrow, the reſt ſhall be joy and tranſport. The firſt ſtep we ſhall take ſhall be to marry our Edmund; I will give orders for the celebration, and they ſhall be the laſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders I ſhall give in this houſe. They then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, and went to prepare for the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſolemnity.</p>
            <p>Sir Philip and the Baron had a private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference concerning Edmund's aſſuming the name and title of Lovel. I am reſolved, ſaid Sir Philip, to go to the King; to acquaint him briefly with Edmund's hiſtory; I will requeſt that he may be called up to parliament by a writ, for there is no need of a new patent, he being the true inheritor; in the mean time he ſhall aſſume the name, arms, and title, and I will anſwer any one that ſhall diſpute his right to them. Sir Philip then declared his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſet out with the Baron at his departure, and to ſettle all his other affairs before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to take up his reſidence at the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>A few days after, the marriage was celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to the entire ſatisfaction of all parties. The
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:032742_0205_0FF50D83235B3D30"/>
Baron ordered the doors to be thrown open, and the houſe free for all comers; with every token of joy and feſtivity. Edmund appeared full of joy without levity, and of mirth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extravagance; he received the congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of his friends, with eaſe, freedom, and vivacity. He ſent for his foſter father and mother, who began to think themſelves ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, as he had been ſo deeply engaged in affairs of more conſequence, that he had not been particularly attentive to them; he made them come into the great hall, and preſented them to his Lady.</p>
            <p>Theſe, ſaid he, are the good people to whom I am, under God, indebted for my preſent happineſs; they were my firſt benefactors; I was obliged to them for food and ſuſtenance in my childhood, and this good woman nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed my infancy at her own breaſt. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy received them graciouſly, and ſaluted Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery. Andrew kneeled down, and, with great humility, begged Edmund's pardon for his treatment of him in his childhood. I heartily forgive you, ſaid he, and I will excuſe you to yourſelf; it was natural for you to look upon me as an intruder, that was eating your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's bread; you ſaved my life, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you ſuſtained it by your food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I ought to have maintained myſelf, and to have contributed to your maintenance. But, beſides this, your treatment of me was the firſt of my preferment; it recommended me to the notice of this noble family: Every thing th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

happened to me ſince, has been a ſtep to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of honour and happineſs. Never man had ſo many benefactors as myſelf; but both they, and myſelf, have been only inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the hands of Providence, to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout its own purpoſes: Let us praiſe God for all! I ſhared your poverty and you ſhall ſhare my riches; I will give you the cottage where you dwell, and the ground about it; I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo pay you the annual ſum of ten pounds for the lives of you both; I will put out your children to manual trades, and aſſiſt you to provide for them in their own ſtation; and you are to look upon this as paying a debt and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing a gift: I owe you more than I can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pay: and, if there be any thing further in my power that will contribute to your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, you can aſk nothing in reaſon that I will deny you.</p>
            <p>Andrew hid his face: I cannot bear it! ſaid he: Oh what a brute was I, to ſuch a child as this! I ſhall never forgive myſelf!—You muſt indeed, my friend, for I forgive and thank you. Andrew retired back, but Margery came for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; ſhe looked earneſtly on Edmund, ſhe then threw her arms about his neck, and wept aloud—My precious child! my lovely babe! thank God, I have lived to ſee this day! I will rejoice in your good fortune, and your bounty to us, but, I muſt aſk one more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

ſo far as to give thee food from my own breaſt, and to bring thee up to be a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to me, and to all that know thee! Edmund was affected, he returned her embrace; he bade her come to the Caſtle as often as ſhe pleaſed, and ſhe ſhould always be received as his mother; the bride ſaluted her, and told her the oftener ſhe came, the more welcome ſhe ſhould be. Margery and her huſband re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, full of bleſſings and prayers for their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; ſhe gave vent to her joy, by relating to the ſervants and neighbours every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Edmund's birth, infancy, and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: Many a tear was dropped by the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and many a prayer wafted to Heaven for his happineſs. Joſeph took up the ſtory where ſhe left it; he told the riſing dawn of youth and virtue, darting its rays through the clouds of obſcurity, and how every ſtroke of envy and malignity bruſhed away ſome part of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that veiled its luſtre: He told the ſtory of the haunted apartment, and all the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it; how he and Oſwald conveyed the youth away from the caſtle, no more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn till he came as maſter of it: he cloſed the tale with praiſe to heaven for the happy diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, that gave ſuch an heir to the houſe of Lovel; to his dependants ſuch a Lord and Maſter; to mankind a friend and benefactor. There was truly a houſe of joy; not that falſe kind, in the midſt of which there is heavineſs, but that of rational creatures, grateful to the ſupreme benefactor, raiſing their minds, by a
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:032742_0208_0FF50DB8EC19BBE0"/>
due enjoyment of earthly bleſſings, to a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for a more perfect ſtate hereafter.</p>
            <p>A few days after the wedding, the Lord Fitz-Owen began to prepare for his journey to the north. He gave to Edmund the plate, linen, and furniture of the Caſtle, the farming ſtock and utenſils: he would have added a ſum of money, but Sir Philip ſtopped his hand:—We do not forget, ſaid he, that you have other children, we will not ſuffer you to injure them; give us your bleſſing and paternal affection, and we have nothing more to aſk:—I told you, my Lord, that you and I ſhould one day be ſincere friends.—We muſt be ſo, anſwered the Baron; it is impoſſible to be long your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy: We are brothers, and ſhall be to our lives end.</p>
            <p>They regulated the young man's houſehold; the Baron gave leave to the ſervants to chooſe their maſter; the elder ones followed him (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Joſeph, who deſired to live with Edmund, as the chief happineſs of his life;) moſt of the younger ones choſe the ſervice of the youthful pair. There was a tender and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate parting on all ſides. Edmund be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought his beloved William not to leave him. The Baron ſaid, he muſt inſiſt on his being at his brother's wedding, as a due attention to him; but after that he ſhould return to the Caſtle for ſome time.</p>
            <p>The Baron and Sir Philip Harclay, with their train ſet forward. Sir Philip went to
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:032742_0209_0FF50DCA5BFCDB20"/>
London and obtained all he deſired for his Edmund; from thence he went into Yorkſhire, and ſettled his affairs there, removing his pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners to his other houſe, and putting Lord Fitz-Owen in poſſeſſion of his own. They had a generous contention about the terms; but Sir Philip inſiſted on the Baron's accepting the uſe of every thing there: You hold it in truſt for a future grand-child, ſaid he, whom I hope to live to endow with it.</p>
            <p>During Sir Philip's abſence, the young Lord Lovel cauſed the haunted apartment to be repaired and furniſhed for the reception of his father by adoption. He placed his friend Joſeph over all his men ſervants, and ordered him to forbear his attendance; but the old man would always ſtand at the ſide-board, and feaſt his eyes with the countenance of his own maſter's ſon, ſurrounded with honour and happineſs. John Wyatt waited upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Lord, and enjoyed his favour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out abatement. Mr. William Fitz-Owen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied Sir Philip Harclay from the north country, when he returned to take up his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence at the Caſtle of Lovel.</p>
            <p>Edmund, in the arms of love and friendſhip, enjoyed with true reliſh the bleſſings that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded him, with an heart overflowing with benevolence to his fellow-creatures, and rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of gratitude to his creator. His Lady and himſelf were examples of conjugal affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and happineſs. Within a year from his marriage ſhe brought him forth a ſon and heir,
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:032742_0210_0FF50DD7DF27BD10"/>
whoſe birth renewed the joy and congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all his friends: The Baron Fitz-Owen came to the baptiſm, and partook of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's bleſſings. The child was called Arthur, after the name of its grand-father.</p>
            <p>The year following was born a ſecond ſon who was called Philip Harclay; upon him the noble Knight of that name ſettled his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in Yorkſhire; and by the King's permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he took the name and arms of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
            <p>The third ſon was called William; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited the fortune of his uncle of that name, who adopted him, and made the Caſtle of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel his reſidence, and died a bachelor.</p>
            <p>The fourth ſon was called Edmund; the fifth Owen; and there was alſo one daughter called Emma.</p>
            <p>When time had worn out the prejudices of Sir Robert Fitz-Owen, the good old Baron of that name propoſed a marriage between his eldeſt ſon and heir, and the daughter of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Lord Lovel, which was happily conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The nuptials were honoured with the preſence of both families; and the Old Baron was ſo elevated with this happy union of his deſcendants, that he cried out—Now I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to die! I have lived long enough! this is the band of love that unites all my children to me, and each other! he did not long ſurvive this happy event; he died full of years and honours, and his name was never mentioned but with the deepeſt marks of gratitude, love
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:032742_0211_0FF50DF24754F400"/>
and veneration. Sweet is the remembrance of the virtuous, and happy are the deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of ſuch a father! they will think on him, and emulate his virtues; they will remember him, and be aſhamed to degenerate from their anceſtor.</p>
            <p>Many years after Sir Philip Harclay ſettled at the Caſtle he received tidings from his friend Zadiſky, by one of the two ſervants who attended him to the Holy Land. From him he learned that his friend had diſcovered, by private advices, that he had a ſon living in Paleſtine, which was the chief motive of his leaving England; that he had met with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous adventures in purſuit of him; that at length he found him, converted him to the Chriſtian religion, and then perſuaded him to retire from the world into a monaſtery by the ſide of mount Libanus; where he intended to end his days.</p>
            <p>That Walter, commonly called Lord Lovel, had entered into the ſervice of the Greek Emperor, John Paleologus, not bearing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo a life of ſolitude and retirement; that he made up a ſtory of his being compelled to leave his native country by his relations, for having accidentally killed one of them, and that he was treated with great cruelty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice; that he had accepted a poſt in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's army, and was ſoon after married to the daughter of one of the chief officers of it.</p>
            <p>Zadiſky foreſaw, and lamented the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of that empire, and withdrew from the
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:032742_0212_0FF50D4735C390A8"/>
ſtorm he ſaw approaching. Finally, he bade the meſſenger tell Sir Philip Harclay and his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted ſon, that he ſhould not ceaſe to pray for them, and deſire their prayers in return.</p>
            <p>Sir Philip deſired Lord Lovel to entertain this meſſenger in his ſervive. That good Knight lived to extreme old age in honour and happineſs, and died in the arms of his beloved Edmund: who alſo performed the laſt duties to his faithful Joſeph.</p>
            <p>Father Oſwald lived many years in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily as chaplain; he retired from thence at length, and died in his own monaſtery.</p>
            <p>Edmund Lord Lovel lived to old age, in peace, honour, and happineſs, and died in the arms of his children.</p>
            <p>Sir Philip Harclay cauſed the papers relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his ſon's hiſtory to be collected toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the firſt part was written under his own eye in Yorkſhire, the ſubſequent parts by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Oſwald at the Caſtle of Lovel. All theſe, when together, furniſh a ſtriking leſſon to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, of the over-ruling hand of Providence, and the certainty of RETRIBUTION.</p>
