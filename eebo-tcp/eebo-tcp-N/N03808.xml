            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>— If ye loved me, ye would rejoyce, becauſe I ſaid, I go to the FATHER.—</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THEY are the Words of our bleſſed SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR; and he ſpake them to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, at a Time, when their <hi>Hearts were troubled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Caſe was this: The Hour being juſt come, in which he knew, he ſhould depart out of the World, he tho't proper to acquaint his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples with it. <hi>Yet a little while,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I am with you.</hi> And again, <hi>Whither I go ye cannot come</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Preceeding Chap. Ver 33.</note>. At this ſad, and unexpected News, they were filled with Grief. They could not bear the Tho't of parting with ſo dear a Friend, ſo good a Maſter and Lord.</p>
            <p>Upon which, that they might not be <hi>ſwallowed up of overmuch Sorrow,</hi> our compaſſionate SAVIOUR proceeds to ſay that, which might have a tendency
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004687_0003_100DB8D6C1AF84C0"/>
to eaſe their Minds, and make them calm and quiet. He aſſures them, <hi>in his</hi> FATHER<hi>'s Houſe were many Manſions</hi>; and that he was only going to <hi>prepare a Place,</hi> where <hi>he</hi> and <hi>they</hi> might be together for ever. <hi>I go,</hi> ſays he, Context, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, <hi>to prepare a Place for you. And if I go, and prepare a Place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto my ſelf, that where I am, there ye may be alſo</hi> As if he had ſaid, "Tho' I am going from you, 'tis only for a Time; and this, in order to your Happineſs, to prepare <hi>Manſions</hi> of Glory for you: Nor will it be long before I ſhall ſee you again, and admit you into <hi>my</hi> FATHER<hi>'s Houſe</hi>; when there ſhall never more be a Seperation between us. A moſt refreſhing Conſideration this! enough to compoſe their Spirits, and make them chearful at parting with their deareſt SAVIOUR.</p>
            <p>He then, after ſome other Diſſwaſives from too much Grief, fetches Conſolation for them, in the Words of the Text, from that which was the Source of all their Sorrow on his Account, even <hi>their Love to him. If ye loved me,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ye would rejoyce, becauſe I ſaid, I go to the</hi> FATHER. 'Tis as if he had ſpoken in ſuch Language as this, "I have already told you, where I am going when I leave you; that I am going to the FATHER, to receive at his Hands, in Reward of my Services and Sufferings for the good of Men, <hi>a Name that is above every Name,</hi> at which, <hi>every Knee ſhall bow, that is in Heaven, and that is on Earth:</hi> And ſhall not this be Matter of <hi>Joy</hi> to you? If you love me, as I
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004687_0004_100DB8D8E20AF740"/>
ſee you do by the Tears you drop, at the Proſpect of my Departure from you, you cannot but <hi>rejoyce.</hi> There will, with your <hi>Sorrow,</hi> be a mixture of <hi>Joy.</hi> 'Tis fitting you ſhould rejoyce for <hi>me,</hi> if you mourn for <hi>your ſelves.</hi> Yea, your Regards to me will make you to rejoyce".</p>
            <p>The Subject fairly offering it ſelf to Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ſuited to the preſent Occaſion, is this,</p>
            <q>Love to our deceaſed, pious Friends, and Relatives, ſhould influence us to rejoyce, in Conſideration they are gone to the <hi>FATHER.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Sorrow,</hi> perhaps, we may imagine to be the moſt proper Expreſſion of Love, upon the departure of our pious Friends: And it may appear ſtrange, to hear it ſaid, we ought to <hi>rejoyce. Joy,</hi> we may think unnatural; at leaſt, very unbecoming at ſo mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Time. But we are herein greatly miſtaken. There is no Occaſion more proper for the exerciſe of <hi>religious Joy,</hi> than when our pious Relatives, tho' dear to us as our very Lives, are called out of the World: Nor is there a more generous Expreſſion of our Love towards them. This our bleſſed SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR has taught us, by ſaying to his Diſciples, <hi>if ye loved me, ye would rejoyce, becauſe I ſaid, I go to the</hi> FATHER.</p>
            <p>In proſecuting this Subject, I ſhall,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Say ſome Things tending to limit and explain the Truth of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:004687_0005_100DB8DA98349820"/>II. <hi>Illuſtrate the Force of our</hi> SAVIOUR's <hi>Argument, by ſhowing what there is in the Conſideration, that our pious, departed Friends, and Relatives are gone to the</hi> FATHER, <hi>that ſhould influence us to rejoyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole will then be followed with the APPLICATION that is proper.</p>
            <p n="1">I. In order to <hi>limit, and explain the Truth in the Text,</hi> which is the firſt Thing, let it be ſaid as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it muſt not be underſtood, as if <hi>they did not love</hi> their Friends and Relatives, who <hi>mourn</hi> their deceaſe. Oar SAVIOUR does not charge his Diſciples with want of Love to him, becauſe they were in Tears at the foretho't of hiſ Death. He knew they had a tender Affection for him; and indeed, this is ſuppos'd as the Cauſe of all their Sorrow, in the Argument, he here uſes with them. Nor may our lamenting the Deceaſe of our <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Friends, be look'd upon as an Inſtance of want of Love to them. So far from this, that the very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we mourn for them is, becauſe we <hi>love them.</hi> Love is the Spring from whence all our Tears flow: Nor, if we did not love them, ſhould we be affected with Grief at their departure from us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor, yet, is our SAVIOUR to be underſtood, as tho' he meant to <hi>prohibit our ſorrowing,</hi> at the Death of our dear Relatives. He does not find Fault with his Diſciples for expreſſing their Grief at the News of his approaching Departure. We may rather
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004687_0006_100DB8DE1096CF98"/>
ſuppoſe, he was pleaſed to think they were ſo much his Friends, and that he was like to die lamented by them. He takes Care indeed to reſtrain their Grief within due Bounds. And immoderate Sorrow is always a Fault, let the Friend or Relative, we are called to part with, be ever ſo dear. But as to the Thing it ſelf, 'tis not to be condemned. We may lawfully mourn, if we don't mourn too much; yea, all the natural Expreſſions of Sorrow, are but a decent Reſpect to the Memory of our departed Friends. 'Tis Stupidity, not true Greatneſs of Mind, to be unmoved at their Death. Our SAVIOUR him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>wept</hi> over the Grave of his <hi>dead</hi> Friend <hi>Lazarus.</hi> And that is the Remark made upon it <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> 11.36.</note> 
               <hi>Behold, how he loved him!</hi> And if Tears were a proper Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Love from our bleſſed SAVIOUR, they cannot be an unſuitable one from us. He who was <hi>once toucht with the feeling of our Infirmities,</hi> and knows our Frame, and the Weakneſs of it, will indulge us in a few Tears, on the Death of a beloved Friend; yea, he would take it ill, if we ſhould ſuffer them to die unlamented by us. To go on,</p>
            <p n="3">3. When we are bid to rejoyce on Occaſion of the Death of pious Friends and Relations, the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, we ſhould, at leaſt, <hi>mix ſome Joy with our Sorrow.</hi> Sorrow there will be, and there ought to be Joy alſo: Nor will theſe Paſſions deſtroy each other. They may both ſubſiſt in the ſame Breaſt;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004687_0007_100DB8DF99CD4150"/>
and indeed, there is juſt Reaſon, upon the Death of every valuable and pious Friend, for the Excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of both theſe different Affections. For in all ſuch Diſpenſations, there is "a <hi>dark</hi> and a <hi>bright</hi> Side"; there is <hi>"our Loſs,</hi> and <hi>their Gain":</hi> And while we <hi>mourn</hi> the one, we ſhould <hi>rejoyce</hi> at the other. When we conſider their Death in Reſpect of <hi>our ſelves,</hi> the Pleaſure and Happineſs we are deprived of, as well as the Inconveniencies, Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Troubles, we are become expoſed to, we have Reaſon to be <hi>grieved,</hi> and ought to be ſo: But when we turn our Thoughts, and take a View of their Death, in Reſpect of <hi>themſelves,</hi> the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they are freed from, and the Bleſſedneſs they are gone to partake of, there is proper Occaſion for <hi>Joy,</hi> and we ought, in Love to them, to <hi>rejoyce.</hi> But there may be a further Meaning in the Words. Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="4">4. When Love to our departed Friends is ſpoken of as that which ſhould influence us to rejoyce, the Senſe is, we ſhould <hi>rather</hi> rejoyce than mourn; our Joy ſhould be <hi>greater</hi> than our Sorrow. <hi>If ye loved me, ye would rejoyce.</hi> The Words are <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi>; "Ye would be in a Frame of Mind diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing you to the exerciſe <hi>rather</hi> of Joy than Grief; ye would nor <hi>ſo much</hi> mourn, as be glad and triumph." Not that an outward Joy, expreſſed in Merriment and Laughter, is here at all encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; ſo far from it, that it would be a monſtrous Incongruity, 'Tis an inward, rational Satisfaction, that our SAVIOUR would recommend; a Joy ariſing
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004687_0008_100DB8E335E17CD0"/>
from the Principles of Religion: And ſuch a Joy does moſt become us, upon Occaſion of the Death of pious, tho' the deareſt Relatives: And we ſhould <hi>chiefly</hi> be in the Exerciſe of it, as being the moſt noble, and truly <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Expreſſion of our Love to them. <q>'Tis a poor, ordinary Frame to mourn for our Dead, as ariſing from meer ſenſitive Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. One needs no Improvement of Mind in order to this. There needs neither <hi>Philoſophy</hi> nor <hi>Chriſtianity, Vertue</hi> nor <hi>Religion,</hi> to teach us this low Leſſon; but to rejoyce in their happy Change, to be glad that they are laid in a Bed of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Reſt, while we ſuffer the Loſs of their pleaſant Society; this is generous and truly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Love! This is ſuch an ingenuous greatneſs of Mind, as is only the product of <hi>divine Faith,</hi> and <hi>chriſtian Hope</hi>; which regulates our Love, and raiſes it to ſuch a Pitch, as nothing below the <hi>Grace</hi> of GOD, and the <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> can advance it to.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But having ſaid, what may be tho't ſufficient to limit, and explain the Truth in the Text, I now go on,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To illuſtrate the Force of our SAVIOUR's Argument, <hi>by ſhowing what there is, in the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that our pious, deceaſed Friends are gone to the</hi> FATHER, <hi>that ſhould influence us to rejoyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this includes in it ſeveral Things, all which are ſo many juſt Reaſons for rejoycing.</p>

Their being <hi>gone to the</hi> FATHER obviouſly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that they are <hi>ſtill alive.</hi> Tho' they are dead, their Being is not extinct; they are not fallen from their Exiſtence. Their Bodies, 'tis true, are rendred ſenſeleſs and inactive, but not ſo their Souls. Death has had no Effect upon <hi>theſe,</hi> but to tranſlate them to the other World; where they ſtill live, &amp; act more perfectly than ever. <q>'Tis with them as with the Sun; at Evening it leaves our Horizon under diſconſolate Darkneſs, and ſome weak Perſons may think it's Glory buried and extinguiſhed; but 'tis only gone to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hemiſphere, and there ſhines with as much Beauty and Brightneſs as ever.</q> A moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving Tho't this! And ſhould fill our Souls with Joy and Gladneſs. If, at Death, the Friends whom we loved like our ſelves, went out of Being; if there was now an End put to their Exiſtence, we might well <hi>refuſe to be comforted, becauſe they are not.</hi> But the Caſe is far otherwiſe. Tho' they are <hi>dead,</hi> they are <hi>yet alive:</hi> They are only <hi>gone to the</hi> FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER. And ſhall we not <hi>rejoyce</hi> at this? We may break forth in the Language of good old <hi>Jacob,</hi> upon the News of his Son <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Welfare, <hi>It is enough, be is alive.</hi> Our dead Friends are alive; they are alive with GOD in another and better World, as truly ſo as ever they were in this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their being <hi>gone to the</hi> FATHER plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that they are gone to be <hi>rewarded by him,</hi> Their full Reward they won't indeed receive, till the Day of the appearing of the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> when
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004687_0010_100DB8E745EC4410"/>
he ſhall ſay to them in thoſe Words, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from before the Foundation of the World.</hi> But they are no ſooner dead, but they begin to be happy. The Day of their Death is the Day of their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance upon the future Bleſſedneſs. So the holy Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> heard it declared by a Voice from Heaven. <hi>I heard,</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Rev. 14.13.</note> ſays he, <hi>a Voice from Heaven, ſaying unto me, write, Bleſſed are the Dead which die in the</hi> LORD <hi>from</hi> HENCEFORTH: <hi>yea, ſaith the</hi> SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT, <hi>that they may reſt from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>what is this Reward,</hi> our pious Friends and Relatives receive by <hi>going to the</hi> FATHER? To which I would ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They hereby obtain <hi>Deliverance from Sorrow and Trouble of every Kind.</hi> While <hi>here</hi> they were ſubjected to Grief and Pain, and often groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the uneaſy Burdens that were laid upon them; but being gone to the FATHER, they are forever ſet free from thoſe innumerable Diſtreſſes &amp; Sorrows, which imbitter the preſent Life, and render it ſo uncomfortable, even under the moſt advantageous Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>They have now nothing to diſquiet them; no Cares, nor Fears; no Loſſes, Croſſes, nor Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments; no painful Diſeaſes, nor pining Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; no wearineſs, nor faintneſs; neither Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004687_0011_100DB8EAB35791E8"/>
nor Thirſt. Theſe Occaſions of Grief are all paſt; they are eternally at reſt from them all.</p>
            <p>Nor are they now expos'd to thoſe <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Griefs, which once pained their pious Minds. They have no Doubts of the Love of GOD, for they are in the actual Enjoyment of it; they have no Fears leaſt they are not intereſted in the great SAVIOUR, for they are with him in PARADISE; they have no Suſpicion of their own Uprightneſs, for they have been approv'd of their Judge, and are <hi>entred into the Joy of their Lord</hi>; they have no Complaints to make of their Frailties and Imperfections, the want of Love, and Zeal, and Activity, in the Service of GOD, for they are now in his Preſence <hi>without Spot or Wrinkle,</hi> and do his Will, with like Perfection, as do the holy Angels.</p>
            <p>Neither are our departed pious Friends liable to Grief, on Account of thoſe Effects of their Death, that are apt to trouble us. We are touch'd with Concern and Pity to ſee them called away from their earthly Poſſeſſions, and worldly Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; we are grieved to behold their Ghaſtlineſs and Deformity, and weep bitterly when they are laid in the Grave to be deſtroyed by Worms; we are moved with Sorrow to think, they are gone from our World, ſo that we ſhall ſee them no more, nor enjoy their Society which was once ſo pleaſant to us. We often ſpeak of ſuch Things as theſe; or, at leaſt, employ our melancholy Thoughts upon them: But ſo do not they. It troubles them not, they have left this Earth, with its greateſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004687_0012_100DB8EC3B94BF20"/>
it moves them not, their Bodies are laid in the Duſt, to return to Duſt; yea, 'tis no Matter of Uneaſineſs to them, they are parted from their Husbands or Wives, once dear to them as their very Souls: Nor are they in Sorrow, they are gone from their deſirable Children, who, it may be, are become poor, helpleſs, deſtitute Orphans. <hi>We</hi> are troubled at this, and it once cauſed great Sorrow of Heart to <hi>them.</hi> They were grieved at the Tho't of leaving their beloved Children; it bore hard upon their tender Minds; they found it difficult to reconcile themſelves to the Will of Heaven in this Matter; it was one of the greateſt Trials to their Faith: But they are now above the reach of Sorrow from theſe, or any Conſiderations whatever. For being <hi>gone to the</hi> FATHER, they are in that State, where there ſhall be <hi>no more Death, neither Sorrow, nor Crying; neither ſhall there be any more Pain. They ſhall hunger no more, neither thirſt any more; neither ſhall the Sun light on them, or any Heat: for the</hi> LAMB <hi>which is in the midſt of the Throne, ſhall feed them, and ſhall lead them to Fountains of Waters: And</hi> GOD <hi>ſhall wipe away all Tears from all their Eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, ſhall we grieve for our departed Friends, who are thus delivered from the Miſeries of this evil World? Is it not <hi>rather</hi> Matter of Joy, that they are redeemed from Sin, and the unhappy Fruits of it, and are poſſeſt of eternal Eaſe and Peace? Their Death is their JUBILEE, the Year of their Releaſe from the Trials and Labours, the Vexations, Fears &amp; Hazards, which attended them
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004687_0013_100DB8EFA64F8A78"/>
in the preſent State; yea, from all manner of Evil. And ſhall we not rejoyce? We have juſt Ground for a holy Joy: And we ſhall certainly be in the Exerciſe of it, if we have any <hi>religious</hi> Love for theſe our <hi>dead</hi> Friends. If we mourn, let it be for <hi>our ſelves</hi>; as for <hi>them,</hi> there is no Cauſe of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; true Love will rather urge us to rejoyce.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By being <hi>gone to the</hi> FATHER, they are not only delivered from all Manner of Grief and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but have entred upon the Enjoyment of <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Bleſſedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being <hi>gone to the</hi> FATHER, they are gone to a <hi>bleſſed Place</hi>; called, in Scripture, ſometimes <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s <hi>Boſom</hi>; ſometimes <hi>Paradiſe</hi>; ſometimes the <hi>City, whoſe Builder and Maker is GOD.</hi> And to be ſure, 'tis a Place of exceeding great Joy &amp; Delight. For 'tis the Place, where the SUPREAM MAJESTY dwells, and has erected the Throne of his Glory, and makes the brighteſt Manifeſtations of Himſelf to the ineffable Happineſs of his Creatures.</p>
            <p>Being <hi>gone to the</hi> FATHER, they are gone to the <hi>beſt and moſt bleſſed Company.</hi> They are gone to dwell with <hi>Patriarchs, Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi>; with their pious departed <hi>Friends,</hi> and <hi>Progenitors</hi>; and with all, whom GOD, in all Ages, from the Days of <hi>Adam,</hi> has been ſelecting from among Men, and preparing to be Heirs to the future, eternal Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance; yea, they are gone to <hi>an innumerable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Angels, to</hi> JESUS <hi>the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to</hi> GOD <hi>the Judge of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:004687_0014_100DB8EE169111B0"/>Being <hi>gone to the</hi> FATHER, they are gone to the <hi>moſt noble Employment</hi>; to worſhip and ſerve the GOD that made them, without Interruption, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Wearineſs, without Sin, without the leaſt Frailty or Imperfection: Being ever full of Love, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence &amp; Obeiſance, they are ever in a Diſpoſition to the Work of Praiſe and Adoration; yea, they <hi>ceaſe not Day nor Night, ſaying, with a loud Voice, Bleſſing, and Honour, and Glory, and Power, be to</hi> HIM THAT SITTETH ON THE THRONE, <hi>and to the</hi> LAMB <hi>for ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a Word, being <hi>gone to the</hi> FATHER, they are gone to be made <hi>perfected Spirits in Glory</hi>; perfect in the Love of GOD; perfect in the Service of GOD; perfect in the Enjoyment of GOD, that GOD, <hi>in whoſe Preſence is fulneſs of Joys, and at whoſe right Hand flow Rivers of Pleaſures for ever more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſhall we now mourn for theſe our departed Friends? What is the genuine influence of true Love? Does it not put us upon wiſhing the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of our dear Relatives? And does it not conſtrain us to rejoyce, when they come to the Poſſeſſion of it? And ſhall we not then be glad, when we take a view of them, as <hi>gone to the</hi> FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, as gone to the Glories of the upper and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal World? However it may appear to an <hi>Eye of Senſe,</hi> 'tis, in the <hi>Eye of Faith,</hi> a bleſſed Truth, that our departed, <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Friends are gone to a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe</hi> of Delight, where they have <hi>perfected Spirits,</hi> and <hi>glorious Angels</hi> to converſe with; yea, and an
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004687_0015_100DB8F1C8C33D88"/>
               <hi>infinite GOD</hi> to enjoy: And are theſe fit Perſons to be lamented? O no! The greater our Love to them, the more ſhould we exult at their Felicity. Can we find in our Hearts to deſire they ſhould leave the Company of Heaven for our's? Would we, were it in our Power, recal them from the Joys of GOD's right Hand? Certainly, our Love to them will nor ſuffer us to be ſo unkind: nor ſhould we ſo much grieve for our ſelves, as rejoyce for them, that they are bleſſed in the Kingdom of their FATHER. To go on,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Truth that we are upon, that our pious, departed Friends are <hi>gone to the</hi> FATHER, ſuggeſts this further Ground of Joy, that they are <hi>gone to the ſame Place, whither we our ſelves, if good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſhall go our ſelves.</hi> Our SAVIOUR, not only tells his Diſciples, in the Context, that he was <hi>going from them</hi>; but adds for their Conſolation, <hi>that where he was, there they ſhould be alſo</hi>; in the ſame Place, with the ſame FATHER. This alſo is our Comfort upon the Death of pious Relatives. Where they are gone, we ſhall go our ſelves, if Partakers of the ſame Faith and Holineſs with them. They are not gone where we cannot come, but to the "ſame Harbour we are bound to, and are upon our Voyage for; Nay, where we our ſelves have already <hi>caſt Anchor,</hi> by a ſtedfaſt Hope, tho' we are not yet landed, as they are". And what a Motive to Joy is this? Whither could we wiſh our Friends, but where they are gone? They are gone to the very Place, we call our <hi>Home</hi>; to the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004687_0016_100DB8F3ECEF2898"/>
very Place, whither we are haſtening our ſelves; yea, to the very Place, which is the great Object of our Deſires and Hopes, of our Prayers and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. O what a joyful Conſideration is this! How ſhould it fill our Hearts with Gladneſs! 'Tis Love to our Friends that makes us grieve, becauſe they are gone from us: and ſhould not the ſame Principle cauſe us to rejoyce alſo? ſince they are gone, where we ſhall ſee them again, and live with them again, and that for ever. If we are our ſelves truly pious, having good Hope towards God, it will be Matter of Joy to us, upon the Death of chriſtian Relatives, to extend our View to GOD's eternal Kingdom, in expectation of Meeting, and dwelling with them in that bleſſed Place.</p>
            <p>The APPLICATION yet remains. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. How <hi>joyful</hi> ſhould be the tho't of dying to <hi>Chriſtians themſelves!</hi> To be ſure, if they ſhould rejoyce, that their departed pious Friends are <hi>gone to the</hi> FATHER, they ſhould much more rejoyce at the Tho't of going there themſelves. And yet, how far are they, commonly, from being joyful on this Account? How unwelcome, to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Chriſtians, is the Tho't of dying, the one only way of <hi>going to the</hi> FATHER? When laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Bed of Sickneſs, and bro't within View of the Grave, how unwilling to go the Way, whence they ſhall not return? How earneſt in their Requeſts for a longer Reprieve? But 'tis certainly a Shame for Chriſtians, who are favoured with ſuch bleſſed
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004687_0017_100DB8F5AF9EEB00"/>
Hopes, to be unwilling to die. The Tho't of Death ſhould be pleaſant to them; they ſhould reflect upon going out of the World, with a holy triumph of Soul, as knowing they are <hi>going to the</hi> FATHER, to have all Tears wiped away from their Eyes, and to be crowned with Glory, Honour, &amp; Immortality, in GOD's everlaſting Kingdom.</p>
            <p>If we were clearly ſatisfied of this, we may be ready to ſay, we ſhould be <hi>willing rather to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Body.</hi> Our <hi>Deſire would be to depart, and to be with</hi> CHRIST, <hi>which is far better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it muſt be acknowledged, 'tis only a <hi>good Hope,</hi> that we are in the Number of thoſe, who when they die, will go to <hi>be with the</hi> FATHER, and <hi>with his Son</hi> JESUS CHRIST, that can make the Tho't of dying ſet upon our Minds with Eaſe and Comfort. This therefore we ſhould endeavour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>giving all Diligence,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> exhorts, <note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Pet. 1.10.</note> 
               <hi>to make our Calling &amp; Election ſure.</hi> And the more watchfull we are over our own Hearts and Lives; the more we keep upon our Guard againſt Sin, and all the Temptations to it; the more we give our ſelves to Prayer, and an Attendance on the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of Religion; the more frequently we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the Acts of our Repentance towards GOD, and Faith in our LORD JESUS CHRIST; and in a Word, the more we take off our Affections from the Earth, and the more we have our Converſation in Heaven,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004687_0018_100DB8F7E4725280"/>
the more likely we ſhall be, to come to a fix'd, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Hope of our good Eſtate GODWARD: And having this <hi>good Hope thro' Grace,</hi> we ſhall have no Cauſe of Fear upon the Proſpect of Death; but may, at any Time, welcome a Meſſage to leave all Things here below; rejoycing in the Tho't, that we are now <hi>going to the</hi> FATHER: And we ſhall have the more Reaſon for this, as ſo many of our dear Relatives are gone before us. The Departure of every pious, amiable Friend, is a freſh incentive to our Deſires to follow after, ſince we ſhall go to the FATHER, and to <hi>them</hi> too: Nor can it be, but that the Tho't of Death ſhould be highly pleaſant to us, while we reflect upon it, as that which will tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate us to thoſe Friends above, whom we loved ſo much here below.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such are taught to be in the exerciſe of <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Joy,</hi> whom it has pleaſed GOD <hi>to bereave of pious Friends and Relatives.</hi> This, I confeſs, is no eaſy Attainment. Our Paſſions are apt to be ſoon in a Tumult; and too commonly, our Voice is that of Lamentation and Mourning. But we ought, certainly, at ſuch a Time, to keep our ſelves under the Reſtraints of Reaſon and Religion; and tho' we are allowed to mourn, it ſhould not be as thoſe who have no Hope; yea, having ſo good a Hope of it's being well with them, in the Kingdom of their FATHER, we ſhould rejoyce: Our Love to them ſhould conſtrain us to do ſo. The Tho't, that they are <hi>gone</hi> to participate of the Pleaſures that flow at GOD's right Hand, ſhould be grateful to us. There is Joy among all their Friends in the upper
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004687_0019_100DB8FB5F062768"/>
World, upon their arrival at that bleſſed Place. JESUS their SAVIOUR, and LORD, has welcom'd them to his <hi>heavenly</hi> FATHER's <hi>Houſe</hi>; holy <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect,</hi> have congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated them on their admiſſion to their Society. And ſhall we alone be dejected with Sorrow? Let us rather join in a Song of Praiſe <hi>to him, who has loved them, and waſhed them from their Sins in his own Blood, and hath made them Kings &amp; Prieſts unto</hi> GOD, <hi>and his</hi> FATHER.</p>
            <p>But I would be particular here in recommending this Duty of <hi>holy Joy</hi> to thoſe, who were the near Friends and Relatives of that <hi>amiable Perſon,</hi> whom we followed to the Grave the laſt Week. Not that I mean to fault you, becauſe your <hi>Hearts are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi> at her Departure. <hi>Nature</hi> leads to this, nor does <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> forbid it. The bleſſed JESUS did himſelf <hi>weep,</hi> on Occaſion of the Death of a beloved Friend: And he won't be  diſpleas'd, if you alſo are in <hi>Tears.</hi> You have indeed juſt Cauſe of Grief; and if you grieve much, 'twill be the more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, as the lovely Perſon, whoſe Deceaſe calls you to lament, had united in her all the Attractives to Eſteem and Love while living, as well as the ſtrongeſt Excitements to a pungent Senſe of Sorrow, now the holy GOD has removed her from you.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible, it will open the Springs of Grief in you, if I bring to Remembrance thoſe Things, in your departed Friend, and dear Relative, which render'd her ſo much the Delight of all acquainted
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004687_0020_100DB8FDC4645BF0"/>
with her: Yet, in Juſtice to her Memory, I can't forbear ſaying, The GOD, who made her, was pleas'd to give her a comely Body, ſo that <hi>none was more praiſed for Beauty than ſhe</hi>; but the Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of her <hi>Soul</hi> were far more worthy of Notice, as they were of ſuperior Excellence. She had a good Underſtanding; a Wit that was ſprightly, yet conjoin'd with ſolidity of Judgment, and a becoming Tho'tfulneſs; the effect whereof was, her being cheerful and pleaſant, yet ſerious and grave; free and open, yet prudently cautious and reſerv'd.</p>
            <p>She was ſingularly <hi>ſweet</hi> in the Temper of her Mind; not ſoon angry, never peviſh, never cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous: but on the contrary, calm and placid; poſſeſſing a ſerene Breaſt her ſelf, and making all eaſy who were about her.</p>
            <p>Her whole Deportment was agreable; and ſhe particularly ſet a good Example in filling up the ſeveral Relations ſhe ſuſtained, with the Virtues proper to them: As a <hi>Friend,</hi> ſincere in her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, true and faithful: As a <hi>Wife,</hi> engaging in her Carriage, reverent and dutiful: As a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> tender and affectionate, yet exerciſing all due Authority over her Children: As <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> in the Family, prudent in her Oeconomy, yet generous and noble; a promoter of good Order; mindful of all under her Care; compaſſionate to her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: In her treatment of <hi>Viſitants,</hi> hoſpitable, courteous, pleaſant and obliging.</p>
            <p>But what is more than all, ſhe was, in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe beſt acquainted with her, <hi>a real,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004687_0021_100DB9000A1807B8"/>
ſerious Chriſtian.</hi> She all along, in her Life, behaved as ſuch; and eminently ſo, under that grievous Trial, it pleaſed the holy and righteous GOD to bring upon her, in the Sickneſs whereof ſhe died. Thoſe, who were then moſt about her, ſpeak high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of her patient and quiet Spirit; wondering, ſhe complained no more, diſcovered no greater Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: when, by Reaſon of that CANCER, which <hi>eat up her Fleſh,</hi> ſhe might have wearied them out with her groanings.</p>
            <p>She often took Occaſion, as is certainly proper for ſuch imperfect, ſinful Creatures, as the beſt of us all are; eſpecially, when upon the Confines of another World: I ſay, ſhe often took Occaſion to look back, not only upon her paſt <hi>Life,</hi> but <hi>Frame of Heart</hi>; and wherein ſhe tho't any Thing had been amiſs, ſhe was free to judge and condemn her ſelf, and humbly and penitently repaired to the Mercy of GOD, thro' the Merits of the GREAT SAVIOUR: And tho', for a Time, ſhe had a Fear upon her Spirit, reſpecting her eternal State; yet, her Fear was mixed with Hope: And ſhe was, at length, in a good Meaſure, raiſed above Fear. She appeared, upon the near Approaches of Death, to be intirely reſigned to the Will of Heaven; and ſuch was the compoſure of her Mind, that ſhe was able, with all freedom, to ſpeak of her <hi>own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe,</hi> and to give Directions about her <hi>Interment:</hi> which, when ſhe had done, ſhe ſet her ſelf to the Work of dying. And as, we truſt, ſhe LIVED TO CHRIST, we charitably hope and believe, ſhe DIED IN HIM; and is now <hi>gone to the</hi> FATHER.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:004687_0022_100DB9019F349DF0"/>You, her Friends, believe thus concerning her: And while theſe are your Hopes; while, by an Eye of Faith, you look beyond Death and the Grave, and view your dear Relative, as gone into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, to take Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Inheritance incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away,</hi> we may well ſuppoſe, you grieve not for her, but rejoyce; rejoyce that ſhe is got beyond the reach of Sin and Sorrow, and is entred upon the <hi>Reward of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> which is <hi>Joy and Peace, Quietneſs and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for ever:</hi> nor can it be tho't, you ſo much as wiſh for her back again, into ſuch a World of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Vexation, Diſtreſs and Trouble, as this is that we live in.

            <p>We pray GOD to return in ſafety his Servant moſt nearly allied to the Perſon deceaſed; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him for the ſorrowful News that waits for him, and to ſanctify it to him; teaching him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from the Vanity and Uncertainty of all earthly Enjoyments, and exciting him to place his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,

We are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from preſented with a very lively and affecting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of humane Frailty. It ſhould awaken our Conſideration, and make us ſeriouſly tho'tful of another World. That is the Call of GOD to us all, <hi>Be ye alſo ready.</hi> But this is the Voice of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in a particular Manner, to us, who are in the height of our Strength and Vigour. O let us take the Warning GOD is giving us! Let us learn herefrom our liableneſs to be taken away, by ſome fatal Stroke, in the midſt of our Days: And let us give our ſelves no Eaſe, till we have got into ſuch a State, as that it might be happy for us, if ſo it ſhould pleaſe the ſovereign Lord of Life.</p>
            <p>And let the <hi>Daughters of Zion</hi> hear the Voice of GOD, yet more particularly directed to them. You
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004687_0024_100DB9082CC80510"/>
are herefrom taught, that, at your beſt Eſtate, you are altogether Vanity; that you are in Death, in the midſt of Life. And O live, as it is proper ſuch frail, dying Creatures ſhould live! — Let your Behaviour be as becometh Godlineſs. — Get your ſelves poſſeſs'd of real and ſubſtantial Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; that, as the <hi>King's Daughter,</hi> you may be <hi>all glorious within.</hi> — Be ſober, diſcreet, chaſts, exemplary for all good Works.— And <hi>your adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> let it not be that outward adorning of <hi>plaiting the Hair,</hi> and of <hi>wearing of Gold,</hi> or of <hi>putting on of Apparrel</hi>; but let it be the <hi>hidden Man of the Heart,</hi> in that which is not corruptible, even the Ornament of a <hi>meek and quiet Spirit,</hi> which is in the Sight of GOD of great Price. For after this Manner, in old time, the <hi>holy Women,</hi> who truſted in <hi>God, adorned</hi> themſelves: <hi>whoſe Daughters ye are, as long as ye do well.</hi>— But I muſt haſten,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Near Relations ſhould be excited, from what has been diſcours'd, ſo to live together, as that when parted by Death, there may be Ground of Joy to thoſe, whoſe Lot it is to ſurvive. Death will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſooner or later diſſolve our Relations; ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating between the neareſt and deareſt Friends. And what will be able to afford Comfort to thoſe who ſurvive, but the Conſideration, that their Friends departed, are <hi>gone to the</hi> FATHER? O how lamentable is the Condition of thoſe, and how much to be pitied, who mourn for wicked, tho' near Relatives, who, they are afraid, are gone to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004687_0025_100DB90A71160270"/>
the Place of blackneſs of Darkneſs! where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched. No wonder, where this is the Caſe, if pious Minds are bowed down greatly.</p>
            <p>Is it the Character of any of us, who are nearly related to each other, that we lead ſinful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy Lives? O let it have ſome Influence upon us, to engage us to repent and turn from our evil Ways, to think, if we ſhould be called to depart hence, what Grief of Heart we ſhould occaſion to our ſurviving Chriſtian Friends. If we are ſeized with Sickneſs, they tremble for us, as knowing the hazard of our <hi>Souls,</hi> as well as Bodies: And if we are ſmitten with Death, they are filled with Diſtreſs and Agony, and can take no Comfort, as fearing we are gone to be made miſerable in the Place of future Torment. O let us have Compaſſion upon our pious Friends, who love us, and wiſh us well as our own Souls! And let us, for their ſakes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have after ſuch a manner, as that they may have Joy in us both living and dying.</p>
            <p>O let us all, both Husbands and Wives, Parents and Children, Brethren and Siſters, be intreated to live together <hi>as Heirs of the Grace of Life!</hi> — Let us be ſincere and faithful in filling up the Relation we bear to each other, with all that Duty, which, as Chriſtians, is expected from us. — Let us encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage one another in every Thing that is ſerious and godly.— Let us be mutual Helps to each other, by Converſation, by Prayer, by good Example,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004687_0026_100DB90C1F445178"/>
in the way to GOD's heavenly Kingdom: ſo ſhall we have a good Hope as to the good State of each other; and whoever are called out of the World firſt, they who ſurvive may rejoyce, while by Faith, they behold their departed Friends, as gone to <hi>their</hi> FATHER, <hi>and our</hi> FATHER; <hi>to their</hi> GOD, <hi>and our</hi> GOD, to be happy, eternally happy in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him.</p>
            <p>And now, as the Concluſion of all,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let me call upon you to be <hi>thankful</hi> to GOD for JESUS CHRIST. For 'tis owing to <hi>Him</hi> and his <hi>bleſſed Goſpel,</hi> that we are able to take Comfort in the Tho't of Death, reſpecting either our ſelves, or our dear Relatives. If it were not for CHRIST, we had not known, that Death, in regard of <hi>good Men,</hi> was nothing <hi>worſe than going to the Father</hi>; which Notion of Death carries in it all the Support and Comfort, we can deſire. We may now rejoyce in the Expectation of dying our ſelves, or at the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of our neareſt and moſt beloved Relatives, if <hi>Believers in</hi> CHRIST.</p>
            <p>And what tho' at Death, the Body is laid in the Duſt, and returns to Duſt, ſo long as JESUS the SAVIOUR has aſſured us, that <hi>this is the</hi> FATHER's <hi>Will, which ſent him, that of all which was given him, he ſhould loſe nothing; but will raiſe it up again at the laſt Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Death indeed is a horror of Darkneſs, to thoſe who can look no farther than the Grave: But to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004687_0027_100DB90F09F04FC0"/>
us who are favoured with the Goſpel, which has <hi>brought Life and Immortality to Light,</hi> a <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>happy Immortality,</hi> in reſpect of all the <hi>true Followers</hi> of CHRIST, there is Comfort in Death, for that there is Hope beyond the Grave; yea, and of <hi>that which is laid in the Grave:</hi> For the Time is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and it haſtens apace, when that which is <hi>ſown in Corruption,</hi> ſhall be <hi>raiſed in Incorruption</hi>; when that which is <hi>ſown in Diſhonour,</hi> ſhall be <hi>raiſed in Glory</hi>; when that which is <hi>ſown in Weakneſs,</hi> ſhall be <hi>raiſed in Power</hi>; when that which is <hi>ſown a natural Body,</hi> ſhall be <hi>raiſed a ſpiritual Body: So when this corruptible ſhall have put on Incorruption, and this mortal ſhall have put on Immortality, then ſhall be brought to paſs the ſaying, that is written, Death is ſwallowed up in Victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which Account, let all who are the faithful Servants of GOD, and ſincere Diſciples of CHRIST, unite in that Song of Triumph, <hi>O Death! where is thy Sting? O Grave! where is thy Victory? The Sting of Death is Sin, and the Strength of Sin is the Law. But Thanks be to GOD, which giveth us the Victory, thro' our</hi> LORD JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore, my beloved Brethren, be ye ſtedfaſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, always abounding in the Work of the</hi> LORD, <hi>for as much as ye know, that your Labour is not in vain in the</hi> LORD.</p>
