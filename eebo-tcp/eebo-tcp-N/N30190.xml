            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>How will the Saints Triumph at the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Day and Praiſe God for his finding out ſuch a way for their Redemption?</p>
            <p>But what an Amazing Day will it be to the Wicked, when they ſhall Crawl out of their Graves like Toads? (as I read in a Book) and will then call to the Saints and ſay, Take us along with you! But the Devils will catch them away to Hell and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:040101_0009_10162BBE24A0CCF0"/>there they muſt be Barred in Hell amongſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and Damned Souls.</p>
            <p>At another time, as declaring her own Spiritual diſcerning, ſo giving good Counſel to People, which ſhe was Enabled wonderfully to do. Eſpecially to give good Counſel to Young People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>She ſaid to this purpoſe,</hi> I ſee that Eternity is Boundleſs and Endleſs, ſo as I never did ſee it before. Were it not for Eternity, the Saints in Heaven could not be happy.</p>
            <p>And ſpeaking with reſpect to the never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ending Joys the Saints have in Heaven, ſhe alſo ſaid, <hi>Oh! That I were with them Praiſing of GOD. When millions of millions of Years are at an End, their Joys are as freſh as at their firſt Entring.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſhe ſaid to them that were Preſent with her, to this purpoſe;</hi> If you did but ſee what Amiableneſs there is in Jeſus Chriſt! Sweet Jeſus Christ! He is altogether Lovely. His Grace is much better than Gold. Gold is not to be mentioned with it. It is Chriſt that Beautifies and Adorns the Soul by His Grace and makes it
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:040101_0010_10162B9921240DF8"/>to ſhine. If you did but ſee how Heaven ſhines, the Angels ſhining, and the Saints with their white Robes and white Garments! Oh! That perſons would mind their precious Souls. Oh! what a precious thing is the Soul? Oh! The never Ending Eternity. Oh! That God would help me this once more to Praiſe Him, that I might warn Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their danger of Periſhing. O that any Soul ſhould Periſh! That any of the <hi>Indians</hi> Souls ſhould go to Hell! That there ever ſhould be a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thought, or a wicked Word ſpoken! Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there is none Perfect, that can live without Sin. Sin dwells in perſons and will be always warring and fighting: but by the ſtrength of Chriſt perſons can overcome. Perſons mind the World; but Heaven ſhould be in their thoughts and mind, and in their ſpeech and diſcourſe. They ſhould talk of nothing of the World but what is neceſſary. They ſhould keep Chriſt neareſt their hearts, the World under their feet, and Eternity in their eye.</p>
            <p>The ſin of Pride is an heinous Sin in the ſight of God, and reigns among People. Young People take care to prink and fine up their Bodies, but they have more need to take care of their Souls, to get Chriſt to ſtand their Friend. O that any ſhould put a duſt of Powder upon their Hair, or a Ribbon on their Caps, that have more need to put on Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth. God abhors the Proud, but it is an humble contrite Spirit that God accepts.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And ſhe deſired that their Souls might have on them the white Robes of Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and that every Soul of them preſent with her, might be waſhed clean in the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>She ſpake to them that were preſent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Judgment to come, and how that they muſt appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt to give an account of every Thing; and how Joyful it would be and Bleſſed for the Righteous then, that their Sins ſhould be blotted out. But ſhe ſpake as to the Wicked, that their Sins ſhould Condemn them, and that the Devils would drag them into Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, where he would tare and torture them; and that they ſhould ſhriek throughout the never-ending Ages of Eternity.</p>
            <p>She called to the <hi>Young People</hi> that were preſent, Warning them not to go to Frolicks, nor to ſpend their Time Idly nor Vainly, but to mind their precious Souls She told them that they ſhould improve heir precious Time and Opportunities, Sermons and Sabbaths.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:040101_0012_10162B9AB9C72728"/>She ſpake unto all in general, that were then preſent with her, Telling them that they could not Love God Enough, that they could not Serve Chriſt Enough. That if they could ſee the Infinite Love of God in Chriſt's Dying to ſave Sinners, in His ſhedding His Precious Blood ... And ſhe ſpake to them, mentioning that Chriſt ſpilt his Precious Blood on the Croſs, to Redeem Souls from Sin. And ſaying, <hi>GOD is Spotleſs and Holy and cannot look upon Sin with any Allowance. O Sin, Sin! That ever any ſhould ſin and grieve ſo good a GOD! The Holineſs, Holineſs there is in Heaven! No man without Holineſs ſhall ſee God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, At another time (it being Lord's-day-Evening, <hi>July</hi> 3<hi>d,</hi> 1720,) ſhe ſpake to this purpoſe; <hi>Oh! The Lovelineſs of Jeſus Chriſt: Chriſt has Merit Enough to Save every Body. Oh! that ever any Soul ſhould be Loſt. Oh! Let all Young People Seek God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſpeaking to the Young People then preſent in particular, ſhe ſaid to ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as followeth; <hi>That You may have on the white Robe of Christ's Righteouſneſs. Oh! That you may have Christ to Smile upon you when you come to lie on your Death-beds.

            <p>I Have cauſe to bleſs GOD, that I was Born and brought up in a Land of Light, under the joyful Sound of the Goſpel; That I was Baptized in my Infancy, being a Child of the Covenant. I have cauſe to bleſs God for my Education by my Father and Mother, who often Inſtructed me to fear God and keep his Commandments.</p>
            <p>Betwixt Seven &amp; Eight Years I was awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; ſtirred up to the duty of Secret Prayer, from the thoughts of another World.</p>
            <p>When I was about Thirteen Years of Age, God wrought in me, by His Holy Spirit, longing Deſires to come to the Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Lord's Supper. Hearing the Reverend Mr. <hi>Hale</hi> Preach from, Iſa. 1 18. <hi>Come now, let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord: though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow; though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wool</hi> I was thereby Encouraged to come to God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:040101_0020_10162BA7D7D5F590"/>I have been Encouraged, by Joh. 7.27. <hi>In the laſt day, that great day of the feaſt, Jeſus ſtood and cried, ſaying, If any man thirſt let him come unto me and drink.</hi> And by that, Mat. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. 28 <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> By theſe I was Encouraged to come to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Luk. 14 23. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Go out into the high-ways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my houſe may be filled,</hi> Was an Encouragement to me to come to the Ordinance of the LORD's SUPPER.</p>
            <p>But it being ſuch an high and holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and I having a ſenſe of my own Unworthineſs, it made me to delay coming, leſt <hi>coming Unworthily, I ſhould eat and drink Judgment to my ſelf.</hi> I was then deſiring Grace of God, that I might be fitted for it: The Preparations of the heart in man <hi>being from the LORD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When my Siſter <hi>Rebecca</hi> lay upon her Death-bed, ſhe told me that I ſhould not put off Repentance till I came to a Sick-bed. She ſaid it was no time then to prepare in for Eternity. She put me in mind of my Duty &amp; of my own Mortality.</p>
            <p>And after a while God was pleaſed to viſit me with Sickneſs, which ſeem'd to threaten my diſſolution &amp; departure out of this world, by reaſon of ſtrong Pain. I was in great
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:040101_0021_10162BCF84BE66B8"/>Darkneſs, and may ſay as the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 30 7 <hi>Thou didſt hide thy face and I was troubled.</hi> And Pſal. 11 6.3. <hi>The ſorrows of death compaſſed me. I found trouble and ſorrow.</hi> And when I thought upon my former Experiences of Chriſt's love to me, it ſeem'd to be gone from me. That place (<hi>Luk.</hi> 13.24.) came into my mind; where we read, <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate: for many, I ſay unto you, will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able.</hi> Which put me into fears leſt I ſhould not be able to enter in. But that place come into my mind, Heb. 2 18. <hi>For in that he himſelf hath ſuffered being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> And it ſeem'd to afford me ſome Encouragement.</p>
            <p>But I yet remain'd in Darkneſs; and here were many Prayers put up for me, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Mr <hi>Hale,</hi> and by my Chriſtian Friends and Neighbours And in anſwer to their Prayers, God appeared very wonderfully for me. God returning to me I immediately ſaw Heavens gate opened, Chriſt ſmiling upon me ſeem'd to welcome me to his Kingdom. I beheld Jeſus Chriſt altogether Lovely, the chiefeſt of Ten Thouſands; ſurrounded with glorious Angels And the Heavenly City the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> was brought into my view; it lay four Square, and the City was of pure tranſparent Gold: It had no need of the Sun
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:040101_0022_10162BA98AD56C18"/>or the Moon to ſhine in it for the LAMB was the Light thereof. Jeſus Chriſt was Cloathed with Glory and Majeſty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Angels ſhined with a glorious ſhining<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No Tongue can Expreſs the Glory I then behold. Oh! how I long'd to come to Heavens gate. Then I thought I could Die: That Death would be welcome and ſweet unto me. I thought I could lie in the Grave as in the ſweet Bed of Chriſt. I thought if People knew how good GOD is, they would be careful to Serve Him and would fear to Sin againſt Him</p>
            <p>Such things as I then ſaw, I Expreſſed in the time of it, as I had ſtrength; having ſuch a real ſight of things, that I even wondred that Others ſaw not with me.</p>
            <p>This was on the Tueſday, <hi>June</hi> the 18<hi>th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On a certain Night ſome time after that, I had a deep ſenſe and fore ſight of the Praiſing of God. Jeſus Chriſt was pleaſed to Viſit my Soul with his Light and Love I ſaw Light round about me. The Room ſeem'd to be full of the Preſence of Chriſt: and the holy Angels ſeem'd to be about the Bed and in the midſt of the Room.</p>
            <p>I was ſo full of the joys of Heaven, I had cauſe to bleſs God that I was Born, that ever I had a Being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I wiſh'd that every Room in the Houſe had been full of People, to help me to Praiſe God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:040101_0023_10162BD261C93B20"/>I thought the Stones of the Street, if they had ſenſe, would have ſhouted for Joy.</p>
            <p>I admired the Free grace of God in Chriſt's Undertaking for ſuch a poor wretched Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as I was.</p>
            <p>Jeſus Chriſt gave me aſſurance that He would ſtand by me and be with me, when I paſſed thro' the valley of <hi>the ſhadow of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Friday night</hi> following, God gave a wonderful ſight of Eternity, as I never ſaw Eternity look ſo before. And I ſaw it as Endleſs and Boundleſs. I ſaw all the World was haſtning apa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e into the endleſs Ocean of Eternity. I did ſee then that it was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity that made Heaven and the Saints Happy. Oh! the endleſs Joys of the Saints. I ſaw how they were there Praiſing God, and Praiſing God for ever; which made me long to be where I might Praiſe Him for ever: That I might be in his full Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, where I might behold my dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer face to face, and ſee Him as He is Lovely, Glorious and Shining. I thought that I could readily leave Father &amp; Mother, Brethren and Siſters, to go to Chriſt</p>
            <p>I ſaw that it was Eternity that made Hell and the Damned Miſerable.</p>
            <p>Jeſus Chriſt was pleaſed to give me a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of His Coming to Judge the World. I ſaw how that the Saints would ſhine and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:040101_0024_10162BADAA938558"/>gliſten at Chriſt's right Hand, made like unto his glorious Body. I ſaw how they would triumph &amp; ſing Hallelujahs unto God and to the Lamb, for finding out ſuch a way for their Salvation; which made me rejoice to think there was ſuch a glorious Day a coming, 1 Theſ 4.15 <hi>Them that ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him.</hi> Ver. 16. <hi>And the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall deſcend from heaven with a ſhout, and with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I thought I ſhould rejoice to hear the ſound of the laſt Trumpet, and to ſee Chriſt coming in the Clouds with Ten Thouſands of his Saints and Angels, with Power &amp; great Glory, to Judge the World.</p>
            <p>I ſaw what an amazing day that Day will be to the Wicked, when they ſhall ſee ſuch Lightnings, &amp; hear ſuch Thundrings, as will pierce into the very bowels of the Earth.</p>
            <p>I ſaw how the now careleſs World would ſtand trembling before their offended Judge. I ſaw how terrible the Wrath of ſuch a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Judge would at that Day be, againſt great Sinners, eſpecially goſpel Sinners, who Periſh from under the Light of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>I ſaw how the Wicked would be baniſhed from Chriſt's Preſence, and from the glory of his Power; and ſhould be ſhut down in utter Darkneſs, to be there for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:040101_0025_10162BD3FA46C708"/>I ſaw how careful Perſons ought to be, to improve their precious Time and Day of Grace, eſpecially Sabbath Opportunities &amp; Sermons; in Crying to God for Grace and Mercy now, while it is called to day, while the Lord is waiting to be gracious. For the Son of Man will come in a day and an hour when Sinners look not for him.</p>
            <p>I ſaw how Chriſt ſuffered and ſhed His Precious Blood on the Croſs, poured out his Soul even unto Death, to purchaſe Life E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal for us.</p>
            <p>I ſaw that Chriſt was able and willing to Save unto the uttermoſt, all that come unto Him, even the chiefeſt of Sinners. Although their Souls were ſtained with Sin, yet that there was Virtue enough in the ſweet Blood of Chriſt, to waſh out the ſtains of Sin, and make them clean in the ſight of God. That God delighted not in the death of a Sinner, was not willing that any ſhould Periſh, but that all ſhould be Sav'd &amp; come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth. And how that, as in Joh. 3.16. (For) <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I was made to ſee that it was Grace that adorned the Soul and made it lovely in the ſight of God. And I did ſee how Grace ſhined, that it out-ſhined the Sun in bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:040101_0026_10162BB0570FA408"/>And I ſaw that none but they that have Grace and Holineſs, ſhould enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>And I ſaw that I muſt firſt ſhine in Grace, before I could ſhine in Glory. The Beauty and Amiableneſs that I did ſee in the Lovely Jeſus! I thought if <hi>Young People</hi> did but ſee the Lovelineſs that there is in Chriſt Jeſus, it would ſoon wean their hearts from the Pride and Vanity of this world.</p>
            <p>I did ſee how that Jeſus Chriſt ſtood with his Arms open ready to receive any that wou'd come to Him: As in Prov. 8 17. <hi>I love them that love me and thoſe that ſeek me early ſhall find me.</hi> And Ver. 11. of the ſame Chap. it is ſaid, <hi>For wiſdom is better than rubies and all the things that may be deſired, are not to be compared to it.</hi> Eccl 11.9. <hi>Rejoice, O Young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes: But know thou, that for all theſe things God will bring thee into Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he gave me new Aſſurance, that I was in his Favour then. I thought if all the world was againſt me, I ſhould value it as nothing.</p>
            <p>I was enabled to ſee that it was an Honour to ſuffer for Chriſt; for them that were his Diſciples to ſuffer reproach for His ſake, and to lay down their lives, if called to it, for
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:040101_0027_10162BD6838BE1F8"/>Chriſt's ſake 1 Pet. 4.14 <hi>If ye be reproached for the name of Chriſt, happy are ye; for the ſpirit of glory and of God reſteth upon you.</hi> Rev. 7 14. <hi>Theſe are they which came out of great tribulation, and have waſhed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</hi> And as in ver. 15. <hi>Therefore are they before the throne of God, and ſerve him day and night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this I had conflicts with Satan, but that in, Rev. 2.10. <hi>Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</hi> And in, Phil. 1.6. — <hi>He which hath begun a good work in you, will perform it to the day of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Theſe Scriptures were ſtrengthning to me.</p>
            <p>God gave me to ſee by an eye of Faith, that Jeſus Chriſt was to me Juſtification, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption and Sanctification, to Juſtify me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</p>
            <p>By this God Enabled me to overcome Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans temptations, Jam. 5 11. <hi>Behold, we count them happy which endure. You have heard of the patience of</hi> Job, <hi>and have ſeen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy.</hi> Rom. 5.3, 4 <hi>But we glory in tribulation alſo, knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Scriptures ſtrengthned me to be Patient under my bodily Weakneſs. And now I can ſay, as in Pſal. 119.71. <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted: that I might
