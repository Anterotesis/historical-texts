            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>INCE it pleaſed Divine Providence ſo highly to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour me, with being the near Companion of this dear Worthy, the Author of the following Sheets, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be altogether ſilent, but muſt give ſome ſmall Account of the early Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Working of Truth in him. He was born in <hi>Keldevon</hi> in <hi>Eſſex</hi> in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> on the 23d of the 2d Month, 1676, of religious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: But he grew uneaſy with the religious Profeſſions of both Father and
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:005390_0003_10173186555EC788"/>Mother (they being of different Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions) and being a Seeker, ſell in with the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> and liked them ſo well he was near Joining them. But a Friend, a Neighbour, being dead, it ſo happen'd, that he was invited to the Burial, where that worthy Miniſter of the Goſpel, <hi>Francis Stamper</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> being led to ſpeak with Life and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er directly to his State, it made ſuch deep Impreſſions on his tender Mind, that put him upon Search into the Principles of Friends, and being fully ſatisfied, joined with them in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth Year of his Age.</p>
            <p>About the eighteenth Year of his Age, he came forth in the Miniſtry, and being faithful he grew in his Gift, fo that in ſome Time he travelled to viſit Friends in the North of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> After which he was concerned to viſit Friends in <hi>America,</hi> and having the Unity of the Brethren, embarked in the Year 1700, and was enabled by the great Hand that drew
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:005390_0004_101731355BC2CFC0"/>him forth, to perform that Service to the great Satisfaction of Friends, and the Reward of Peace in himſelf.</p>
            <p>Being then, and for ſome time after, freed from any Concern to travel in the Service of Truth, we were married to each other, <hi>viz.</hi> on the firſt Day of the Tenth Month, 1702, and ſettled at <hi>Haddonfield</hi> in the County of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> and Weſtern Diviſion of the Province of <hi>New-Jerſey.</hi> In the fore Part of his Time he travelled pretty much; but in the latter Part he was troubled with an Infirmity in his Head, which rendred him unfit for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and his Good Maſter, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no Impoſſibilities of his Servants, favoured him with being very eaſy at home; where, thro' Mercy, we lived very comfortably: For I'll venture to ſay, few, if any, in a married State, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lived in ſweeter Harmony than we did. Oh! he was a ſweet Companion indeed! A loving tender Huſband; an humble exemplary Man; a Pattern of
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:005390_0005_10173187D97CD378"/>Moderation in all Things; not lifted up with any Enjoyments, nor caſt down at Diſappointments. Oh! what ſhall I ſay of him, but that he was a Man endowed with many good Gifts, which rendered him very agreeable to his Friends, and much more to me, his Wife.— My Loſs is as far beyond my Expreſſing, as is his WORTH.</p>
            <p>Now after ſome Years (as before is obſerved) of Indiſpoſition, it pleaſed the Lord to reſtore him to a State of Health; and ſoon after he had a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to viſit Friends at <hi>Tortola.</hi> This brought on him a deep Exerciſe, but when he was confirmed it was really required of him ſo to do, he gave up to it; Home, and the Company there, which uſed to be ſo pleaſant to him, he was then weaned from. He firſt wrote to them; but finding this would not excuſe him, he durſt no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, but go he muſt. So, on the 13th of the 8th Month, 1742, we parted in the Aboundings of Love and Affection on that Occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:005390_0006_10173138AF780DC8"/>
And now, the moſt acceptable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I can give the Reader, of his Service in <hi>Tortola,</hi> is extracted from two Letters which I received from a Friend of that Place, directed to me, and to the Effect following, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>On the 8th of the 9th Month,</hi> 1742, <hi>he arrived at the Houſe of</hi> John Picker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>with his Companion</hi> John Cadwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lader, <hi>where they were received with much Love and great Joy, being made to rejoice together in the tender Mercies and Love of God, which was greatly manifeſted that Day, to the Honour and Praiſe of his great Name, and alſo to the Comforting of his poor People.—The Teſtimonies of theſe Servants of the Lord were with Life and Power, and were as Clouds fill'd with Rain upon a thirſty Land.</hi>—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to be more particular concerning thy dear Huſband, whoſe Memory is dear and precious to me, and many more whoſe Hearts were open to receive the Glad Tydings which he brought. His godly
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:005390_0007_1017313BAD0B24A8"/>Life and Converſation ſpoke him to be a true Follower of the Lamb, and Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, whom he freely preached, and by the effectual Power of whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love, was he called forth to our Aſſiſtance, for which we bleſs, praiſe and magnify the God of all our Mercies: And as a faithful Meſſenger, with much Love, in a tender Frame of Spirit, would be invite all to the Fountain which had healed him. O! the deep Humility that appeared in him in the Time of his publick Teſtimony; and when in private Converſation with his near and dear Friends, as he often ſaid we were to him, how chearful and pleaſant would he be, in that bleſſed Freedom wherein Chriſt had made him free. Innocent, harmleſs, of a chearful Countenance, yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Chriſtian Gravity well becoming the Doctrine he preached. He was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant for the Truth to the laſt, and tho' he is gone to his Grave, his Memory is ſweet and precious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He had his Health very well until the
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:005390_0008_1017314197F383F8"/>Death of his dear Companion; but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Burial, we were caught in a Shower of Rain, which we, and he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved was the Occaſion of his Illneſs. However, he was mightily favoured with the Divine Preſence, which enab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to anſwer the Service of that Day; and the next, being the firſt Day of the Week, we had a bleſſed Meeting, the Lord's Preſence accompanying us; and tho' thy dear Huſband was ſo near his End, his Candle ſhin'd as bright as ever, and many that beheld it, were made to glorify God on his Behalf. This was the laſt Opportunity on this Iſland, ſave his Farewell upon his dying Bed, where he both preached and prayed, a little before his Departure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>On the next Day, being the ſecond of the Week, he went to a little Iſland cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> Jos Vandicks, <hi>accompanied with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Friends; but on the 3d day in the Morning he complained very much, yet was enabled to go to Meeting, where were a pretty many People waiting to
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:005390_0009_10173140127599E8"/>hear the Word of Life declared, and a bleſſed Opportunity we had together, to the tendring and melting our Hearts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a heavenly Frame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he, who never ſpared his Labour whilſt amongſt us, extending his Voice as a Trumpet of the Lord's own ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was ſo inwardly ſpent he was ready to faint. However, he went on board the Sloop that Afternoon, and next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning came aſhore at our Houſe; where he had not been long before a ſhivering Fit ſeized him, and a Fever ſoon follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which kept its conſtant Courſe every Day. This being the 1ſt day of the 10th Month, he took great Notice that it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Forty Years ſince his Marriage with thee; that during that Time you had lived in much Love, and parted in the ſame; and that thou waſt his greateſt Concern of all outward Enjoyments. And tho' the laſt two Days he was in much Pain, yet he was preſerved under it in much Patience and Reſignation, and had his perfect Senſes to the laſt, exhorting
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:005390_0010_10173148F7A9F448"/>Friends to Faithfulneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And on the 6th Day of the 10th Month, about 6 a Clock at Night, he went away like a Lamb, with Praiſes and Thankſgivings in his Lips but about two Minutes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>—Thus far from the ſaid Letters.</p>
            <p>And thus finiſhed this dear Worthy in the 67th Year of his Age, at the Houſe of <hi>William Thomas</hi> on the Iſland of <hi>Tortola;</hi> highly favour'd by his great and good God in the very extreme Moments; the Conſideration whereof, and the Account given of his Service, afford me, at times, ſome Relief; but, alas! my Wound is ſo deep, nothing but the healing Balm from above can effect my Cure. My Loſs is inexpreſſible; yet ſince it is the Will of the Almighty, it becomes me to ſubmit, tho' it be hard ſo to do.</p>
            <p>Oh! a ſweet and bleſſed End indeed to go away as in Raptures of Life, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by the Almighty as a choice Flower, in full Perfection and Fragran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy! For ſure, few, if any Man, ever
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:005390_0011_101731895F0C1AD8"/>left a ſweeter Savour, both at home and abroad, than he has done: Having li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved belov'd, is gone lamented in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and therefore it is no Wonder that I, who am ſo much the greateſt Loſer, lament and bemoan my great, my great Loſs! And yet in the Midſt of all, I have a ſecret Satisfaction in that I was enabled to give him up (tho' ſo dear to me) unto the Service into which he was called. This is but juſt a Hint for thoſe who may be under the like Exerciſe and Tryal, that they may not hold back, but ſubmit, and freely give up their All, leaving the Conſequence to the wiſe diſpoſing Hand, who knows for what Cauſe it is He is pleaſed ſo nearly to try his People, ſome with Life itſelf, others near it, and the Cauſe yet hid.</p>

            <p>The laſt Viſit that he made, was to the Iſland of <hi>Tortola,</hi> where, after his Service was over, he was taken ſick, and departed this Life. And we make no doubt but that he is in the Fruition of that Glory and Happineſs which will never have an End. Almighty God, if it be conſiſtent with his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will, raiſe up, ſpirit and employ
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:005390_0015_10173190F0816778"/>more ſuch faithful Labourers in his Harveſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.38. to the Gathering of many to himſelf; and that Praiſe and Honour may be aſcribed to his great Name, who is worthy both now and forever!</p>

            <head>A CALL TO THE Unfaithful Profeſſors OF TRUTH.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE great Courage and Zeal of our worthy FRIENDS, who firſt received the Truth in this latter Age of the World, hath been often brought to my View. Many were the Hardſhips which for Chriſt's Sake they underwent,
<note place="margin">Matth. 5.11, 12.</note> yet in all they rejoyced, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005390_0019_101731956FC54750"/>upon it as a Bleſſing from God, that they were thought worthy to ſuffer for him; count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Loſs of all things but as Droſs and Dung,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.8.</note> that they might win Chriſt. Thus with their All, they purchaſed the Truth;
<note place="margin">Math. 13.44, 45, 46.</note> and having gained it were tender of it; watching over themſelves and one another in Love, ſo that no Evil might get up among them, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Growth of that pure Seed which God had ſown in their Hearts.</p>
            <p>And here,
<note place="margin">Math. 13.23.</note> as the good Ground brought they forth plentifully of thoſe Things which the great Lord of the Vineyard was well pleaſed with, who bleſſed his Work in their Hands, and gave them Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over their Enemies, adding daily to their Number, ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.
<note place="margin">Acts 2.47.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:005390_0020_10173153A9F856C8"/>
Here it may be obſerved, what bleſſed Effects Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God doth produce; by it the Heart comes to be purged from all Deceit and Filthineſs, and the Soul beautified with Righteouſneſs; and then from within,
<note place="margin">Matth: 12, 35.</note> out of the good Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Heart, are good Things brought forth: But the contrary where the Heart is not made good; for the Evil Man out of his Evil Treaſure, brings forth Evil Things (to wit) Pride, Covetouſneſs, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, Envy, Deceit, and all Things that are bad: And to my Grief, I have ſeen too much of theſe appear amongſt many, who are ſhrouding themſelves under the Profeſſion of Truth. But wo! unto you, ye falſe-hearted ones; for the Face of the Lord is againſt you, becauſe of theſe Things; and the Time is
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005390_0021_10173199FACE3EB8"/>coming, wherein you ſhall be made to know, a Profeſſion will not do, altho' it be of the Truth it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the Fear of God, I warn you all, whether Young or Old, to return in Time, before it be too late; for the Lord will not always ſtrive with you,
<note place="margin">Geneſis 6.3.</note> altho' he is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and long-ſuffering to- you-wards, and hath often viſited you both immediately and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally, laying open your Conditions before you; but Oh! how have you rejected him, and had thoſe in Deriſion, who in Love to your Souls, have in the Fear of God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reproved you, for your light and frothy Behaviour, which is out of Truth, and is prejudicial to your Souls ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Well-being: And other times, for your running into the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005390_0022_101731598F790F40"/>vain Faſhions and pernicious Ways of the World; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Evil of theſe Things hath been laid before you, from time to time, yet ſome are ſaying, they ſee no Evil in them, or that they ſhould be let alone to ſee it in themſelves: Others are crying, ſuch or ſuch things they are but ſmall Matters; and thus the Devil is endeavouring to uphold his Kingdom in you; that if poſſible he might throw down that by you, which through the Mighty of God hath been built in his faithful Children, whom he hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to his Work and qualified for his Service, who as good Soldiers are making War in Righteouſneſs againſt all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 19.4.</note> and the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of their Warfare are not carnal, but ſpiritual, and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005390_0023_1017319CF0E02948"/>mighty through God to the pulling down the ſtrong Holds of Sin and Satan, that ſo Reformation may go forward in the Nation.</p>
            <p>But ye Libertines are againſt this Work; for you are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring, to weaken the Hands of thoſe who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned therein; and thus do ye make the Hearts of thoſe ſad, whom the Lord hath not made ſad; but the Mighty God will call you to Account for theſe Things,
<note place="margin">Luke 12.49.</note> and appoint you your Portion amongſt the Unbelievers, if ye repent not: Therefore ſeek the Lord whilſt he is near,
<note place="margin">Iſai. 55.6.</note> leſt the Kingdom be rent from you; and then what will all the World avail you? ye ſhall then cry and mourn; but there will be none to pity you; for he whom you have ſlighted will ſlight you again,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005390_0024_1017315B15007700"/>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 1.26.</note> and even laugh at your Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and mock when your Fear cometh; thus will the mighty God who is juſt
<note place="margin">Ezekiel. 18.25.</note> and equal in all his Ways, deal with the rebellious Children, who take Counſel but not of
<note place="margin">Iſai. 30.1.</note> him, and that cover with a Covering but not of his Spirit.</p>
            <p>I therefore warn you in the Love of God to take care in time, and withdraw yourſelves from the Evil Counſeller, for his End is to deſtroy you, and to deprive you of eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Therefore be ye awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd, and incline your Minds unto the Lord, who is the Shepherd and Biſhop of Souls, that out of all things which are hurtful he may gather you,
<note place="margin">Heb. 6.7.8.</note> that ſo no longer you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, as the Ground which drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the Rain that cometh upon it, and brings forth Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

<note place="margin">John 13.35.</note> of Chriſt, for by this, ſaid our Lord, ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples, if you have Love one to another: But where this undefiled Love is wanting, there alſo will the Mark of a true Diſciple be wanting; and if that be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it will not be any ones Say-ſo which will render him, or her, to be ſuch; but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Fruits ſhall we be

            <p>For the Sake of theſe I am concerned, that the Gift of God may be ſtirred up, and have its Liberty in them in whom it hath been long ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled <note place="margin">Amos 2.13.</note> and oppreſt as a Cart with Sheaves: Many go bowed down in Spirit becauſe of the

<note place="margin">Heb. 6.6.</note> unto themſelves in his ſpiritual Appearance, and put him as to open Shame; cauſing many to blaſpheme his worthy Name.</p>
            <p>Oh! ye careleſs and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Stewards, do ye not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that one Day you muſt give an Account of your Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſhip;

Thus will the Lord revenge himſelf on the careleſs and ſlothful Ones, who have no regard to Truth; but are turning their Backs on it, becauſe they cannot have an undue Liberty therein; no, not ſo much as in the ſmalleſt Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but there muſt be a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Judgment, which is every way unpleaſant, to you who love to gratify a vain Mind; and therefore, the Way ſeems too ſtreight for you that you cannot walk therein; and yet you would be looked on, as ſuch, who do walk in the Truth: And one is ſaying, I have been convinced ſo long; and another, I go no where but to Friends Meetings; and others from Birth and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, lay claim to Truth, and it would be ill taken, if it ſhould

<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.20, 21.</note> if after having eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the Pollutions of the World through the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled therein, and overcome, the latter End is worſe with them than the Beginning: For it had been better for them not to have known the Way of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, than after they have known it, to turn from the Holy Commandment deliver'd unto them. Oh! here, you that own your ſelves to have been reached unto by Chriſt, and convinced of his Eternal Truth, may clearly ſee, that without a ſteady Adhering to the Truth, your being convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:005390_0039_101731B546D246E0"/>can be of no Advantage, but a Diſadvantage it will be to you in rejecting ſo merciful a Viſitation, by which you are drawing down God's Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon you: For as ſaid the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.18.</note> the Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all Ungodlineſs &amp; Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Men, who hold the Truth in Unrighteouſneſs; and unto the Wicked God ſaith,

<pb n="41" facs="unknown:005390_0040_10173172F5811CF0"/>Thou ſlandereſt thine own Mother's Son. And may it not with Sorrow be ſaid, this is become too much the Caſe of many in our Time, that are of the Stock and Offspring of pious and godly Men and Women: But,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.4.</note> as the Son was not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for the Father's Offences, ſo on the other Hand, if the Son refuſe to obey God, his Father's Happineſs will not be intail'd upon him; for, ſaid the Lord to the Prophet, all Souls are mine, as the Soul of the Father, ſo alſo the Soul of the Son is mine; the Soul that ſinneth it ſhall die; and ſurely it will fall heavy on ſuch young People as have had, or that now have the Opportunity to obſerve the pious and godly Example of tender Parents, and yet take no Regard either to their Examples or Precepts,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:005390_0041_101731B83AEC51F0"/>but let looſe the Reins of their Minds to many Corruptions; and yet ſome of theſe would, nevertheleſs, have it thought, that they are of the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples with their Parents: But alas! you are but like the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Virgins before mentioned, that hold a Lamp without Oil, and ſo at laſt deceive yourſelves; wherefore take Warning in Time, leaſt the Alarm be ſounded, when you think not of it:
<note place="margin">Gal. 6.7, 8.</note> For ſurely, ſuch as Men ſow, ſuch ſhall they reap, and if they ſow to the Fleſh they ſhall reap Corruption; but if to the Spirit, then Life everlaſting; and to be carnally minded is Death;
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.6.</note> but to be ſpiritually minded is Life and Peace. Therefore in the Love of God, I call unto you, to forſake the corrupt Ways of the World, and cloſe in with the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:005390_0042_1017317498B5F168"/>Spirit of Chriſt; that ſo you may know the Deeds of the Fleſh mortified: For, ſaid the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.13.</note> if ye through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, do mortify the Deeds of the Body ye ſhall live; and would you not live eternally with God? Yes ſurely,
<note place="margin">Num. 23.10.</note> all are willing to die the Death of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and to ſhare with them in heavenly Manſions of Glory; but this cannot be, but as you come to dwell under the Croſs of Chriſt, and give that to the Fire that is for the Fire, and to the Sword that which is for the Sword; ſo that all may be ſlain in you which is not of God; then you will not only have to tell of being convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; but experience That which converts the Soul to God. And here alſo may you who are the Offspring of the faithful Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:005390_0043_101731B9C2EBA288"/>of God, come to inherit the Crown of immortal Life with your Parents, who may be gone before and are now reaping an endleſs Reward for their Obedience to Chriſt;
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> for the Lord is a rich Rewarder of all them who faithfully ſerve him. Wherefore, be ye prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with to hearken to his Call. Oh! mind his tender Invitation; let it not be any longer made in vain to any of you; but break off from the Folly and Corruption of the World, and come and humble your ſelves, like the Prodigal of old, ſo ſhall you meet with a merciful Reception; For the heavenly Father's Bowels of Mercy rowl towards you;
<note place="margin">Matt. 23.37.</note> and as he ſpread forth the Wing of tender Love to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo is he opening it to you, even you, who are of the Stock and
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:005390_0044_10173179017C2080"/>Offspring of his People: But take Care you do not weary him out, for if ſo, then ſhall you feel that inſtead of ſweet Viſits of Love and Mercy, he will turn his Hand in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon you, and tho' you may cry to him he will not anſwer your Deſires; becauſe, when he, the Holy One, called to you, ye would not anſwer, but turned the deaf Ear unto him, like <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> But Oh! what a dreadful Day brought ſhe upon her ſelf thereby! may the Conſideration thereof take Place with you, who are in the ſame rebellious Nature; that ſo, whilſt there is yet a little Space between you and Deſtruction, you may ſue for Peace with the Lord, who is full of Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Creatures. Yet he ſaid, my Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive
<note place="margin">Gen. 6.3.</note> with Man, for that he alſo is
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:005390_0045_101731BE25FEE5F0"/>Fleſh: and therefore, as it was ſaid,
<note place="margin">Heb. 3.7, 15.</note> to Day if you will hear my Voice, harden not your Hearts,
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.4.</note> but turn to the Lord and he will heal your Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings; and as ye are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to put away the Evil of your Doings from before the
<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.18.</note> Lord, then may you come and he will reaſon with you, and if your Sins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white as Snow; though they be red like Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they ſhall be as Wool.</p>
            <p>But this Thing of coming to Judgment, is what many who are Lovers of Pleaſure more than God, care not to hear ſo much of:
<note place="margin">Iſa. 30.10.</note> But would have (as of old) the Seers to ſee not; and ſay to the Prophets, Propheſie not unto us right Things, ſpeak unto us ſmooth Things, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie Deceits: But alas! were it to be ſo, what Benefit
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:005390_0046_1017317BF36808C0"/>could that be to looſe and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Ones to be dawbed with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered Mortar? For both the Dawber and the Dawbed were to ſuffer together; as we find in the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the Lord would accompliſh his Wrath upon the Wall,
<note place="margin">Eze. 13.15.</note> and upon them that have daubed it with untemper'd Mortar; and will ſay unto you, the Wall is no more, neither they that dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed it. Thus we may take notice how the Hand of God turned in Judgment upon both Prophets and People who were corrupt. And do any think, that there is a greater Liberty under the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel allowed to Men, than there was under the Law: Oh! ſurely nay, for God is of purer Eyes than to behold Evil with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance: For our dear Lord ſaid,
<note place="margin">John. 16.7.</note> he would ſend the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:005390_0047_101731C11ECD8750"/>the Spirit of Truth to his Diſciples; and when he is come, he will reprove the World of Sin; and are you not reproved?
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.19.</note> is not that ſure Word of Propheſy declaring to you, what your End muſt be if you deny Chriſt before Men? Oh! will he not deny you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father?</p>
            <p>But it may be ſome will ſay, how do we deny him, ſince we profeſs Faith in him and own and believe he is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World? it may be anſwered, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding you may thus believe, yet by Works you deny him; and ſo are making void your Faith which becomes dead thro' Diſobedience, how lively ſoever it may have once been. Whilſt you remain'd under true Subjection to the Will of God, you felt your Faith in Chriſt
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:005390_0048_1017317EE9961A58"/>to increaſe; for his divine Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue fill'd your Souls, the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whereof was ſuch as marr'd the Glory of this World; and there was nothing in ſo much Eſteem with you as the pure Enjoyment of that Life, which our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour gives to all them, who truly believe in and obey him.</p>
            <p>And, he did not only come and give us Life, but that we alſo might know the Abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and daily Increaſe thereof; which, praiſed be the Name of Almighty God, a Remnant do witneſs; and can truly ſay, there is nothing they ſo much deſire as the Continuation of his divine Favour unto them; and in order thereunto, are carefully watching over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they may not be miſtaken, or led into Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and are diligently coming
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:005390_0049_101731C415625D80"/>to the Light,
<note place="margin">John. 3.21.</note> to examine every Thought, Word and Action; that ſo their Deeds may be made manifeſt,
<note place="margin">John. 15.5.</note> that they are wrought in God. Oh! theſe are the Living Branches, that abide in the holy Vine, and are daily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with Life and Virtue from that never-failing Root, which enableth them, Day by Day, to bring forth ſuch Fruits, as renders them truly acceptable to God; which thoſe, that abide not in him, cannot do.</p>
            <p>For,
<note place="margin">John. 15.4.10.</note> ſaid Chriſt, the Branch cannot bear Fruit of itſelf, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it abide in the Vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me; and if (ſaid he) ye keep my Commandments, ye ſhall abide in my Love; but ſuch as are yielding to Pride, Drunkenneſs, Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Whiſpering, Backbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. are not keeping his
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:005390_0050_1017320BF6FDDD98"/>Commandments, and ſo are depriving themſelves of his Love. And what greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury can any one do himſelf, than to deprive himſelf of the Love and Favour of God? Sure nothing can exceed it. Therefore, ſaith every faithful and upright One to the Lord, whatever low or worldly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments thou feeſt meet to deprive me of, Oh! let me not be deprived of the inward Influences of the Virtues of thy divine Love: For what is this World, or all the Glory and Friendſhip thereof? it's as nothing to the true Followers of Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe Love and Delight is placed in the Lord. And as the Mind is ſtayed on him,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 26.3.</note> he will keep ſuch in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Peace, and make his abode with them. And whilſt he in his great Wiſdom and Power,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:005390_0051_101731C70A985378"/>doth meaſurably reſide, and take up his Abode in us, our Hearts are filled with pure Zeal, ſuch as is conſiſtent with true Knowledge; in which, thoſe who enjoy it are led in all Things agreeable to the Will of God: And what they do tends to his Glory: Being care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to diſcharge themſelves of what they know is their Duty, and great is, and will be, the Peace that reſts upon the Souls of ſuch, notwithſtanding the many hard Reflections which may be caſt upon them, by ſuch whoſe looſe and libertine Behaviour they have reproved and teſtified againſt; which with ſome, is Provocation e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to abuſe and beſpatter, if poſſible, ſuch of the Lord's faithful Servants, who cannot wink, or connive at Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, let it appear in whom it
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:005390_0052_1017320EEC8D6540"/>will, whether Rich or Poor; but muſt bear a faithful Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony againſt it.</p>
            <p>For altho' thoſe who walk in the Light,
<note place="margin">1 John. 1.6.</note> have true Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip one with another, yet they cannot have Fellowſhip
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.14. 15.</note> with ſuch as walk in Darkneſs, though they may be making an outward Profeſſion of the Truth with us, and pretend to believe in the Light, as many in this eaſy Summer's Day ſeem to do. To be called a <hi>Quaker</hi> is not now attended with ſo much Difficulty as it wont to be; People may now go to Meeting without the Hazard of being ſent to Priſon, and from the Priſon to the Whipping-Poſt; which was the Lot of many of our antient Friends, ſome of whom did not only ſuffer many cruel Beatings, but even Death itſelf; and all for
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:005390_0053_101731CA042F1B20"/>their Love and Obedience to Chriſt, whoſe Sayings they were fully bent to keep, and to do. And ſo approved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be of the Number of thoſe, whom our Lord likened unto a Wiſe-Man who built
<note place="margin">Matt. 7.24.</note> his Houſe upon a Rock; and altho' the Rain deſcended, the Floods came, and the Winds blew, and beat upon that Houſe, it fell not: For it was founded upon a Rock. And praiſed be the Name of the Lord, there are yet a Remnant, whoſe Feet are fixed on the Holy-Rock, where they ſtand for the Cauſe of God, and are truly concerned, that the Camp of ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> may be kept clean:
<note place="margin">Joſh. 7.1.</note> and that no <hi>Achan</hi> may lodge within it. Therefore they are often making Search, and hunt out every corrupt Thing; in order that Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:005390_0054_10173210724FF588"/>may not lodge, or be ſecretly encouraged among us the Lord's People; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there can be little room to expect the Church of Chriſt ſhould flouriſh, where any thing is countenanced that is not conſiſtent with the Purity of the Goſpel; and therefore, the faithful Followers of the Lamb, are, as formerly, for having every thing kept under and deſtroyed, which is not of God, that ſo Truth may ſtill be known to flouriſh in all who profeſs it. And that there may be no juſt Cauſe given for People to ſay, the <hi>Quakers</hi> are not ſo ſtrict as they uſed to be; but come nearer to them, and can act as they do. For altho' this may be too true with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſome Particulars, yet it is not in the general; for the ſame godly Care which reſted
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:005390_0055_101731CB9710F7E0"/>upon the Hearts of the Faithful formerly, yet lives and remains upon many to this Day: And they are as zealouſly concerned to bear a Teſtimony againſt the vain and corrupt Ways of the World, now, as much as ever: For the Faithful know the Truth is the ſame it ever was; and that it allows of no Liberty to commit Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
            <p>And yet, notwithſtanding all the Labour and Chriſtian Care of the Faithful, there is (we muſt allow) too much room for ſuch a Saying, reſpecting ſome in Profeſſion with us, who can ſhape themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Company they are with; when among the Sober and truly Religious, they appear demure, and ſeem very careful to uſe the plain Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; but let them but turn
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:005390_0056_10173214E3F8F818"/>their Backs, as it were, and the Quaker ſhall in a Moment be all thrown off; and being in Company with thoſe who can give Compliments one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are as ready with them as any of thoſe who were never reſtricted from, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and trained up in the Uſe of them.</p>
            <p>But for you who are of the Stock of Friends, to be found in ſuch ſort of Behaviour, is ridiculous; and thoſe you are thus imitating, though they may ſeem pleaſed with theſe Appearances in you, yet behind your Backs make a Ridicule and Sport of it, and beſtow the Title of <hi>Baſtard Quakers</hi> upon you; for they know it is not conſiſtent with the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Principles to be found in ſuch ſort of Behaviour; and could the Parents of ſome who
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:005390_0057_101731D17171DE10"/>now practice ſuch Things, have complyed with pulling off the Hat, and with the uſual Ceremonies, they had not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſo much Cruelty as they did, becauſe for Conſcience<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake they could not do it: For the Lord had convinced them of his holy Truth, through which they ſaw the Emptineſs and Vanity of ſuch kind of Compliments, both in Male and Female: And that it was not the Spirit of Chriſt which led into them; but that they ſprung from a proud ambitious Mind in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ſeeks to be adored and ſet up.
<note place="margin">Jam. 4.6.</note> But God reſiſteth the Proud,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.5.</note> and will puniſh the World for their Evil,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 13.11.</note> and the Wicked for their Iniquity, and cauſe the Arrogancy of the Proud to ceaſe, and will lay low the Haughtineſs of the Terrible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:005390_0058_10173217DE8E8E38"/>
Wherefore conſider in Time, you who are of the Stock and Offspring of the meek Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of holy Jeſus, and break off from all ſuch vain Imitations, which corrupt your Minds, and tend only to pleaſe and gratify proud Fleſh which is to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified; for it's of the Kingdom of Antichriſt, and muſt be brought down: And the Day is come, and coming more and more, which the Prophet ſpoke of,
<note place="margin">Mal. 4.1.</note> which ſhall burn as an Oven, and all the Proud, yea, and all that do wickedly ſhall be Stubble; and the Day that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſhall burn them up, faith the Lord of Hoſts, that it ſhall leave them neither Root nor Branch. And praiſed be the great Name of God, a Remnant are brought in a great and good Degree inwardly and ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to experience, that as the Fire

<note place="margin">Iſa. 33.14. 15.</note> when he cries out, Who amongſt us ſhall dwell with the devouring Fire? who amongſt us ſhall dwell with everlaſting Burnings? He then proceeds and gives Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count who it is that ſhould be able; it's he that walketh righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and ſpeaketh uprightly; he that deſpiſeth the Gain of Oppreſſions, that ſhaketh his Hand from holding of Bribes, that ſtoppeth the Ear from hearing of Blood, and ſhutteth his Eyes from ſeeing Evil.</p>
            <p>Oh! here the Looſe, the Libertine, the cruel and vain unrighteous Men, may ſee themſelves unable to ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the mighty Force of the
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:005390_0061_101731D479FAB660"/>Fire of God's Word, ſhould it break forth without Mixture of Mercy upon them, by Reaſon of their having rejected the Viſitation of the Love and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, and are ſo averſe to his Call, that inſtead of Liſtning thereunto, they are ſtopping their Ears, and even ſhut their Eyes when any Thing from Jeſus Chriſt is tenderly offered them for their future Good. But let the Enemy whiſper to them of ſomething that is agreeable to their vain Appetite, Oh! how quick the Libertine Perſon can hear, and with great Pleaſure open his Eyes and look upon Folly and Corruption, and receive Iniquity with Greedineſs: But whoever thou art, that thus yield up thyſelf to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Satan, and pleads for it, ſaying, There is nothing but

And ſuch hath been, and ſtill is, the Piercing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God's Word in the Soul, that how ſtout ſoever any have been, and though they may have thought nothing ſhould ever bring them to confeſs they had done any thing contrary to the Truth, or worthy of Blame, and ſo may have braved it out, until Stillneſs was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the Voice of the holy Judge heard, and the true and juſt Witneſs having liberty to ariſe, will ſo juſtly accuſe ſuch, as that all their Stoutneſs will be broke down, and inſtead of ſaying they are not be blame, there will be a Suing for Peace, and craving

Oh! here, a Day of Diſtreſs will come like an armed Man upon thoſe who will not be won upon, or in any ways hearken to the Voice of the Lord. Ah! methinks, there are many who muſt aſſent to this Truth, and ſay it is not for want of being called unto, that we are found purſuing a vicious Life; for that the Lord hath often called immediately by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:005390_0066_1017322402A108E0"/>and alſo by his Miniſters and other his faithful Servants; but Alas! may not ſuch ſay, we have diſregarded both; though we have at times been a little touched with the heavenly Influences of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mercy of God, yet, it was to us but as the Seed which fell on the High-Way Ground; for the Enemy's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements were ſo prevalent in us, that thoſe tender Viſitations and inward Touches of the Love and Favour of God, we were ſoon deprived of; and ſo fell from the Appearance of Grace, into Wantonneſs again, by which our Hearts are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come hardened. This is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true, for by frequent neglecting the Viſitations of the Holy One, Men may at laſt be ſo left to themſelves, as to be locked up in ſuch a State of Death and
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:005390_0067_10170FBF914A8B50"/>often concerned for; that as ye have entered into the Way and Path of Life, you may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved therein, and feel your growth to be in Chriſt the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Vine;
<note place="margin">John 15.</note> and where that is witneſſed, the good Fruits are not wanting: For whoever grows in Chriſt, grows in all Holineſs of Life; for what is received from him, is of a holy, pure and divine Nature; purging to the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Conſciences of
<note place="margin">Heb. 9.14.</note> them that believe. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of ſuch who once were Sinners to become Saints. And they who were once Blind have by believing in him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Sight, and given to look into the Myſtery of the Kingdom of God, in which his Glory is beheld, the leaſt Glimpſe whereof tends to mar all the Glory of Satan's
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:005390_0068_10173226F8B49618"/>been preſerved and upheld, to the Praiſes and Glory of God; and by him made as the Salt of the Earth; for being filled with the Life and Vertue of Chriſt, and ſtanding ſingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the Service of God, ſuch have been, and divers yet are, made eminently ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his Hand, to reach to the divine Witneſs in others; who through the Operation of the holy Meaſure of Life, have been brought to believe in Chriſt, and to become ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Government of his Spirit, and ſo have had Right to call him Lord and Maſter, by Reaſon they are ſubject to his Commands, and in all things ſeek to honour him, and living under a pure Senſe of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God to them, in that whilſt they were Tranſgreſſors, and even Enemies to his Rule
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:005390_0069_101731DED1BC92B8"/>and Government, he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſtretch forth his Hand of Love and Mercy, and make bare the Arm of his Salvation, whereby they now feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſet in a good Degree of Liberty from their old Maſter, whoſe Aim and Deſign was to have kept them in Bondage, and ſo to have cut them off from Happineſs, or having any Place in the Kingdom of God's Glory.</p>
            <p>Oh! let me now ſay to all you who have thus ſeen what the Lord can do for them that believe in him, hath not he brought you out of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually? And altho' you may ſometimes have apprehended that the Enemy was purſuing you, and the Sea before you, which brought you under doubtful Apprehenſions, and filled you with a Fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:005390_0070_10173229FB7F1440"/>carried back into the old miſerable State again; yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the midſt of this, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſought the Lord, he hath ariſen and made way for you through the various Difficultys which attended you in the Courſe of your Pilgrimage and Progreſs <hi>Sion</hi>-wards. So that there is no Room, or Reaſon, for any to ſink under Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements;
<note place="margin">Iſa. 49.15.</note> there may be a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of a Woman's forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her ſucking Child, yet it cannot be, that the Lord ſhould neglect ſuch as are faithfully o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying his Divine Will.</p>
            <p>Therefore, be not faint-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or let in Unbelief, or think that becauſe ſome whom you looked upon to be much before you in a ſpiritual Growth in the bleſſed Truth, have yet been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by the Enemy: But let me ſay to ſuch, who are thus be-Look
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:005390_0071_101731E1E73ED060"/>not out this Way; for here it is, that the ſubtle Adverſary is endeavouring to undermine your Faith, and ſo by degrees will deprive you of what ſhould be your Support, and take from you that holy Shield
<note place="margin">Eph. 6.16.</note> which is the Quencher of the fiery Darts of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>Oh! this has been the Way which the Serpent hath beguil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome Innocent Ones, and brought ſuch a thick Vail of Darkneſs over them, &amp; bereav'd them of the Light and Life of Chriſt, that ſome of theſe have not ſtuck to ſay there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Religion, it is but a meer Bubble: And ſo have given way to the Gratifying themſelves in whatſoever their corrupt Minds led them unto: Such are fallen under ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the like Condition, with which the Apoſtle had juſt
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:005390_0072_1017322CF1F619A0"/>Reaſon to upbraid the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> where he ſays, Oh! foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>Galatians,</hi> who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched you, that ye ſhould not obey the Truth;
<note place="margin">Gal. 3.1, 2, 3.</note> before whoſe Eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied amongſt you; this, ſaid he, would I only learn of you, received ye the Spirit by the Works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith? are you ſo foliſh? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by the Fleſh?</p>
            <p>Here we may ſee, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it is to keep a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Watch upon our Minds, for notwithſtanding a State of Convincement may be come to, and ſome degree of the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God's Spirit experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in the Soul, yet ſuch a State may be ſoon loſt, through looking out too much at the
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:005390_0073_101731E4DD0BE1F0"/>Failures of others. Had the Apoſtles been ſo feebly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards their great Lord and Maſter, they might have all fell; for what a Shooking thing it muſt have appeared to be, there being but Twelve of them, and that one of them ſhould betray his Lord, into the Hands of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers. But we do not find it had any ſuch ill Effect upon the other Eleven, as anyways to leſſen their faithful regard to Jeſus Chriſt, their holy Lord. Oh! then why ſhould any whom the Lord hath merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully favoured, with a true Senſe and Feeling of his inward and ſpiritual Appearance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come offended, ſo as to diſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Truth, becauſe of the Failures of ſome who once may have been zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors thereof? and ſo to think
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:005390_0074_1017322FEC735560"/>it a ſufficient Reaſon to decline having any further Regard to that holy and pure Principle manifeſted in your Hearts, and not only ſo, but become filled with Prejudice againſt the whole Society, and are led into a malicious uncharitable Spirit, to judge all for the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs of ſome. And as this may have happened to ſome, whereby their Faith is overthrown, let all ſuch, as now are ready at times to look out this Way, take Warning in time, and inſtead of looking at that which is attended with ſo much Prejudice, rather ſeek and diligently labour to get your Minds girded with the Girdle of Truth; and conſider, that altho' one ſhould fall to the right Hand, and another to the Left, yet God's Way is perfect, even and good; and
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:005390_0075_101731E7D934B2A0"/>he that hath a ſingle Eye to it, ſhall be bleſſed with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newings of the Love of God, upon his Soul; and he, or ſhe, who holds out to the End, will be ſaved. It was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful Servants ſlighting and
<note place="margin">Matt. 25.27.</note> neglecting the Talent the Lord had mercifully favoured him with, which was the Cauſe of his being condemned.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, whoſoever thou art, that haſt been favoured with the leaſt Appearance of the Light of Chriſt in thy Soul, be thou faithful to it; it is given thee to lead thee out of Darkneſs, and will, as thou follows the pure Leadings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, bring thee where thou mayſt have free Acceſs to Chriſt, and through Faith draw of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Virtue to thy Soul, in which thy Strength in him will be ſo increaſed, and thy Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:005390_0076_1017323171F84450"/>brightned, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſtumbling at the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of others, thou will ſee it highly neceſſary to take heed to thy own Standing; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly ſubject to the Order and Government of the Spirit of Chriſt, inſtead of turning thy Back on the Truth, thou wilt then ſtand up for it, and in the Authority of God's Power call to thoſe who are backſliding, and whether they will hear, or not, thou ſhalt find great Peace and Comfort in the true Diſcharge of thy Conſcience towards thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom thou ſaweſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſtray from the Lord.</p>
            <p>But inſtead of this Chriſtian Labour with thoſe thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſee forſaking the Way of Truth, if thou ſhouldſt ſuffer the Adverſary to get in upon thy Mind, and fill thy Heart
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:005390_0077_101731E95F150030"/>with Prejudice againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and faithful Followers of Chriſt, here thou wilt come to ſuſtain an irreparable Loſs, by being turned back into the Wilderneſs again, where, by reaſon of Unbelief thou muſt be left to periſh, as many of the Iſraelites did,
<note place="margin">Num. 14.26. 27.</note> who were Murmurers againſt God and ſlighted his Servant <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, Oh! Soul, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art, and who may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt read theſe Lines, if under the like Beſetment as above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, my Heart is deeply affected for thee, and my ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Breathings to God are for thy Preſervation. The Lord hath extended of his Goodneſs to thee in cauſing his Day of Light and Salvation to dawn upon thy Soul, and thou haſt clearly ſeen in ſome good Degree, what is agreeable to the Will
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:005390_0078_10173235DE9D2498"/>and Mind of God, ſo that there is no room to plead and ſay, thou didſt not know what his Will was. Conſider therefore what Chriſt ſaid concerning
<note place="margin">Luk. 12.47, 48.</note> that Servant, who knew his Lord's Will and did it not; he was to be beaten with many Stripes. But he that knew it not, &amp; committed things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Stripes, was to be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with few Stripes. For unto whomſoever much is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<note place="margin">Act. 17.30.</note> of him ſhall much be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. In the times of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance it's ſaid God winked, but from thoſe to whom he hath given of his good Spirit he is requiring Obedience, and a ſtrict Conformity to his revealed Will; and ſuch who fall ſhort therein, may expect to meet with the like Repulſe as thoſe before-mentioned, who came to the Door and
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:005390_0079_101731EDC57AD500"/>knocked, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; but he anſwer'd &amp; ſaid unto them,
<note place="margin">Luk. 13.25.</note> I know ye not, whence you are; depart from me all ye Workers of Iniquity.</p>
            <p>And here it may be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it was their being found in Unrighteouſneſs which cauſed the Door to be ſhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; and altho' ſuch may have to ſay, we have eaten and drank in thy Preſence, and thou haſt taught in our Streets, yet all this could make no Way for an Entrance, ſince they had diſobeyed the Teachings of Chriſt, and were cloathed with Unrighteouſneſs. And we read that no impure, or unholy Thing muſt enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, Oh! all ye care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Ones, who now are making Profeſſion of the pure Truth, but live a Life very contrary
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:005390_0080_10173238D7128650"/>thereunto, and ſo are in Danger of being ſhut out from the Manſions of Eternal Glory, (ſhould you be cut off in your Tranſgreſſions) whilſt the Lord is pleaſed to call unto you in his Love, turn not the deaf Ear unto him, but liſten to his Voice; that ſo ye may be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and made alive thereby, and be raiſed up out of the State of ſpiritual Lethargy wherein you are ſo ſtupified, that it is not eaſy to make you ſenſible the Way wherein you are going is the Way that leads down to Death and Deſtruction. But if ye once come to be quickned, and made alive anew; and have a touch of the Divine Eye-ſalve from Chriſt, then ſhall ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that God is full of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, in that he cut you not off in your Iniquity, but was pleaſed to lengthen out the
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:005390_0081_101731F0B81F0120"/>Day of his tender Mercy to you; and as there is a Turning from your Backſlidings, then, as was ſaid to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I will not (ſaid the Lord) cauſe mine
<note place="margin">Jer. 3.12.</note> Anger to fall upon you, for I am merciful, ſaith the Lord, and I will not keep Anger forever.</p>
            <p>And now, dear Reader, if thou art one who haſt been a Backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, here is Encouragement for thee to come and humble thy ſelf, and freely to acknowledge before the Lord thy Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Diſobedience to him; and as thou comes in an awful Fear, &amp; makes thy Addreſſes in Humility of Spirit, the Lord in Mercy will look down upon thee, and heal thy Backſlidings. And that thou mayeſt be thus happily recover'd out of an Eſtate of Unrighteouſneſs, and brought to a true and ſolid Settlement in the unchangeable Truth of God,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:005390_0082_1017323A5BD361F0"/>is the Deſire of one that ſeeks and prayeth to God for thine, and the Redemption of all Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors out of Sin, through the Faith of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <head>AN EPISTLE FROM JOHN ESTAUGH, <hi>To the Quarterly Meeting of Friends, for</hi> Newton, <hi>and</hi> Salem, <hi>in</hi> New-Jerſey.</head>
            <p>DEAR Friends, as it hath been the Lord's Love which took hold on my Mind, and drew me forth from you, to viſit his People in other Parts, ſo it's from a Senſe and Feeling of the ſame heavenly Spring of the Father's Love, in
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:005390_0084_101732402DF05488"/>which I am now drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, for ye are freſh in my Remembrance, and as at many other times, ſo at this time, is my Concern for you, that as God of his infinite Goodneſs hath been pleaſed to reach unto you, and by the Shepherd's Crook of his Love hath taken hold, and gathered you near unto himſelf in ſome degree, and hath often given you to partake of the Bread and Water of Life, through the Virtue whereof your Loves were at firſt raiſed to him, and ye fill'd with heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Zeal, and were made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to leave all for his Sake, and with the Apoſtle to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem <note place="margin">Phil. 3.8</note> the Loſs of all things but as Droſs or Dung, ſo you could but win Chriſt. And that this heavenly Mind may grow and increaſe in you, is what I am
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:005390_0085_101731F818CCC910"/>often concerned for; that as ye have entered into the Way and Path of Life, you may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved therein, and feel your growth to be in Chriſt the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Vine;
<note place="margin">John 15.</note> and where that is witneſſed, the good Fruits are not wanting: For whoever grows in Chriſt, grows in all Holineſs of Life; for what is received from him, is of a holy, pure and divine Nature; purging to the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Conſciences of
<note place="margin">Heb. 9.14.</note> them that believe. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of ſuch who once were Sinners to become Saints. And they who were once Blind have by believing in him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Sight, and given to look into the Myſtery of the Kingdom of God, in which his Glory is beheld, the leaſt Glimpſe whereof tends to mar all the Glory of Satan's
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:005390_0086_10173241B3D6FF00"/>Kingdom, in them who are thus favoured with the Dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Day of God's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Viſitation upon their Souls. With which, my dear Friends, you have been favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and largely given to partake thereof,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.12.</note> with many others, and by the one Spirit have been baptized together as into one Body:
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.4.</note> And have drank at the one Heavenly Divine Spring, and united together in that pure Love which flows from God, thro' Chriſt, to true Believers; and great was that Care which came upon you, for the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of that Love and Unity which Truth had brought you into; and when anything appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which ſtruck thereat, how readily did you then joyn Hand in Hand, to get that caſt out from amongſt you, which had ſo ill a Tendency in it. And
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:005390_0087_101731F99F9C6458"/>God, who delighteth to behold his Children united together in his Love, failed not to bleſs your Endeavours.</p>
            <p>And dear Friends, if the ſame Care be continued, you'l then feel the Lord will not be wanting to ſupport you in what tends to his Honour;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 34.15.</note> for his Eyes are upon the Righteous, and his Ears are open to their Cry. And for their Help he will ariſe, and what is wrong muſt be judged down by him. Therefore, let not any give Way to favour any thing which is from under the Croſs of Chriſt, for thoſe who would favour the Cauſe of ſuch as are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to bear the Yoke, will thereby hurt themſelves, and bring a Vail of Darkneſs over their own Underſtandings, and if Darkneſs prevails, Love will wax cold to Brethren, and that
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:005390_0088_10170FB81250C050"/>Care for maintaining Love and Unity will be loſt, and inſtead thereof, Bitterneſs gets up, and hard Speeches are uttered, and grievous Reflections paſt on them who cannot give Way for any thing to be countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or encouraged in the Church of Chriſt, but what is conſiſtent with his Will whoſe dwelling is in Holineſs,
<note place="margin">Hab. 1.13.</note> and is of purer Eyes, than to behold any Evil with Allowance.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, my dearly beloved Friends, be all careful to keep a ſtrict Watch, each over his own Mind; that nothing that's wrong may get up, to harden your Hearts or darken any one's Underſtanding which God hath open'd; &amp; iſ the Watch be well kept up at home, and no evil thing incouraged there, then, ſuch will become more and more in the Lord's Hand, as
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:005390_0089_101731FCD4A90C18"/>proper Inſtruments to watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver others, and to lend a helping Hand unto them who ſtand in need. And indeed, he that would help another out of the Mire, muſt firſt get out himſelf, and be waſhed from his own Defilements, before he can be helpful in ſo good a Work; for ſhould Help be offered from ſuch an one, who hath not paſſed under the refining Power and mortifying Word of God, it might well be rejected, and turned back again, and to him ſaid, Oh! thou deceitful Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, firſt get a clean Heart cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in thyſelf, before thou offers Help to me.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.16. 17, &amp;c.</note> And God faith to the wicked, what haſt thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou ſhould take my Covenant in thy Mouth? ſeeing thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Inſtruction and caſteth my
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:005390_0090_10173247C28B2368"/>Words behind thee; when thou ſaweſt a Thief then thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentedſt with him, and haſt been Partaker with Adulterers. And dear Friends, ſeeing there were ſuch in many Generations that are paſt, who did preſume to appear as Servants of God, and were not truly ſuch, we need not wonder if there be ſome ſuch in this Day; for there is the ſame old Deceiver,
<note place="margin">Job 1.7.2.2.</note> that's going about ſeeking whom he can devour, and he is not without his wicked and evil Inſtruments, by whom he is working: And as is their Maſter, ſo are they, full of Subtilty, and often under a ſeeming Shew of Goodneſs, and a feigned Humility, gain upon the Minds of ſome, and get a Place in their Affections; which being once fixed is hard to move; and ſo it proves, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:005390_0091_101731FFCA200E68"/>times, of ill Conſequence, when ſuch an One comes to be diſcovered, and judged to be no other than a Deceiver.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, Dear Friends, in order that That and all other Dangers may be avoided, let every one keep cloſe to the Gift and Meaſure of Chriſt's Spirit in himſelf, againſt which no Device or Inchantment of the Enemy can ever prevail: For if we are deceived, it's for want of keeping a ſingle Eye to our holy &amp; heavenly Guide, Chriſt Jeſus; to whom, for all the Mercies we enjoy, be Glory and Praiſe for ever.</p>
            <p>And, dear Friends, as to my Travels, I may with Comfort ſay, the Lord hath been with me in this my Service and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Love to his People, ſo that my Way has been made
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:005390_0092_1017324AC0A6ABF8"/>eaſy, and ſo far as have felt it opened, I have anſwered; and now finding my ſelf free and clear of that Concern, which lay as a Weight on my Mind, and, being at Liberty, think the Time long, till I am again with you. And if this Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity had happened the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of laſt Month, I ſhould have came this Fall: But the Winter is now too near to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it: I have therefore dropt the Thoughts of coming until Spring. My dear Wife gives her dear Love to you all, and through Mercy we are in a good State of Health, praiſed be the Lord. And may it pleaſe him, our heavenly Father, to protect and preſerve us all in the Way and Path of Life, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the End of our Time here, and at laſt give us an Entrance
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:005390_0093_10173202BB6BDA60"/>into the Kingdom of eternal Glory, is the ſincere Deſire &amp; Prayer of your truly concerned</p>

            <p>DEAR and welbeloved Friends, having lately been favoured with the Peruſal of a Copy of a Letter from Friend <hi>Pickering,</hi> Governor of the ſaid Iſland, to Friends at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> in which is ſet forth the great Goodneſs of
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:005390_0095_101732060A266B50"/>God unto you, and that through the Operation of his divine Power, divers are not only brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, but truly to obey the Truth; taking up the Croſs, and following our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; and thereby a daily Growth is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed; which Account is Joy and Rejoicing to me and many more.</p>
            <p>Soon after, this good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was received, our much eſteemed and well beloved Friend, <hi>Thomas Chalkley,</hi> was in the Love of God drawn to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit you, and after his Arrival there, he gives an Account to his Wife, not only of his kind Reception, but alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the above good Account: And likewiſe takes notice, how the Lord had bleſſed his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Love, and made his
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:005390_0096_10173250AB6E1A60"/>Viſit truly beneficial to you, which affords great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to all faithful Friends, who deſire the Proſperity of God's holy Truth. And I doubt not, but it was a Time of Comfort and ſpiritual Joy with you, that you were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with the Company and Benefit of the Labour of one of the faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel of Chriſt. But we hear, that the Lord ſaw meet in his Wiſdom to take this worthy Inſtrument to himſelf, and though it may to you, and us, look as a Loſs to the Church, yet as it was conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with his divine Will that it ſhould be ſo, it becometh us to be eaſy and content there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and now rather to look to our own ſtanding, that we may through Faith and true Obedience maintain a Hold and
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:005390_0097_1017320900ECB1C0"/>Intereſt in Chriſt: So ſhall we have truly to experience what the Apoſtle gave Teſtimony
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.12.</note> of, which is, that by one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſaid he, are we all baptized into one Body, whether we be <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles;</hi> whether we be Bond or Free; and have been made to drink into one Spirit, and being thus u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited into one Body, of which Chriſt is Head, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but have a Spiritual Senſe, and Feeling of each other, tho' outwardly Strangers. And it is in the ſpiritual Senſe that the true Children and Servants of God, both know and are well known one to another; and can ſymphathize together when under Affliction; and alſo rejoice together, when any Part of the Body is favoured with the Extendings and holy ſweet In-flowings, of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:005390_0098_10173253A1774E78"/>Virtue of Chriſt. In the Reading of the above Accounts, my Heart was deeply affected with a Senſe of the great and wonderfull Loving-kindneſs of God unto you, in that he hath cauſed his great Day of Light, Life and Salvation to break forth unto you, and through the Comings-up of the Life and Virtue of Truth, into Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in your Souls, the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Gaiety of this World, with all its ſinful Delights, are now become marr'd in your Sight; and to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Fools for Chriſt's ſake is your Choice, rather than to enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin which are but for a Seaſon, and will come to an end; but leave a Sting behind, upon the Souls of them, who run out the whole Time of their
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:005390_0099_101732A3F17EAB68"/>Lives in Sin, and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Invitation of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But, praiſed be his holy Name, he hath highly favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, in that he hath not only called to you, but even taken you as by the Hand, and led ye out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and as with <hi>David,</hi> pluckt your Feet out of the Mire and Clay,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 40.2.</note> and hath ſet them upon the Rock where there is Safety. But yet, my dear and tender Friends, it will be well for you to take heed to your Standing, keeping a conſtant Watch, leſt the ſubtle Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary come upon you at an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and through ſome Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem or another get in upon your Minds, and thereby draw by Degrees a Cloud of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs over the Eye of your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, which God hath opened; whereby you have
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:005390_0100_101733307A507780"/>not only been given to ſee, the vile Ways &amp; Works of Satan; but alſo, in the Name of Holy Jeſus to teſtify againſt him, and all his corrupt and defiled Ways. But, Beloved, as you have thus broke off from him, by denying his Kingdom and Government, he will be laying wait to overſet, if poſſible, the Work of God, in the Hearts of Believers in Chriſt. And where groſs Sins will not be received, he then will aſſume another Shape. For the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> ſignifys, <hi>Satan</hi> was transformed into an Angel of
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.14.</note> Light, in which falſe Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he hath ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome unwary and young convinced Ones, filling them with ſtrange Notions and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that were contrary to the Goſpel of Chriſt, and ſo,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:005390_0101_101732A85A361158"/>they have not only ſuffered Loſs thereby, but have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe brought great Trouble upon the Church, by cauſing Diviſions and running into Heats and Parties.</p>
            <p>But, my dear and tender Friends, I mention not this to diſcourage you, but that ye may be the more put upon you. Guard, and as you faithfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in the Light of Chriſt, you will be able to diſcern Satan in all his Transformations, and in the Authority of God's Power to ſtand againſt him, and keep him out; and ſo diſappoint him of breaking that Peace, Love, and Concord, which you now have and enjoy in the pure Truth of God: And ſo can join with <hi>David,</hi> and from true Experience ſay,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 133.1.</note> behold how good and pleaſant a Thing it is, for Brethren to dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:005390_0102_1017325993F325B0"/>in Unity!
<note place="margin">Pſal. 133, 2.</note> It is, ſaid <hi>David,</hi> like the precious Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Head, that ran down upon the Beard, even <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Beard, that went down to the Skirts of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and as the Dew of <hi>Hermon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 133.3.</note> and as the Dew that deſcended upon the Mountains of <hi>Zion;</hi> for, ſaid he, there the Lord commanded the Bleſſing, even Life forevermore.
<note place="margin">John. 13.34, 35.</note> And Chriſt ſaid to the Believers, a new Commandment I give unto you, that you love one another, as I have loved you, that you alſo love one another; and then, ſaid he, by this ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples, if you have Love one to another. And <hi>John</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
<note place="margin">1 John. 1.5.</note> that God is Light, and in him is no Darkneſs at all; and, ſaid he, if we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:005390_0103_101732AB52C71160"/>we have Fellowſhip one wit another, and the Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, his Son, cleanſeth us from all Sin. And theſe are true Sheep of the good Shepherd;
<note place="margin">John. 10.4.</note> and when he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth his own Sheep, he goeth before them; and the Sheep follow him, for they know his Voice, and a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will they not follow, but will flee from him;
<note place="margin">John. 10.5.</note> for, ſaid our Lord, they know not the Voice of Strangers. And, ſaid <hi>David,</hi> I have ſet the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways before me, becauſe he is at my Right Hand, I ſhall not be moved.</p>
            <p>Oh! my beloved Friends, whatſoever your Trials or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetments may happen to be, here will be your Safety, in keeping your Minds purely ſtaid upon the Lord, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to feel your ſpiritual
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:005390_0104_1017325C91F28738"/>Strength renewed. For though its ſaid the Youth ſhall faint
<note place="margin">Iſa. 40.30, 31.</note> and be weary, and the young Men ſhall utterly fall; yet they who wait upon the Lord ſhall renew their Strength; they ſhall mount up, ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> with Wings as Eagles, they ſhall run and not be weary, and they ſhall walk and not faint. And theſe as living Branches abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">John. 15.1. &amp;c.</note> in the Vine, they feel dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supply from the Root. For, ſaid our Lord, as the Branch cannot bear Fruit of itſelf, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it abide in the Vine, no more can you, except you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in me, and my Words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in you.</p>
            <p>And therefore, Oh ye tender and beloved Ones of Chriſt, take ye heed to the pure Word of God, which, is quick and powerful, and ſharper (ſaith the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:005390_0105_101732AE4EBD8770"/>Apoſtle <hi>Paul)</hi> than any two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged <note place="margin">Heb. 4.12.</note> Sword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of Soul and Spirit, and of the Joints and Marrow, and is a Diſcerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart,
<note place="margin">Heb. 4.13.</note> neither, ſaid he, is there any Creature that is not manifeſt in his Sight; but all Things are naked and opened to the Eyes of him with whom we have to do.
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.19.</note> This alſo, is that Word of Prophecy which <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> recommended to the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, to take heed unto, as unto a Light that ſhineth in a dark Place, until the Day dawn, and and the Day-Star ariſe in your Hearts; and this is what, I believe, you have had living Experience of; and can now ſay, though for a Time things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared but darkly; yet, as you had Faith in that ſmall Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and did wait in hope the<pb n="107" facs="unknown:005390_0106_1017325F90487500"/>Lord would make farther Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries to you, the merciful God hath looked down upon you, and hath cauſed the Sun of Righteouſneſs to ariſe upon you, by whom all Miſts are taken away: And the true Light ſhining, you ſee things clearly; and being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly aſſured of the Way of God, you are led to bear Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony to the Truth, and to own and acknowledge with
<note place="margin">John. 4.29.</note> the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman, Chriſt hath told you all that ever you have done. And, as he had convinced and ſatisfied her, what the true Worſhip of God is, ſo he hath let you ſee, it is not a bare outſide Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, but an inward and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual one, which is aceptable to God. And being convinced that the Father ſeeketh ſuch to
<note place="margin">John. 4.24.</note> worſhip him, who worſhip
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:005390_0107_101732AFD74AE018"/>him in Spirit and in Truth, and as the Way of God was ſo clearly caſt up before you, ye found it unſafe to abide with thoſe who hold a Form of
<note place="margin">Tim. 23.5.</note> Godlineſs, but deny the Power thereof; So have fallen in with the Apoſtle's Advice, which was, to turn away from ſuch.</p>
            <p>And as it hath pleaſed Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God thus to favour you, with a true and right Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, that you may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in true Humility, having at all times a pure and ſingle Regard to the Leadings of his
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.38, 39.</note> Spirit, ſo that as the Apoſtle ſaid, neither Death nor Life nor Angels, nor Principalities nor Powers, nor Things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor Things to come, nor Heighth nor Depth, nor any other Creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate you from the Love of
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:005390_0108_1017326115E60888"/>God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, is the Deſire and Prayer, of your Friend and Brother in the unchangeable Truth of God.</p>

            <head>A SECOND EPISTLE <hi>Prepared by</hi> JOHN ESTAUGH, <hi>for Friends at</hi> Tortola, <hi>but not ſent.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>DEAR Friends, I have received by our worthy Friend, <hi>William Thomas,</hi> three Letters, viz. one from my eſteem'd Friend <hi>John Picke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> one from <hi>Jeremiah Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> and one from <hi>Fat-Hog Bay</hi> ſigned by nine Friends, all which are very kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and truly acceptable to
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:005390_0110_10173265906A4D10"/>me; and by them I underſtand, you had received my Epiſtle ſent via <hi>Antigua,</hi> directed to our aforeſaid Friend <hi>J. Picke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;</hi> and by him I underſtand, it was read at the Cloſe of a publick Meeting, and was to the Edification and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of thoſe preſent, which I am glad of, and alſo to hear, that our heavenly Father was ſo graciouſly pleaſed at the Reading thereof, to favour you, with the Renewings of his Divine Goodneſs, in opening the free Spring of Life amongſt you, ſo that the Thirſty in <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> were refreſhed, and could ſing to the holy Rock, and rejoyce in the God of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and being afreſh bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed and influenced with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Senſe of the Life and Virtue of Truth, were therein and thereby led (I doubt not)
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:005390_0111_101732B73609D8D8"/>to renew your Covenants with the Lord, and to take up freſh Reſolutions, and to hope, through Divine Aſſiſtance, ye ſhould never ſhrink, or turn your Backs of what the Lord hath ſhewn, or manifeſted to you, to be your Duties to him; but were ready to conclude, with good old <hi>Joſhua,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joſ. 24.15.</note> let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Choice be as it will, as for you, ye will ſerve the Lord.</p>
            <p>And now, Oh! ye tender and beloved Ones of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, in order that theſe pious and godly Reſolutions may be kept to, keep ye under a cloſe and ſtrict religious Exerciſe, waiting to feel the Operation of the holy Power of God in your Hearts, and then in his divine Light, you ſhall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee your own Weakneſs, but for your Comfort, ſhall alſo behold Chriſt, on whom help
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:005390_0112_10173268891B2958"/>is laid: And, as he told the Believers of old, ſo his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and faithful Servants at this Day, find, that without him, they cannot do any thing which will tend to God's Glory,
<note place="margin">John. 15.5</note> or to the Peace and Happineſs of themſelves; and therefore under a true Senſe of their own Feebleneſs, ſuch as theſe, by the Spirit of Chriſt, are rightly led and guided into a right Prayer to God for daily Bread. And as Bread natural is to the natural Man called the Staff of Life, or is that on which the natural Life depends, ſo long as the Lord in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom may ſeem meet to allow a Being here, (For this outward Bread cannot be any other ways ſerviceable to that noble Part, the Soul in Man, than to ſupport the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Tabernacle, in which ſhe
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:005390_0113_101732B8C11A7C68"/>is allowed a Being for a little Space) ſo the Bread, the Soul is to live upon, and which is to be daily ſought and prayed for,
<note place="margin">John 6.51. &amp;c.</note> is the living Bread, which comes down from God out of Heaven: And is the holy Staff of Life, whereon every true Member in the Church of Chriſt, may ſafely truſt and lean upon, without the leaſt Danger of being deceived by it; nor hath it ever been known to fail any, tho' the leaſt of the Servants of God, who hath ſtood up faithfully for the Cauſe of the holy Truth, chooſing to ſuffer the greateſt Cruelties that Man could inflict upon them, rather than to deny Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Oh! it was this divine Power from God, in and by which our antient and worthy Friends were ſupported in the firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:005390_0114_1017326B81BD4830"/>in the dark World: and as the Work, they were called to, was very great, the Lord did in Proportion thereunto fit them with Life and Power, and in the Name, and with Authority of the King of Kings, and Lord of Heaven and the whole Earth, they were led to proclaim the
<note place="margin">Rev. 17.3.4.5.</note> Downfall of the great Whore, and falſe Church, which <hi>John</hi> ſaw cloath'd with Scarlet and Purple, and ſitting upon the Scarlet-covered Beaſt, having a Golden Cup in her Hand, full of Abominations and Filthineſs of her Fornication; and upon her Forehead was a Name written, Myſtery, <hi>Babylon</hi> the Great, the Mother of Harlots, and Abominations of the Earth.
<note place="margin">Rev. 6. &amp;c</note> And, ſaid <hi>John,</hi> I ſaw the Woman drunk with the Blood of the Saints, and with the
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:005390_0115_101732BD2D1BD618"/>Blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus. But as ſoon as thoſe faithful Servants of Chriſt, began to open their Commiſſion, and in the Name of their Maſter to call the Children of Men to forſake her dark, ſinful and adulterous Ways, ſhe ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared full of Rage, and cauſed ſuch of her Servants, as got their Wealth and Riches by trading and dealing with her, to beſtir themſelves, inventing many barbarous and cruel Ways to afflict the faithful Servants and Meſſengers of Chriſt, imagining thereby to have extinguiſhed and hindred the pure Goſpel Light from ſhining; and in order thereunto caſt many of the Lord's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants into Priſon, and dark naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Dungeons, having firſt ſlaſhed and cut their tender Bodies, and ſtripp'd them of
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:005390_0116_1017326D06D2BFF8"/>their Goods; baniſhed Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band from Wife, and Wife from Huſband, and all for their faithful Obedience to Chriſt; But all this was not able to diſcourage thoſe truly begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and faithful Servants of God; for being filled with the divine Life of Jeſus they bore all things with Meekneſs; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting their Cauſe to God: And were not at all deterr'd, or any ways affrighted, or put by their Duty and Obedience to Chriſt: But faithfully follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and his Regard was to them; and in the Enjoyment of his divine Love and Life, could in the Priſon and dark Dungeons ſound forth living Praiſes to the moſt high God, eſteeming it as a Bleſſing that they were thought worthy to ſuffer for Chriſt's ſake; and when the Lord had let their
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:005390_0117_101732C02787C428"/>cruel Proſecutors ſee, that it was not in their Power to ſtop his glorious Work, he then damp'd their hot and fiery Day of Perſecution, and gave Reſt and Eaſe to his faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
            <p>And now, you tender and beloved ones, if it ſhould be your Lots to be in ſome things tried a little for Chriſt's ſake, yet be not diſcourag'd, but ſtand faithful to your great Lord and Maſter, who is ſtill as able as ever to carry on the Work which he hath begun, and will not fail to relieve and comfort his humble and faithful Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who are chearfully given up to be order'd and directed ſo as may be conſiſtent to his Divine Will: And may the Lord be with you all, and increaſe your Faith and Hope in him, is the Deſire
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:005390_0118_10173271731E70E8"/>and Prayer of your ſincere Friend, who in the Love of God tenderly ſalutes you, and bids you, in the Lord, farewel.</p>
