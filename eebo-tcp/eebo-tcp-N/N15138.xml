            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE bill, which originated in the<note n="*" place="bottom">The conſtitution of Pennſylvania has wiſely directed, that, "To the end that laws, before they are enacted, may be more maturely conſidered, and the inconvenience of haſty determinations as much as poſſible prevented, all bills of a public nature ſhall be printed for the conſideration of the people, before they are read in general aſſembly the laſt time for debate and amendment; and, except on occaſions of ſudden neceſſity, ſhall not be paſſed into laws, until the next ſeſſion of aſſembly."</note> laſt ſeſſion of aſſembly, for repealing the law whereby a charter of incorporation is granted to the bank in this city, under the name of the Bank of North-America, will be taken up, in a few days, for its final deciſion. It reſpects an object of great and general concern; and requires the ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of every member of the legiſlatre.</p>
            <p>A gentleman, well known for his <hi>profeſſional</hi> abilities, has undertaken to advocate the cauſe of the bank, in a pamphlet, juſt publiſhed, entitled—"Conſiderations on the Bank of North<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>America." He has gone fully into the defence of this inſtitution; and has pleaded for his client with his uſual ingenuity.</p>
            <p>The writer of the following ſtrictures aſſures the public, that he has no inducement to take up his pen, on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, but to offer his candid, unbiaſſed ſentiments, on the ſubject to which they relate. He has to lament, that ſo little time is afforded him for the purpoſe: and this, he begs, may be accepted as his apology, for not going more fully into the matter.</p>
            <p>The firſt poſition, which the author of the Obſervations endeavours to eſtabliſh, is—"That the Bank of North-America was <hi>legally and Conſtitutionally</hi> inſtituted and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized, by the charter of incorporation granted by the <hi>United States in Congreſs aſſembled."</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:019217_0004_0FAA640E6A4EA870"/>
This we deny—The ſecond article of the confederation declares. in <hi>expreſs</hi> terms, that "Each ſtate retains its ſovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, juriſdiction and right, which is not by this confederation <hi>expreſsly</hi> delegated to the United States in Congreſs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled."—The right of creating a corporation appertains to ſovereignty; and every ſtate in the union, by virtue of this right, exerciſes the power. It is a power veſted in the legiſlature of each ſtate. We find that, in <hi>England,</hi> though a monarchy, the power of erecting corporations, is a <hi>right of parliament.</hi> It is true, the king <hi>alſo</hi> poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes this power: but it ſeems to be rather a <hi>permiſſive</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of the ſovereign, which he, as a conſtituent part of the parliament, has the <hi>privilege</hi> of exerting; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the forced conſtruction, in favour of <hi>preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> which Judge Blackſtone makes, in his obſervations on this privilege (though not an <hi>excluſive</hi> one) of the crown—"The method," ſays the learned Judge, "by which the king's conſent (to the erection of any corporation) is expreſsly given, are either by <hi>act of parliament</hi> or char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. By <hi>act of parliament,</hi> of which the royal aſſent is a neceſſary ingredient, <hi>corporations may undoubtedly be created:</hi> but it is obſervable, that moſt of theſe ſtatutes, which are uſually cited as having created corporations, do either <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm</hi> ſuch as have been before created by the king, as in the caſe of the College of Phyſicians, erected by charter, 10. Henry VIII—<hi>Which charter was afterward confirmed in parliament;</hi> or they PERMIT the <hi>king</hi> to erect a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <hi>in futuro,</hi> with ſuch and ſuch powers, as is the caſe of the BANK OF ENGLAND, and the ſociety of the Britiſh fiſhery. So that the <hi>immediate</hi> creative act is uſually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the King alone, in virtue of his royal prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative."—The foregoing quotation naturally ſuggeſts the idea of a diſtinction, with reſpect to corporations by <hi>char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in England, between the "immediate creative act," by the <hi>king,</hi> and a <hi>ſubſequent confirmation in parliament.</hi> This idea will apply to a charter granted by CONGRESS; its immediate <hi>creation</hi> may be by them; but, to give it <hi>operation,</hi> it muſt be <hi>confirmed</hi> by the ſeveral ſtates. So far, and no farther, do the powers of Congreſs extend, as to the erecting of corporations. And it is evident this
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:019217_0005_0FAA6410AC89C778"/>
was the idea of the matter, entertained by that body, when they <hi>recommended</hi> to the legiſlature of <hi>each</hi> ſtate, "to paſs ſuch laws as they might judge <hi>neceſſary for giving the ordinance incorporating the bank its</hi> FULL OPERA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION." By the 9th ſection of the conſtitution of this commonwealth, there is an expreſs confirmation of the power of the legiſlature, "to grant charters of incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration." The exerciſe of this power is an act of "ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty;" and as it is <hi>not,</hi> by the articles of confederati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, "<hi>expreſsly</hi> delegated to the United States in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs aſſembled," the <hi>"right"</hi> to exerciſe it is <hi>excluſively</hi> veſted in the legiſlatures of the ſeveral ſtates. Nor can any <hi>implication</hi> operate to the extinction of this right, by giving Congreſs any other power, in this caſe, than ſuch as is above defined.</p>
            <p>But, could we, for a moment, ſuppoſe, that Congreſs has a power of <hi>eſtabliſhing</hi> corporations, we muſt admit that ſoleciſm in politics, <hi>imperium in imperio.</hi> For could they not inſtitute a corporation, whoſe objects might, to uſe the words of the author of the "Obſervations," be—"commenſurate to the United States"—whoſe opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would extend through all—and whoſe principles, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and police might interfere with the laws and conſtitutions of individual ſtates?—<hi>Such</hi> a power, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs neither poſſeſſes nor claims: And though the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and power of that truly honourable and reſpectable body are, without doubt, in many inſtances, incompetent to the diſcharge of the high and important duties annexed to their office; it is to be preſumed, that no man will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly contend for the propriety of granting them <hi>this</hi> prerogative. "Cities and towns" (ſays Judge Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, I. 472. note <hi>h.</hi>) "were firſt erected into corporate communities on the Continent, and endowed with many valuable privileges, about the eleventh century: to which the <hi>conſent</hi> of the feodal <hi>ſovereign</hi> was <hi>abſolutely neceſſary, as many of his prerogatives and revenues were thereby conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably diminiſhed"</hi>—If the Bank of North-America is to be conſidered as a body corporate within the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Pennſylvania, without the "conſent" of the legiſlature, which is the ſovereign power of the ſtate; is not an <hi>eſſential</hi> "prerogative" of the ſtate infringed—And
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:019217_0006_0FAA6411EB1DFE90"/>
may not its "revenues" be "conſiderably diminiſhed" by many of its citizens veſting their funds in an inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, within the heart of the ſtate, <hi>ſolely</hi> "under the <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and auſpices of <hi>Congreſs,</hi>" and not am enable to the laws of any ſingle ſtate?—Might not Congreſs, on the ſame principles, incorporate an Eaſt-India Company, and grant them great and excluſive privileges, with an exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their imports from all duties and impoſts what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever?</p>
            <p>The author of the Obſervations aſſerts—That "STATES are <hi>corporations,</hi> or bodies politic, of the moſt important and dignified kind." "New ſtates, ſays he, "muſt be FORMED and eſtabliſhed; their extent and boundaries muſt be regulated and aſcertained"—And then aſks—"How can this be done, unleſs by the United States in Congreſs aſſembled."</p>
            <p>To this we reply—That ſtates <hi>reſemble</hi> corporations in their nature and properties; and, in ſome reſpects, may be conſidered as ſuch. The <hi>territory,</hi> on which the <hi>new</hi> ſtates are to be eſtabliſhed, was ceded to the United States, in conſequence of a <hi>treaty</hi> between Congreſs and the original proprietors of the ſoil; the right of "enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into treaties" being veſted in Congreſs, by the 9th article of the confederation. But, neither the acquiſition of the lands, nor the regulating and aſcertaining "their extent and boundaries," conſtitute the act of incorporat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—<hi>People</hi> are the neceſſary ingredient, (if we may uſe the term) which enter into the compoſition of a body politic: And Congreſs do no more than declare, that the <hi>ſettlers</hi> on theſe lands ſhould, in the <hi>firſt</hi> inſtance, be authorized "to meet together, for the purpoſe of eſtabliſhing a <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary</hi> government," FOR THEMSELVES—and, on an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their numbers, "to eſtabliſh a <hi>permanent conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and government,</hi> FOR THEMSELVES."—<hi>They</hi> are to incorporate, or rather confederate <hi>themſelves:</hi> Congreſs has nothing to do with their <hi>incorporation</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The author of the Obſervations ſeems to have derived his idea of the new ſtates being <hi>corporations,</hi> from Congreſs having declared that their reſolutions, (reſpecting, among other articles, the manner in which the inhabitants of thoſe ſtates are to adopt and afterwards form a government and conſtitution "for themſelves") "ſhall be formed into a CHARTER of <hi>compact,</hi> &amp;c." A <hi>charter</hi> is defined to be—"An inſtrument, or written evidence, of a thing, under the ſeal of a prince" (or ſovereign power) "whereby he makes a <hi>grant</hi> to a perſon, or community, of ſome particular and excluſive privileges, under certain limitations." And, according to Blackſtone (I. fol. 45) a <hi>compact</hi> is a promiſe proceeding <hi>from</hi> us. The union of theſe two words, therefore, cannot be conſtrued to mean, in this inſtance, a charter of <hi>incorporation—nothing</hi> is <hi>granted to</hi> the inhabitants of the new ſtates—<hi>emption</hi> gives them a right to the <hi>ſoil;</hi> and they enjoy an <hi>inherent</hi> right to frame, "for themſelves" a <hi>conſtitution,</hi> and to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter their government—Congreſs <hi>recognize</hi> this inherent right. Blackſtone, treating of the <hi>charter governments,</hi> dependent on the Britiſh crown, which formerly ſubſiſted in America, ſays—they were "in the nature of civil <hi>corporations</hi>—with ſuch rights and authorities, as were <hi>ſpecially given them,</hi> in their ſeveral <hi>charters of incorporation.</hi>" The very idea of a <hi>corporation</hi> ſuppoſes its <hi>dependence</hi> on ſome <hi>higher</hi> power, which cannot apply to ſovereign, independent ſtates:—And, conformably to this opinion, it is obſerved by Dr. Turnbull (in his notes to Heineccius ſyſtem of univerſal law) that, "a multitude of people, united under a common magiſtracy; but ſubjected to a large Kingdom or republic, does not properly come under the name of a <hi>republic,</hi> but a <hi>town incorporate.</hi>"—The juſt and proper ſignification of CHARTER OF COMPACT, in the caſe before us, is—a written evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or "promulgated" teſtimony, <hi>prior</hi> to the laying off and ſettling the new ſtates, that the inhabitants thereof ſhall be conſidered as citizens of the American confederated republic;—under which <hi>compact</hi> or declaratory promiſe, and ſubject to which condition, ſuch perſons as may chooſe to become inhabitants of thoſe new ſtates, will owe allegeance to, and be entitled to protection from, the <hi>confederacy of all the ſtates:</hi> and that certain articles, conſtituting the ſaid charter of compact, "ſhall ſtand as <hi>fundamental conſtitutions</hi> between the thirteen <hi>original</hi> ſtates, and each of the ſeveral <hi>ſtates now newly deſcribed.</hi>"</note>, having no agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in <hi>this</hi> part of the formation of the new ſtates.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:019217_0007_0FAA641212833A30"/>
To what has been ſaid on this ſubject, we ſubjoin the ſenſe of the <hi>Council of Cenſors,</hi> relative thereto.—"By the firſt ſection of the act of aſſembly to incorporate the Bank of North-America, paſſed the firſt of April, 1782, the claim of Congreſs to erect incorporations is acknowledged.—Yet there is <hi>no countenance</hi> given to this aſſumed authority by the <hi>confederation.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Theſe arguments, we conceive, are ſufficient to ſhew the futility of the aſſertion—"That the Bank of North-America was <hi>legally and conſtitutionally</hi> inſtituted and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized by the <hi>charter of incorporation</hi> granted by the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States in <hi>Congreſs</hi> aſſembled."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:019217_0008_0FAA64133300CB10"/>
On what baſis, then, does this inſtitution ſtand?—It will not be ſeriouſly contended, that any ſingle ſtate in the union has a right to exerciſe a legiſlative power over any one or more of the others; nor that twelve ſtates, out of Congreſs, have authority to bind a thirteenth <hi>in any caſe whatſoever.</hi>—The reſult, in the preſent inſtance, is—that the <hi>validity</hi> of the incorporation of the bank depends on the exiſtence of a law of this ſtate, entitled, "An act to incorporate the ſubſcribers to the Bank of North-America."</p>
            <p>This point being eſtabliſhed, it follows, as a neceſſary conſequence, that the aſſembly of Pennſylvania have a <hi>right</hi> to diſſolve the corporation of the bank. "<hi>A corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> (ſays Judge Blackſtone, I. 485) <hi>may be diſſolved by act of parliament,</hi> which is boundleſs in its operations." The power of <hi>repealing</hi> its own laws, is a right inherent in every legiſlative body—it is a right exerciſed by the <hi>freemen of Pennſylvania,</hi> through the medium their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, <hi>for the benefit of the whole community;</hi> and therefore it cannot, with any reaſon, be ſuppoſed, that "acts of the ſtate" exerting that right, will be directed by "every varying guſt of politics." The moſt abſolute and explicit terms of <hi>perpetuity,</hi> as to the force and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a law, cannot militate againſt this right: for to ſuppoſe the contrary, would, in effect, be to infer—either, that the legiſlature can do no wrong; or that, having once gone into an error, the people muſt neceſſarily ſubmit to the conſequences, be they what they may, without any means of obtaining redreſs—The abſurdity of ſuch doctrine is too glaring, to need any comment; it being ſufficiently exemplified in the inſtance before us, of a legiſlative body erecting a <hi>public bank</hi> into a <hi>perpetual corporation</hi>—a thing unprecedented in any free country!</p>
            <p>The right of the legiſlature, to diſſolve the corporation of the bank, being aſcertained, our next enquiry ſhall be—as to the <hi>expediency</hi> of the meaſure.</p>
            <p>We ſhall endeavour to ſhew, as conciſely as poſſible that the Bank is an inſtitution incompatible with the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and welfare of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>High intereſt for money is allowed, by all writers, to be extremely prejudicial to every country where it obtains.

It is alike unfavourable to the farmer, merchant and tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. In a country, where the principal ſource of their wealth is agriculture and the lands are in a ſtate of progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive improvement, with a proportionable increaſe of trade, manufactures and people, every man muſt ſee the neceſſity of a circulating medium being kept up, in a due ratio to theſe increaſing uſes and demands for money. Such a country is <hi>this:</hi> But the balance of trade being againſt it, <hi>that</hi> balance muſt be paid in gold and ſilver; and as the addition made to the circulating medium by the bank, muſt bear a certain reaſonable proportion to its <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>fixed capital,</hi> which cannot be enlarged, ſo as to keep pace with the growing pecuniary uſes, there muſt be a <hi>progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive diminution</hi> of the circulating medium of the country; operating againſt its intereſt, in a <hi>compound</hi> ratio to the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing uſes and demands</hi> for money: unleſs, indeed, <hi>other paper,</hi> beſides that of the bank, be thrown into circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a medium of alienation; which would be contrary to <hi>their</hi> intereſt. This effect will be produced by the <hi>high rate of money;</hi> whereby none can poſſibly be benefited, but the ſtockholders themſelves, and an inconſiderable number of merchants and traders: while the <hi>farmer</hi> is deprived of acceſs to ſuch ſums, as are abſolutely neceſſary, towards enabling him to cultivate and improve his lands, in ſuch a manner, as to contribute to his own emolument and the wealth of his country; otherwiſe than on terms totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with thoſe purpoſes. In what manner will this operate? In facilitating the importation of foreign commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; preventing the ſettling and improvement of the lands; diſcouraging emigration of uſeful citizens hither, from abroad; and expediting the tranſportation of gold and ſilver to other countries. The great emoluments which would accrue from banking, under theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances would induce men of <hi>moderate monied</hi> property, as well as the rich, to veſt their funds in bank-ſtock, to the diſcouragement of induſtry. And, for the ſame purpoſe, and to a ſimilar effect, would the occupier of a <hi>landed</hi> eſtate convert it into caſh, in order to become a proprietor in the funds of the bank; that he might draw an intereſt of eight or ten per cent. per annum for his money, without any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ſubject to no taxes. Theſe allurements might
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:019217_0010_0FAA641431907A00"/>
continue for ſome conſiderable time; probably long enough to ſuffer a long ſucceſſion of great holders of ſtock to acquire independent fortunes, from the accumulation of <hi>intereſt upon intereſt every ſix months.</hi> But, finally, all the circulating ſpecie of the country muſt center in the bank, and, whilſt one of its notes remains in circulation, will be drawn out to diſcharge the grand balance of our trade with foreign countries, till the whole ſhall be exhauſted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>influence</hi> of the bank is not leſs to be dreaded, than its dangerous tendency in other reſpects. By the act of aſſembly for incorporating the ſubſcribers to the bank, they are "declared and made able and capable in law to have, purchaſe, receive, poſſeſs, enjoy and retain lands, rents, tenements, hereditaments, goods<note n="*" place="bottom">The bank of England is, by its charter, <hi>expreſsly</hi> reſtricted from <hi>trading,</hi> or ſuffering any perſon or perſons, <hi>in truſt for them,</hi> to trade with any of the effects of the corporation, in the buying or ſelling of <hi>any merchandize or goods;</hi> except in buying or ſelling gold or ſilver bullion, or in ſelling goods mortgaged to them and not redeemed in due time. But the bank of North America is not only impowered to "<hi>purchaſe goods, chattels and effects,</hi>"—but alſo to "<hi>ſell alien or diſpoſe of, goods, chattels and effects.</hi>"—What is this but a <hi>right to trade,</hi> in the moſt unequivocal terms; and a power which they may exerciſe, <hi>without control?</hi>—what individual merchant has a fair chance in his commercial negotiations, againſt this enormous <hi>trading company?</hi>
               </note>, chattles and effects, of what kind, nature or quality ſoever, to the amount of <hi>ten millions of ſpaniſh ſilver milled dollars</hi>" By the ſame law, this corporation is to exiſt <hi>for ever.</hi> And we are told, "The bank was eſtabliſhed and organized under the <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> and auſpices of <hi>Congreſs</hi>"—That, "the directors have a truſt and duty to diſcharge to the United States, and to all the particular ſtates, each of which has an equal inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the bank"—That "they could not have received, from this ſtate, a charter, unleſs it had been <hi>ſimilar</hi> to that granted by Congreſs"—That, "<hi>Without the approbation of Congreſs,</hi> where all the ſtates are repreſented, the direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors would not be juſtified in agreeing to <hi>any alteration</hi> of the inſtitution"—And, that, "<hi>if</hi> alterations are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; they ſhould be made through the channel of the <hi>United States in Congreſs aſſembled.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Thus, the Bank of North-America is an organized body;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:019217_0011_0FAA6414F23B3120"/>
endowed with certain rights and privileges FOR EVER; capable of poſſeſſing property to the amount of TEN MIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIONS OF DOLLARS, governed by TWELVE men; ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated in the metropolis of the ſtate (indeed, it might be ſaid, of the United States) and claiming an exemption from the power of its legiſlature!—Its intereſt is diſtinct from that of the ſtate; and, in ſome reſpects, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible. The intereſt of the ſtate requires a <hi>paper cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,</hi> for the encouragement of the <hi>farmer;</hi> but this would diminiſh the profits of the ſtockholders, and therefore they will continue to oppoſe it. Here, then, is an interference of intereſts between the <hi>ſtate</hi> and a <hi>mercantile corporation.</hi> To deſtroy this competition, the latter will naturally be led to exert its utmoſt <hi>influence:</hi> and, when we conſider of what <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>extent</hi> this INFLUENCE may be;—eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when exerciſed by men who ſuppoſe themſelves, in their corporate capacity, <hi>free from the control of the laws;</hi> and who, poſſibly, may be aliens and even enemies, or under the direction of ſuch;—what may not be its effects?—what have we not to fear?</p>
            <p>The people of England, ever jealous of their liberties, were alarmed at the parliament extending the duration of the charter of their national bank <hi>only ten years</hi> beyond its uſual term of <hi>twenty one!</hi> what ſays Mr. David Hartley on that occaſion (in his letter, dated 22d. June, 1782) to the Lord Mayor of London?—"The eſtabliſhment of a monopoly in any corporation, immenſe in its magnitude, of the duration of thirty-one years," (the duration of the Bank of North-America is to ETERNITY) "ſituated in the very heart of the city of London, which is the heart of the kingdom, and which may, by that eſtabliſhment, be enabled to control the whole national powers of public and private credit, is an object moſt ſeriouſly deſerving the attention of the city of London"—"A ſtate bank ſhould be the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the ſtate, QUAMDIU SE BENE GESSERIT, and under the control of a leaſe of moderate duration. Thoſe who give power out of their own hands, are reſponſible for any ſubſequent uſurparions or encroachments which <hi>may</hi> follow."—"If they were upon any ſudden occaſion, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any preſſing emergence of the ſtate, <hi>to refuſe the ordinary circulation</hi> of land or malt bills, <hi>or of any other articles of</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:019217_0012_0FAA6415B6007E50"/>
               <hi>public ſupply,</hi> they might have it in their power to control all the executive faculties of the ſtate, and to fetter, by their excluſive negative all their vigorous and financial ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. The extremes likewiſe, on the other hand, would be equally in their power. If any daring miniſter hereafter ſhould meditate ſome deep deſign, and ſhould extend the <hi>influence and powers of corruption</hi> over ſome unknown future ſet of twenty-four bank directors"(the Bank of North America has but twelve) "the immenſe power of their monopoly, thus liberated from fear or control for an age to come, might become the moſt formidable engine of ſtate; even ſo far, poſſibly, as by ſome deſperate ſtroke to render the executive power independent on the knowlege or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of parliament, for any required ſum of money." And farther. "If, unfortunately, in any future period in this country, vehement factions ſhould ariſe, and that the bank ſhould, incidentally, become an engine in the hands of any one party, to wreak their vengeance upon their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, might not <hi>ſome</hi> men be prefered to partial favor, while others of equal merit might be proſcribed to bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy? Let every merchant and banker in the city of London apply this caſe to his own thoughts, whether he would wiſh to ſet it merely on a caſt of lots, on whoſe head favor or proſcription ſhould fall."</p>
            <p>This is the language of Mr. Hartley.—We offer no apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for the length of the quotations—They are <hi>in point</hi>—And every man, capable of judging, may draw the <hi>parallel,</hi> and determine, whether theſe remarks do not apply with equal force, if not greater, to the Bank of North America.</p>
            <p>This bank, as well as that of England, is founded on the principles of <hi>mercantile credit.</hi> Sir James Steuart (in his "Political OEconomy") tells us—"The conſtitution of the bank of England differs <hi>eſſentially,</hi> in ſome particulars, from that of <hi>banks upon mortgage and private credit.</hi> It is not ſo much calculated for <hi>multiplying the currency</hi> by melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down private property, as for <hi>facilitating the circulation of the trade of London, and</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">"So early as 1706, the government of England began to borrow at ſix per cent. upon funds already engaged. What was the conſequence? The exchequer, <hi>having no money to pay the intereſt as it fell due,</hi> paid with tallies; theſe fell to <hi>great diſcount.</hi> Upon this occaſion, they availed themſelves of the bank of England.—They engaged the bank to diſcount <hi>all</hi> tallies iſſued for intereſt of debts: but as public credit was ſo low that money could not be found to diſcharge <hi>even the intereſt of the advance made by the bank,</hi> the <hi>government</hi> conſented that all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of that kind ſhould bear <hi>compound</hi> intereſt quarterly, at 6 per cent.—Had banks of circulation upon <hi>mortgage</hi> been eſtabliſhed at that time, money would have come in, at a moderate <hi>ſimple</hi> intereſt, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, who would have evailed themſelves of them for the payment of all public burthens."—Steuarts Political Oeconomy, Vol. II.</note> 
               <hi>exchequer of Great Britain</hi>"
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:019217_0013_0FAA6416726D2E00"/>
It is, ſays he, "more uſeful for promoting circulation, than <hi>augmenting</hi> it."—Where then are the great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges reſulting to this country from the Bank of North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, to counterpoiſe its numerous and great diſadvantages? "It is not much calculated for multiplying the currency." Nor has it teſtified any diſpoſition to <hi>co-operate</hi> with govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the reſtoration and ſupport of <hi>public credit;</hi> as the bank of England has done: on the contrary, it has fully evinced its determination to <hi>oppoſe</hi> all paper but its own. The author of the obſervations has exhibited a liſt of monies advanced to the public by the bank—We wiſh not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the merit of the bank: but, on enquiry, it will be found—that theſe ſums were advanced on ample ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and that they received intereſt for theſe advances; altho they had the uſe of a ſum not leſs than 16,000 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars belonging to the ſtate, ten or twelve months, without any charge. If the facts are otherwiſe, we wiſh to be ſet right: they may be aſcertained, without much difficulty.</p>
            <p>On a review of what has been ſaid, we apprehend it will be ſufficiently evident, that it would be "wiſe" and "po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic" to repeal the charter granted by this ſtate to the Bank of North-America; and that the legiſlature would be juſtifiable, in ſo doing, on every principle of equity, expediency, and duty.</p>
            <p>It now remains for us to point out a proper ſubſtitute for the bank—ſome inſtitution, which ſhall anſwer all the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of a bank, <hi>ſuited to this country;</hi> which ſhall not be attended with the diſadvantages and dangers of one, but adapted to promote the <hi>intereſts of the whole community. Such</hi> an inſtitution is a LOAN-OFFICE; on a footing ſimilar to that which obtained in this ſtate, prior to the revolution. This is, in fact, a <hi>ſtate bank,</hi> and analogous,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:019217_0014_0FAA641731283698"/>
in its operations, to a <hi>bank of circulation upon mortgage.</hi> A paper currency is emitted by government—This is <hi>loaned,</hi> (in ſums not exceeding, perhaps, two hundred pounds to any one perſon,) to proprietors of lands within this ſtate; who mortgage <hi>real,</hi> ſubſtantial property, amounting to double or treble the value of the money borrowed by them, as a ſecurity for the repayment of the principal with inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, in fifteen or ſixteen years, in equal yearly portions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>demands for money</hi> in every country, will be regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its <hi>uſes:</hi> When the uſes are great, the demands will be ſo; and ſo, <hi>vice verſâ,</hi> in proportion. The occupiers of the lands, in a new and unimproved country, have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al uſes for money, to ſtock and improve their farms. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, the ſettlers in an unimproved country can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and the improvements of the partially-cultivated lands muſt become ſtationary, or advance but ſlowly. But when the farmer is enabled to obtain money, on the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable terms of a loan-office he <hi>uſes</hi> it in extending the improvements of his farm; which improvements become, as it were, the <hi>capital ſtock,</hi> from the employment of which he is enabled to repay, in the limited time, the principal ſum borrowed; together with <hi>intereſt,</hi> which muſt come out of the <hi>profits</hi> on his capital ſtock.—For inſtance—"A farmer borrows, from a public loan-office, one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds, on a mortgage of lands double or treble in value; repayable, with intereſt, in ſixteen yearly inſtalments. He pays £.142 10, principal and intereſt, in that term. As this intire ſum of one hundred pounds, in <hi>paper money,</hi> originally lent, muſt be withdrawn from circulation by the ſtate, at the expiration of the ſixteen years, the <hi>additional</hi> ſum of £.42 10, which the borrower will have then paid, will be produced by the uſe which he has had, during that term, of the <hi>average</hi> ſum of £.53 26, per annum, at an intereſt of five per centum. Therefore, the borrower of the original ſum of £.100, in the bills of credit, will, by the employment thereof, have created the additional ſum of £.42 10, in <hi>actual money.</hi> The <hi>principal</hi> will have been <hi>realized</hi> by the borrower in <hi>that improved value of his lands,</hi> which has furniſhed <hi>ſuch intereſt;</hi> and <hi>that</hi> intereſt will have ſupplied a <hi>fund for public uſes.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Nothing is more evident, than, that the objects, which
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:019217_0015_0FAA641812CC0EB8"/>
create <hi>ſuch</hi> uſes for money, are of the moſt important kind: They promote, in the higheſt degree, the national wealth and proſperity. The demands of the farmer, for money, will continue while he can apply it to ſuch uſes with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, but no longer; and ſo long may the government continue to iſſue it, without any danger of creating too great a quantity. While in circulation, there can be no apprehenſion of its depreciation, having <hi>indubitable</hi> and ſufficient funds for its redemption.</p>
            <p>Loan-office bills of credit anticipate, from time to time, the improvement of real eſtates. Money of this kind ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates as a <hi>ſtimulus</hi> to the borrower, to procure funds for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment, whereby a ſpirit of induſtry is excited. Add to this, that a circulating medium is eſtabliſhed, adequate to the neceſſities of the whole community; our exports in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; domeſtic trade enlivened; population promoted; and a revenue furniſhed to the ſtate.—"I will venture to ſay" (in the words of Mr. Pownall, extracted from his "Adminiſtration of the Colonies") "that there never was a wiſer or a better meaſure, never one better calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſerve the uſes of an increaſing country, that there never was a meaſure more ſteadily purſued, or more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully executed, for forty years together, than the loan-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in Pennſylvania, formed and adminiſtered by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of that province."</p>

                  <p>The following extracts from that invaluable work, Sir James Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art's Political Oeconomy, ſerve to elucidate further what has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, relative to <hi>banks</hi> and <hi>paper money.</hi>—The great utility and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency of ſome inſtitution for furniſhing men with <hi>credit</hi> upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit of <hi>private ſecurity,</hi> are enforced every where by this author, in his obſervations on <hi>banks of circulation upon mortgage.</hi> The <hi>principles</hi> of this kind of bank may be much more uſefully applied, and with greater practicability, in a <hi>new and improving country circumſtanced like this,</hi> than in any other.—I have obſerved the <hi>great affinity</hi> there is between <hi>theſe principles and thoſe of a loan-office.</hi> The reader will ſee this affinity, and will diſcern, that the <hi>inferences</hi> deduced from the former will ſuit the latter: he will make his own comments on the quotations here preſented to him, which I ſubmit to his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <p>"A circulating value (money) muſt conſtantly bear a proportion to allenation.

                  <p>It has been obſerved in a preceding note, that the bank of England, in 1706, diſcounted and circulated exchequer bills and tallies.

"This operation," ſays ſir James Stewart, "was quite ſimilar to banks of circulation upon mortgage; the bank of England was here employed in converting into money exchequer bills, <hi>ſecured upon the faith of government. Banks upon mortgage covert into money the property of individuals, upon private ſecurity.</hi> Had therefore, banks upon mortgage been eſtabliſhed in England, at this time, all thoſe who had <hi>property</hi> would have got <hi>credit</hi> from them, and would have been enabled thereby to pay their taxes, and carry on their induſtry, without diminiſhing their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. The exchequer would then have had no occaſion to iſſue diſcredited bills and tallies for making up deficiencies; becauſe taxes would have been productive, and the ſtate would have been relieved of the exceſſive burthen of intereſt at ſix per cent. accumulated quarterly in favour of the bank."</p>
