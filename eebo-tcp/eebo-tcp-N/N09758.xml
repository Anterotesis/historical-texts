            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

their work, and diſincumber their diſcourſes of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of vain jangling; yet ſo imperfect are our conceptions, and ſuch is the ambiguity of language, the beſt medium we have of communicating our ideas, that even intelligent perſons, and thoſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually well affected, will many times ſtrangely miſtake the deſigned purport of each others expreſſions.</p>
               <p>Had it not been for our diſtant ſituation from each other, I would, before I entred the liſts of public debate with the Rev. Mr. Hopkins, have tried whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by private conference, or letters, the difference of opinion that appears to be between us might not have been ſomewhat narrowed and reduced.—But at preſent I have no other way of entring into his views than by what he has publiſhed; which while I examine with freedom, I hope I ſhall not tranſgreſs the law of charity towards a fellow labourer in the Goſpel, or the rules of modeſty towards one, who, on other accounts beſides ſuperiority of age, is intitled to reſpectful treatment from the author of the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſſay.</p>
               <p>The ſubject now to be diſcuſſed having never (that I know of) been controverted among profeſſed Chriſtians till very lately, it will be the more neceſſary for us to take care that we conceive aright of the queſtion propoſed to conſideration—And that the ſtate of the queſtion may be truly and plainly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, it will be neceſſary for us in the firſt place to diſtinguiſh it from ſome other queſtions with which it may inadvertently be confounded.—Let it then be carefully obſerved.</p>
               <p>The queſtion is not whether it be the duty of the unregenerate to obey all and each of the commands of God. The obligation of all mankind to obey the divine law, is on both ſides equally acknowledged.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="unknown:012416_0007_0F8974DBB27AAB20"/>Nor is it diſputed whether there be ordinarily a work of the holy Spirit upon the ſoul preparatory to regeneration. This we both plead for.</p>
               <p>It is alſo mutually allowed that this preparatory work is ordinarily carried on by means of the outward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the word, and other divine ordinances.</p>
               <p>And that the <hi>Endeavours</hi> of the unregenerate in attending on God's word and ordinances are, by his appointment and bleſſing, ſubſervient to this prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory work.</p>
               <p>And further, that God has ſome way given en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the endeavours of the unregenerate in a way of attendance on the means of grace.— This, though perhaps denied by ſome, with whom at preſent we concern not ourſelves, is expreſly grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. H. I ſhall now propoſe that ſtate of the queſtion which Mr. H. has given in the ſecond part of his reply to the Rev. Mr. Mills, p. 116.</p>
               <p>'The queſtion' ſays he
<q>is, whether there are any commands given to the unregenerate which <hi>do not</hi> require any thing holy, <hi>but only</hi> require ſuch exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and doings which they may and do comply with while they are perfect enemies to true holineſs?</q>
               </p>
               <p>If Mr. H. had only maintained the negative of the queſtion as above propoſed, the difference which ſeems to be between him and thoſe who maintain that ſomething is enjoined upon and required of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in a way of duty previous and preparatory to regeneration, might I conceive be accommodated without much trouble.—For we conceive that there is no inconſiſtency in ſuppoſing that a divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which requires holineſs, and nothing but what is ſome way included in holineſs, does yet require and oblige to the performance of ſome actions, which taken nakedly in themſelves, ſeparate from ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, qualifications and adjuncts as ought to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012416_0008_0F8974DC72904278"/>
accompany them, have not the complete eſſence of holineſs.—We conceive that the holineſs of an action conſiſts in its entire conformity to the divine law, in itſelf, its principles, end a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d manner.—That the law which requires the whole of what is neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute an action holy, does alſo require each of thoſe things in particular which are involved and conjoined in every act of holy obedience, although the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete eſſence of holineſs is not found in any of thoſe particulars detached from the reſt. There is a great breadth in the divine law, to which every act of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ue holineſs muſt be ſome way anſwerable. Whatever particular is comprehended in the duty required by any divine precept, is therefore matter of duty becauſe contained in the command; and yet it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, either that whatever is contained in the duty required has (taken by itſelf) the whole of what is eſſential to true holineſs, or that there is any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which <hi>does not</hi> require any thing holy, but <hi>only</hi> requires unholy acts. In a word, we conceive that it may very conſiſtently be maintained, that though no actions of the unregenerate are ſo fully conformable to the divine command as that they can be denominated holy in the leaſt degree, being eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially defective in divers reſpects; yet ſome actions are conformable to the divine command in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, and are therefore comprehended in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirement of it.</p>
               <p>Whether ſuch conceptions of the commands of God and of the actions of the unregenerate are agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſcripture and reaſon will afterwards be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. Our preſent deſign is not to argue points, but to open the ſubject of the enſuing enquiry. But it is very manifeſt that Mr. H—'s aim and deſign is not ſo much to prove that there is no command which requires <hi>only</hi> ſuch actions as may be done in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012416_0009_0F8974DD30666950"/>
a ſtate of unregeneracy, but that no actions of the unregenerate are required <hi>at all.</hi> If he would admit that they were required <hi>at all</hi> in any divine precept, and that conſequently we had any divine warrant to inculcate upon ſinners an attendance on the means of grace, as preparatory to regeneration, I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver contend with him, though he ſhould at the ſame time hold that this is not the whole duty contained in and injoined upon them by ſuch precept. The queſtion then is not, as he has repreſented,
<q>whether there are any commands given to the unregenerate which <hi>do not require any thing truly holy, but only</hi> require ſuch exerciſes as have not the nature of true holineſs.</q>
But the queſtion is, <hi>whether any actions which men do or can perform while unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, are required of them in and by any divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand?</hi> This we affirm and Mr. H. denies.</p>
               <p>This appears from the whole drift of his reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is to oppoſe and confute the notion of unregenerate duties as he calls them; that is, of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties required of men to be performed by them previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to regeneration. And his expreſs words (p. 116.) put this matter out of doubt. For after ſaving that his opponent has attempted to prove that God does require duties of the unregenerate which they are to do, and do and may perform while in an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtate, and alſo that he ſuſpected and even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that he (Mr. H.) held to no ſuch duties, he adds that <hi>he readily owns the charge</hi>; and proceeds accordingly to produce his arguments.</p>
               <p>But to prepare the way for the clearer diſcuſſion of the important queſtion above ſtated, there are ſome preliminary enquiries which I have propoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider by themſelves, and which will furniſh matter abundantly ſufficient for the next Section.</p>

               <head>SECT. II. An enquiry into the character of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, their powers and principles of action, with the nature and quality of thoſe exerciſes of which they are capable.</head>
               <p>THE points propoſed to examination in this Section being important, and nearly connected with our main ſubject, and having been the ſubjects of great controverſies, by means of which, as it often happens in the like caſe, they have fallen into much confuſion and intanglement through the ſubtilties of vain philoſophy, there will be need of careful attention to give a clear and juſt repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of truth, avoiding erroneous extremes on either hand. I will endeavour to be as plain as the nature of the ſubjects will allow; though I fear it will be ſometimes neceſſary to enter farther into ſome abſtruſe metaphyſical diſquſitions than is deſirable in a theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical diſſertation. If the reader has not a reliſh for ſuch ſpeculations, he may relieve himſelf without much inconvenience by now and then paſſing over a paragraph or two which may appear dry and barren.</p>
               <p>As we are to conſider the character of the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, the firſt enquiry is, who are intended by the unregenerate? To which the anſwer is obvious: all thoſe are intended who have never been the ſubjects of that important change termed by chriſtians, rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration or being born again: That change whereby men become true chriſtians or ſaints, as the ſcriptural phraſe is. I ſhall not here ſtay to ſhew the different ſignifications in which this word has been underſtood by divines. In Scripture it ſignifies the ſame as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, or a man's being turned, or turning from ſin
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012416_0011_0F8974DEB173F150"/>
to holineſs, as has been well proved by a learned writer of our own. <note n="*" place="bottom">Edwards on Original Sin, part 3. chap. 2.</note> And if Chriſtian divines had kept to the ſcriptural ſenſe of the word, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enlarging or narrowing it, they would, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, have done as they ought to do. However, there is a more limited ſenſe which has obtained with many. Regeneration in this ſtrict ſenſe imports the immediate work of the holy Spirit, creating, infuſing or communicating a principle of ſpiritual life, with a power for holy exerciſes and acts. It is commonly, if not univerſally in this latter ſenſe, that the word is to be underſtood when uſed by Mr. H. If then the grace of regeneration imports a vital principle with a power for holy acts, then the defect or privation of this, in any man, is that in which the eſſence of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneracy conſiſts. And every one who is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereof is unregenerate.</p>
               <p>Unregeneracy, I ſay, conſiſts ſtrictly in a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not as ſome ſeem to conceive) in principles or habits phyſically and poſitively oppoſite to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For firſt, there are no poſitive principles of ſinſolneſs in nature. If there were, they muſt have a poſitive cauſe. They muſt either be created in and with our nature by God, who muſt therefore be the proper efficient cauſe of what is ſimply and eſſentially evil, or elſe they muſt be the production of ſome evil being, who is therefore in part the author of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which is no other than the manichean Hereſy. Secondly, though there be poſitive principles of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acts, yet unregeneracy does not conſiſt in them. If we take the word Sin in the concrete ſenſe, then it is true there is ſomething poſitive in the nature of it, which therefore muſt flow from ſome poſitive cauſe and principle. But ſinfulneſs metaphyſically and abſtractly conſidered is only a defect, and flows only
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012416_0012_0F8974E05268C8A8"/>
from a defect in the cauſes or principles of that act which is ſinful. There are not in the nature of man poſitive principles of fooliſhneſs, though there are poſitive principles of action, which operating without the direction and government of wiſdom, are the ſource of fooliſh action, or folly in the concrete ſenſe. And the ſame poſitive principles of action operating without the influence and government of holy diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions in creatures ſubject to the divine law, are the poſitive cauſes of ſinful actions, which in the concrete ſenſe are ſin. It might eaſily be ſhewn that ſin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts formally and eſſentially in defect or privation contrary to the divine law: that it flows from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative and deficient and not from poſitive and effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſes: And that this is agreable to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the moſt learned divines, who have moſt zealouſly maintained the doctrine of man's natural depravity in conſequence of the original lapſe. <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid.

Unregeneracy then does not lie in any poſitive prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of action, nor in any actings of the ſoul, or in the privation of any exerciſe, but it conſiſts in the privation of ſpiritual life and power for holy action. It is blindneſs in the mind, want of taſte for ſpiritual beauty, impotency and indiſpoſition in the will to chuſe and perform acts of obedience in a holy ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:012416_0013_0F8974E14F0AF3C0"/>But it is neceſſary to be obſerved, that ſince unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy conſiſts in the privation of that rectitude and moral perfection of nature in which man was at firſt created, and which by the divine law he was bound to maintain, it is therefore to be accounted not merely an unhappy but a faulty defect, which does not excuſe a ſinner from guilt in tranſgreſſing the laws of God, notwithſtanding his impotency and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition to exerciſes and acts of true holineſs.— Which obſervation is of importance to be remembred, that ſinners may not exculpate themſelves while living in diſobedience to God, by perverting the doctrine of man's natural inability with reſpect to acts of holy obedience, and that the calumny which ſome have had the forehead to caſt upon all who dare call in queſtion their novel opinions concerning the powers and actions of the unregenerate, who have without any juſt foundation been charged with juſtifying ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in their impenitency and diſobedience to God, may be obviated.</p>
               <p>But in order to our having right apprehenſions of the ſtate of the unregenerate, with the nature and quality of their actions, we muſt enquire more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into theſe things: Which is the more neceſſary to be done, becauſe Mr. H. in his ſection on the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the unregenerate, has diſcourſed in too looſe and declamatory a manner, and not with diſtinctneſs of method, preciſion of expreſſion, and clearneſs of evidence, which are neceſſary to give a proper view of the ſubject. In the multitude of ſynonymous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, which he has ſo profuſely heaped together to ſet forth the depravity of the unregenerate, though there are ſundry juſt obſervations, yet many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are by no means exact. Things which ought to be carefully and clearly diſtinguiſhed, are often ſo confounded and lumped together, as tends
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012416_0014_0F8974E1B31D1158"/>
exceedingly to darken and perplex the ſubject, inſtead of opening and illuſtrating it. Yea ſeveral propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are advanced, inconſiſtent with truth and ſound doctrine; which ſo far as they fall in our way, and tend to obſtruct our progreſs, will in the proper place be animadverted upon.</p>
               <p>The principal point here to be enquired into, is that impotency to the performance of duty which is implied in unregeneracy. For the opening of which, three things will be diſtinctly conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The nature and degree of this impotency.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The powers and aſſiſtances for action, which the unregenerate may be the ſubjects of.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The nature and quality of thoſe actions which with theſe powers and aſſiſtances they may perform.</p>
               <p>The firſt enquiry we will divide into three branches, viz. What kind of impotency is that which is implied in unregeneracy.—And as impotency or power im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a relation to acts, we will declare what kind of acts they are, for which the unregenerate want pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er —Then the degree of this impotency will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning that kind of impotency the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate are ſuppoſed to be under, there has been much enquiry. Many who have had occaſion to make frequent mention of it ſeem to have been much at a loſs how to ſtate the matter clearly, or how to conceive of it. This difficulty has been greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by means of the remarkable ambiguity at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending almoſt every notable word and phraſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly occurring in diſcourſes on this ſubject; which ambiguity often lies ſo deep as not to be readily obſerved.</p>
               <p>To remedy this inconvenience, the diſtinction of natural and moral impotency has been introduced, and is at this day much in vogue with many among
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012416_0015_0F8974E271752200"/>
us, ever ſince an eminent writer of our own, <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. Mr. Jonathan Edwards, late Preſident of New Jerſey College.</note> in his elaborate treatiſe on the human will, ſome few years ago publiſhed, has made great uſe of this diſtinction. As it may ſerve to throw ſome light upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our preſent enquiry, I will endeavour to ſtate this famous diſtinction, as I find it laid down by thoſe who have made uſe of it, and then make ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon it.</p>
               <p>It ſeems to be a plain dictate of common ſenſe, as well as of divine revelation, that there is ſome kind of inability with reſpect to certain actions, which is a good excuſe for not doing them. And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand it is evident from ſcripture, and ſeems to be a point generally acknowledged among Chriſtians, that men may be in ſome ſenſe unable to do certain actions, which notwithſtanding they are bound in duty to do, and are inexcuſable for not doing. Here are we ſee two kinds of inability, the diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which ought to be marked as ſtrongly and plainly as poſſible. The former kind is meant by <hi>natural,</hi> the latter by <hi>moral inability.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But unleſs we underſtand the real difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe things which are diſtinguiſhed by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent names, our knowing that one is called by this name, and the other by that, ſhews us only their nominal difference. Our conceptions of things are not at all enlarged and improved, any more than by our knowing the latin or greek names of them. We muſt then conſider what is the real difference between the ideas, diſtinguiſhed by the terms natural and moral inability. If this difference is clearly opened, and expreſſed in words of plain and determinate ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, we have then what we wanted; but if the explication is given in terms as unfixed in their
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012416_0016_0F8974E332756F48"/>
meaning, or as hard to be underſtood as what was to be explained is in itſelf, we are then as far from underſtanding the matter as before.</p>
               <p>Let us then attend to the definition of natural and moral impotency. The firſt is defined to be
<q>an inability to do a thing, becauſe what is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called nature does not allow of it, or becauſe of ſome impeding defect or obſtacle that is extrinſic to the will, either in the faculty of underſtanding, conſtitution of body, or external objects.</q>
               </p>
               <p>"Moral inability" we are told
<q>conſiſts not in any of theſe things, but in the oppoſition or want of inclination.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Edwards on the Will, p. 24.</note>
               </p>
               <p>If this were a clear and exact repreſentation of the difference between that kind of impotency which is an excuſe for not doing an action, and that kind which is no excuſe, our preſent enquiry might eaſily be anſwered. For we allow that the unregenerate are not held excuſable in their diſobedience to the divine law, though unable in ſome ſenſe to yield that obedience which is required of them. But if I may (premiſing due reſpect to the ſuperior character of the author above mentioned) declare my mind freely, I muſt ſay that this repreſentation of the matter is to me neither plain nor ſufficient, and introduces a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and manner of ſpeaking ſo diſſonant from, and contradictory to the language of the ſacred ſcriptures, and the almoſt univerſal ſtile of ſound divines, that I cannot be pleaſed with it.</p>
               <p>The real difference between that inability which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes from acting, and that which does not, is not clearly expreſſed, either by the terms natural and moral, which are as vague in their ſignification as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt any words in language, or by the definitions which are given of natural and moral inability. It
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012416_0017_0F8974E3F0E44BE0"/>
will not be eaſy to find two ſentences of equal length, containing more dark and ambiguous terms than the above definitions. When we are told that
<q>natural impotency is an inability to do a thing, becauſe what is moſt commonly called nature, does not allow it;</q>
this ſurely does not make the matter a jot the plainer. I am utterly at a loſs what is commonly called na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; a word which is obſerved to bear about a dozen different ſignifications. <note n="*" place="bottom">See Boyle's Enquiry into the Notion of Nature, p. 27, &amp;c.</note> It is added,
<q>or becauſe of ſome impeding defect or obſtacle that is extrinſic to the will.</q>
Before we can underſtand what is here intended, there are two doubts of no ſmall difficulty to be reſolved. Firſt, what is meant by the will? Sometimes it means <hi>the power of willing,</hi> ſometimes the <hi>act of willingneſs,</hi> ſometimes the object or thing willed. Now which of the two former ſenſes of the word is here meant, or whether both, is not I confeſs clear to me.—If by the will, is here meant <hi>actual willingneſs,</hi> then the impotency of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, with reſpect to holy acts, muſt be concluded to be <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>excuſable</hi> according to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, for it is certain that it is extrinſic and ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to all <hi>exerciſes and acts</hi> of the will; which concluſion is doubtleſs very unſound. If by the will is here meant the <hi>power of willing,</hi> then in caſe a man intoxicates himſelf with ſtrong drink, to that degree as to diſorder his underſtanding, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an impeding defect or obſtacle to the regular exerciſe of that faculty, his impotency to ſober and rational acts, is according to this definition natural and excuſable, ſince his incapacity is becauſe of a defect or diſorder he has brought upon his underſtanding. But this ſurely is not ſo evidently true. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is not neceſſary that the defects or obſtacles to action ſhould be extrinſic to the <hi>power of willing,</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:012416_0018_0F8974E4B317A6A0"/>
in order to a creature's being excuſable for not act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. There is a <hi>defect of power to will an action,</hi> which is a good reaſon for not doing it. And there is alſo <hi>a defect of power to will,</hi> which is no good excuſe. But ſecondly, We can never underſtand by this definition wherein conſiſts natural inability, or whether thoſe impeding defects or obſtacles which render an action impoſſible be a good excuſe for not doing it, unleſs we are able to determine whether theſe obſtacles or defects belong to the underſtanding or will or bodily conſtitution. And I gueſs theſe are not ſuch eaſy and plain points, that it is fit peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould wait till they are clearly determined by the philoſophers, before they ſhould be able to determine whether their impotency excuſes them or not. Some who have been no mean philoſophers, have thought that no real and natural diſtinction could be made between the faculties, habits, acts and objects of the underſtanding and will; which though it may be thought a wild notion by thoſe who have always been uſed to think in a different track, yet for my own part I am ſcarce able to ſhew that it is any ways abſurd, or unphiloſophical. <note n="*" place="bottom">The faculties of the mind have been commonly diſtinguiſhed by modern divines and philoſophers into the underſtanding, the will, and the affections. Others comprehend the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the will; among whom is the Rev. Author above mentioned.—The object of the underſtanding is truth, the object of the will and affections is good. The mind by the underſtanding perceives, judges, reaſons, knows, aſſents; by the affections loves, rejoices, hates, grieves, &amp;c.—by the will chuſes, refuſes, exerts, forbears, and the like. Theſe objects and acts of the mind at firſt may ſeem to be of a different nature; but this may perhaps be owing to our viewing the ſame object, as it were in a different attitude and light.—Thus Good, which is the object of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is knowable, ſo is an object of the underſtanding. It may be both known and loved. Yea to know and to love good, ſeems to be the ſame thing. What is love, but the perception of goodneſs, or lovelineſs? Perception is referred to the underſtanding, and affection to the will. But is there any more real difference between perceiving beauty and loving it, than there is between attraction and gravitation? It will be ſaid, there is a twofold perception of objects, viz. <hi>Sub ratione ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, &amp; ſub ratione boni</hi>: The former is referred to the intellect, the latter to the heart or will. But it may well be enquired, whether there be any object of perception in nature, or any perception or idea in the mind, which does not involve both thoſe reſpects? And whether perception, and taſte, do not univerſally, eſſentially and neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply each other, their difference being rather nominal than real? Whether there be any taſte without perception, or any perception without taſte? And conſequently, whether the underſtanding and heart, do not really contain each other, and their acts coincide? I have ſometimes thought that the promiſcuous uſe of the words, mind, underſtanding, heart, knowledge, love, obſervable in the inſpired books, was very agreable to this ſuppoſition, and gave ſome countenance to it. And yet the common diſtinction of the faculties of the mind may conveniently enough be retained, for method's ſake, provided we take care not to be led into miſtake by it. If what has been above ſuggeſted ſhould be found agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to truth, will not ſuch curious queſtions about which ſome have made ſo much ado, viz. Whether the heart be renewed by the illumination of the underſtanding, or the underſtanding enlightned by the renovation of the heart, and the like, diſſolve into ſmoke and vanity, and all diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the priority and cauſality of the one to the other may perhaps be found to proceed on a miſtaken hypotheſis.— However this may be, it ſeems ſcarce worth while for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to ſpend their time, and much leſs fall into uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contentions, in weaving, and in ſweeping away the fine ſpun cobwebs of each other. Surely the fates of Greece de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend not upon theſe things.</note> And however this may
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012416_0019_0F8974E572D93258"/>
be, it is not ſurely fit that a diſtinction of ſo much importance as this, between that inability which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes and that which does not, ſhould turn upon ſo nice and abſtruſe a point, as whether the defect or obſtacle lies in the underſtanding or the will.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:012416_0020_0F8974E7329372E0"/>The definition of moral inability is equally dark and indeterminate. "Moral inability" we are told,
<q>conſiſts not in any of thoſe things before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but either in the want of inclination, or the ſtrength of a contrary inclination; or the want of ſufficient motives in view to induce and excite the act of the will, or the ſtrength of apparent motives to the contrary; or both theſe may be reſolved into one, and it may be ſaid in one word, that moral inability conſiſts in the oppoſition or want of inclination.</q>
Here we may obſerve that the word <hi>inclination</hi> may either ſignify an <hi>act of the ſoul,</hi> or it may ſignify <hi>a power promptitude and habitual fitneſs of the ſoul to incline,</hi> upon the propoſal of proper objects, motives and perſuaſives. The words in which this definition is expreſſed, as well as thoſe which immediately follow, would perſuade one to think that by inclination is here meant <hi>the act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining, or preferring.</hi> For this is ſpoken of as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and depending upon motives in the view of the mind. For it is ſaid,
<q>When a perſon is unable to will or chuſe ſuch a thing through a defect of motives, or prevalence of contrary motives, <hi>it is the ſame thing as his being unable through the want of an inclination, or the prevalence of a contrary inclination, in ſuch circumſtances, and under ſuch views.</hi>
                  </q>
And yet I can hardly think that the want of <hi>actual inclination,</hi> or <hi>the want of motives in the view of the mind,</hi> is all that this learned author intends by moral inability. For then we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the inability of the unregenerate, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to exerciſes of holy obedience, conſiſts merely <hi>in the want of acts, or in contrary actings,</hi> (for this is allowed to be merely a moral inability by this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) and conſequently the removal of this inability, which is effected in regeneration, is nothing elſe but
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012416_0021_0F8974E7B12CA368"/>
producing an <hi>actual inclination</hi> to holineſs, by means of motives brought to the view of the mind, and not it creating or infuſing any new habit, power, or principle in the mind and heart, and thereby giving an immediate ſubjective capacity of being ſo influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced and wrought upon by motives, as to take a new actual inclination. But this is a concluſion which I cannot think this author would admit. Beſides the words power and inability, have relation to acts. And in order of nature, power is neceſſarily prior to all acts flowing from it; even as the cauſe is neceſſarily prior to the effect. To talk of power or inability, whether natural or moral, in any other ſenſe, is unintelligible jargon. Now this author often ſpeaks of a moral ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to love God and holineſs, which he endeavours to prove is no excuſe. If then moral inability conſiſts, as we are here told in the <hi>want of an inclination,</hi> then we muſt conclude that there is an inclination prior to the love of God and holineſs, and which bears the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it of a power to its act. The want of this incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is the want of this power. The queſtion is, what is this inclination wherein conſiſts our moral power to love God and holineſs, and the want of which is moral inability. Is it an inclination to God and holineſs? No certainly. For this is the very act itſelf of love. And it is as evidently abſurd to ſuppoſe an act educed from itſelf as its power, of the want of power to conſiſt in the want of the act, as it would be to ſuppoſe an effect to be its own cauſe. And to ſay that moral inability is no excuſe for not loving God is only ſaying that a man's not loving God is no excuſe for not loving him. Which is too ridiculouſly trifling to deſerve to be ſolemnly debated or even ſeriouſly aſſerted. Is this inclination, the want of which is moral inability, to love God, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination (not to God and holineſs but) to the love of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012416_0022_0F8974E8710F0560"/>
God and holineſs? No. For then it will unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably follow that we muſt firſt have an inclination (that is a love) to the love of holineſs, and from thence as from its cauſe or power the act of love to holineſs muſt flow, which is abſurd, and prepoſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: Since it is manifeſt that our loving God, is in order of nature, prior to our inclining to or loving the love of God; and conſequently the latter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſidered as a power, or the want of it as an inability of any kind whether natural or moral with relation to the former.</p>
               <p>If by <hi>inclination</hi> we underſtand an habitual radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal principle or next power and promptitude in the ſoul, to incline and yield to the influence of motives and moral perſuaſives whereby a compliance with du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be inculcated; then I grant that the want of this is that in which I do ſuppoſe the inability of the unregenerate, with reſpect to acts of true holineſs, really to conſiſt. But then I obſerve, firſt, that I do not find that this is ever called mere moral impotency by any divine or philoſopher, before this author.— Secondly, his deſcription of moral inability as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the want of motives, or in contrary motives, is not conſiſtent with the notion of inability here giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. For that power which is here ſuppoſed to be wanting does not conſiſt in, or depend upon any acts, affections, views, or motives in the mind what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; but is a prior ſubjective ground of all holy exerciſes, and of the prevalence and efficacy of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives thereunto. Indeed I am apt to think that the author above mentioned did mean to include this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency here deſcribed, in what he calls moral inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but to ſay the truth, he often reaſons about moral impotency in ſo dark (not to ſay looſe) a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that one is at a loſs to know whether he means by it the want of a <hi>power to will,</hi> or the want of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012416_0023_0F8974E930BC70C0"/>
                  <hi>actual willingneſs.</hi> And he often appears to argue as if there were evidently no difference between that inability to duty which conſiſts in the want of actual willingneſs, and that which conſiſts in the want of a power to will; and concludes that it muſt clearly follow, that becauſe unwillingneſs is no excuſe for not doing our duty, therefore the want of a principle or next power to be willing, is no excuſe: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, though it be true in the caſe of the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, yet will ſcarce follow from theſe premiſes; ſince in the judgment of common ſenſe the caſes are not parallel. Nor is the difference in the nature of things taken away or leſſened at all, becauſe both may be comprehended under the common equivocal name of moral inability.</p>
               <p>And therefore I add in the ſecond place, that as this diſtinction of natural and moral inability is not plain and intelligible enough, ſo it is lame and inſufficient for the purpoſe of giving one a diſtinct and exact view of the ſubject to which it is applied. For under the common name of moral inability are ſignified ſuch different ſtates, as according to the common ſenſe of mankind ought to be carefully diſtinguiſhed. For inſtance, who does not ſee that one who is under the dominion of ſin, deſtitute of any principle of virtue, given up of God to vile affections and hardneſs of heart, is under a far other kind of impotency to turn from the love and practice of ſin to holineſs, than a man is ſaid to be under to do any ordinary action of life while he is only unreſolved to do it, but at the ſame time has it in the power of his will to reſolve upon and do it, upon the propoſal of a good reaſon or motive, without having any new principles or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits infuſed to enable him unto it. The difference is great and ſtriking. The inability in the latter caſe is what is (I think) frequently called moral impotency
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012416_0024_0F8974E9F7184750"/>
by divines and philoſophers; and needs nothing to remove it but what is called moral ſuaſion. But in order to remove the impotency in the former caſe to actions ſpiritually good, the ſinner muſt have a new heart created, a new principle or taſte communicated to him. And therefore this is much more commonly and properly called a natural impotency, though in a ſomewhat qualified ſenſe. The confounding theſe things together has been the occaſion of ſome groſs miſtakes, as before we have done we ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to obſerve.</p>
               <p>I add thirdly, that the diſtinction of natural and moral inability, as underſtood and improved, of late, introduces a new ſtile and language into religious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, ſo diſſonant and contradictory to the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of ſcripture, and that which has hitherto been received and uſed in the church, that I think it ought not to be commended or imitated. The inſpired writers aſſert not only a want of will, but of power to do that which is holy and acceptable to God, in ſuch as are in a ſtate, and under the dominion of ſin: that the carnal mind <hi>is not</hi> and <hi>cannot</hi> be ſubject to the law of God: that the natural man <hi>cannot</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and know the things of the Spirit of God: that an evil tree <hi>cannot</hi> bring forth good fruit: that no man <hi>can come</hi> to the Son except the Father draw him; that ſeparate from Chriſt, <hi>we can do nothing,</hi> ſpiritually good, &amp;c. Theſe phraſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their proper ſignification, expreſs a real inability or want of power, and not merely a want of will. Nor do I remember that the inability of man as in a ſtate of ſin to comply with his duty in a holy manner, is ever in ſcripture expreſſed or ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by a word importing merely a want of will: or on the contrary, that a mere want of willingneſs is ever ſignified by the words and phraſes above quoted,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012416_0025_0F8974EAB2C64698"/>
or any others of the ſame force. When our Savior tells the Jews, ye will not come to me that ye might have life, his deſign herein was not to expreſs their inability in any ſenſe to come to him, but their wilful refuſal, and actual rejection of him. In ſcripture language, <hi>cannot</hi> and <hi>will not,</hi> ſignify different things; the former a want of power, the latter a want of acts. And they who confound theſe things together in their diſcourſes, depart at leaſt from the ſtile of the ſacred writings. I readily allow that the inability of the unregenerate is eſſentially different from that of mere animals with reſpect to moral actions: yet if we follow the ſcriptures, or general ſtile of chriſtian writers, it is more proper to call it a <hi>natural impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,</hi> than <hi>a moral impotency conſiſting in a want of will.</hi> Such a departure from the language of the church is inconvenient, and ought not for light rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be attempted. It is well known that chriſtian writers, eſpecially ſince the Pelagian controverſy, have conſtantly aſſerted that man in a ſtate of ſin is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as well as unwilling to perform acts of holy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; and that it is neceſſary they be furniſhed with a power herefor by the grace of God. And how univerſally the Calvinian divines in particular, (for whom thoſe who hold this modern diſtinction ſo ſacred would be thought to have ſome regard) have maintained a <hi>natural</hi> as well as <hi>moral impotency</hi> in fallen man, with reſpect to the performance of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual duties, is well known by thoſe who have been converſant with their writings.</p>
               <p>I mean not to make difficulty about words and phraſes, provided the things ſignified by them are clearly and diſtinctly repreſented: and I will allow that the impotency here intended may properly be called moral in ſeveral reſpects—as it relates to acts of a moral nature—as it is a moral, or culpable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012416_0026_0F8974EB7362E840"/>
—and as human nature was not originally ſubject to it, but it was contracted by ſin. But to call it <hi>ſimply moral inability,</hi> as oppoſed to natural, and then to explain it as conſiſting merely in the <hi>want of incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and motives,</hi> is a way of ſpeaking (as I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive) improper in itſelf, abhorrent from the cuſtom and ſtile of the ſacred and of chriſtian writers, tending to deceive and miſlead the inattentive in their reaſonings and concluſions, and has done ſo in fact in ſome notorious inſtances, as will afterwards appear.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore endeavour to repreſent in a ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what different manner, the nature of that inability here propoſed to examination. Only I would fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn the reader not to expect to have all the darkneſs diſpelled, which ſuch abſtruſe ſubjects are more or leſs involved in, eſpecially in the view of ſuch as have not much attended to them; which yet ſhould not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us from aiming at as clear and diſtinct ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions as may be obtained.</p>
               <p>The human ſoul though immaterial and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in its ſubſtance, is the ſubject of various <hi>powers.</hi> By powers is meant both an ability to act, and a capacity of being acted upon. Of theſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſome are neceſſary to conſtitute man a proper ſubject of moral government. Theſe are ordinarily diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Faculties.</hi> There are other powers which though not eſſential to the being of a moral agent, are yet neceſſary to his well-being, and to the right exerciſe of his faculties, in obeying the law of his creation. Theſe are commonly called principles, habits, diſpoſitions, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of its faculties the ſoul <hi>is indifferently capable</hi> of ſin or holineſs, of right or wrong action. But when endowed with habits morally good it <hi>is not indifferently diſpoſed</hi> to ſin or holineſs, but has a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and promptitude for right action.—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:012416_0027_0F8974EC33710D58"/>The faculties of the ſoul are ſometimes called <hi>the primary powers of moral action,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">By moral actions I mean ſuch as are commanded or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the divine law.</note> every action as ſuch flows from the faculty as its proper phyſical cauſe. And as what is called the matter or ſubſtance of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons receives its being or is produced by the faculties, they are therefore called the <hi>material principles</hi> of action.</p>
               <p>The moral habit or principle is for diſtinction ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called <hi>the ſecondary power of moral action</hi>;— whereby the ſoul is capacitated, qualified, and (as it were) biaſſed not only to act, but alſo to act in <hi>ſuch a manner</hi>; that is, wiſely and virtuouſly. It is alſo called <hi>the formal principle of right action</hi>; whence it is that actions are morally good. For that the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are in their own nature indifferently capable of right or wrong exerciſes, ſhould exert themſelves in the manner they ought, amidſt the infinitely vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ways equally poſſible, is owing to ſome cauſe or reaſon. Nor is this to be aſcribed merely to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective propoſal of opportunities and motives, but to the ſubjective meetneſs and diſpoſition of the agent to be wrought upon and influenced by them. Which diſpoſition or meetneſs does not lie in the natural fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in themſelves conſidered, ſince it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, diminiſhed, and even totally loſt, while the natural faculties remain the ſame; but is a perfection ſuperadded to and as it were inveſting them, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating in all their exerciſes and operations.</p>
               <p>To make this matter, if I can, a little plainer, I will here endeavour to explain more particularly what I mean by habits, as diſtinguiſhed from the faculties.</p>
               <p>The word habit is ſometimes uſed in a narrow ſenſe for a diſpoſition or promptitude to any particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of action, which <hi>is acquired by a ſeries of actions.</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:012416_0028_0F8974ECF0AC6360"/>
This is ſometimes called cuſtom, which ſometimes hangs ſo heavy a bias upon the mind in its operations, as to induce what is called a <hi>moral neceſſity or inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> to certain actions. By which is not commonly meant any inclinations which a man has no power to reſiſt or controul, but ſuch as cannot without great difficulty be overcome. Theſe contracted habits much reſemble natural propenſities in their influence and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Hence cuſtom is called a <hi>ſecondary nature.</hi> It not only ſtrengthens the natural appetites, but will really create new ones which nature never gave us; as appears in a multitude of obvious inſtances.</p>
               <p>But the word habit has obtained a more general and extenſive ſignification among divines. It is uſed to expreſs any principle, diſpoſition, or propenſity, which is a foundation of mens loving or hating particular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or acting in a particular manner. They are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly reduced to three claſſes: natural, called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts —ſupernatural or infuſed, called graces,—and acquired, which have been above deſcribed.</p>
               <p>It may further be obſerved, that as there are <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities and powers</hi> in the mind, <hi>previous to and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent upon all its views and exerciſes,</hi> which are internal and habitual principles of operation; ſo there are other powers, which flow as acts from ſome prior principle or habit in the mind: which may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the ſame time be conſidered as both habits and acts, though in different reſpects; even as the ſame thing, conſidered in different relations, may be both a cauſe and an effect; which is the caſe of all cauſes except the firſt. Thus love is an <hi>act</hi> flowing from habit in the ſoul; and at the ſame time is itſelf <hi>a habit or principle</hi> of beneficent action.</p>
               <p>The difference between the primary and ſecondary power of action, or between the faculties and habits of the mind, may be yet better conceived of when illuſtrated by a familiar inſtance and example.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:012416_0029_0F8974EDB286EFC0"/>As man has a power of uttering articulate ſounds to ſignify his ideas, he may be ſaid to have the faculty or firſt power of ſpeaking any particular language. But in order to his being able to ſpeak any language with propriety, he muſt have ſkill in it; and this ſkill or underſtanding of language, is a habit or ſecond power ſuperadded to and (in ſome ſort) co-operating with the general faculty of ſpeech. And words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered ſimply as articulate ſounds ſtanding for ideas, are produced by the faculty of ſpeech as their proper phyſical cauſe. But it is owing to a man's ſkill in language that he utters articulate ſounds in ſuch a manner as is fit to expreſs ideas according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the language. As therefore the faculty of pronouncing words as ſigns of ideas may be called the material principle, from which the matter of words (if I may ſo ſpeak) proceeds, ſo ſkill in language may be called the formal principle of ſpeech, whence flows the propriety of words, according to the true idiom of a particular language. Thus man as a rational agent is endowed with faculties, primary powers, and material principles for moral action: which yet will never operate in the manner they ought, or in a way of virtuous action, without the concurring influence of a virtuous habit or diſpoſition, as a ſecondary power and formal principle.</p>
               <p>The faculties are eſſential and inſeperable powers of the human ſoul: particular habits are not eſſential and inſeperable powers. For though it ſeems to be as impoſſible to conceive of the human faculties as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of all habits or diſpoſitions, as it is to conceive of matter diverted of all form; yet as the particular forms of matter are accidental and changeable, ſo the ſame may be ſaid of the particular habits of the mind.</p>
               <p>A man who has all natural faculties neceſſary for moral action, without thoſe habits or principles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012416_0030_0F8974EE73249720"/>
he is qualified and diſpoſed to exerciſe them in a holy manner, may be ſaid to have a remote power for holy action; but when he is furniſhed and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified with theſe principles, he has an immediate or next power, and is capable of being excited thereto by the propoſal of occaſions, and motives ſuited to touch theſe ſprings of action, and educe from them ſuch exerciſes and operations.</p>
               <p>This may ſuffice to ſhew what is intended by the primary and ſecondary power of moral action.</p>
               <p>To apply this to the point in hand, let it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the inability of the unregenerate with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to acts of holy obedience, does not conſiſt in the want of any natural faculty neceſſary for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it, as is on all hands acknowledged. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, which removes this inability, is not a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of new natural faculties. How they are defined and diſtributed by philoſophers, whether the common diſtinction of them into the underſtanding and the will be founded in nature, how their ſeveral opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions depend upon each other, I ſtay not to enquire. This is certain, that mankind are furniſhed with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural faculties ſufficient for the performance of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever duty is required of them. Their impotency con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the want of a ſecondary power, a habit or principle diſpoſing them to holy affections &amp; actions; the origin of which defect I will endeavour briefly to declare.</p>
               <p>Man was originally created upright. His ſoul was furniſhed not only with faculties ſufficient for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever duty God required of him, but alſo with princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and habits enabling and prompting him to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. He had a power both to will and to do. There was a foundation in the moral ſtate and frame of his ſoul for thoſe affections, and that behaviour to which he was bound by the law of his creation. And
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012416_0031_0F8974EF37A80818"/>
though he was dependent upon God in all his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet it was as really in the power of his own will, as furniſhed with principles of righteouſneſs, to act righteouſly, as it was in the power of his will as a natural faculty to act at all. And as he might truly be ſaid to have a power to act, though not indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in its exerciſe upon God's providential concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ſo he had a power to act righteouſly, though not independent on the divine co-operation, as the original ſource of moral perfection. He needed but to act according to his nature, and exerciſe thoſe faculties and principles he was endowed with in his creation, in order to maintain his innocency and happineſs. Capable he was indeed by reaſon of the mutability of his finite nature of being deceived and falling into ſin, as from fact is ſadly evident; but he was not neceſſitated to it through any defect of natural ſtrength or rectitude. But by voluntarily neglecting to follow nature in its ſuperior principles, and obey the dictates of the divine law written on his heart, he (as it were) caſt away that divine perfection and glory of his nature, and blotted out the ſacred impreſſion of God's moral image from his heart. The natural faculties with the inferior habits, which in all their exerciſes and operations ought to be ſubordinate to that ſovereign ſuperior perfective principle of human nature, being thus left to operate alone, human nature became immediately depraved. An amazing revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution took place in the ſoul of man, conſiſting in no leſs than a change of its ultimate and higheſt end of action; a revolution reſembling the change in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical body, revolting from its lawful King, placing an uſurping ſubject in his throne, and transferring to him that love, honour, obedience and tribute, which is due from a ſubject to his prince.</p>

Or if I may borrow a ſimilitude from philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, as ſoon as he wandred beyond the ſphere of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine attraction, his inferior appetites and inclinations, like a repellent force, carried him off inſtantly, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it impoſſible for him without an immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of divine power to recover his former ſtation. By the free act of his own will he gave himſelf up to be governed by his inferior principles; which, though good and uſeful in their proper place of ſubordination, are unfit to have the government of the heart. And though God was able if he had pleaſed to have inſtantly dethroned the uſurper, and recovered again the dominion of the heart; yet as no ſuch favour was due to the rebellious creature, and would have been contrary to the threatning of that law under which man was created, God was pleaſed, as it were, to pronounce this awful ſentence upon him;
<q>Since man has choſen to be unrighteous and corrupt, let him be corrupt and unrighteous. Since he has diveſted his nature of its perfective orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, dignity, and glory, it is a meet puniſhment of his ſin that his nature remain diveſted of it.

               <p>Thus it appears that this impotency of man in his natural ſtate, is both the natural and penal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his firſt tranſgreſſion. <hi>Natural,</hi> as it was in effect the object of his own choice, in turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from God, to ſelf and the creature as his laſt end. <hi>Penal,</hi> as God in righteous judgment did not reſtore that primitive rectitude and power, which by

The primary and original obligation is founded in and reſults neceſſarily from the nature of God, and the relation ſubſiſting between him and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Poſitive precepts are acts of God's ſovereign will. And there is a ſecondary obligation to thoſe duties which are required in the law of nature, which (obligation) is founded in, and flows from God's ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign authority, as ſhall afterwards be ſhewn. <note n="†" place="bottom">It has been ſaid that

The authority of a law is that in or belonging to it which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges the ſubject to obey it; or it is the right of the law, (if I may ſo ſpeak) or rather of the lawgiver, to command o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. To ſay then that the authority of a law her whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the threatning, is the ſame thing as to ſay that the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the law is all that obliges the ſubject to obedience; and conſequently if the threatning or threatned puniſhment could be avoided, it would no longer be our duty to obey the law. And for any one to be freed from the penalty of the law, is the ſame thing as to be freed from the authority or obligation of the law. But ſurely this is a very unſound prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. It is indeed groſs hobbiſm. The very dregs of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomianiſm. According to this principle believers are not ſubject to the authority of the law, for they are not ſubject to the penalty or threatning. The authority of a law is preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the threatning, for if the ſubject were not bound in duty to obey the law, ſeparate from, and antecedent to the conſideration of the threatned penalty, it would be unjuſt to threaten <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>m, and more unjuſt to puniſh him for not obeying. Nor it is true that the authority of the law appears only in the threatning. For then the moſt unrighteous laws may appear to have as much authority or right to command obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as any; ſince they may be enforced with penalties; But they have no authority at all; nor do they appear to have any to thoſe who judge of them by right rules. The authority or binding power of a law, conſiſts primarily and principally in theſe two things, the righteouſneſs of the law it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the right of the legiſlator to enact it: And whatev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er obligation the penalty lays upon the ſubject, is but a ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate and ſecondary one. It is rather an obligation of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt than of duty. The authority of a law giver conſiſts in his right to require obedience under penalty; and whatever it be that gives any one this right, one thing is evident, that it is not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a power of threatning and puniſhing—Whatever makes it manifeſt that any one has the right of legiſlation, in that alone does his authority appear; but the bare exerciſe of power, which is all that appears merely in commanding threatning and puniſhing, does not make it appear that any one has right, unleſs we are ſo abſurd as to found right meerly in irreſiſtable power.</note>

               <p n="2">(2.) The diſtinction between legal and evangelical holineſs muſt alſo be noted. <hi>Legal holineſs is that which perfectly anſwers the requirement of the law in every reſpect. Evangelical holineſs, though defective in the eye of the law, is yet ſo far anſwerable to the rule of duty as that according to the gracious conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the new covenant it is through the mediation of Chriſt, acceptable ond rewardable by God; and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned and adapted to thoſe ends for the ſake of which it is required in the goſpel.</hi> A perſon or action is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> it be in any degree inconformable to the law of God. It is evangelically unholy if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in any thing neceſſary to acceptance with God according to the new covenant. No human perſon or action is to be found in this world that is legally holy. Evangelical holineſs is found in different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in the <hi>character</hi> of all true chriſtians, and in <hi>ſome of their affections and performances:</hi> but it is not found in the unregenerate or any of their actions.</p>
               <p>Here then is the great point to be reſolved, viz. What is the nature of evangelical holineſs? Which agreable to the diſtinction abovementioned may be divided into two enquiries. <hi>What is eſſentially impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the character of a holy or good man in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel acceptation?</hi> And <hi>what is neceſſarily required in any act to conſtitute it evangelically holy, or ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:012416_0042_0F8974F83236ACE0"/>The general and moſt eſſential difference between the character of a ſaint and ſinner in the goſpel ſenſe conſiſts chiefly in theſe things. The true ſaint is one who is regenerate, or endowed with a ſupernatural vital principle, with habitual power for holy acts. Being by faith united to Chriſt he receives from him ſupplies of grace, vital communications, in order to his furtherance in holineſs and comfort. As to the exerciſes of a principle of holineſs in faith, hope, love and good works, theſe are an eſſential part of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a good man. It is not indeed eſſential to a ſtate of evangelical holineſs that grace be at all times in actual exerciſe. A habit of holineſs will not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in adult perſons remain dormant long at a time. It will in various degrees prevail, and have a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influence into the practice, yet not ſo as to exclude danger of great degrees of apoſtacy in time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. This is that ſeed of God which ſhall never utterly die or periſh in any ſoul where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce planted. Though a ſaint may for a time fail in the acts, he ſhall not finally fall from the ſtate of holineſs. Here then lies the eſſential univerſal difference. Whatever good gifts or virtuous endowments the minds of the unregenerate may be furniſhed with, and however uſeful and amiable their lives may be, yet they are unable to will or do any thing ſpiritually good. And however the true chriſtian may fail in acts of holy obedience, that divine nature of which he is made a partaker remains in him.</p>
               <p>To reſolve the other enquiry, viz. What is required in any act to conſtitute it an act of goſpel holineſs there will be need of more conſideration. That I may open this point as plainly and fully as I can in a few words, I would premiſe a few things concerning the habitual principle of holineſs, which is the ſubjective ground of all acts of evangelical obedience, ſhewing
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012416_0043_0F8974F9C2D5C4E0"/>
wherein this is different from natural principles. As this is a ſecret hidden work, it ſeems ſcarce capable of being otherwiſe diſcribed than by its ſubject, its efficient cauſe, its end, and effects. The receptive ſubject is the whole ſpirit, ſoul and body, all the powers or faculties of human nature. The efficient cauſe is the holy Spirit, creating and infuſing a vital principle, with a power and promptitude for holy exerciſes. The end whereof is to prepare a living temple, wherein to take up his everlaſting reſidence: to fit the ſubject for ſuch exerciſes and acts as are required in the goſpel, and are ſuitable and neceſſary for that new ſtate to which he is called, that he may bring forth the fruit of new obedience, to the glory of God's grace, the honour of Jeſus Chriſt, and his goſpel, the good of mankind, the preſent comfort, and eternal ſalvation of his own ſoul. The effects are a ſpiritual change in his apprehenſions, affections, enjoyments, aims, and endeavours: dying to ſin, living to God, in the daily exerciſe of repentance, faith, love and good works.</p>
               <p>This leads us to conſider the nature of thoſe acts which flow from that ſupernatural habit or principle above deſcribed; in other words what is requiſite to conſtitute an action ſpiritually good, and according to the evangelical covenant acceptable to God? and <hi>in the firſt place,</hi> all acts of acceptable obedience im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply or preſuppoſe the perſon to be in a ſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God. This indeed is not properly a qualification of the action, but the agent: and that not an inherent, but relative qualification, yet it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary. The promiſes and bleſſings of the covenant belong only to thoſe who are in the coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. Till a ſinner is juſtified, his being in a ſtate of guilt is an effectual bar to the acceptance of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances as rewardable with covenant bleſſings.
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012416_0044_0F8974FACBB3C5F8"/>
God accepts us, and has a gracious reſpect to us, in and through the mediator of the new covenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he accepts or reſpects any of our works as acts of goſpel holineſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, All acts of goſpel holineſs muſt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be conformable to the divine command. The work done, the <hi>opus operatum</hi> muſt be a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed action, and not a mere human invention. This is what is meant by the ſubſtance and matter of duty, about which Mr. H. appears to be ſo bewildered, and talks in ſuch an extraordinary ſtrain, as if ſomething muſt needs be intended extrinſic to, and diſtinct from the act of the ſoul or agent. This was rather too groſs a miſtake. One would ſcarce have expected that Mr. Hopkins, would need to be informed that by the ſubſtance or matter of an action is meant <hi>the action as abſtracted from its circumſtances,</hi> and not any conſequent effects diſtinct from it. Whatever abſurdity there is in calling the locomotion of body abſtract from the agency of the ſoul the ſubſtance or matter of duty, himſelf (I ſuppoſe) is author of it. If ſome ſpeaking in popular ſtile have called the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal effects immediately connected with the act of the mind as their cauſe, and flowing from it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the laws of nature, by the name of external ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, duties, or ſins, it was becauſe on account of this connection they are conſidered as virtually compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in, and the ſame with the act of the mind: not that they ever dreamed that the mere motion of matter ſeparate from the agency of the mind has any morality in it. It is the act itſelf commanded to be done that is the matter of duty. It is the act of the will <hi>ad extra,</hi> productive of an external work required in the divine law, that is the ſubſtance and matter of external duty. I ſay then, no action however quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or circumſtanced is holy, if the act itſelf, as to
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012416_0045_0F8974FB32A54178"/>
the ſubſtance and matter of it, be not commanded, or conformable to the rule of duty.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, All acts of holineſs muſt flow from right principles. An action taken nakedly in itſelf may bear ſome conformity to the divine command, and yet be ſo deficient in its cauſes and principles as to be unholy. The ſame <hi>effective</hi> acts of the ſoul may be educible from very different principles. Two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants may be equally attentive, and in the ſame way, to pleaſe their maſter; while the one acts from love, the other from ſlaviſh fear. An unregenerate ſinner and a true ſaint may do the ſame kind of actions, conſidered in themſelves; the one from holy, the other from mere natural principles. The principles of holy obedience are (1.) A divine nature, a new heart, a ſupernatural habit communicated in regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. (2.) A true faith in God, in Chriſt, in the divine word, precepts, promiſes, and threatnings, wherein are contained the rule and motives of evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical obedience. (3.) The ſpecial influence of the holy Spirit dwelling within us, exciting, aſſiſting, and co-operating with us, working in us both to will and to do what is acceptable to God. To which may be added with reſpect to effective acts, (4.) Love, the greateſt of chriſtian graces, without which we with all our endowments and works are nothing.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Acts of goſpel holineſs muſt be directed to a right end. A defect here will corrupt the beſt performances. Many good actions done by believers, inſtead of being accepted and rewarded in the world to come, will be burnt up as hay and ſtubble, becauſe not done for an holy end. The ends of holy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience are, Firſt, the glorifying and pleaſing God: Secondly, the ſalvation of our own ſouls: Thirdly, the beſt good of mankind. To theſe all inferior ends muſt be ſubordinated, without which, however good
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012416_0046_0F8974FBF40100E8"/>
and lawful in themſelves, they become irregular and inordinate; but by being ſought in their proper place are ſanctified to us. Fifthly. There are other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, ſuch as the manner, time, place, &amp;c. of the action which muſt be rightly ordered according to the divine command. A groſs defect or irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity in theſe reſpects, may ſo deform an otherwiſe good action, that it is rather to be accounted a ſin than a good work. A good man may do an action materially good, and for a good end, and yet it may be ſo unſeaſonable, ſo miſplaced, ſo out of order, and in it's circumſtances ſome how ſo indecent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, that it may really degenerate into ſin.</p>
               <p>This then is the ſum of the matter. Holineſs comprehends conformity to the command of God in reſpect of the matter, manner, principle, and end of action. An action's being conformable to the rule in any one of theſe ſeveral reſpects, while inconformable in the others, is not ſufficient to denominate it holy. So far as it is conformable to the rule of duty it is good; but not every inſtance of conformity to the rule is holineſs. When goodneſs of principle, end, manner, and circumſtances concur and concenter in an act materially good, the conjunction or coincidence of all theſe conſtitute that intire conformity to the will of God which is true holineſs. But neither will a good end and principle ſanctify a forbidden action, nor is the doing a commanded action an inſtance of holy obedience, if eſſentially defective in principle and end.</p>
               <p>The divine law is a perfect rule of duty; nor is any action good or acceptable any further than it is conformable to it. And yet as was before hinted, the ſincere obedience of true believers though far ſhort of legal perfection is acceptable to God through the mediation of Chriſt. For by the grace of the goſpel
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:012416_0047_0F8974FCB1AA2838"/>
chriſtians are delivered from the rigour of the law, as Calvin phraſes it. <note n="*" place="bottom">Inſtit. lib. 3. chap, 19. ſect. 5.</note> That is, though the <hi>rule of our duty</hi> be not at all abated, yet the <hi>rule of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God in acts of obedience</hi> is not according to <hi>the rigour of law,</hi> but <hi>the grace of the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> According to the rigour of law, one ſin is ſufficient to hinder the acceptance of a perſon, or any of his actions, however perfect they may have been: And beſides the leaſt ſinful defect in the ſtrength or degree of affection or endeavour renders the act ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unacceptable to God. But by the grace of the new covenant the weakeſt deſires and endeavours of obedience, if ſincere and right in the ſeveral reſpects above mentioned, are through Chriſt's mediation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; notwithſtanding any ſinful mixtures, and defects in degree, with which they are attended. Theſe defects being forgiven, and as it were covered by the merits of Chriſt, hinder not the acceptance of the ſincere obedience of believers, as to thoſe ends and purpoſes for which it is in the goſpel required of them. <note n="†" place="bottom">Our author in his ſermons on Rom. 7.7. p. 8. ſays, "Jeſus Chriſt did not come into the world and aſſume the character of mediator in order to get this (moral) law repealed or abated, as many have very abſurdly and wickedly believed and taught." Abſurd and wicked doctrine indeed! If there are any among us who avow ſo groſs an error (though I know of none) chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are bound in duty to God, and charity to the ſouls of men, to teſtify earneſtly againſt it. At the ſame time charity allows us not to inſinuate ſo high a charge againſt any who do not evidently appear to be juſtly obnoxious to it.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It will naturally be here enquired; Whether thoſe works of chriſtians, which though materially good, and flowing in the main from right principles, and aiming at a right end, are yet in no ſmall degree ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular in reſpect of the manner, and ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:012416_0048_0F8974FD71A6B568"/>
of the performance; are on that account un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy and unacceptable according to the tenor of the new covenant. The reſolution of this caſe will, I hope, give ſome further light to the ſubject of our preſent enquiry, the nature of evangelical holineſs.</p>
               <p>Let it then be carefully obſerved, that there are ſome acts of the mind which have whatever is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to a holy action inſeperably connected with, or rather involved in the ſubſtance and matter of the act. Thus love and reſignation to God are acts not only materially good, that is, conformable to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will conſidered barely in themſelves, but they are ſuch acts as neceſſarily imply <hi>holy principles,</hi> and cannot poſſibly flow from any other: Such acts as are immediately directed to and connected with <hi>a holy end,</hi> even the higheſt that a creature can reſpect: Such acts as can never be unſeaſonable, or improper <hi>at any time, in any place or circumſtances:</hi> And in a word, are ſo eſſentially and intrinſically right, holy, and ſpiritual in the very ſubſtance of the act, that though they may be imperfect in degree, yet they cannot be evangelically unholy, nor will they ever fail of a gracious acceptance with God through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But there are other actions, ſuch as all command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or effective acts of the will required in the divine command, which may be willed and done for the ſubſtance of the act, without the circumſtances and qualifications above mentioned as neceſſary to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute an action ſpiritually good. The action does not neceſſarily imply holy principles and ends, and may be very irregular in reſpect of manner and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. Beſides ſome qualifications required in a commanded action to conſtitute it ſpiritually good may be applied to an action materially repugnant to the divine law. An unlawful action through error

That confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the will of God which gives them the nature of holineſs, reſpects the performances, as well as the concomitant affections.

                     <p>It may perhaps be agreable to ſome readers to have this point ſtated a little more metaphyſically. We may then obſerve, that virtue (that is holineſs) is a word which may be taken ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in an abſtract or concrete ſenſe; and may in either of thoſe ſenſes be defined. Virtue in the abſtract, or virtuouſneſs is a <hi>quality of ſome habit or act</hi> of a moral agent. Virtue in the concrete is a <hi>qualified habit or act.</hi> In the abſtract, it is <hi>conformity to the law.</hi> In the concrete it is <hi>a habit or act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the law.</hi> Virtue in the abſtract, has for it's <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> ſome habit or act required in the law. And it's <hi>formal reaſon</hi> which is all that can be meant by <hi>it's eſſence</hi> is it's <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the law.</hi> Virtue in the concrete, has for it's <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> a moral agent, its <hi>ſubſtance or matter</hi> is ſome habit or act conformable to the law, it's <hi>form</hi> conſiſts in the conformity thereof to the law. It appears then that to ſay the eſſence of virtue conſiſts in benevolence, is not an exact definition, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we take the word virtue <hi>abſtractly</hi> or <hi>concretely.</hi> Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the <hi>abſtract</hi> is not benevolence—for benevolence is an act or habit, but virtuouſneſs is neither act nor habit, but the conformity thereof to the law. Benevolence is one inſtance of virtue <hi>in the concrete ſenſe,</hi> and an important one, but not the only one. Virtue in this ſenſe conſiſts eſſentially not only in benevolence, but in every other act or habit duly conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the law of God.</p>
                     <p>And as virtue may be defined from it's relation to the divine law as it's <hi>perfect and adequate rule,</hi> ſo it may alſo be defined from it's <hi>reſpect to the higheſt good,</hi> or the good of the univerſe, which is (as we may ſay) the original reaſon and foundation of the divine law. The higheſt good of the univerſe may be conſidered as a meaſure or ſtandard by which to try whether any thing be truly and ſimply good. And accordingly true virtue may be defined either <hi>in the abſtract</hi>—is the agreement and conſent of the habits and acts of the mind with the good of the univerſe, or <hi>in the concrete,</hi> as the habits and acts of the mind agreeing and conſenting with the good of the univerſe. It is in this way that Mr. Edwards aims to define the nature of true virtue in his diſſertation on that ſubject. But as I humbly conceive, has not done it with accuracy and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. All his definitions are in the <hi>concrete,</hi> but they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adequate to the ſubject, nor ſcarce conſiſtent with each other. Sometimes he ſays that true virtue conſiſts in <hi>benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to being in general</hi>—ſometimes it is <hi>a conſent, propenſity and union of heart,</hi> to being in general, that is <hi>immediately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed</hi> in a general good will. Which is to me a very dark ſentence, nor can I determine whether this conſent, propenſity, &amp;c. means an <hi>act or habit.</hi> A little after he ſays that his meaning is that the nature of true virtue conſiſts in a <hi>diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> to benevolence towards being in general, and again that no affections towards particular perſons or beings are of the nature of true virtue but <hi>ſuch as ariſe from a generally bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent temper,</hi> or from that <hi>habit</hi> and <hi>frame</hi> of mind wherein conſiſts a diſpoſition to love being in general. And once more all virtue conſiſts <hi>in that affection of heart</hi> to being <hi>which is exerciſed</hi> in benevolence or an inclination to it's good. Does there not appear to be great perplexity and embarraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in theſe definitions? Sometimes we are told that the eſſence of virtue conſiſts in an <hi>affection,</hi> ſometimes in a <hi>habit</hi> diſpoſing to that affection, ſometimes in ſomething we can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell whether <hi>habit or affection,</hi> ſometimes it ſeems in <hi>both habits and affections</hi>—ſometimes all virtue conſiſts in <hi>an affection exerciſed in an affection:</hi> And as for <hi>actions</hi> or <hi>effective acts</hi> they ſeem to be quite overlooked and forgotten, as if they had nothing of the nature of virtue. But if we define virtue in the concrete, it is as improper to ſay that its eſſence conſiſts in this or that particular inſtance whether habit, affection or action, as it would be to ſay that the eſſence of juſtice conſiſts in any <hi>particular exerciſe or act of juſtice.</hi> The eſſence of concrete vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue conſiſts in <hi>every habit, affection and action</hi> conformable to the divine law, and agreeing with or favoring the general good of the univerſe, as has been above explained.</p>

                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:012416_0052_0F897500714AE198"/>The nature of true holineſs has been thus far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. The impotency of the unregenerate conſiſts in a want of power for exerciſes and acts of this kind, It only remains to finiſh the account we propoſed to
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:012416_0053_0F897501FA8B9068"/>
give of this matter, that we ſay a word or two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>degree</hi> of that impotency unto acts of true holineſs, to which the unregenerate are ſubject. It is manifeſt from ſcripture, and will be I ſuppoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that no mere man is able in this life to attain to legal holineſs, or perfect conformity to the law in any action. As to evangelical holineſs the unregenerate, though endowed with a remote power for ſuch acts in the faculties of their mind, have not a next or habitual power for them. For (1.) they are not in a ſtate of reconciliation, without which their works cannot be acceptable: Nor (2.) are they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the principles of goſpel holineſs; viz. a new heart, a living faith, and the ſpecial influence of the holy Spirit, implying a vital union to Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom we can do nothing: Nor (3.) can they direct any of their actions ultimately to the glory of God: And therefore though they may perform ſome actions materially good, (as ſhall preſently be ſhewn) yet they cannot perform them in a holy manner: Nor are they in their preſent ſtate capable of ſuch exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes as imply true holineſs in the ſubſtance of the act. It muſt then be concluded that for the performance of duties in a holy ſpiritual manner, all who are in a ſtate of irregeneracy are without ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Proceed we now to the ſecond enquiry, viz. What powers and aſſiſtances for action the unregenerate may be the ſubjects of?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:012416_0054_0F897502CDEF0058"/>The queſtion is not concerning the primary power of action conſiſting in the natural faculties of the ſoul, in which reſpect there is no eſſential difference between one man and another: But what ſecondary powers or principles of action the unregenerate are endowed with, and what further helps beyond the mere powers of nature may be and are ſometimes afforded to them. And let it be remembred, that we do not mean to place the power of the unregenerate in any natural principles ſeperate from ſupernatural aſſiſtances by the outward diſpenſation of the word, and inward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Spirit of God; but we ſay that from the concurrence of all theſe there ariſes an immediate or next power for the performance of ſuch actions, as we ſhall afterwards ſhew are required in the word of God.</p>
               <p>To inſtance in ſome particulars: The unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate are able from natural principles, aſſiſted by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and the influence of the holy Spirit, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their lives, to purpoſe, ſpeak and do many things materially good, wherein the ſubſtance of effective acts of obedience is contained. They have a power to attend to the reading and preaching of God's word, and pray to him for his ſaving mercy: And to do this in ſuch a manner as is in ſome reſpects agreable to the divine command; that is, ſeriouſly and conſcienciouſly: With a deep concern to eſcape the miſery of a ſtate of ſin and guilt: With a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of conſcience (and a juſt one too) that God has commanded, and encouraged them to do ſo, and conſequently that it is their duty: And with ſome moral ſenſe or taſte of the fitneſs and reaſonableneſs of their doing theſe things, and of the moral turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a contrary behaviour.</p>
               <p>It is not my preſent buſineſs to prove that ſuch actions, and ſuch circumſtances of action as have here
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:012416_0055_0F897503704EDDF8"/>
been mentioned, are in themſelves good, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God. That will be attended to in it's proper place. What I have now to do is to ſhew that the unregenerate have a power by the common aids of divine grace to do ſuch actions, and in ſuch a manner as has here been declared.</p>
               <p>This appears <hi>firſt from fact.</hi> They have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times done all theſe things. Now as every act pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſes a power ſufficient for it, it is certain that men have a principle or power for the doing of ſuch actions as are done by them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſame may be proved <hi>a priori</hi> by taking a view of human nature, with it's powers, principles, habits, and ſprings of action. Theſe when directed and excited by that light and influence which may be conveyed to the mind of an unregenerate perſon from the word and Spirit of God, are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, without the infuſion of a holy principle, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to will and do all theſe things. There is nothing in ſuch exerciſes and acts which may not be educed from natural principles, under the advantages above mentioned.</p>
               <p>To manifeſt this we may take a brief ſurvey of the principles of action natural to mankind, together with thoſe advantages and aſſiſtances which in different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees ordinarily attend the outward diſpenſation of the goſpel. This enquiry will be neceſſary to obviate exceptions, as will appear in the progreſs of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. But if the reader has a mind to avoid me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical diſquiſitions, contenting himſelf with the ſimple doctrine of divine revelation, and the ſimple dictates of common ſenſe, he may if he pleaſes paſs over what follows to the 73<hi rend="sup">d</hi> page, which for the ſake of ſome readers has been inſerted.</p>
               <p>It will be proper in the firſt place, to ſhew what is here intended by a principle of action. The word
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:012416_0056_0F89750432B89A98"/>
principle is of a very general ſignification. It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends whatever has a cauſal influence into an action. It may be applied to the agent, who is the <hi>efficient</hi> principle, to the faculty or primary power, which metaphyſical writers call the <hi>ſubstantial prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi> But theſe are foreign to our preſent enquiry. What we here mean by a principle of action, is <hi>that in or belonging to a voluntary agent, whereby he is fitted, guided, and diſpoſed unto the performance of ſuch kind of actions as have been mentioned.</hi> Or in one word the <hi>formal principle.</hi> Theſe principles might be reduced to two heads, viz. the <hi>directing,</hi> and the <hi>moving</hi> or <hi>prompting</hi> principles. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſollicitous to reduce them to theſe claſſes they may conveniently enough be comprized in theſe four particulars. Reaſon, Conſcience, Self-love, and other particular inclinations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Reaſon is a principle of action natural to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. By which I do not mean ſimply the natural faculty of reaſoning and judging, but as furniſhed with an habitual power, fitneſs, and promptitude to reaſon, judge and dictate <hi>aright,</hi> eſpecially in matters relating to practice. Hereby we diſcern the connection between cauſes and their effects, the ſuitableneſs of means to their ends, and in what way we are to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue that happineſs we deſire. When therefore we are convinced that we are haſtning into the eternal world, where thoſe who are reconciled to God will be happy in his favour, and thoſe who are obnoxious to his wrath will be puniſhed with everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and that now is the ſeaſon of mercy, in which God is uſing means with us, and calling us to attend on them, in order to obtain that knowledge of the way of ſalvation, and that divine influence which may perſuade and enable us to an acquieſcence in, and conſent to it; reaſon will dictate that it is fit and right
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:012416_0057_0F897504F143B990"/>
for us to regard our eternal intereſt according to it's importance; and diligently uſe thoſe outward means whereby God is wont to communicate to ſinners the bleſſings of his ſpecial grace. The dictate of reaſon will have a tendency to determine our wills to ſuch a conduct as it preſcribes. For there is a propenſity in the mind to follow the practical dictates of it's own reaſon; which though often controuled by ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular appetite or inclination acting in oppoſition thereto, will yet even when overpowered make a ſtrong reſiſtance.
<q>The dictate of reaſon (ſays Mr. EDWARDS,) declaring what is moſt for a perſon's happineſs taking in the whole of his duration, when it takes place, is one thing that is put into the ſcales, and is to be conſidered as a thing which has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in the compound influence which moves or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the will,</q>
&amp;c. <note n="*" place="bottom">Enquiry concerning the will, p. 12.</note> Though the ſoul be promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the choice of it's ultimate end not by reaſon but by taſte, yet in the choice of the means condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to this end the dictate of reaſon has great weight to determine the will. Whether therefore it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to call reaſon a prompting, or only a directing principle of action, certain it is that it's dictates have a tendency to influence the conduct of mankind. Reaſon aſſiſted by the word and Spirit of God, will tend to engage the unregenerate to a ſerious attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the means of grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſcience is another principle of action natural to mankind. In this principle is implied a moral ſenſe approving virtue and diſapproving vice; whence ariſes a ſenſe of deſert, as an eminent writer of our own has juſtly obſerved. <note n="†" place="bottom">EDWARDS on the nature of true virtue, chap. 5.</note> That there is a moral ſenſe or taſte of the natural beauty of virtue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:012416_0058_0F897505B3725D48"/>
of vice, diſtinct from a ſupernatural principle of holineſs, may I ſuppoſe be taken for granted. Now conſcience I ſay, when enlightned by the word and awakened by the Spirit of God, is both a direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prompting principle of action. It directs men what they ought to do, it repreſents the obligation they are under to do it, the reaſonableneſs of comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their duty, the unfitneſs of a contrary beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and from a ſenſe of the difference between right and wrong warns them what to expect as the juſt conſequence of their actions. The approbation of conſcience implies ſome perception or taſte of the natural beauty of virtue, and this denotes ſome kind of propenſity in the heart to ſuch acts as are thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, though not a holy ſpiritual propenſity to ſpiritual excellency as ſuch. A ſenſe of beauty of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind implies taſte or inclination of ſoul to it. The moral ſenſe ſhews that there is ſomething in it's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject attractive of the heart. That painful remorſe which is cauſed by a conſciouſneſs of ſin ſhews that it is repugnant to ſome taſte or inclination: For as pleaſure conſiſts in the gratification of ſome taſte or appetite, ſo pain ariſes from the diſagreement and contrariety of it's object to ſome taſte or appetite. When therefore an unregenerate ſinner is convinced that it is his duty by virtue of the divine command to reform his life, and attend the means of grace; conſcience as a director, moral inducer to, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover of duty, will have an influence to determine the will to a compliance with it's dictates. Other natural inclinations may be too ſtrong for conſcience to controul, yet when it is overpowered by luſt, there will be many times a hard and uneaſy renitency.</p>
               <p>But Mr. H. objects, p. 10.
<q>Natural conſcience, ſo far as it is diſtinguiſhed from the heart, is no principle of action at all. The heart is the ſource
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:012416_0059_0F89750673B899C0"/>
and ſeat of all moral exerciſe and action. Natural conſcience therefore, as diſtinguiſhed from this, is neither virtuous nor vicious.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I can ſcarce ſatisfy myſelf what is intended in this objection; but if I can gueſs at the meaning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it, it is exceeding impertinent. Natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience belongs to the heart, and is a principle of it, if we underſtand by the heart the ſame that is meant by it in ſcripture. "By the heart," ſays Dr. Owen,
<q>the ſcripture underſtandeth all the faculties of our ſouls, as they are an entire rational principle of all moral and ſpiritual operations.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">OWEN on apoſtacy, chap. 13.</note> And again more particularly:
<q>The heart generally denotes the whole ſoul of man, and all the faculties of it, not abſolutely, but as they are all one principle of moral operations, as they all concur to our doing good or evil. The mind as it enquireth, diſcerneth, and judgeth what is to be done, and what refuſed; the will as it chuſeth or refuſeth and avoids; the affections as they like or diſlike, cleave to, or have an averſion from that which is propoſed to them; the conſcience as it warns and determines, are all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether called the heart.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Id. On indwelling ſin. chap. 3.</note> We will then readily grant that conſcience as diſtinct from all the powers and principles of the ſoul is no principle of operation, but we do not mean any ſuch thing by natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. We ſuppoſe (and if we are wrong we would gladly be ſet right) that natural conſcience is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the heart or ſoul, conſidered as the ſource of moral action. It is one principle among others that has influence in determining the acts of the will; which is very conſiſtent with the ſuppoſition of the heart's being the principle of all moral operation.—
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:012416_0060_0F897507317E2E68"/>
There are ſeveral particular principles of rational and moral action in the human mind, which have their ſeveral influence into it's acts, and being joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether they form <hi>one compound principle of action,</hi> which we call the heart. And if we ſhould take the word <hi>Heart</hi> to ſignify the will, which is perhaps what our author means by it, natural conſcience would ſtill be a principle of it. For it includes the moral ſenſe, as has been juſt obſerved. And the moral ſenſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies taſte, which doubtleſs belongs to the appetitive faculty. The apoſtle calls the impreſſion and ſenſe of duty which the Gentiles had in their conſcience, the work of the law written in their hearts <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 2.15.</note> Yea, if the conſcience belong wholly to the underſtanding, it may yet properly be called a principle of moral action, if any regard be paid to the dictate of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence declaring what is duty, if this be one thing to be put into the ſcale, which if there be any ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in human nature as the moral ſenſe cannot be denied. The underſtanding is allowed to be a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of action as well as the will by thoſe who make uſe of this diſtinction of the faculties. Yea what is more uſual among divines than to call the <hi>acts</hi> of the ſoul, ſuch as knowledge, faith, love, &amp;c. principles of ſuch actions as flow from them? And would not that man be thought impertinent who ſhould ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly inſiſt, that theſe as diſtinguiſhed from the heart are no principles of moral action, becauſe the heart is the ſource and ſeat of all moral exerciſe? Or would any intelligent and candid perſon imagine there is any impropriety in ſaying, that in ſome ſenſe the whole ſoul is the only principle of moral action, and at the ſame time that the ſeveral diſtinct <hi>faculties, habits</hi> and <hi>various acts</hi> of the ſoul, are diſtinct and ſeveral
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:012416_0061_0F897507F0CBA360"/>
principles of operation? That natural conſcience, in itſelf conſidered, is either virtuous or ſinful, we do not aſſert, nor have any occaſion to do it in order to maintain that it is a principle of ſuch actions as are here ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Self-love is another natural principle whereby men may be prompted to reform their lives, and attend on the means of grace. This need not be proved, Mr. H. aſſerting that "the unregenerate act only from ſelf-love." What is the proper notion of ſelf-love, is a point that much needs to be duly ſtated and cleared, having had ſo large a ſhare of grave per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity through the ſubtilties of vain philoſophy. The reader will I hope pardon me if I divert a little from the main buſineſs in hand, to ſet this matter in a true light.</p>
               <p>It will be proper to premiſe ſome general obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning love, which may help us in reſolving our preſent enquiry concerning the nature of ſelf-love.</p>
               <p>Love being a ſimple perception or affection of the heart, cannot properly be defined; yet it is felt and known by all men. It is commonly diſtinguiſhed into two kinds, <hi>benevolence</hi> and <hi>complacence. Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence is love to perſons or beings capable of happineſs. Complacence is love to thoſe things which are objects of happineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Benevolence is, I think, juſtly termed by Mr. Edwards, <note n="*" place="bottom">On the Nature of true Virtue, pag. 119.</note>
                  <q>that affection or propenſity of heart to any being which cauſes it to incline to it's well being, or diſpoſes it to deſire and take pleaſure in it's happineſs.</q>
Here we may obſerve, that our love to or delight in the happineſs of any being is not benevolence, if this be a juſt account of it, but is an immediate effect, a diſtinct act of the mind flowing from it. Both the <hi>object</hi> and <hi>act</hi> are different. The
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:012416_0062_0F89750985FE83F0"/>
                  <hi>object</hi> of benevolence is ſome perceptive being, which is diſtinct from the happineſs of the ſame being. The <hi>acts</hi> are alſo different. For we love and delight in the <hi>happineſs</hi> of a perſon, <hi>becauſe</hi> we love the <hi>perſon himſelf.</hi> Benevolence is ſuch a union of ſoul in affection to the perſon beloved as is a foundation or cauſe of a participation in the good or evil that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals him. Hence ariſes a love to, or <hi>complacency</hi> in his happineſs.</p>
               <p>Complacence is <hi>that affection we have for thoſe things which are agreable to ſome taſte or appetite ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or mental.</hi> Happineſs is nothing elſe but our <hi>enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> thoſe things which are <hi>objects of our complacence.</hi> Our love to the happineſs of thoſe for whom we have a benevolent affection, is our complacence in their happineſs. Our love of knowledge, virtue, arts, riches, honour, food, is our complacency in them. And when we have a love of complacence for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it is the <hi>character or endowments</hi> of the perſon that is it's preciſe object.</p>
               <p>Theſe two diſtinct kinds of love being thus noted and deſcribed in general, I proceed to ſay, that bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence may in reſpect of it's object be divided into two branches, viz. <hi>Self love,</hi> and <hi>love of other percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive beings.</hi> It may be ſomewhat unuſual to call ſelf-love a branch of benevolence: But as the import of the word will well bear this uſe of it, ſo there are good authorities to ſupport it. What I aim at is to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh a love of good will, whether to ourſelves or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, from love of complacence, which ſeems to have been very often in ſome degree confounded with it. As ſelf-love is only benevolence to ourſelves, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of benevolence which has juſt been given may be applied to ſelf-love, viz.
<q>It is that affection or propenſity of heart to ourſelves, which cauſes us to incline to our own well being, or diſpoſes us to
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:012416_0063_0F89750A3054B9F8"/>
deſire, and take pleaſure in our own happineſs.</q>— Here then I would obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Self-love is not properly called a love of our own happineſs in any ſenſe. The love of happineſs is complacency. It has not a perceptive being for it's immediate object.</p>
               <p>The love of our own happineſs is an ambiguous expreſſion. Sometimes it is put for the love of that whatever it be, that is delightful, or an object of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to us. This indeed ſeems to be an improper way of ſpeaking, amounting at bottom to no more than this, our loving what we love. The love of our own happineſs moſt properly means <hi>a compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in our own happy ſtate, becauſe it is our own,</hi> ariſing from benevolence to ourſelves; even as we take complacency in the happineſs of thoſe we love becauſe it is theirs, they are the ſubjects of it. But neither love to thoſe things which are objects of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to us, nor the love of our own delight as our own is ſelf-love, though both the one and the other have often been confounded with it. As this ought to be carefully attended to in order to conceive aright of this matter, and yet, ſo far as I have obſerved, is generally overlooked, I crave leave to conſider it more diſtinctly.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Love to thoſe things which are delightful to us is intirely diſtinct from ſelf-love. It will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by thoſe with whom we are preſently concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>that</hi> love to, or complacency in the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of others which ariſes from benevolence to them, is diſtinct from ſelf-love. I add, that love to any thing <hi>as an object of happineſs,</hi> however private or perſonal the pleaſure reſulting from it may be, is <hi>toto coelo</hi> diſtinct from ſelf-love. This may ſeem a ſtrange aſſertion to thoſe who have received it from eminent divines, that it is meer ſelf-love that appears in the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:012416_0064_0F89750AF0838E40"/>
diſpoſition of men to be pleaſed with the objects of their private and perſonal delight. But if we keep in mind the true notion of ſelf-love, viz. good will to ourſelves, we ſhall ſee that there is nothing of ſelf-love in theſe inclinations and affections. Both the object and act or affection are wholly different, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does the one affection flow from the other. The object of ſelf-love is ourſelves; the object of theſe appetites and inclinations is ſomething diverſe from and extrinſic to ourſelves that is delightful to us. The affection of ſelf-love is <hi>benevolence</hi> to ourſelves: The affection we have to that which delights us, is complacency in it as a pleaſant good.</p>
               <p>Moreover our love to, or complacency in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar objects of delight, does not proceed from ſelf-love. Self-love is not the cauſe why I find an immediate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal delight in beauty, proportion, particular ſtudies, employments, recreations, food which I may be fond of. The foundation of this delight, is a particular taſte or reliſh for theſe things, and not the good will I have for myſelf. Self-love prompts us to ſeek thoſe things which are objects or means of happineſs to us, but it no more creates i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> creates the things themſelves loved and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in. Nor does ſelf-love flow from our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in particular objects. Complacency in the character of perſons may be a foundation of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to them; but complacence in ſomething diſtinct from ourſelves, is not the cauſe of good will to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Nor does ſelf love flow from complacency in our own character, nor has any neceſſary connection with it, as is too manifeſt to need any proof.</p>
               <p>This by the way ſhews the falſhood of that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which Mr. H. often lays down, and builds much upon it, without once offering any thing, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:012416_0065_0F89750BB36DAE10"/>
in the ſhape of an argument to prove it, viz. <hi>that the unregenerate act wholly from ſelf love.</hi> As this is no where aſſerted in ſcripture, nor I ſuppoſe, ever was, will, or can be proved, it may without preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be called in queſtion. To ſay that men natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly act only from ſelf love, implies that all the natural inclinations or affections of men prompting them to action are reſolved into ſelf-love: The impropriety and abſurdity of which has juſt been noted. Men often in their actions follow the impulſe of particular inſtincts or appetites in oppoſition to their own intereſt on the whole, yea in oppoſition to "what reaſon declares to be beſt or moſt for their happineſs taking in the whole of their duration." <note n="*" place="bottom">See EDWARDS on the Will, p. 12.</note> Love to our own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs <hi>in general,</hi> is the only love of happineſs that flows from ſelf-love; and therefore ſelf-love ſo far as it governs the acts of our will, will always prompt us to chuſe and do what we think will be moſt for our good upon the whole, taking in the whole of our exiſtence. But a regard to what we judge will be moſt for our good and happineſs upon the whole is far from having always the whole government and determination of our wills and actions. Particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, paſſions and appetites, are ſometimes ſo ſtrong, that inſtead of ſubmitting to the rules and meaſures which a regard to good upon the whole would preſcribe, they carry the will captive as it were, and turn the ſcale againſt all the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itency of ſelf-love. Whenever a preſent pleaſure is preferred to a future advantage which a perſon judges will be greater when it comes,<note n="†" place="bottom">Idem pag. 8.</note> it is not a regard for our own intereſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole (which is the only regard for it that flows from ſelf-love) that determines the will in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the preſent pleaſure. For a regard to our own
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:012416_0066_0F89750C72BF64E0"/>
happineſs upon the whole, if that were the ſole go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning principle, would incline the will to the choice of that which is judged to be upon the whole moſt for our advantage: But it is the ſtrength of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inclination to the preſent pleaſure, intirely diſtinct from ſelf-love, or a love to our general happineſs, which cauſes that pleaſure to appear more agreable than a greater advantage at a diſtance.</p>
               <p>There are alſo many actions which flow partly from a general regard to our own happineſs, and partly from particular taſtes or inclinations. Such as eating and drinking, acts of kindneſs to thoſe we love, of compaſſion to the miſerable, attendance on divine ordinances, and in a word all actions which may in themſelves give preſent pleaſure, and be alſo of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage hereafter. A regard to our own happineſs on the whole will alſo incline us to the indulgence of every appetite, when the pleaſure of indulgence is not followed with diſadvantages ſufficient to counterba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance it. On this account it may be difficult or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to determine concerning particular actions, how far we were prompted to them by appetite or <hi>particular inclination,</hi> and how far by a <hi>general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi> to our own happineſs flowing from ſelf-love. But the difference between theſe two principles of action is palpable; and that both have their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence into our conduct is undeniable. Sometimes one is the governing principle, and ſometimes the other.</p>
               <p>It is methinks to be regretted that the confuſed unphiloſophical notions of the old Epicureans, Hobbs, and the moſt corrupt of the infidel writers, and that ſtrange affectation of reſolving all particular affections natural to mankind into ſelf-love, in oppoſition to common ſenſe, ſhould be revived among us by chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian writers, and thoſe of no mean note. But to proceed,</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:012416_0067_0F89750D32F092B8"/>2. Love to our own happineſs is not ſelf-love. This has been explained to mean complacence in our own welfare, as our own. Though this flows im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and neceſſarily from ſelf-love, and is often blended with it, yet the very terms ſhew that both the object and affection are of a different kind. The object of ſelf-love is <hi>my ſelf,</hi> a perceptive being. Happineſs a <hi>deſirable good</hi> is the object of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, when I love my own happineſs. The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections I have for theſe different objects are alſo of a different kind, though both called by the name of love. The one is benevolence to myſelf, the other complacence in my own happineſs. Benevolence does not imply complacence in the perſon beloved, nor does complacence imply benevolence to the good beloved.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Both ſelf-love, and the love of our own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are different from ſelfiſhneſs. Selfiſhneſs is a regard to ourſelves and our own good, excluſive of all regards to others or their good. Two things are expreſſed in this definition. Firſt a love to ourſelves and our own happineſs. Secondly an excluſion of love to others and their happineſs. Obſerve here, that the excluſion or privation of love to others added to ſelf-love changes the idea. It is adding wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to it. For the viciouſneſs of ſelfiſhneſs conſiſts not at all in the love of ourſelves or of our happineſs, but wholly in the excluſion of love to others and their happineſs.
<q>Self-love is a very uſeful and neceſſary principle in the world of mankind.</q>
It not only conduces to their preſervation and comfort here, but <q>in innumerable reſpects reſtrains from acts of true wickedneſs, and puts men upon ſeeking true vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</q>

But the want of love to others is neither good nor uſeful; it is utterly ſinful, and in it's ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency

Nor does it appear that ſelf-love is in general too ſtrong, but only that love to others is too weak. The diſorders and miſeries which abound in the world through the wickedneſs of men, are perhaps chiefly owing to the inordinate ſtrength of particular appetites and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, ungoverned by a regard to their own gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. has gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en two definitions of ſelf-love.— The firſt is a love of happineſs, the ſecond is ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">Pag. 121.</note> It appears that he has intirely miſtaken the thing in both. It is neither the one nor the other— but in ſhort no more not leſs than good will to ourſelves.</p>
               <p>But it will be ſaid, ſelf-love in the unregenerate is without benevolence to other beings, ſo is indeed ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhneſs.
<q>They have no reſpect or regard either to God or man only for ſelfiſh ends, and as the fruit and exerciſe of this ſelfiſhneſs. And this being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to all that is truly good, ſo far as men act from this principle, they ſin.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whether ſelf-love be ſin, and whether all actions flowing from it are ſin, will afterwards be conſidered. At preſent I will only attend briefly to theſe two enquities: Whether the unregenerate have no good will to others or delight in their happineſs, except what flows from and is reſolvable into meer ſelf-love? And whether ſelf-love in them is ſelfiſhneſs?</p>
               <p>I have ſhewn that men have naturally particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and inclinations to objects diſtinct from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or their own happineſs; which inclinations are
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:012416_0069_0F89750EB990B1C0"/>
ſometimes ſo ſtrong as to controul and govern ſelf-love itſelf. It is now enquired whether there be in men unregenerate any love to <hi>perſons</hi> diſtinct from ſelf-love, and which is not educed from, and to be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into it as it's ſource and only principle? Some have earneſtly endeavoured to prove that there is not. Mr. H. though he has not offered one ſentence that I remember tending to evince the certainty or proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of what he aſſerts, is behind hand of none in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently affirming, that
<q>the unregenerate have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to any only for ſelfiſh ends, and as a fruit and exerciſe of ſelfiſhneſs.</q>
How he confounds the ideas of ſelf-love and ſelfiſhneſs has been noted, and ſhall preſently be further manifeſted. We will put the moſt candid conſtruction to his words, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that by ſelfiſhneſs he means ſelf-love. But how earneſtly ſoever he may beg, or how peremptorily ſoever he may challenge a conceſſion, that men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate have no love or regard to any others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>pt what flows from ſelf-love, I can by no means conſent at preſent that this be taken for granted.</p>
               <p>For 1. All that has been offered to prove this, ſo far as I have hitherto obſerved, tends only to ſhew that <hi>poſſibly</hi> ſelf love may be the only principle whence all thoſe appearances of good will and kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others which are obſervable in mankind in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral may be educed. The argument in it's full ſtrength is no more than this. It may be ſo, therefore it is ſo. It is poſſible, therefore it is certain. But by what rule of logic can ſuch a way of arguing be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? <note n="*" place="bottom">A poſſe ad eſſe non valet conſequentia.</note> If it were true that all kind affections towards others <hi>may be</hi> effects of meer ſelf-love, how will this prove that they <hi>certainly are?</hi> They may as well ariſe from friendly inclinations, inſtincts, and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons implanted in human nature. The contrary never
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:012416_0070_0F89750F71256008"/>
was nor can be proved. We may then full as juſtly conclude, that ſince the love which men have for their friends and relatives and others may ariſe from a particular inſtinct or diſpoſition of human nature diſtinct from ſelf-love, therefore it does ariſe from ſuch a principle, and not from meer ſelf-love. Such an argument I know would not be concluſive; yet it would have this advantage above the other, that it would conclude agreable to the common ſentiments of mankind. But to conclude that all unregenerate men are as ſelfiſh in their kindeſt actions towards thoſe they moſt love, as the moſt hard hearted op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors are in their moſt unconſcionable meaſures to promote their private intereſts, is, I dare ſay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the common ſenſe of fools and philoſophers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the unregenerate act merely from ſelf-love, then we are under no obligations of gratitude to them for any acts of kindneſs they may do us. Children have no more reaſon to be thankful to their parents, however affectionate and careful for their welfare, than if they only nurſed them as lambs to kill and eat them. If there be no love exerciſed towards us, or kindneſs deſigned to us, except what is wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceable to love and kindneſs to themſelves, we owe no gratitude, or thanks, or recompence for it. Our obligation to gratitude is founded upon ſome favour done or deſigned to us for our ſakes, and not wholly for the ſake of the benefactor. If after receiving kindneſſes from any one we find that he had no ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate intention to do us good, but only to ſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, we feel ourſelves at once diſcharged from the obligations of gratitude. If a man ſhould expreſs the warmeſt affections to a woman, both by words and gifts, meerly to bribe her to ſubmit to his will, that he might enjoy the pleaſure of the ſixth ſenſe (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> calls it) by abuſing her, here is no obligation
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:012416_0071_0F8975118C4DDB48"/>
to gratitude. If ſelf-love be the only principle of action, and ſelf-intereſt the only end ultimately aimed at, it matters not whether a man aims at advancing his wealth or honor, or pleaſure of any kind. If he has no ultimate intention of benefiting any but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, (which it is certain he has not if he acts meerly from ſelf-love) no thanks or recompence is due for benefits conferred, how many and great ſoever they may be. But this ſurely is a conſequence not to be endured, which at one ſtroke cancels all obligations of gratitude to parents, friends, and benefactors, for all favours and kindneſſes, if they are unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. I add,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That love which the unregenerate have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to others, cannot poſſibly be educed from ſelf-love. I grant there is a love to others, both a love of benevolence and complacence, which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into meer ſelf-love as it's principle and ſource. Thus, ſelf-love produces complacence in our own happineſs. Hence ariſes complacence in a character favourable to our own happineſs. Complacence in the character produces benevolence to the perſon. But ſelf-love does not produce either benevolence or complacence towards another <hi>for his own ſake,</hi> but meerly in order to my own benefit. A regard to our own welfare will cauſe us to love what we think is conducive to it <hi>as a uſeful good,</hi> but not <hi>as a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful good</hi>—that is, to love it as a <hi>means,</hi> but not as an <hi>end.</hi> We may from this principle love a character that is favourable to our intereſt, and love the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the perſon, and be much delighted in it, <hi>for our own ſakes,</hi> as a means of our own happineſs, but not <hi>for it's own ſake,</hi> as an object of happineſs. It is the very ſame kind of love which we have for a fruitful field, or a favourable ſeaſon. It is true per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do us good deſignedly, whereas inanimate things
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:012416_0072_0F897511B166FCE8"/>
are uſeful without deſign or conſciouſneſs. But this makes no difference in the view of meer ſelf-love. That will never cauſe us to love either the character or the happy ſtate of any one in the leaſt degree in itſelf, or for it's own ſake, but only as profitable to us. Seperate the means from the end, and our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for them will ceaſe immediately and intirely, if we valued them only for the ſake of the end. It alters not the caſe at all in this reſpect, whether the means of our happineſs are conſcious or not. Meer ſelf-love will never cauſe us to love any perſon, or to deſire his happineſs, or be pleaſed with it at all, as agreable in itſelf, but purely in order to our own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, that he may ſerve us the better; and when we expect no further advantage by his means, we ſhall be perfectly indifferent how it fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s with him.</p>
               <p>But it is evident that the unregenerate have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuch a love to others, as cauſes them to have a real pleaſure in and concern for their welfare, ſeparate from all hopes or proſpects of being benefited by them. For it will diſcover itſelf ſtrongly in ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where there are no ſuch proſpects. Is it not often ſeen that ſuch when they are in their own apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on juſt leaving the world, and have no expectation of being any longer ſerved by their friends, will appear as much or more concerned for them as when they had hopes of living long to enjoy them. But as to thoſe things which are valued only for their uſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they might value them before, the proſpect of having no further advantage at once cools their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and makes them unconcerned and indifferent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them. It is not mere ſelf-love that prompts a man to expoſe his life to ſave the life of one, who he never expects will be able to make him any adequate requital; or to grieve at his misfortunes, which no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe affect him than by exciting ſympathetic ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:012416_0073_0F897512709852A8"/>
In ſuch inſtances as theſe there appears a love to the happineſs of others as a good deſirable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful in itſelf, and not merely profitable and ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to ſelf-intereſt, and conſequently ſuch a love as cannot be educed from and reſolved into ſelf-love. Which was to be proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scholium.</hi> Many things are loved partly as delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in themſelves, and partly as uſeful. The welfare of our friends may be deſired on both theſe accounts. So may reputation, honours, authority, and even rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; for ſome appear to have a fondneſs for them diſtinct from what ariſes from their apprehended uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. But that love which terminates in it's object as in itſelf delightful can never be reſolved into ſelf-love or a love of our own happineſs; and however it may be joined or compounded with a value for the ſame object as uſeful, it is in it's nature as intirely and eſſentially different from it, as the love I have for any food as pleaſant, is different from the love I have for it as wholeſome. <note n="*" place="bottom">When a perſon who has been pleaſed with the ſinging of a bird, or frighted with a rattle ſnake, is delighted or diſguſted at the ſight of their pictures, this does not ariſe from ſelf love. (See Edwards on the nature of true Virtue, pag. 155.) It is not ſelf-love but a particular taſte that is the immediate ſubjective ground of that pleaſure we have by ſeeing and hearing a beautiful ſinging bird. Nor is it ſtrange if the ſame taſte ſhould be ſomewhat gratified by a lively idea of the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.

This ſeems to ariſe from ſome habitual alteration in the ſtate of the ſtomach, and organs of taſte and ſmell. That may ariſe from an abiding change in the brain or nerves occaſioned by the fright. There is, I doubt not, a phyſical cauſe of both. What it is I leave to the naturaliſts.</note>

But though this ſeems unneceſſary, it may not be amiſs to add, that it will not follow from any thing that has here been pleaded for, that mankind have naturally a principle of true holineſs, nor does it enervate the proofs of mans natural depravity from ſcripture and experience. But truth ſcorns to be beholden to error for it's ſupport, and human nature corrupt as it is may be miſrepreſented and belied.</p>
               <p>Our next enquiry, namely, whether ſelf-love in the unregenerate is ſelfiſhneſs, and whether all actions flowing from ſelf-love are ſelfiſh, and flow from a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh principle, is now to be briefly attended to. Now though it be true that all who have ſelf-love without any good will to others are ſelfiſh perſons, yet it is not ſelf-love ſimply that is ſelfiſhneſs, or that conſtitutes any one a ſelfiſh perſon. The excluſion of good will to others is eſſentially contained in the idea of ſelfiſhneſs, as has juſt been noted. This is a very important part of the idea, which is not included in ſelf-love. When this vicious defect, is conjoined with ſelf-love in our conception, the idea is changed from what it was before, and the name expreſſing it muſt be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged alſo. It is not ſelf-love that is ſelfiſhneſs, nor is it the want of love to others, but both together. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a whole into parts, and neither one part nor the other taken by itſelf is the whole.</p>
               <p>If it ſhould be ſuppoſed that men naturally act from meer ſelf-love, it would not follow that they acted from a ſelfiſh principle. An action does not flow from ſelfiſhneſs unleſs want of love to others as well as love to ourſelves be a formal principle; ſo as
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:012416_0075_0F897513F1A45020"/>
that what is done ſhould be an expreſſion or evidence of the former, as well as the latter. When a man does that to promote his own intereſt which is in his apprehenſion inconſiſtent with the intereſt of others, his action flows from ſelfiſhneſs; it takes it's form from the want of love to others, as well as from love to himſelf. If he had regarded the welfare of others he would have done otherwiſe. But when a man aims at his own welfare in ſuch a way as is conſiſtent with the welfare of others, ſelf-love is the principle he acts from; it is from this his action takes it's form, and not at all from the want of love to others. It is an expreſſion of good will to himſelf, it is no expreſſion of want of love to others. Whether he had regarded the welfare of others or not, he would have done the very ſame that he has done. Suppoſe he has no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the intereſt of others, he is then a ſelfiſh man. Suppoſe what he does interferes with the intereſt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in his apprehenſion, and ſo is an expreſſion and evidence of want of love to them as well as of love to himſelf, it then flows from ſelfiſhneſs, that is, it flows from want of love to others, as well as from ſelf-love. But ſuppoſe what he does be profitable to himſelf, and conſiſtent with the intereſt of others, then meer ſelf-love is the formal principle. The want of love to others has no influence in the caſe.</p>
               <p>It may ſeem ſtrange to thoſe who are unacquainted with metaphyſics, that a defect or privation ſhould be ſpoken of as a formal principle, which has an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in it's kind into an action. To open this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fully would carry us too great a length into ſome abſtruſe diſquiſitions. Though privative cauſes (as they are called) have no poſitive or phyſical influence in determining the acts of the will, yet the formality of actions has a dependance upon them; and actions are very often denominated from them. The fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:012416_0076_0F897514B2587550"/>
of an agent, though a meer defect, is though not a phyſical, yet a logical cauſe, and formal princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a fooliſh action; which action is denominated fooliſh, not meerly becauſe it is the act of a fooliſh man, but becauſe it is an expreſſion of folly, taking it's form as fooliſh from this defect in the agent. The ſame obſervations may be applied to ſelfiſh actions.</p>
               <p>An action flowing meerly from ſelf-love is not therefore a ſelfiſh action, according to the common and proper ſignification of the word, unleſs it inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feres with the intereſt of others, and ſo is an expreſſion and evidence of a vicious defect of good will to them. It is properly an <hi>intereſted</hi> action. There is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the general acceptation of words, the ſame difference between an intereſted and a ſelfiſh action, as there is between ſelf-love and ſelfiſhneſs. Self-love is the principle of the former, ſelfiſhneſs of the latter.</p>
               <p>Theſe obſervations may appear to ſome more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til than uſeful. Perhaps we ſhall find before we have done, that it is of more importance than preſently appears, to have our words and ideas as determinate as poſſible in reaſoning on ſuch points as are before us.</p>
               <p>To return from this long digreſſion. If an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſinner may have any juſt reaſon to think, that his reforming his life, and attending the means of grace tends to his benefit in any reſpect, ſelf-love will be a prompting principle to ſuch a conduct; and that in ſome proportion to the clearneſs of his conviction hereof, and the ſtrength of his love to himſelf, and his own happineſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There are other affections and inclinations natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to mankind, which may influence them to a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and an attendance on the common means of grace. The natural diſpoſition in men to be pleaſed in being loved and honoured, and uneaſy in being
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:012416_0077_0F89751577D07F78"/>
the objects of contempt and abhorrence, tends to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them to the practice of thoſe virtues which are of good report, and reſtrain from a diſſolute life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by mankind. This pleaſure and trouble though private does not flow from ſelf-love, as ſome have imagined; but from a particular inclination of human nature. For a conſciouſneſs of being beloved by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is in itſelf delightful to us, and the contrary grievous. But (as has been ſhewn) love to ourſelves and our own happineſs will never cauſe us to delight in any particular object for it's own ſake, but only as a means, and for the ſake of a further end. Other particular affections and inſtincts might be mentioned tending to reſtrain men from a profligate life, and diſpoſe them to a contrary behavior, which I omit. Yet I cannot forbear mentioning that inquiſitive turn of mind, that thirſt after knowledge, for which ſome are remarkable, and all I ſuppoſe have ſomething of it, by which many are prompted to ſeek after divine knowledge, and ſearch for it in the uſe of means as for hid treaſure. Many who have no principle of true holineſs take a real pleaſure in ſearching the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, informing their minds with a doctrinal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the principles of chriſtian religion, and the evidences of it's divine authority, in attending on divine ordinances, &amp;c. There is a mental taſte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining hereto, which is diſtinct from ſelf-love, though this may have a joint influence with it.</p>
               <p>From the whole it appears that the unregenerate are furniſhed with ſuch principles of action, as with the advantages of inſtruction from the word of God, by the common influence of his Spirit, are ſufficient to enable them to reform their lives, and attend the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon means of grace. They have a principle or next power from which by mere moral ſuaſion ſuch acts of will may be educed.</p>

                  <pb n="74" facs="unknown:012416_0078_0F89751632E03738"/>Mr. H's ſentiments on the general ſubject hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to treated of are expreſſed in the following words.
<q>The unregenerate ſinner is under no kind of ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or difficulty that is in the way of his turning to God immediately, which the open profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate is not under as a bar in the way of his reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his conduct immediately. In the latter caſe all the difficulty lies in the corruption of his heart, and the oppoſition of his will to it, and this is all the difficulty in the former. And if it is more difficult for a ſinner to turn to God through Jeſus Chriſt with his whole heart than it is for him to forſake all ways of known ſin in his external con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and he is under a greater inability to do the former than the latter, it is wholly becauſe his will oppoſes the former more than it does the latter, or rather becauſe the latter may be complied with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the indulgence of the reigning wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the heart, and enmity againſt God, whereas the former cannot. The reaſon why the open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate does not reform his conduct immediately i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, becauſe he is not willing, or his heart oppoſes this. And the only reaſon why the awakened ſinner does not embrace the goſpel immediately, but remains obſtinately impenitent, is becauſe his will even his whole heart oppoſes it. All the difference is, that in the latter caſe the oppoſition of the heart to Jeſus Chriſt is more fixed and ſtrong than it is in the former caſe to an external reformation, as an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reformation may be complied with conſiſtent with the gratification of the reigning luſts of the heart: But compliance with the goſpel cannot.</q>

               <p>As this way of repreſenting the inability of fallen man has lately crept into vogue with ſome other
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:012416_0079_0F897517DEAEC068"/>
                  <hi>ingenious</hi> writers, beſides our author, who ſeem to look upon it as an important and happy diſcovery, it may not be amiſs to propoſe ſome brief obſervations in anſwer to theſe two enquiries.</p>
               <p>Wherein conſiſts the inability or difficulty which obſtructs the reformation of the profligate, and the converſion of the unregenerate?</p>
               <p>Is the inability or difficulty in both caſes of the ſame kind?</p>
               <p>To the firſt I ſay, that by the acknowledgment of all there is no ſuch inability in either caſe as conſiſts in the want of ſtrength in the natural faculties either to reform, or turn to God. There is no want of primary power neceſſary to theſe purpoſes, either in the profligate or unregenerate. The profligate is alſo furniſhed with ſuch natural principles or habitual ſprings of action, as are capable of being wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by perſuaſives, ſo as that he may without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of ſupernatural habits be prevailed with to
<q>forſake the ways of known ſin in his external con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</q>
The obſtructions in the way of his refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation are his reliſh for the pleaſures of ſin, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal difficulties and oppoſition which muſt be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come if he changes his courſe: To which we muſt add ignorance, or error of judgment, in reſpect of the advantage of reforming his life, and the deſtructive tendency of a profligate courſe, and in conſequence of this an unwillingneſs to reform. But by means of inſtruction and motives, his miſtaken apprehenſions may be rectified, and ſuch a willingneſs and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to reform his life may without the infuſion of any ſupernatural principle be excited, as ſhall overpower all theſe obſtructions. It may then be truly ſaid that it is in his power to reform. All that is wanting is that this power be drawn forth into act by exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and moral inducements. He has <hi>natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:012416_0080_0F897518761058E8"/>
and habits</hi> whence ſuch acts of will may be educed as are implied in a reformation of his external conduct.</p>
               <p>The inability of the unregenerate to turn to God immediately conſiſts in his unregeneracy. That is, the want of a principle of true holineſs, a ſecondary power, or next capacity of being perſuaded by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and arguments to turn from ſin to God, as has been declared at large.</p>
               <p>To the other enquiry, viz. Whether the inability of the profligate to reform his life be of the ſame kind with the inability of the unregenerate to turn to God? I anſwer, it ſeems very plain that it is not. For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The profligate has a real and proper ability to reform his life, being endowed with natural faculties, and habitual principles ſufficient for this purpoſe, but the unregenerate are really and truly unable, (as deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of a principle of holineſs) to perform acts of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedience.</p>
               <p>The profligate is as really able to reform his life as Adam was to maintain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s integrity, or as a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſon is to comply with any of the precepts of the goſpel. Adam had a power to obey the law of his creation. He had natural faculties, and conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed principles of righteouſneſs The regenerate have alſo a power for acts of ſpiritual obedience communicated to them by the holy Spirit. And mankind in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral have it in their power to abſtain from acts of open wickedneſs and practiſe external duties. There may be a power ſufficient for an action, and yet the action may never be done. There may be a natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and habitual principle, and yet they may never be excited, or put forth to action. The proper uſe of moral ſuaſion is to work upon ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="77" facs="unknown:012416_0081_0F89751932025670"/>
ſprings of action which are within us, to put them in motion, or wake them up to their proper exerciſes.</p>
               <p>But the unregenerate have not a next power or principle of holy exerciſes. Mere moral ſuaſion is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to prevail with them to turn to God with all their hearts, until a new heart is created in them. They have not the ſame kind of power herefor that Adam had to obey the law of his creation. They have not the ſame kind of power that the regenerate have to turn to God. They have not the ſame kind of power that men have to do common actions. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam had ſuch a power as implied an habitual princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of righteouſneſs, ſo have the regenerate. But this is wanting in the unregenerate.</p>
               <p>When men have natural faculties and habitual principles, implying an immediate capacity of being wrought upon merely by the propoſal of motives, unwillingneſs to act is very improperly called inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; or however it is an inability of a very different kind from that which conſiſts in the want of <hi>habitual principles.</hi> The proſligate is unwilling to reform, but by inſtructions and exhortations he may be perſuaded to it without having any new principle infuſed into him. The unregenerate are not only unwilling to perform acts of holy obedience, but are deſtitute of a ſecondary power herefor, which no inſtructions or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations can furniſh them with, without the ſpecial and immediate influence of the divine Spirit. <note n="*" place="bottom">

But he is under an Ethico-phyſical ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to diſcern ſpiritual things in a ſpiritual manner, and turn to God with all his heart, while he is unregenerate. Many others of late, beſides Mr. H. have confounded theſe two latter kinds of inability together under the name of moral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, contrary to the received language of the ſcriptures and ſound divines; though the diſtinction between them be as important and neceſſary, as the diſtinction between the want of power and the want of will; which has introduced vaſt confuſion, perplexity, inconſiſtency, and impertinence into their diſcourſes. Hence we have ſeen ſome (who appear to diſcourſe very ſenſibly upon other points) that when they come to ſpeak of the inability of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And common ſenſe declares that unwillingneſs is no excuſe. But indeed this does not touch the core of the matter. If mankind are born with a principle or habit fitting and diſpoſing them, upon the propoſal of motives and occaſions, for acts of holy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence no pelagian will plead unwillingneſs as any excuſe of diſobedience. But if this habit be wantnig, and cannot be created by any act of our will, then the inability of man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a want of <hi>power</hi> to will, prior to <hi>any volitions whatever.</hi>

But our author owns that an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reformation is conſiſtent with a ſtate of unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy; and conſequently a power to reform is conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with ſuch a ſtate. What obſtructs the reformation of the profligate may be removed without regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is not unregeneracy, but ſomething entirely diverſe and ſeperable from it. The inability then is not in both caſes of the ſame kind.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the profligate ſinner were under the ſame kind of inability to reform, that the unregenerate ſinner is under to repent and turn to God with all his heart, then the ſame kind of operation of divine grace which is neceſſary to the converſion of the unregenerate would alſo be neceſſary to the reformation of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate: And the ſame kind of means which are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to reform the profligate, would be ſufficient to convert the unregenerate. There can be no need of a different kind of divine influence to remove an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction or inability of the ſame kind. Now it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that the unwillingneſs of the profligate to reform his life may be removed by moral ſuaſion alone, without communicating to him a new ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural principle.

               <p>That which ſeems to have deceived our author and others in their reaſonings, is the ambiguity of the word will; which ſignifies both the power and the act of willing; and confounding ſimple moral inability, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in unwillingneſs, with that inability which is termed by divines <hi>ethico phyſical,</hi> conſiſting in the want of a principle or next power to will.</p>
               <p>The inability of the profligate to reform, ſo far as it conſiſts in unwillingneſs, is ſimple moral inability; and is not properly and upon the whole any impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency at all, ſo long as the mind is furniſhed with a principle or next power to will and do whatever is implied in his reformation, and only needs to have this power excited and drawn forth into acts by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and motives.</p>
               <p>But the inability of the unregenerate to repent and turn to God, lies in the want of a ſecondary power to will, which he is truly and properly unable to produce or create in his own ſoul, nor can it be produced by motives alone, becauſe it does not conſiſt in, or flow
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:012416_0085_0F89751C32993388"/>
from any act of his will, but muſt be communicated and infuſed by the immediate agency of the holy Spirit creating in him a new heart. If a ſinner's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability for holy acts conſiſted in his unwillingneſs for them, or the oppoſition of his will to them, then it would not conſiſt in his unregeneracy. For unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy does not lie in any actings of the will, or in the privation of any acts, but in the privation of a principle of holineſs. To ſay that the <hi>only reaſon</hi> why a ſinner does not embrace the goſpel is becauſe his heart op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it, is the ſame as to ſay that his rejecting the goſpel is the only reaſon why he rejects it, which is falſe and abſurd. <hi>It is falſe,</hi> for it implies that there is no want of a holy principle. If a power to will were wanting, this defect would be a bar in the way of a ſinner's converſion, of much greater moment than mere unwillingneſs, which if that were all might be removed by moral ſuaſion. If unwillingneſs, or oppoſite actings of will are the <hi>only reaſon</hi> why a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner does not embrace the goſpel, unregeneracy or the want of a principle of holineſs is <hi>no reaſon</hi>; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently regeneration (as diſtinguiſhed from conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) removes <hi>no cauſe</hi> of impenitency. Again, the impleaded principle is palpably <hi>abſurd.</hi> Oppoſition of heart or will to the goſpel is refuſing to embrace it, or rejecting it. But who can help <hi>feeling</hi> the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of ſaying that,
<q>the only reaſon why men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to embrace the goſpel, is becauſe they refuſe to embrace it?</q>
That is, this <hi>act of will</hi> either has no cauſe or reaſon of it's exiſtence, or elſe it is the cauſe or reaſon of itſelf. And this ſhews the futility and impropriety of ſuch kind of aſſertions which ſome have been ſo fond of, "The unregenerate can repent and turn to God if they will—There is nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders but their own obſtinate unwillingneſs, or want of will." Willing to repent in the ſenſe here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:012416_0086_0F89751CF23CE2B8"/>
is a holy change of will: In one word, it is true repentance. The matter then comes to this, He that does repent, can repent! The important uſe of this ſage maxim to reconcile the goſpel with common ſenſe ſeems to be a modern diſcovery,
<q>He that is wiſer for this may rejoice in it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I agree with our author that the inability of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate is a ſinful defect, nor have I the remoteſt view or deſire to weaken the foundation of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truth, but rather to confirm it. But I muſt ſay, that Mr. H. with ſundry others, how well ſoever they may have deſerved of the chriſtian church on other accounts, have on this point (as I am verily perſuaded) darkned counſel by words without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. To point out the impropriety of theſe new-fangled phraſes and notions, with which ſome are ſo enamoured, with the fallacious reaſonings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions iſſuing from them, is an important ſervice to the cauſe of truth to which chriſtians ſeem to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly called at this day. If any man ſpeak let him ſpeak as the oracles of God.</p>
               <p>The next point propoſed to conſideration, is now to be attended to, and may be ſtated in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner.</p>
               <p>Allowing that men have a power or principle, whereby they are capable of reforming their lives, and attending the means of grace, as has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and pleaded for; yet human nature is totally depraved. Are not natural principles then utterly ſinful? And muſt not all exerciſes of ſuch principles be utterly ſinful?</p>
               <p>For the reſolution of this point let it be obſerved, that we allow the depravity of human nature, yea the total depravity, as taught in ſcripture, and in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed churches, in oppoſition to the pelagian and ſemipelagian doctrine. We allow that all the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:012416_0087_0F89751DB021AF90"/>
of human nature in it's unrenewed ſtate are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by ſin, that it is deſtitute of a principle of true holineſs, and in a ſtate of ſpriritual death. But we muſt carefully diſtinguiſh between natural principles conſidered ſimply in themſelves, and the corruption of them. The corruption of human nature conſiſts eſſentially and radically in a defect or privation of a principle of true holineſs, not in the infuſion of any principles poſitively and in their own nature evil. Natural principles when ſubſiſting and operating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, unſubordinate to a principle of holineſs, are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, becauſe deſtitute of a due perfection which they ought to have. Hence they are ſometimes called poſitive principles of ſin; and indeed proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, if we underſtand ſin in the concrete ſenſe: For every act of the ſoul muſt flow from ſome poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive principle, though ſinfulneſs in the abſtract flows only from a privative cauſe, as is commonly noted by divines. Thus ſelfiſhneſs is a corrupt principle, and a poſitive principle of ſelfiſh actions; yet there is nothing properly poſitive in ſelfiſhneſs but the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural uſeful and innocent principle of lelf-love. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature with it's principles may be conſidered ſimply in itſelf, ſo it is the work of God; and therefore not evil but good. It may alſo be conſidered as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted by the ſin of man of it's primitive moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and thereby incapacitated to anſwer the great end of it's creation: So it is depraved and evil. But though depraved nature implies ſomething poſitive, yet the depravity of nature conſiſts properly not in any thing poſitive, but in a meer privation of it's due moral perfection.</p>
               <p>That natural principles ſo far as they denote any thing properly poſitive are not evil, may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated various ways. God is the proper efficient cauſe of our nature, and of every thing poſitive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:012416_0088_0F89751E715D3118"/>
to it: But he is not the efficient cauſe of evil, as all chriſtians not only allow but contend. Moreover, there is a real poſitive concurring influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of almighty God with our natural principles in all their operations; but ſurely it is inconſiſtent with the divine purity to excite and actuate any principle that is in itſelf eſſentially evil, ſuppoſing it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (as it is not) that ſuch a principle did really exiſt. The holy Spirit works upon the natural principles of the unregenerate altogether in awakening and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them, and exciting them to attend upon the means of grace; which would be directly inſtigating them to ſin, as ſin, if theſe principles and their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were in themſelves ſimply evil. And finally if natural principles were poſitively evil, the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of divine grace would tend to deſtroy them; but it is only the diſorder introduced by ſin that is removed in ſanctification.</p>
               <p>Though moral depravity has ſpread over every part of human nature that is capable of it, yet not every thing in human nature is moral depravity. The diſtinction between <hi>natural principles</hi> and <hi>the corruption</hi> of them is of great importance; and it would be much better to endeavour to ſet this in the plaineſt light poſſible, than to heap up cloudy looſe expreſſions of total depravity, enmity, ſelfiſhneſs, and the like, as the manner of ſome has been, and then to draw ſuch ſtrange concluſions as that all acts flowing from mere natural principles muſt of neceſſity be acts of enmity againſt God, i. e. ſins of commiſſion, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively repugnant to the divine command. But i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> we will conceive aright of this matter we may main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that though natural principles, ſeperate from and unſubordinate to a principle of holineſs are depraved, yet in themſelves they are good lawful and uſeful. And though the want of a principle of holineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:012416_0089_0F89752018953E50"/>
every act flowing from mere natural principles of that perfection which is neceſſary to conſtitute it a holy action, which <hi>defect</hi> is contrary to the divine law, yet the want of a holy principle does not always and neceſſarily cauſe an act flowing from mere natural principles to be <hi>in itſelf</hi> contrary to the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: And conſequently the ſin adhering to it, <hi>does not conſiſt in what is done,</hi> but rather <hi>in the defect of ſome circumſtance</hi> which ought to have attended it: That is, it lies in omiſſion rather than commiſſion. Though the ſinful omiſſion or defect whereby the act is corrupted flows from the depravity of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet the <hi>act itſelf</hi> does not <hi>in any ſenſe,</hi> nor is any exerciſe or expreſſion thereof.</p>
               <p>But this matter muſt be further opened and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, which I ſhall endeavour to do as plainly as I can, by examining that famous queſtion, which has been ſo long and ſo much debated in the church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the virtuous actions (as they are called) of the unregenerate. Whether, and in what ſenſe they are ſin? Whether and in what reſpect they are good? Here obſerve, that the point to be enquired into is not, whether any actions of the unregenerate are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, either in a legal or evangelical acceptation? It is plain they are not. Nor whether they are not, taken in all their circumſtances ſinful, and in this view may be termed ſins? This is granted. Nor whether they are meritorious of grace either in a way of condignity or congruity? This we do not pretend. And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we do not ſuppoſe that there are any promiſes of ſalvation, or regenerating grace to the doings of the unregenerate; but God acts with ſovereign liberty in the exerciſes of his mercy. The queſtion then is, <hi>Are the beſt actions of the unregenerate properly denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated good in any reſpect, and is there any moral goodneſs in them?</hi> By moral goodneſs is here meant
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:012416_0090_0F897520B9A10188"/>
any kind or degree of conformity to the law <hi>in any reſpect</hi>; though there ſhould not be that intireneſs of conformity <hi>in all neceſſary reſpects</hi> which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in true holineſs.</p>
               <p>The full examination of this queſtion would carry us into the bowels of our main controverſy, which is reſerved for the ſubject of the two following ſections. But without anticipating I would obſerve—</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, The beſt actions of the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate are uſeful, both to themſelves and to mankind in general. They are often ſubſervient, by the bleſſing of God, to their temporal and eternal good—and the neglect of them, with a contrary behaviour, is ſinful, of pernicious tendency, and oftentimes of fatal conſequence.</p>
               <p>And as the good works of believers which are ſeen of men are to the glory of God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally good works of the unregenerate, when done in profeſſed obedience to him. The inward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of holineſs is viſible only to the ſearcher of hearts. The want of it therefore cannot hide the light ſhining from a good converſation, in the ſight of mankind, by beholding of which they may be induced to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify God. Therefore,</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is a goodneſs in outward acts of religious obedience, ſeperate from the goodneſs of the inward principle of action, or the immanent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of love to God and man. Actions externally good are by the acknowledgment of all, the proper exerciſes, and fit expreſſions of a good heart. Now whatever act is a proper expreſſion of a good heart, is in itſelf good abſtract from the goodneſs of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per therein exerciſed and expreſſed; otherwiſe there would be no correſpondence or anſwerableneſs of the expreſſion with the thing expreſſed. Beneficent act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion is a proper way of expreſſing love; becauſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:012416_0091_0F89752170385858"/>
is in itſelf good and amiable, and therefore love prompts and diſpoſes men to ſuch a behaviour. A good man inclines to and takes complacency in a good behaviour. His goodneſs cauſes him to do ſo. But if there were no goodneſs in the outward act of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, except what conſiſted in the inward exerciſe of love; then it would be perfectly indifferent whether love operated in this way, or in a conduct directly the reverſe. If good actions are not in themſelves better than bad ones, apart from the conſideration of their principle; why ſhould a good principle diſpoſe a man to the one rather than the other? But if there be ſuch a difference in the nature of human actions, that ſome are properly denominated good, and others evil in reſpect of their ſubſtance; which goodneſs or evil does not lie in their cauſes and principles; then there is a goodneſs in the beſt actions of the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, however deſtitute they are of a principle of holineſs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If the object of choice be good, as view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and choſen by the mind; then the act of the will in chuſing it is in itſelf good. The act of our will is indeed diſtinct from thoſe effects which flow from it by the laws of nature; ſuch as the motion of our own or other bodies, in conſequence of the exertion of our ſouls. And it is poſſible for a man by accident to do that which may prove of advantage to himſelf and others, when he acts with the moſt miſchievous intention. In this caſe we ſay the action as choſen and done by the agent is bad, though good has come of it contrary to his will. But when a good effect naturally flowing from the act of a man's will is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen and choſen as ſuch; then the act of chuſing is in itſelf good, as well as the object choſen, or the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect flowing from it. Nor is the matter at all effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a rational, and moral conſideration, whether the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:012416_0092_0F897522321E7990"/>
perſon were the immediate efficient cauſe of the good effect, or only an occaſional one. Actions material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good are no doubt (if we ſpeak properly) the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our ſouls, and not any external effects as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached from the agency of the will. The ſubſtance or matter of an act of choice is to be denominated good or evil, according to the nature of it's object, as viewed and choſen by the mind. However de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective the prime principles or ultimate ends of action may be, the choice of an action materially good is an act of choice materially good. And if there be any goodneſs in ſome external actions more than in others, which ought to incline a good man to take delight in them; then there is a goodneſs in the choice of ſuch kind of actions: There is a goodneſs in the effective act of the will, ſeperate from the goodneſs of the immanent act, or of the habit or principle from which the immanent act flows. If there be no goodneſs in effective acts of the will, except what conſiſts in the goodneſs of the principles they flow from; then a principle of holineſs would no more fit diſpoſe and prompt the ſoul to ſuch kind of acts than to the very reverſe. A ſanctified heart which has a right judgment and taſte approves of and inclines to ſuch kind of acts: They are the proper exerciſes of a good principle; which is a clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their goodneſs in themſelves. Our choice of objects is not that which makes them good, but their goodneſs is the ground and reaſon of our chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, as it is this which makes them fit objects of choice. As the <hi>effects</hi> flowing from an act of will are what they are in themſelves whether good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, whatever the deſign of the agent might be, ſo the <hi>effective acts</hi> themſelves are what they are in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their ſubſtance, from whatever principles they might flow. In this ſenſe it <hi>is a true</hi> principle,
<q>
                     <pb n="89" facs="unknown:012416_0093_0F897522F081EC48"/>that the goodneſs or evil of actions lies in their nature and not in their cauſes.</q>

               </p>
               <p>Now when the unregenerate perform actions ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially good, the external effect, and the internal act of the mind chuſing the action, and exerting effective power for the performance of it, are the ſame in their own nature, as if they acted from a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rinciple of true holineſs. And ſince ſuch kind of actions are good in themſelves, abſtract from the goodneſs of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, the want of a holy principle does not deprive them of <hi>this kind of goodneſs</hi> whatever it may be.</p>
               <p>But here it will naturally be enquired, what kind of goodneſs this is which belongs to external actions or effective acts as conſidered in themſelves, abſtract from their principles? I anſwer firſt, <hi>the uſefulneſs or good tendency of ſuch actions:</hi> Their connection with and conducivene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> to ſuch ends as are ultimately good. Philoſophers have diſtributed good into three kinds, <hi>bonum honeſtum, jucundum, &amp; utile.</hi> Moral good, happineſs, and that which is profitable, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it's inſtrumental ſubſerviency to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of virtue or happineſs. The goodneſs of the end derives a goodneſs to the means conducing to it. In this ſenſe at leaſt the beſt actions of the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate cannot be denied to be good, by any that allow them to be any ways conducive to their benefit. I add ſecondly, If ſuch actions are required in and by any divine command, if effective as well as immanent acts of the will are jointly and ſeverally ſubject to the law, then it muſt be allowed that there is a moral goodneſs, in the ſenſe before explained, in ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that is, there is an agreement with the rule of duty, in the ſubſtance of the action, though ſuch an imperfect kind of conformity as cannot be denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated true holineſs. And yet it is ſuch a kind of
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:012416_0094_0F897523B2245D60"/>
moral goodneſs, that the want of it is <hi>in itſelf</hi> really and eſſentially ſin. This ſuppoſition is denied and exploded by Mr. H. and that (as his manner is) with high contempt of all that hold to it, as
<q>perſons who do not exerciſe their reaſon, but confuſe and bewilder themſelves with a ſet of words without ideas.</q>
We will in due time try the weight of his arguments; and ſo leave it to the reader, when he ſhall ſee the iſſue of the controverſy in hand, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve this point for himſelf; which he will then, I hope, be able to do without any trouble.</p>
               <p>All that I ſhall add at preſent is a brief enquiry concerning the <hi>ends of unregenerate ſinners in their be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> actions.</hi> Here, as ſome ſuppoſe, is the hardeſt k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of all. For if it ſhould be granted that natural prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of action are in themſelves good, or however not unlawful; and that ſuch actions may flow from them as are materially good, that is uſeful, and anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the divine precept as to their ſubſtance, as has been declared; yet ſurely it muſt not be ſaid that men are allowed, and much leſs required by God to do any action, however good in itſelf, for a bad end. Now it is ſuppoſed that the unregenerate always act for a wrong end; which ſince it is forbidden, their acting at all, while unregenerate ſeems to be forbidden by neceſſary conſequence. Though the <hi>Tò actum</hi> ſhould be allowed to be good in ſome reſpects, yet the <hi>Tò agere</hi> ſeems in this caſe to be evil and unlawful.</p>
               <p>But it will require no very ſtrong finger to unty this knot, if what has been already laid down be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, and neceſſary diſtinctions attended to.</p>
               <p>The end of an action is that for the ſake of which the action is done. And this may be ſaid to be ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular and wrong in two different reſpects. <hi>First,</hi> when what is ſought for is abſolutely forbidden. In this caſe we are not allowed to act at all in order to ſuch
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:012416_0095_0F8975247012DAB0"/>
an end, even though the means in themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered may be lawful. Thus it was abominable in Jezebel to proclaim a faſt, that under the cloke of zeal for reformation ſhe might murder Naboth. It was vile treachery in Judas to kiſs his Lord in order to betray him. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The end of an action is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular and wrong when it is defective, though in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not abſolutely forbidden. Here we muſt carefully diſtinguiſh between the end in itſelf, and the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or irregularity of it. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hen what a man ſeeks for is good, his end is good in itſelf. But if he purſues this end <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n oppoſition to a greater good, to which it ought to be ſubordinate, his end is wrong; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an object in itſelf forbidden is ſought, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a greater good is neglected. To do a forbidden action, or aim at a forbidden end is always unlawful. So it is to neglect a commanded action, or not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our actions to the glory of God, which ought to be our governing end: But it is not unlawful in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to do an action materially good for an inferior end, if the purſuit of ſuch an end be not forbidden end.</p>
               <p>When men act in order to obtain a forbidden end, we grant that their acting at all in this caſe is directly repugnant to the command of God. The choice of ſuch an end is in itſelf poſitively oppoſite to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will: It is a ſin of commiſſion: It is an act materially evil; and is in no caſe commanded allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or encouraged by God. Thus if a man ſhould utter the words of a prayer, with a malicious intent to mock God, and profane his ordinances; ſuch an act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion would be in itſelf horribly wicked. To act at all with ſuch a deſign would be an exerciſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and enmity againſt God.</p>
               <p>But the unregenerate do not always act for ſuch ends as are in themſelves forbidden, and unlawful, though the ends of their actions are always eſſentially
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:012416_0096_0F8975252FA9ACE8"/>
defective. For a man to ſtrive to eſcape miſery is to act for a reaſonable and lawful end; unleſs it be a duty to deſire miſery, or at leaſt to be unconcerned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. It a man has no other aim or deſire than to ſecure his own happineſs, his end is defective and irregular. But the fault does not lie in his ſeeking a forbidden object, but in neglecting and refuſing to aim at the glory o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When we ſeek our own happineſs unſubordinate to the glory of God, our end is indeed irregular and incon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and poſitive rejection of God and his honor, when propoſed as the ultimate end of our action is a ſin of commiſſion, and may be termed an exerciſe of enmity againſt him. But a diſregard to God, and forſaking him are in their own nature intirely diſtinct from a regard to our own happineſs, and an endeavour to ſecure and promote it.</p>
               <p>There is evidently, in the judgment of common ſenſe, a broad difference, between acting for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful end, and acting for an end lawful in itſelf, though unſubordinate to a higher one. If a man gives money to his poor neighbour to hire him to murder his enemy, he is himſelf a murderer. If he does it in hopes of a temporal reward, it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the action or end is in itſelf unlawful, though both are ſinfully defective if he aims at nothing higher. In the former caſe the action is an exerciſe of enmity; in the latter it is an exerciſe of mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

refraining to act for an unlawful end, we refrain from ſin; but no ſin is avoided by forbearing to act for a ſubordinate lawful end. If it were poſſible for a man to diveſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is as I conceive through inattention to the diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inctions above propoſed, between natural principles and the corruption of them, between forbidden and defective ends, that Mr. H. has been deceived in his reaſonings and concluſions. He ſuppoſes that all exerciſes of the unregenerate are acts of enmity againſt God, becauſe they are carnally minded, and the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind is enmity againſt God. And before acts of enmity are forever unlawful. The unavoidable conſequence of which is that it is utterly unlawful for men to act at all from natural principles. But this is mere fallacy. Actions may flow from princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that are corrupt, and yet not flow from their corruption, ſo not be any <hi>exerciſe</hi> or <hi>expreſſion</hi> of moral corruption. A man acting merely from ſelf-love may do actions which are not ſelfiſh but intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. An action is not ſelfiſh, or an exerciſe of ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, unleſs a diſregard of the good of others, as well as ſelf love, has an influence into it as <hi>a formal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> and is therein expreſſed; which is never the caſe unleſs ſelf-intereſt is ſuppoſed to interfere with the intereſt of others. An action is not an exerciſe of moral depravity, unleſs moral depravity be the cauſe of a man's doing it; ſo that his conduct would have been the reverſe if he had not been morally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved. An action is not an exerciſe of enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, unleſs enmity to God be the cauſe and formal principle of it; ſo that it would not have
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:012416_0098_0F897527CCD8C5C8"/>
been done unleſs the agent had hated God. Now it is plain there are many actions flowing from natural principles, and directed to interior ends, which being unſubordinate to a holy principle and end, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore privatively corrupt; which actions, though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of that conformity to the divine law in reſpect of principle and end which is implied in true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, do not take their form from the corruption of their principle or end, but from that in or belonging thereto, which is lawful and good: And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whatever ſinfulneſs adheres to ſuch action, lies in the <hi>omiſſion</hi> of ſome requiſite qualification, and not in any <hi>actual</hi> and <hi>poſitive repugnancy</hi> of the <hi>act itſelf</hi> to the divine law. This omiſſion indeed may be ſaid, in ſome ſenſe, to flow from the corruption of human nature; but the act itſelf does not, nor is any exerciſe or expreſſion of it. What I mean may be better underſtood perhaps when illuſtrated by a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar ſimilitude. A young child who has not wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to judge what is good for himſelf, may to gratify his appetite eat what is unwholeſome; and he may to gratify his appetite eat what is wholeſome as well as pleaſant. In both caſes he acts without wiſdom, following his appetite. But when he eats what is unwholeſome, his want of wiſdom is, though not a phyſical, yet a proper logical cauſe of his action; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe notwithſtanding his appetite if he had been wiſe he would not have done it. And therefore his fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs in conjunction with his natural appetite is the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al principle of his action; which action <hi>takes it's form from,</hi> and is an <hi>effect</hi> or <hi>expreſſion</hi> of folly as well as natural appetite. His natural appetite is the proper poſitive principle of the <hi>action</hi>; his want of wiſdom is the proper privative cauſe of the <hi>fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of it. But when a child to gratify his appetite eats what is both pleaſant and wholeſome, though he
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:012416_0099_0F89752832097A90"/>
acts without wiſdom, yet want of wiſdom is not the formal principle of his action; it is not a cauſe or reaſon in any ſenſe of his doing what he does. His action is no exerciſe or expreſſion of folly, but merely of natural appetite. Though he acts from mere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, his action is agreable to the rules of wiſdom. If he knew what was good for himſelf he would do the very ſame. In this caſe neither wiſdom nor folly, but natural appetite is the <hi>logical, phyſical, formal</hi> principle of his action.</p>
               <p>Thus when a man in order to promote his ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed intereſt acts in oppoſition to the rules of piety and humanity, the want of a due regard to God and his neighbour is in conjunction with ſelf-love, the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical cauſe and formal principle of his conduct; which therefore is an exerciſe and expreſſion of moral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity, as well as natural ſelf-love. But when a ſinner does any action materially good from mere ſelf-love, in hopes that it will be to his advantage; in this caſe the action does not flow, or take it's form, from the corruption of human nature. It does not flow from enmity againſt God and his neighbour, nor from want of love, nor from want of an habitual principle diſpoſing to exerciſes of love; but from that natural lawful and uſeful principle, implanted within us by God, whereby we incline to our own happineſs. The end here aimed at is not ſuppoſed to be inconſiſtent with the good of the univerſe: His deſign is not to hurt others, but to advantage himſelf. Such an action can with no propriety be called an exerciſe of enmity to God or man; becauſe however averſe the heart of the ſinner may be from God and man at the time of acting; yet it is not enmity, but mere ſelf-love that diſpoſes and determines him to ſuch a conduct. A change of heart would no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe change the actings of his will in this caſe, than
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:012416_0100_0F8973E13480C7D8"/>
by joining the influence of a new governing princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with thoſe natural principles which operated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The act itſelf is not enmity or hot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How much enmity ſoever there may be in the heart, it has no more poſitive and prompt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng influence into this action, than it has in the action of a ſucking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant that reaches earneſtly for the breaſt. And the action of ſuch an infant might as truly and properly be called an exerciſe of enmity to being in general, as the action of a ſinner in the caſe ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>Man in his depraved ſtate is an enemy to God. He is fallen under the dominion of ſin. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and exerciſes of his heart <hi>are not ſubject to the law of God, nor indeed can be,</hi> ſo long as he is <hi>in</hi> and <hi>after the fleſh,</hi> as the apoſtle ſpeaks; that is, ſo long as he is unregenerate. His heart is alienated from God and his holy law: All his actions are inconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the rule of duty. This alienation of heart from God, with that actual diſobedience which flows from it, being in itſelf and in it's natural tendency diſhonorary to God, is termed <hi>conſtructive</hi> enmity to God, which is implied in all ſin; which yet is to be diſtinguiſhed from that <hi>actual</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> riſing of the heart againſt the divine majeſty which is uſually term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>hatred of God. This</hi> is a ſin of commiſſion, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying not only ſome knowledge of God, but an actual exerciſe of the mind in thinking on his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter with averſion. <hi>That</hi> is implied in every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of duty; it is chargeable on ſinners who know not God and have him not in their thoughts: It does not neceſſarily imply any actual exerciſe of the ſoul at all. Enmity moſt properly ſignifies an affection or act of the ſoul contrary to love. <hi>To be

carnally minded, ſays the apoſtle, is enmity againſt God,</hi> Rom. 8.7. That which is here termed enmity, is not the carnal heart, or depraved nature, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of corrupt exerciſes; (as many have ſuppoſed, being deceived perhaps by the ambiguous word <hi>mind</hi>) but it is <hi>Phroneema Sarkos,</hi> which expreſſes the actual exerciſe of the mind and heart <hi>as depraved,</hi> as is commonly remarked by critics.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Poli Synopſ. Piſcator, Pareus, &amp;c in loc. Leigh's critica ſacra. Owen on ſpiritual Mindedneſs, chap. 1.</note> It ſignifies the ſame with the <hi>luſting of the fleſh,</hi> which the apoſtle elſewhere ſpeaks of. But though the exerciſes and actings of natural principles <hi>as corrupted by ſin,</hi> are inconformable to the law of God, and ſo are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructively at leaſt enmity againſt God, ſince they are at beſt deſtitute of that rectitude and holineſs of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and end which the law requires; yet in actions materially good the ſinfulneſs adhering does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt <hi>in the exerciſe</hi> but <hi>in the privation of right prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and ends in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ting:</hi> It is the omiſſion of duty, not the perpetration of a forbidden act. Take this exerciſe of the natural principle intirely away, and the ſinfulneſs of the perſon remains undiminiſhed. The law of ſin, as the apoſtle terms it, does not in this caſe operate by a formal influence into the ſubſtance of the action, but by depriving it of thoſe qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are neceſſary to conſtitute it ſpiritually good.</p>
               <p>Some have ſeemed to think that natural affections (ſelf-love for inſtance) when unſubordinate to general benevolence, are <hi>in themſelves</hi> acts of oppoſition, or enmity to being in general. For ſuch an affection (it is ſaid) exalts it's private object above the other great and infinite object; it puts down being in general which is infinitely ſuperior into an inferior place. <note n="†" place="bottom">Edwards on the Nature of true Virtue, pag. 131,</note>
                  <pb n="98" facs="unknown:012416_0102_0F8973E2B2F253F0"/>
But this is argued rather like a rhetorician than a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher. It is not ſelf-love that puts down being in general, but it is the privation of general benevolence. It is not any private affection in itſelf, but it's unſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinateneſs to the love of God and our fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that is vicious. This unſubordinateneſs does not conſiſt in the nature or ſtrength of the affection, but is only the privation of a ſuperior principle; that is, it is only the want of a ſupreme regard to God. It does not appear that ſelf-love is ſtronger in ſelfiſh perſons than in others; at leaſt there is no need of ſuppoſing that it is in order to account for their conduct. The want of good will to others will ſet up ſelf intereſt; or leave it to be the higheſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the affections. And indeed this is all in a ſelfiſh temper or affection that is in itſelf vicious. No action is the worſe for being intereſted, or the better for being diſintereſted. Diſintereſted miſchievouſneſs imports the utmoſt wickedneſs. And it was no ways derogatory to the perfection of our Savior's ſubmiſſion to the will of God in his ſufferings, that he endured the croſs for the joy that was ſet before him.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, though the beſt actions of the unregenerate are not ſpiritually good, becauſe eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially defective; yet they may be materially good; they may flow from principles, and be directed to ends good in themſelves, though of an inferior kind. Nor is this anything more than has been aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the moſt eminent lights of the chriſtian church ancient and modern, as might eaſily be ſhewn. And therefore I cannot but wonder how Mr. H. ſhould aſſert confidently in the face of the public, that

               <p>I have been the larger in diſcuſſing the points treated of in this Section, becauſe it appears to me, that our author with ſome others has fallen into much miſtake, by confounding together things eſſentially different in their natures and cauſes; and has greatly darkned the truth, and thrown ſtumbling blocks in the way of mens attending the means of converſion. If ſome particulars are not ſufficiently cleared, the

               <p>TO open our way more plainly to the enſuing arguments, I would premiſe one diſtinction, which the reader will find neceſſary to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to and carried in mind, that he may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter apprehend the force and pertinency of what is to be offered, and remove ſuch objections as may occur: And that is the diſtinction between the <hi>moral law ſimply conſidered,</hi> and the <hi>divine precepts as contained in ſcripture, and enjoined on men by ſupernatural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The natural and ſupernatural law (if we may thus diſtinguiſh them) do agree in the general notion, or formal eſſence of law; that is a rule and bond of duty with annexed ſanctions. They agree alſo in their author, viz. God the ſupreme lawgiver. They alſo coincide in their requirements, ſo as mutually to ſtrengthen each other. For the law of nature binds us to obey all ſupernatural diſcoveries of the divine will, as ſoon as they are made known to us; it being an eternal principle of the law of nature that all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural revelations of the will of God (if any ſuch there be) ought to be obeyed. And the ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral law of revelation eſtabliſhes the law of nature, not only as it always ſuppoſes it's unchangeable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:012416_0105_0F8973E4F24654B0"/>
but requires the ſame moral duties to which we are by the law of nature neceſſarily bound, and lays us under ſome additional obligations of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The difference then here to be noted conſiſts eſpecially in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The moral law ſtrictly and ſimply conſidered flows neceſſarily from the nature of God and man, and the relation ſubſiſting between them; but the commands of God enjoined by ſupernatural reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, flow freely from his ſovereign will. Though the creation of moral agents be a free ſovereign act of the divine will, yet when once they are created their obligation to love and obey God reſults neceſſarily from the perfections and bounty of the creator, and the dependence of the creature on him for being and happineſs. The moral law is therefore of neceſſary and unchangeable obligation. But ſuch commands as are given by ſupernatural revelation are, as ſuch, formally acts of divine ſovereignty. The giving any ſuch commands to mankind, was a free ſovereign act of God's will. And it was the ſame ſovereign will of God, that, according to the counſels of infinite wiſdom, determined what precepts were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this ſupernatural law. Even th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe moral duties which are of eternal obligation, as well as thoſe duties which are called poſitive, and are in their own nature changeable, have a place in this ſupernatural law, only becauſe the ſovereign will and authority of the great legiſlator was pleaſed ſo to ordain; and not from any neceſſity in the nature of things. Though a duty of neceſſary obligation cannot be cancelled by any act of the divine will, and therefore we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily bound by the moral law; yet this infers no neceſſity that a ſupernatural revelation of God's will ſhould take in every duty of the moral law. That additional inforcement of obedience, which reſults
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:012416_0106_0F8973E5B2E870B0"/>
from a ſupernatural injunction, or poſitive act of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign authority, may be ſuperadded to all, or to ſome only of the duties of the moral law, as infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall ſee fit, and the ends for which ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation is given may require.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The moral law binds all moral agents; but the precepts of ſupernatural revelation bind thoſe only to whom the revelation is given. The precepts of revelation, as ſuch, belong only to fallen man. Yea ſuch of mankind as are invincibly ignorant of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation, are not bound to obey any of it's precepts <hi>as ſuch,</hi> though they may be bound to the ſame duties for ſubſtance, as contained in the moral law of nature. The ſcripture revelation being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for and given to fallen man alone, he only is ſubject to it's injunctions. Therefore,</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſupernatural law is founded on the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of grace through the mediator; but the law of nature has no neceſſary dependence on that diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. The duties required of men in the goſpel, are required for ſuch ends as could not have taken place, unleſs an act of grace had paſſed in favor of fallen man. This I have elſewhere proved, nor is it that I know of denied by any. And I may add, that the duties are many of them ſuch in their nature, that there could have been no poſſible place f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r them, unleſs in conſequence of the diſpenſation of grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The moral law ſimply conſidered requires obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, merely becauſe it is right and juſtly due. It exacts duties ſolely as a debt in which we are bound to God, and not as means of future advantage, or conditions of future rewards. The law gives no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward beyond the condign merit of a creature, which is perfectly nothing. Whatever benefit or reward may accrue to a creature in the way of obedience is owing to divine bounty, or a free promiſe, intirely
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:012416_0107_0F8973E6762E1248"/>
diſtinct from mere law; nor does the obligation of the law depend at all upon it. But the precepts of revelation require duties not only as debts of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but alſo as means in order to ſome further ends. Even thoſe duties which are required by the moral law, and ſo are of neceſſary obligation, have by the gracious appointment of God an inſtrumental ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency to the benefit of mankind, in this and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing world, and <hi>as ſuch</hi> are enjoined in the ſcriptures. By being taken into this ſupernatural law, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as means of our preſent and future happineſs, <hi>moral precepts</hi> have a new and diſtinct obligation and enforcement ſuperadded to them by the ſovereign will of God; and we have a new additional reaſon for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying them. And as to <hi>poſitive precepts,</hi> our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to the obſervance of them is wholly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into God's ſovereign will, and their ſubſervien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as means to ſome good end, diſtinct from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance therein required.</p>
               <p>Corollary, If duties be required in the ſcripture as means in order to ſome further end, by the ſovereign appointment of God, and it hence be concluded that ſuch a performance of them as is fitted to ſubſerve the end propoſed is contained in the requirement, and of conſequence is a commanded duty, how far ſhort ſoever it may fall of that perfection of obedience, which the law requires, this concluſion will not imply any relaxation of the obligation men are under to yield perfect obedience to the moral law, or extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the guilt of any failure in the leaſt degree. But of this afterwards.</p>
               <p>The attentive reader, I truſt, cannot but perceive from theſe obſervations, what will more plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in our progreſs, that is, the fitneſs and neceſſity of diſtinguiſhing between the moral law conſidered ſimply and ſtrictly in itſelf, as a rule and bond of
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:012416_0108_0F8973E732E35FD0"/>
right action to moral agents in general; and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine precepts given by ſupernatural revelation, to fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len man alone, upon the foundation of divine grace through the mediator, preſcribing duties as means of carrying into execution God's merciful purpoſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the children of men. This being premiſed, I ſhall now addreſs myſelf to the proof of my poſition, as above ſtated and explained.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The principles laid down in the preceeding ſection unavoidably lead us to conclude, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is required of men in a way of duty, which they are able to do previous to regeneration.</p>
               <p>It has been proved that the unregenerate who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy goſpel privileges are able, by the common aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of divine providence and grace, to reform their lives; to break off from courſes and acts of open ſin in oppoſition to the dictates of their own conſcience; to do actions materially good, and that ſeriouſly and conſcientiouſly according to their preſent light. They have both faculties and principles of action ſufficient for theſe things. If theſe things are enjoined upon them by, and contained in thoſe commands which God in his word has laid upon them, then it is their duty thus to reform their lives, and attend the means of grace, that is, ſomething is their duty which they have a power to do before regeneration. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence cannot be denied, unleſs we will deny that it is the duty of men to do whatever God has enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them.</p>
               <p>But thoſe things abovementioned, which men have a power to do while unregenerate, are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in and enjoined by thoſe commands which God in his word has laid upon them. For it has been ſhewn, and is abundantly evident from ſcripture, that the divine command requires not only right princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and ends of action, but alſo that the action itſelf
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:012416_0109_0F8973E7F09A6DB8"/>
be materially good. It regulates the performances as well as the affections; the external and imperate, as well as the immanent or elicit acts of the will. It enjoins the work itſelf, as well as thoſe circumſtances which are requiſite to conſtitute it a holy action. Mr. H. owns, that if there be any commands en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining a reformation of life and a good behaviour on the regenerate, then the ſame is enjoined on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate. For he ſays (p. 116.)
<q>No duty is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the regenerate which the unregenerate are not alſo commanded to do.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">This is not true. It is doubtleſs the duty of the regenerate to thank God for his diſtinguiſhing mercy in their election, rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, converſion, juſtification,  which cannot be the preſent duty of any unregenerate ſinner.</note> The unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate then are commanded to reform their lives; to hear, read, and meditate on the word of God; to examine their hearts and ways, and pray to God for pardoning mercy through Jeſus Chriſt. That is, they are commanded to do thoſe actions, which they have both faculties and principles ſufficient to enable them to do, as to the ſubſtance of the performance.</p>
               <p>If then the command requires <hi>ſuch actions,</hi> as well as ſuch circumſtances, principles, and manner of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as are implied in true holineſs; then the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the actions, though deſtitute of theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. are matter of duty, as being a part, though not the whole of the requirement. The command obliges to the whole of our duty, and to each diſtinct part of it. Such effective acts of the will as are required, are materially good; they have a goodneſs diſtinct from, and not dependent on all thoſe circumſtances and qualifications, which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to conſtitute them holy actions. And there is an obligation to the performance of them, <hi>beſides</hi> the obligation to perform them in a right manner in
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:012416_0110_0F8973E981A8B690"/>
every reſpect; and conſequently, there is an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the doing of that which men are able to do before regeneration.</p>
               <p>Actions may be taken in a twofold ſenſe, that is, as learned writers expreſs it, <hi>in ſenſu compoſito &amp; in ſenſu diviſo.</hi> The meaning is, they may be taken as comprehending, and inveſted with, all their moral circumſtances, qualifications, and adjuncts; or they may be taken ſimply and abſtractly in themſelves. In the latter ſenſe, no imperate act of the will can be denominated holy, though for ſubſtance conformable to the divine command; becauſe holineſs implies a conformity to the will of God in the circumſtances and qualifications, as well as the ſubſtance of the action; as has been before declared. Yet the actions of men are ſubject to the divine command in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as well as the former ſenſe; that is, the divine command enjoins the whole of what is contained in a holy action <hi>conjunctly,</hi> and it enjoins each ingredient of the action in this compound ſenſe, <hi>ſeverally.</hi> We are commanded to do actions materially good; we are alſo commanded to do them in ſuch a manner, and with ſuch a degree of ſtrength, as is perfectly conformable to the rule of our duty. But theſe things are ſo commanded, that however we may fail in ſome particulars, we are nevertheleſs bound to the obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of all and each of the other. Which may be thus proved. The guilt of any ſinful action is more or leſs multiplied or aggravated, as it is inconforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the divine law in more or fewer reſpects. If an action be anſwerable to the law in matter and manner, but ſomewhat deficient in the degree or ſtrength of the performance, it's ſinfulneſs is not ſo great, as if it were deficient in a greater degree: It would be yet more ſinful if not done for a holy end; and ſtill more if done for an unlawful or forbidden
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:012416_0111_0F8973EA95089138"/>
end; and finally it's guilt would be yet greater if the action itſelf, as well as it's end and circumſtances were unlawful.<note n="*" place="bottom">To omit the duty (external obſervances of religion) wholly, is worſe than to perform good in a wrong manner, and to be doing evil inſtead of both is yet much worſe. Goodwin's Works, Vol. 3 pag. 430.</note> It is not ſo bad for a man to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a covetous principle, by ſtriving to acquire riches in a lawful way that he may lay up treaſures on earth, (though this is utterly forbidden) as it would be to ſeek riches for the ſame purpoſe by ſtealing, robbery, and all manner of unrighteouſneſs. If there were not an obligation to the performance of the action in itſelf conſidered, as well as taken in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with all it's moral circumſtances; then the omiſſion of it would not in itſelf be ſin, nor could it add any thing to the guilt ariſing from the irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſuch circumſtances. For ſin is the tranſgreſſion of the law. We may be ſure that that is in itſelf a duty, the omiſſion of which is in itſelf ſin. Now though external duties <hi>in ſenſu diviſo</hi> be not holineſs, yet the omiſſion of them is in itſelf ſin: And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently external duties are required in and by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law. We are ſo bound by the law of God that an uninterrupted courſe of obedience is our duty; and each particular act taken by itſelf is alſo our duty; and in each act of obedience, perfection in degree, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtrength of our faculties is our duty; and ſo is every inferior degree that can be ſuppoſed: And finally whatever is contained in the eſſence of true holineſs collectively conſidered is our duty; and at the ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e time each particular ingredient, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or qualification, is alſo our duty, taken ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and by itſelf. And our guilt is multiplied and enhanced according as we have violated more of theſe obligations, and broken the divine command in more reſpects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="unknown:012416_0112_0F8973EAF21F38F8"/>To ſum up the argument. Since actions materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally good, conſidered in themſelves, are required of men as matter of duty; and, ſince unregenerate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have a power to do actions materially good; we conclude, that unregenerate ſinners have a power to do ſomething which is required as matter of duty: Which is the point we undertook to maintain.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. has moved an objection which contains the ſubſtance of the argument above propoſed, viz.
<q>That men by doing actions materially good, do ſome part of their duty, and ſo far obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</q>
Pag. 117. How he has ſucceeded in his attempt to anſwer it we will now conſider.</p>
               <p>He ſays,
<q>Nothing is either duty or ſin, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered without any reſpect to the heart, and as not implying any exerciſes of that.</q>
Pag. 117.</p>
               <p>Anſw. We may here note that this aſſertion,
<q>that nothing is either ſin or duty, if conſidered as not implying any exerciſes of the heart,</q>
is a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of the doctrines of original ſin and righteouſneſs, or of ſinfulneſs or righteouſneſs of nature diſtinct from, and previous to all acts of the mind. But this I ſuppoſe was owing to inadvertence, and therefore I ſhall take no further notice of it. There are alſo ſome ſins of omiſſion which do not imply any exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of heart. If the propoſition be limited to actions, we grant it; but it will eaſily appear that it makes nothing againſt us For,</p>
               <p>All actions whether taken in the compound, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſenſe are acts of the will The ſubſtance of an action, is the action itſelf abſtracted from it's circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.

                  </gap>or are the natural effects and conſequences of our voluntary exertions, though apprehended and choſen by us, the ſubſtance of
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:012416_0113_0F8973EBB192D390"/>
our action of properly ſpeaking. This is no other than the very act of our will, chuſing that thoſe effects ſhould take place, and putting forth our executive power for the production of them. Mr. H. ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſes that by the ſubſtance and matter of a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or action is meant ſomething diſtinct from all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of the heart, or acts of the will; ſomething of which a meer machine is capable; and then concludes, (as well he might) that there is no ſin or duty in all this, in itſelf conſidered; adding ſome contemptuous expreſſions of thoſe who are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded, as perſons, who bewilder themſelves wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h a ſet of words without meaning. We leave them to his correction if there be any ſo abſurd as to hold that to be the matter of an action which is no act of the will. But what is this to the purpoſe of anſwering our argument, which ſuppoſes the duties in queſtion to be voluntary actions? Methinks ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body elſe is got bewildered, beſides thoſe men of ſtraw which our author attacks with ſo much ſpirit.</p>
               <p>It is further pleaded, ſuppoſing the actions in queſtion be voluntary, yet it is rather more abſurd
<q>to ſpeak of a man's doing any part of his duty in his external conduct, when his conduct is conſidered as the fruit of wrong and ſinful exerciſes of heart.</q>
Pag. 118.</p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. We do not ſuppoſe that the <hi>fruit</hi> of any exerciſes of the heart, or acts of the will, whether right or wrong, is the matter of duty, unleſs <hi>that fruit</hi> be alſo an act of the will, Now there is no abſurdity in ſuppoſing, that an act of the will may in itſelf be good, and the matter of a commanded duty, though it be the fruit of a preceding act which was not ſo. Mr. Edwards beſure, did not think there was a groſs ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity in ſuppoſing that the goodneſs or evil of actions lay in their nature and not in their cauſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">Enquiry concerning the Will, part iv. ſect. 1.</note>
                  <pb n="110" facs="unknown:012416_0114_0F8973EC72F3F5E8"/>
Giving alms is a good action in itſelf, and the matter of duty; though, in the Phariſees it was the fruit of pride, which beſure was no good principle. If the object choſen be good, the act of chuſing is materially good, however it may be wrong in it's adjuncts and circumſtances. It is good <hi>in ſenſu diviſo.</hi> It is wrong <hi>in ſenſu compoſito.</hi> An act of choice in itſelf is either good or evil according to the nature of it's object. Since then we are divinely commanded to do actions materially good, we conclude that it is our duty to do them.</p>
               <p>It will be enquired, is it then our duty to do theſe things from wrong principles, and for unlawful ends?</p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. It is not our duty to be actuated by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil principles, or aim at unlawful ends, in any of our actions. This is utterly ſinful. But the doing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded action is in itſelf a duty, how much ſoever we may fail in the principle, end and manner of the performance. And our guilt will be double, if the action as well as it's principle and end be utterly wrong.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The principles and ends of mens actions may be ſaid to be wrong in two ſenſes. 1. When they are in themſelves abſolutely forbidden, as when a man acts from malice. To act at all with a miſchievous intent is unlawful. In this caſe the formal principle, and final cauſe of the action is in itſelf ſin. The action not only flows from a heart that is corrupt, but from the corruption itſelf. 2. The principles and ends of mens actions are ſaid to be wrong, when they are defective; though in themſelves good in their kind. Such are the principles of ſelf-love, natural conſcience, &amp;c. in the unregenerate. Now when men do actions materially good from theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, they do not act from ſinful principles as ſinful. That is, though they are defectively corrupt, the
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:012416_0115_0F8973ED33D33E10"/>
action does not flow and take it's form from their corruption, as was noted in the laſt ſection. This is well expreſſed by Dr. Preſton, "Take man's nature," ſays he,
<q>as ſecluded from [ſanctifying] grace, it is able to do two things; to bring forth ſin and luſt, which comes from the corruption of it, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe many excellent virtues, which proceed from common nature which is in a man unregenerate, as well as ſinful nature.</q>

                  <q>A man may do a thing by nature,</q>
ſays Mr. Charnock,
<q>from a good principle, a principle of common honeſty good in it's kind, (braſs is good in it's kind but not ſo good as ſilver) but not evangelically good without a renewed affection to God.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Vol. 2. page 16. Fol.</note> Now though the want of this renewed affection to God, in performing the ſubſtance of commanded duties, be utterly ſinful, yet to act from a natural principle good in itſelf is lawful: And to do actions materially good, from ſuch a principle is a duty, as we ſhall ſee more fully in the ſequel.</p>
               <p>It is further argued by Mr. H. that what are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed external duties
<q>are not required for their own ſakes, or in themſelves conſidered, but only as proper ways of exerciſing and expreſſing love to God. Love to God is therefore the thing required: The whole of the duty lies in this: And where this is wanting the externals are as to duty an empty nothing, not the thing required; and in doing them no duty is done.</q>
Pag. 118, 119.</p>
               <p>Here are two propoſitions, of which the latter (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. H.) follows from the former, being connected with it by the illative particle [therefore.] We will firſt conſider their connection, and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the truth of each of them apart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="unknown:012416_0116_0F8973EDF23AF688"/>As to their connection: Our author here argues, that
<q>if external duties are not required for their own ſakes, but only as proper ways of exerciſing and expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love to God; then love to God is the [only] thing required: The whole du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y lies in this.</q>
But how can this conſequence flow from the antecedent to which it is ſubjoined? Or indeed how can it conſiſt with it? Common ſenſe I ſhould imagine, would conclude that if external duties are required at all, whether for their own ſakes, or on any other account; then love to God is not the only thing required, nor does the duty lie wholly in this. Certain it is, that external actions are as diverſe from love, as the effect is from it's cauſe, as the ſign is from the thing ſignified; as an immanent affection is from an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of operative power for the performance of an outward work. On the contrary, if love be the only thing required, no imperate act of the will is required at all. If the whole duty lies in love, no part of it lies in expreſſing love, or in exerting any effective acts from any principle whatever. All the fruits and effects of love i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a way of endeavour to glorify God, and do good to men, being in nature intirely diverſe from the affection of love, muſt be cancelled from the liſt of duties, as well as the endeavours of the unregenerate. To draw a conſequence from a principle inconſiſtent with and contrary to it, is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks a little extraordinary. But,</p>
               <p>Let us now examine the truth of each propoſition apart. To begin with the latter, viz. That in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal duties of religion love to God is the only thing required, the whole duty lies in this. This muſt be denied, ſince not only ſcripture and reaſon, but Mr. H. himſelf will ſupport us in ſaying, that endeavours of external obedience are required, as well as the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of love, at leaſt when they accompany and
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:012416_0117_0F8973EEB0EECB60"/>
flow from love to God, and are genuine fruits exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and expreſſions of it. I add, that ſince the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſuch endeavours is <hi>ſin in itſelf,</hi> as well as the want of a principle of divine love in them, and ſo doubles the ſinners guilt; it muſt be concluded, that the former is a part of duty as well as the latter; and that there is an obligation to both conjunctly, and to each ſeverally.</p>
               <p>Perhaps we have not yet fully hit the joint. If not I hope we ſhall at length find it, in examining the other propoſition, viz.
<q>External duties of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are not required for their own ſakes, or in themſelves conſidered; but only as proper ways of exerciſing and expreſſing love to God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It will be neceſſary to premiſe a few things for the better underſtanding of what is here aſſerted, which as it lies may not appear ſo plain. External duties are of two kinds, moral and poſitive. To ſpeak and behave reverently in reſpect to God, juſtly truly and kindly towards men, ſeem to be duties of perpetual obligation, on ſuppoſition that we have power and occaſion of ſpeaking, and acting at all. Now there is a fitneſs and goodneſs in ſuch a manner of beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, a ſuitableneſs to our ſtate and relations; and a contrary behaviour would be naturally unſeemly and pernicious. There is a goodneſs in right actions conſidered in themſelves, and therefore they are fit expreſſions of good affections. External actions are not like words in themſelves equally fit to expreſs any idea. There is truth righteouſneſs and goodneſs in ſpeech and behaviour, as well as in the ſentiments and affections of the heart. Whatever principle a man acts from, lying, acts of injuſtice and cruelty, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and evil in themſelves; and on the contrary acts of righteouſneſs and mercy are in themſelves right.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="unknown:012416_0118_0F89748F33F3BE60"/>There are other external duties which are called poſitive. The ſubſtance of ſuch actions is not in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of neceſſary obligation, but is ſanctified and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined merely by the ſovereign will of God. Of this kind are inſtitutions of religious worſhip.</p>
               <p>Concerning external duties it is enquired, 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are required <hi>for their own ſakes?</hi> If the meaning be, whether they are required becauſe right and fit in themſelves, and not in their own nature ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely indifferent, I anſwer poſitive duties are not required for their own ſakes. The performance of them is good becauſe required, not required becauſe good in itſelf. But to ſpeak the truth, to do juſtly, to behave reverently towards God, are duties in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fit. There is a goodneſs in ſuch a manner of conduct; and it may truly be ſaid that theſe things are required for their own ſakes, or becauſe right in themſelves; though perhaps this may not be the ſole reaſon of their requirement. Poſitive duties are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not for their own ſakes, but for ſome further end. Actions morally good may be and are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red partly for their own ſakes, and partly as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to other purpoſes diſtinct from the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. If then unregenerate ſinners may perform external duties, good in themſelves, as has been prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it muſt be concluded that this is required of them. And if they can attend inſtrumental duties, ſo as that their attendance ſhall be conducive to the end for which they are required, as ſhall in due time be proved; their not being required for their own ſakes will not at all weaken our argument, that ſuch an attendance is in itſelf their duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Are external duties of religion required <hi>in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſidered?</hi> If this means the ſame with the former enquiry, it has now been anſwered. But it ſeems Mr. H. in denying this, intends ſomething fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:012416_0119_0F89748FF1CAA888"/>
viz. That what are called external duties of religion, materially conſidered, or <hi>in ſenſu diviſo,</hi> are not required but upon the ſuppoſition that they are conjoined with and flow from love to God. That is, theſe things are <hi>duties</hi> if they are true expreſſions and fruits of love to God, otherwiſe they are not required at mens hands. To open this a little it may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſome duties are binding upon us as moral agents, without implying or preſuppoſing any other qualifications than natural capacities and advantages for obedience. Such are the duties of loving God and our neighbour. Other duties are required of men only conſequentially, or <hi>on ſuppoſition</hi> that they are ſubjects <hi>thus qualified,</hi> and the action be <hi>thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi> It may be their preſent duty to be thus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, and ſo to do the duty conſequentially required without any delay; yet the doing of it while unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified is not a duty; it is not required, and ought not to be done. And ſome circumſtances though not eſſential to an action, <hi>as an action,</hi> may yet be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to it, <hi>as a duty required.</hi> Thus though it be the preſent duty of thoſe who have had ſufficient means of inſtruction, to believe in Chriſt and profeſs their faith; yet it is not the duty of any one to profeſs faith until he does believe. Profeſſion, baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper are duties <hi>on ſuppoſition,</hi> that the ſubjects are qualified according to the rules of the goſpel. Though it may be the ſin of an unbeliever that he does not now join himſelf to the chriſtian church, yet it would be a greater ſin for him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs faith, and be baptized, while conſcious that he is an infidel. It may be the preſent duty of a profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chriſtian to partake of the Lord's ſupper; yet it is not his duty to eat and drink at the Lord's table unleſs he do it <hi>religiouſly,</hi> in remembrance of Chriſt. And if any one ſhould do the outward action, meerly
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:012416_0120_0F897490B2B7C7A8"/>
to ſatisfy his hunger, qualify himſelf for a commiſſion, or gratify an intemperate appetite for wine, without any religious views; we might truly ſay that what he does is no duty at all, but a great ſin; becauſe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious manner of eating and drinking is eſſential to partaking of the Lord's ſupper, <hi>as a duty</hi>; and we ought not to do the outward action at all unleſs we do it religiouſly. In this caſe though we cannot ſay that the qualification of the perſon, and the religious manner of the performance, is the only thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that the whole of the duty lies in this, (for external actions are alſo required) yet we grant that theſe circumſtances are eſſential to the outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, conſidered as duties;
<q>and where theſe are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the externals are as to duty an empty nothing, or rather much worſe than nothing, and in doing them no duty is done</q>; and that for this plain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe theſe externals are required <hi>only on ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi>
of theſe other requiſites; and conſequently theſe adjuncts belong to the ſubſtance and matter of the <hi>duty,</hi> though they belong not to the ſubſtance of the <hi>outward action</hi>: Which action is a commanded duty only in the compounded and not in the divided ſenſe.</p>
               <p>This appears to be Mr. H's meaning, when he ſays, that the unregenerate in attending the externals of religion, do nothing that is their duty. He conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders theſe things as enjoined on men only on ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that they are regenerate, and have a holy love to God. For he ſays,
<q>they are required only as expreſſions of love to God.</q>
Expreſſions of love, as ſuch, are duties only on ſuppoſition of love. Now as it is the main deſign of this ſection to confute this notion, it will not be neceſſary that we detain the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der long, by framing a full reply to this exception, before we proceed to our enſuing arguments. Yet a few things may be hinted briefly.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="117" facs="unknown:012416_0121_0F897491766E24A0"/>1. If this be true, then it is as unlawful for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ſinner to ſpeak the truth, do an act of juſtice or kindneſs to a neighbour, reſcue his parent when in danger of death, to read or hear the word of God, or pray to him for any mercy temporal or ſpiritual, or do any external action whatever; as it would be for an unbeliever contrary to his inward perſuaſion to profeſs faith, be baptized, and come to the Lord's table purely to get drunk. For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirement of duties only on ſuppoſition of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and love to God, implies the prohibition of them, in all other caſes. It is as unlawful for one who has not a holy love to God, to do any thing required only as an expreſſion of ſuch love, as it is for one who has no religious regard to Chriſt, to do an action required only as an expreſſion of religious regard to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then it is a greater ſin for an unregenerate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to read and hear God's word, and pray to him, than to refrain from it; even as it is a greater ſin for an infidel to profeſs faith, &amp;c. than not to do it. For a duty required only on ſuppoſition of love to God, is, by one who has not this qualification, and while he has it not, omitted with leſs guilt than done.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then it is as unwarrantable and preſumptuous for any one, whether regenerate or not, to endeavour an attendance on an external duty of religion, until he has ſome prevailing evidence that his endeavours are ſincere expreſſions of holy love, as it is for a man to offer himſelf to baptiſm, or to join in partaking at the Lord's table, without a prevailing perſuaſion that he is in a good meaſure qualified for it, and ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ordinance in a religious manner. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed mens fault when they do not love God: So it is if they (enjoying goſpel privileges) are not qualified for the outward ſeals of the covenant. Yet while
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:012416_0122_0F89749230B99E18"/>
they are unqualified they ought to refrain from them, and while they have no evidence of their qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they are, in the judgment of their conſciences, unqualified, and ſo obliged to refrain. And thus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one who has no prevailing perſuaſion of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a lover of God, muſt in conſcience refrain from ſuch actions as are required only on ſuppoſition of holy love, and as expreſſions of the ſame; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, from declaring that he has ſuch love, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. H's ſcheme from every other exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal duty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then there is the ſame reaſon to caution and warn men againſt preſuming to read and hear the word of God, to pray to him, or attend on any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal duty of religion, until they firſt find ſome evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that they either are, or ſhall be regenerated in and with the attempt; as there is to warn men not to come to the Lord's table until they find ſome evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their being duly qualified for it.</p>
               <p>I could eaſily go on further, but I forbear. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks theſe conſequences are ſo intolerable, that no principle ought to be admitted from which they can fairly be deduced. If they can fairly be avoided on Mr. H's plan, let it be ſhewn.</p>
               <p>It is true the external duties of religion are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fit ways wherein love to God may be exerciſed and expreſſed, and it is the duty of all men to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe love to God in attending on them. But it is moſt falſe to ſay, that they are required only as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes and expreſſions of holy love. They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the goſpel primarily and principally <hi>as means,</hi> through the ſpirit's influence, of enlightening, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, converting and ſanctifying thoſe who are choſen in Chriſt to ſalvation: As alſo of reſtraining the out-breakings of ſin in many others, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the bad conſequences in this world. And
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:012416_0123_0F897493BAF67F68"/>
ſuch an attendance on the external duties of religion, as does not imply any exerciſes of true love to God, may be well adapted to ſubſerve ſeveral of thoſe ends for which they are required; as for inſtance, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the preſent welfare of mankind, to awaken and humble ſinners, prepare them for regeneration, and lead them on to a ſaving converſion. Why then ſhould any think that ſuch an attendance is not the duty of men, previous to regeneration?</p>
               <p>Whether the argument hitherto inſiſted on and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended be not valid, notwithſtanding what has yet been urged to enervate it, let the unbiaſſed judge. Mr. H. indeed takes the freedom at the cloſe of his firſt plea againſt "unregenerate duties" (as well as at other times) to ſeat himſelf a while upon the bench. He has given his judgment
<q>that the ſhort plain argument he has conſidered is quite ſufficient to end the diſpute.</q>
But it may be doubted, whether it be proper for every <hi>pleader</hi> to follow the precedent. Some liberties appear well enough in great men, which would ſcarce be thought modeſt in perſons of mean rank. Perhaps our author was how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a little too ſanguine in concluding ſo perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
<q>that it is as demonſtrably evident that there is no obedience but what conſiſts in love, as any truth contained in divine revelation, and muſt approve itſelf to the reaſon of every one who will exerciſe his reaſon, and not confuſe and bewilder himſelf with a ſet of words without meaning.</q>
Pag. 117. On what evidence this concluſion ſtands we ſhall ſee preſently.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Our point may be further proved from ſundry texts of ſcripture. The firſt I ſhall produce is the conference between our Savior and the ſcribe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Mark xii. 28,—34. <hi>And one of the ſcribes came, and having heard them reaſoning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:012416_0124_0F897494C753EE48"/>
and perceiving that he had anſwered them well, aſked him, Which is the firſt commandment of all? And Jeſus anſwered him, The firſt of all the commandments is, Hear, O Iſrael; the Lord our God is one Lord: And thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy ſtrength. This is the firſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And the ſecond is like, namely this, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf. There is none other commandment greater than theſe. And the ſcribe ſaid unto him, Well, maſter, thou haſt ſaid the truth: For there is one God, and there is none other but he. And to love him with all the heart, and with all the underſtanding, and with all the ſoul, and with all the ſtrength, and to love his neighbour as himſelf, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and ſacrifices. And, when Jeſus ſaw that he anſwered diſcreetly, he ſaid unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durſt aſk him any queſtion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may ſeem a little remarkable, that arguments concluding in direct contradiction to each other, ſhould be founded on this conference. Mr. H's prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal argument to diſprove "unregenerate duties," is taken from this diſcourſe of our Lord as related by Matthew, chap. xxii. 37,—39. In ſtating and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating our argument from this paſſage, we ſhall be unavoidably led to examine Mr. H's reaſoning on the matter, which would otherwiſe have been referred to another place.</p>
               <p>The queſtion which this ſcribe put to our Savior, was not, "what is the ſum of all the commands and of man's duty as contained in them? He did not conceive that the whole duty of man was expreſſed in one or two commands. It would be evidently improper on this ſuppoſition to enquire which is the <hi>firſt,</hi> that is the <hi>greateſt</hi> commandment of <hi>all.</hi> It
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:012416_0125_0F8974953359E3A8"/>
ſeems to have been a point diſputed among the Jewiſh doctors, which of all the commands of the law was to be accounted the greateſt. And this ſcribe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that Jeſus had anſwered the ſadducees well was deſirous to hear his judgment of this great queſtion.</p>
               <p>Our Savior in his reply directly reſolves the point propoſed, declaring expreſly that the firſt and great commandment is to love God with all the heart. To which he adds the ſecond requiring the love of our neighbour. Though the ſcribe's queſtion was only concerning the greateſt command of all, yet as the ſecond was like the firſt, it is with good reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined with it; and the rather becauſe it ſeems to have been a prevailing error among the Jewiſh teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that the ſocial virtues were not very important, provided men were but zealous and exact in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordinances of divine worſhip. Beſides, theſe two commandments have the cloſeſt connection. He that truly loves God loves his neighbour alſo. Our Lord therefore joining theſe two great moral precepts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which may be conſidered as a kind of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of the moral law, adds, "there is no other commandment greater than theſe," that is, theſe are the greateſt: There is no other of equal importance. Now here are two things to be carefully noted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was not our Savior's deſign to comprehend all the commands of God in theſe two great precepts. This is evident, becauſe he refers to other commands, and draws a compariſon between theſe other, and thoſe two great ones of which he had been ſpeaking. To ſay that the law of love is greater than the other commands, implies that there are other commands. The comparative terms <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>leſs</hi> are relative, and neceſſarily ſuppoſe their correlatives. Nor can it be ſaid, that theſe other commands, with which the
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:012416_0126_0F897495F12B6AE8"/>
law of love ſtands compared, are contained in it. For they are plainly diſtinguiſhed from it; they are called <hi>other commands.</hi> A part of any thing cannot be called another thing than that in which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Beſides, if we ſhould ſuppoſe that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon is between the whole of the divine law and ſome particular commands contained in it, our Savior's ſaying "there is no other commandment greater than theſe," would amount to no more than this, that a part is not greater than the whole: Which would be trifling and uninſtructive.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe other commands, with which the great precepts of the law are compared, do not contain in them thoſe which require the love of God and our neighbour. For if they did, they would not be other commands, but the very ſame, with only the addition of ſome new requirements. And beſides, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts requiring the love of God and our neighbour, are ſaid to be greater than the other; which would be palpably abſurd, if the law of love were involved in theſe other. It would be ſaying that the law of love is greater than the ſame law, with theſe other precepts taken together. That is, that a part is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the whole; that the love of God and our neighbour is a greater duty, than a duty which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it the love of God and our neighbour.</p>
               <p>How can theſe conſequences be avoided? Will any pretend that to ſay "there is no other command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment greater than theſe," does not neceſſarily imply that there is any other? This would be charging our Lord with groſs impropriety of language. Had he thought that thoſe two commandments contained all, he would have ſaid there is no other commandment <hi>beſides theſe.</hi> Or if there were any doubt about the matter, the anſwer of the ſcribe, which was approved as diſcreet, muſt ſatisfy it. Says he, to love God and
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:012416_0127_0F897496B32CFB90"/>
our neighbour is more than all whole burnt-offerings and ſacrifices. Here thoſe commanded duties are mentioned, with which the love of God and our neighbour are compared; and which we have ſhewn are diſtinct from it, neither containing it nor contained in it, in the ſenſe here intended. Religious ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces laid an obligation of obedience on thoſe to whom they were given: Yet they were not ſo important as the love of God and our neighbour. This is the ſenſe and ſcope of our Lord's diſcourſe; which is parallel with what he afterwards ſaid, when reproving the partiality and hypocriſy of the ſcribes and phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees in their religious obedience. Says he,
<q>ye tithe mint aniſe and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith (with the love of God. Luk. 11.42) theſe ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 23.23.</note> This text is alſo much to our purpoſe, and the ſame concluſions will flow from it. Paying tithes is here declared to be a duty, or what ought to be done; and another duty diſtinct from the weightier matters of the law. But this text is ſo ſim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lar in meaning and expreſſion, to what has juſt been conſidered, that 'tis needleſs to make more particular obſervations on it.</p>
               <p>From the whole we conclude that an attendance on religious ordinances is enjoined on men by other commands than thoſe which enjoin holy love. And conſequently ſomething is required as matter of duty different from love, and which does not in itſelf ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily imply any exerciſes of ſuch love. There is therefore an obligation on thoſe to whom the word of ſalvation is ſent, to attend the inſtituted means of grace, beſides the obligation they are under to do it in the exerciſe of true love to God. Our Savior's
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:012416_0128_0F897497724AC568"/>
determination upon the caſe propoſed to him, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes us with a ſure principle for our determinations, with reſpect to the poſitive precepts of the goſpel. Such an attendance on the means of grace is required as does not in itſelf neceſſarily imply or preſuppoſe regeneration, or the actings of faith and love; that is, ſuch an attendance as men have a power for while unregenerate. And this obligation reſpects all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ordinances, except ſuch as may evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be limited and appropriated to qualified ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that is, to believers, as thoſe ordinances which are called ſacraments I ſuppoſe are. And we may by parity of reaſon conclude that ſuch external acts of obedience to moral precepts as the unregenerate by God's common aſſiſtance are able to perform, are alſo commanded duties.</p>
               <p>Let us now take a view of Mr. H's reaſoning from this conference, where we have the argument on which he ſeems chiefly to depend, and which, if we will take his judgment, is quite ſufficient to end the diſpute. I muſt now anticipate a little the buſineſs of the next ſection, and for a while take the place of <hi>reſpondent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Says he,
<q>According to our Savior's account of the divine law or commandment (Mat. 22.37,—39) it requires nothing but love to God and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</q>
P. 116. Anſwer, Our Savior's words as related by Matthew, prove no ſuch thing as is here aſſerted; and as related by Mark they imply the very reverſe. Mr. H. adds,
<q>He expreſly ſays on theſe two commandments hang all the law and the prophets, (ver. 40.) That is, all that is required in the law and in the prophets, every injunction and command to be found in divine revelation really requires nothing but love to God and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</q>
P. 117. Anſw. But this interpretation of
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:012416_0129_0F89749832F1A040"/>
our Savior's words is contrary to reaſon and ſcripture, and for what yet appears has nothing to ſupport it but Mr. H's authority; which (without diſparagement) may he confronted by an authority no way inferior, that is by the authority of the ſame Mr. H. who in a paſſage lately produced acknowledges that the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of religion are in ſome caſes required. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps our author does not mean that the inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of love is all that is required, but
<q>Love act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out and expreſſed is all proper ways.</q>
Ibid. Anſw. By love acted out and expreſſed, I conceive nothing can be intended but the external fruits and expreſſions of love, which however they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with love under figurative expreſſions, are in nature as diverſe from it as any other effect is from it's cauſe. We do indeed allow that nothing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as duty, but what is either implied in the affection of love, or is a fit way of exerciſing and expreſſing it; nothing which may not be conſidered as comprehended in love, if not formally, yet virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and radically, as being apt to flow from it, as an effect from it's cauſe, or an act from it's habit. But that no external duties of religion are required, but ſuch as <hi>actually</hi> flow from love, and to imply the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of it, (which I think is the moſt candid ſenſe in which Mr. H's words can be taken) is not at all proved by our Savior's words, and is untrue, as has been ſhewn from this very paſſage of ſcripture, and ſhall be further demonſtrated. But Mr. H. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds—
<q>No other natural and eaſy ſenſe can be put upon theſe words of Chriſt;</q>
(How can we know that?)
<q>But would they bear another ſenſe, what St. Paul ſays on the ſame ſubject, fixes the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. He ſays, he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. And again, Love is the fulfilling of the law. Love could not be the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:012416_0130_0F897498F24A09E8"/>
of the law, if the law required any thing more than love acted out to a perfect degree, and in a proper manner. Love is therefore the whole duty of man. Nothing more nor leſs is required. God has not given one precept to man in the law or the prophets, in the old teſtament or new, but what requires love to God, or man, or both; and is to be obeyed in the exerciſe of love, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, or by nothing elſe. There is therefore no obedience but what conſiſts in love; and where there is nothing of this there is no duty done; nothing that is required, and is due, is given.</q>
P. 117.</p>
               <p>I have now given the reader the intire argument with which Mr. H. would prove that nothing more or leſs than love is required: On which we may note—</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here is nothing tending to enervate the proofs we have given, that there are other commands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the great ones our Savior ſpeaks of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If love be taken in it's proper ſenſe for an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or immanent act of the will, it will be flatly contrary to the current of ſcripture, and to divers of Mr. H's expreſſions, to ſay that nothing beſides love is required. It is certain that good works as well as love are commanded duties.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We have no reaſon to think that love in the texts of ſcripture above referred to is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as including all thoſe acts of external obedience which flow from it. It does not appear that it is ever uſed in ſo extenſive a ſenſe in the ſcriptures. Mr. H. beſure has offered nothing to prove that it is, unleſs the words of the apoſtle,
<q>Love is the fulfilling of the law,</q>
may be thought to imply it; which will be conſidered immediately.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="127" facs="unknown:012416_0131_0F897499B08E7B20"/>4. There is nothing in the ſhape of an argument to prove that nothing more or leſs than love is required, except two texts of ſcripture, viz. Mat. 22.40. Rom. 13.8, 9. If then theſe texts ſhould be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a conſtruction different from what he has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, his argument will come to nothing. Now it does not appear that there is any neceſſity of taking theſe texts in the ſenſe he has given, and indeed if they are cloſely examined they will not bear that ſenſe.</p>
               <p>When our Savior ſays,
<q>On theſe two command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hang all the law and the prophets,</q>
he is ſpeaking of commandments which he had juſt been comparing with and declaring greater than others, and which were conſequently diverſe from thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to which they are preferred. And there is nothing in the expreſſion here uſed that ſo much as intimates that every command in divine revelation really requires nothing but love. On the contrary when one thing is ſaid to hang on another, we na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally conceive of a difference between them. All the law and the prophets may properly be ſaid to hang on theſe two commandments, if theſe are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any other; if theſe are the foundation, the ultimate end of other precepts, and indeed of the whole of divine revelation, which is deſigned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover men to the love of God and their neighbour; if other duties required in the word of God naturally and regularly flow from love as their principle or efficient cauſe. It ſeems to me that the phraſe here uſed cannot, without ſtraining, be made to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend much more, at leaſt it cannot bear Mr. H's conſtruction: Nor has he hinted one reaſon for his ſenſe of the words, except his referring to the words of St. Paul, which he ſuppoſes to be parallel and to fix the meaning of this text, may paſs for a reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="unknown:012416_0132_0F89749B4D32EFD0"/>Our whole buſineſs then is to attend to this paſſage of the apoſtle here referred to, which taken in it's connection is as follows. Rom. xiii. 7—10.
<q>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore to all their dues, &amp;c. O <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e no man any thing but to love one another, for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou ſhalt not commit adultery. Thou ſhalt not kill. Thou ſhalt not ſteal. Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs. Thou ſhalt not covet. And if there be any other commandment it is briefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended (anakephalaioutai) in this ſaying namely, thou ſhalt love thy neigbhour as thy ſelf. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour, therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</q>
On theſe words we may obſerve.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the apoſtle ſeems evidently to ſpeak of the law in a limited ſenſe, meaning only what is called the ſecond table; containing our duty to our neighbour. At moſt it comprehends only the moral law. Now if it ſhould be ſuppoſed that the <hi>moral law</hi> requires nothing but love, this will not prove that there are no <hi>ordinances</hi> pertaining to the external worſhip of God which require any thing beſides love. For that law of which the apoſtle is ſpeaking does not contain every divine command. It does not contain poſitive precepts, which (as we learn from our Savior's words) are diſtinct from that law which obliges us to love our neighbour as ourſelves. God by his ſovereign authority may have enjoined exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal duties of religion of a quite different kind, for any thing that can be argued to the contrary from this text.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is certain that the moral law, and even the ſecond table requires ſomething beſides love, in the ſtrict ſenſe. It requires acts of kindneſs. And it alſo requires a <hi>due degree</hi> of love, and endeavour to

do good. If then love be taken in ſo large and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified a ſenſe as to include the whole of our duty, or a perfect conformity to the law in all reſpects; then it is true, that this is ſtrictly the fulfilling of the law; and every one in whom this is found has fulfilled the law. But then I ſay that ſomething leſs than perfect obedience is alſo required of us by God. Something is our duty, which in itſelf is not a complete fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole law. The exerciſes and actings of love in true chriſtians are commanded duties, though by reaſon of their imperfection they are not the fulfilling of the law. Theſe and much more are their duty. True it is, that nothing more can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of any one than to fulfill the law. But this will never prove that nothing leſs, is in any caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. The whole of our duty in a perfect degree, and each part, in all it's degrees is jointly and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally required. That holineſs which is perfectly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the law is our duty; and ſuch acts of holineſs as are imperfect, and conſequently are not the fulfilling of the law are our duty: And external duties of religi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n, though in themſelves they have not the complete eſſence of true holineſs, yet are a part of that duty whereby the divine command is fulfilled. The ſubſtance of the duty is enjoined as well as it's circumſtances. That ought to be done, and theſe not omitted, though the ſubſtance of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal duties without love be not goſpel holineſs; and though goſpel holineſs being imperfect in degree be not the fulfilling of the law, or the whole duty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in required.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, that any act of obedience is a fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the law: I anſwer, it may be ſo termed in ſome ſenſe: It is a doing ſomething required in the law. But this is not the ſenſe in which the apoſtle uſes the phraſe. He means the whole of our duty in it's full
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:012416_0134_0F89749CB1613088"/>
extent. But if the apoſtle intended by the fulfilling of the law, only a particular act of obedience, then his ſaying that love is an inſtance of obedience to the law, does not imply but that there may be many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtances. Love and the fruits of love, and actions materially good though deſtitute of holy love, may all conſiſtently enough be inſtances of duty, by doing of which we <hi>in this ſenſe</hi> fulfil or obey the law in ſome reſpect. If it be ſaid that, every inſtance of obedience or duty implies ſome degree of holy love, this is only begging the queſtion. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we attend carefully to the apoſtles words, it will I think plainly appear, that there are other duties we owe to our neighbour beſides love, in the ſenſe here intended.
<q>Owe no man any thing but to love one another, for he that loveth,</q>
&amp;c. The apoſtle here evidently mentions other debts or duties owing to others beſides love. Such as rendring to every one his due. And he obſerves a notable difference between this debt of love, and thoſe others; viz. that theſe muſt be diſcharged by actual payment; which when we have done, we ſhall owe them no longer. But that other debt of love we ſhall always owe our neighbour, though we ſhould owe him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. The apoſtle here diſtinguiſhes between rendring to all their due, and loving one another: He compares and oppoſes theſe different duties to each other: Which ſhews that the former are not included in love in the ſenſe here intended. I ſee not how any tolerable ſenſe can be made of the text, if love be underſtood to contain thoſe other duties which are compared with it. For then the meaning muſt ſtand thus:
<q>Owe no man any thing except love, that is, except tribute, cuſtom, fear, honour and every thing elſe which is ever due from one man to another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </q>
The bare recital of which is a
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:012416_0135_0F89749D710817F0"/>
ſufficient confutation. And thus the words of Paul pointed to by Mr. H. confirm the ſenſe we have given of our Savior's words. They both appear to uſe the word love in it's proper ſenſe: And neither of them comprizes in it all acts of external obedience: And conſequently Mr. H's aſſertion,
<q>That nothing more or leſs than love is required,</q>
not only wants proof, but is fully confuted, and convicted of falſhood from thoſe very texts by which he endeavours to maintain it.</p>
               <p>But it may be enquired, Why is love called the fulfilling of the law; and he that loveth another ſaid to have fulfilled the law; and all the commandments of the ſecond table comprehended briefly in this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf?— This may eaſily and ſatisfactorily be anſwered, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, if we will not cut the ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſtles words to the quick, which ſome expoſitors perhaps have too much done. The learned <hi>Toletus</hi> ſeems to have given the true meaning of this paſſage as follows.
<q>The law is ſaid to be fulfilled two manner of ways. 1. When each of the precepts are fulfilled in particular, &amp;c. 2. When that is done on which the whole law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, or unto which the whole law is ordained or framed, or by which the whole law is performed. And thus he that loveth hath fulfilled the whole law; as well becauſe love is the principle, cauſe and root of all other things which are commanded; as becauſe love is the end or ſcope of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the law according to 1 Tim. 1.5. as alſo becauſe it exhibits the manner wherein the other commandments are perfectly done, namely from love.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Pol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="132" facs="unknown:012416_0136_0F89749E34367098"/>
Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf; this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not intend that they are ſtrictly and formally, but only that they are as it were radically contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; as love is an operative principle, diſpoſing and prompting to all other duties to our neighbour. Or perhaps the original word may only import that the other commands are connected with this as their head, or capital principle: And then the meaning will very much coincide with that of our Savior's words before explained, "On their two command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hang all the law and the prophets."</p>
               <p>But whether this be the full and exact meaning of theſe expreſſions or not, certain it is that this paſſage neither requires nor indeed will bear Mr. H's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And ſo we have conſidered the whole e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence on which depends the truth of his <hi>major propoſition,</hi>
                  <q>that the divine law enjoins nothing more or leſs than love.</q>
                  <hi>The aſſumption,</hi> viz. "The unregenerate have no true (i e. holy) love to God and their neighbour," we diſpute not; though we cannot admit the reaſon immediately ſubjoined, viz. That "unregeneracy conſiſts in want of love, and in conſequent exerciſes of enmity." For it has been ſhewn to conſiſt in the privation of a holy prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and not in any act or the privation of any act.</p>
               <p>We have now ſuſtained the attack of our author's grand battery; and have I hope maintained our ground againſt it.

                  <pb n="133" facs="unknown:012416_0137_0F89749EF25807F0"/>III. We will now again reſume the labouring oar, and proceed in our preſent taſk: That is, to prove that ſomething is required of men in a way of duty which they are able to do while unregenerate. And the next argument is taken from the apoſtle's words, Rom. 2.14.
<q>When the Gentiles who have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law, theſe having not the law are a law to themſelves.</q>
The deſign of the apoſtle in the beginning of this epiſtle is to prove that both Jews and Gentiles are under ſin. But ſince there is no tranſgreſſion where there is no law, it might be objected, that the Gentiles not having the law ſeem not to be guilty of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing it. To this the apoſtle anſwers, that though the Gentiles have not the written law, yet they have the work or impreſſion of the law of nature on their hearts, in thoſe notions of right and wrong which they are naturally furniſhed with. This appears, 1. from their conſcienciouſly doing ſome things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in and enjoined by the divine law.
<q>Though they have not the law, ſaith the apoſtle, they ſhew f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rth the work of it, they do many things which it requireth, and forbear or abſtain from many things which it forbiddeth, and ſo ſhew forth it's work and efficacy.</q>

               <p>That the perſons here ſpoken of are unregenerate cannot be doubted, beſure not by Mr. H. who ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to ſay, that it would not be a wiſe act in God to regenerate an ignorant heathen, or a very errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous profeſſor of chriſtianity, without preparing him for this change by a previous uſe of means.<note n="†" place="bottom">Serm. on Regen. pag. 56.</note> How competent judges we are of what is wiſe for God to
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:012416_0138_0F89749FB266BD90"/>
do in this caſe, I enquire not. That theſe heathen here mentioned were unr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>generate is mutually agreed.</p>
               <p>Of theſe perſons it is ſaid that they do the things contained in the law. This is the medium or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which the apoſtle proves that they are a law to themſelves. The form of expreſſion may ſeem hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothetical, "<hi>When</hi> the Gentiles do," &amp;c. but the meaning is plainly categorical. q. d. Since the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles do the things contained in the law, it appears that they are a law to themſelves. The conſequence muſt ſtand or fall with it's antecedent.</p>
               <p>Now whatever actions are contained in or required by the law, are commanded duties: But by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Paul, the moral virtues of the unregenerate heathen are things contained in the law, or as <hi>Calvin</hi> renders it, <hi>works of the law</hi>; <note n="*" place="bottom">Inſtit. lib. 2. chap. 2. ſect 22.</note> that is, works requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the law. Therefore ſome actions of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate are commanded duties. And this, by the way, directly proves that a virtuous life, as well as an attendance on ordinances of religious worſhip, is the duty of men previous to regeneration.</p>
               <p>Theſe things the Gentiles do <hi>by nature.</hi> I do not ſuppoſe that theſe words were meant to exclude all divine influence prompting and aſſiſting the powers of nature to action; yet they doubtleſs exclude the influence of ſupernatural ſanctifying grace; and ſo leave no room to doubt that the perſons ſpoken of are unregenerate.</p>
               <p>But there is an exception to this teſtimony, that deſerves ſome conſideration. The phraſe in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal (ta tou nomou) which is here tranſlated
<q>the things contained in the law,</q>
is more literally ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>the things of the law.</hi> And a learned writer <note n="†" place="bottom">Glas's Works, Vol. 3. pag. 25.</note> thinks that the meaning of the text is not that the
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:012416_0139_0F8974A072797688"/>
Gentiles do any duties contained in, or enjoined by the law; but that they do
<q>the offices of the law to themſelves or the things which pertain to the law to do. And this</q>
he ſays
<q>
                     <hi>is ſupported by the words immediately following,</hi> theſe having not the law are a law to themſelves, which ſhew the work of the law written in their hearts.</q>
Whether Mr. H. would follow this interpretation of the text I know not; he having taken no notice of it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we will attend to it. And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whereas it is ſuppoſed that the following words, "Theſe having not the law are a law to themſelves," are an evidence that the Gentiles doing the things of the law means their doing the things which the law does, (that is, enjoining duty, forbidding ſin, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and condemning the guilty, acquitting the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent) it appears to me that they are a great objection, and even a full confutation of the ſenſe here given of the text. The deſign of the apoſtle is to prove that the Gentiles who have not the law are a law to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And the medium, or argument by which he proves it is their doing by nature the things of the law. Now it is a maxim in logic that the medium by which any thing is proved, muſt be different from that which is proved by it; different in ſenſe, as well as in terms; otherwiſe the argument will be trifling, merely proving a thing by itſelf. For inſtance, it would be trifling for any one to argue in this manner.
<q>Since the Gentiles who have not the law are a law to themſelves, therefore theſe not having the law are a law to themſelves.</q>
Now to ſay that a man does the <hi>offices</hi> of the law to himſelf, is ſaying no more nor leſs than that he is a law to himſelf. We are in no other ſenſe a law to ourſelves, than that we do the offices of the law. If this then be what is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Gentiles doing the things of the law, I think
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:012416_0140_0F8974A1332016C8"/>
the apoſtles antecedent and conſequence differ only in terms; and the argument in the text muſt am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>unt to no more than this,
<q>When the Gentiles who have not the law do by nature the offices of the law to themſelves, theſe having not the law, are a law, that is, do the offices of a law to themſelves!</q>
Surely St. Paul did not argue at this rate. But if the ſenſe be as our tranſlators have rendred, <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things contained in the law,</hi> the argument is clear and pertinent. Mens doing the things required in the law without any knowledge of the written law, is an evidence that they are inſtead of a law to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that they have the work of the law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on their hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I humbly conceive, that the original word (poie) here uſed is not proper to expreſs the elicit or imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent acts of the mind and conſcience, by which alone men are, or do the offices of a law to themſelves. It properly ſignifies to perform ſome action. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> uſes it to expreſs the doing of what are called actions or performances, in diſtinction from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent acts of the ſoul. <note n="*" place="bottom">Ethic. lib. 6.</note> And I think the word is commonly, if not always uſed in this ſenſe in the new teſtament. When the conſcience of men does the office of a law, this cannot properly be called (poieſis) a doing or performance. But to do the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in or injoined by the law is properly expreſſed by the word here uſed. It often bears this ſenſe in the new teſtament, particularly in the verſe immediately preceding this under conſideration, the doers (poietai) of the law unqueſtionably means the doers of the duties contained in the law. And it ought not to be ſuppoſed, without evident reaſon, that the apoſtle ſhould immediately uſe the ſame word in effect to expreſs a meaning intirely diverſe.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="137" facs="unknown:012416_0141_0F8974A1F9410F08"/>3. The following verſe ſeems much to confirm the interpretation we plead for. "The gentiles," ſays the apoſtle,
<q>
                     <hi>ſhew</hi> the work of the law written in their hearts.</q>
How do they ſhew it? By thoſe actions, no doubt, which he had juſt mentioned, viz. doing the things contained in the law. Or to uſe Dr. Owen's words,
<q>They do many things which it requireth, and forbear or refrain from many things which it forbiddeth, and <hi>ſo ſhew forth</hi> it's work and efficacy.</q>
They ſhew it as believers do their faith, that is by their works. But ſuch actions as bear no conformity to the impreſſion of the law on mens hearts, do not ſhew or evidence ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. And inward acts of mens minds are not viſible.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſtream of expoſitors runs the ſame way. All our engliſh expoſitors and divines (except Mr. Glas, from whom I took the objection here conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ſo far as I have yet found, follow our tranſlation. With theſe agree the moſt eminent foreign divines, particularly <hi>Calvin, Gryneus, Hemingius, Piſcator, Alting, Maſtricht, Voſſius,</hi> &amp;c. beſides thoſe referred to in <hi>Pool</hi>'s Synopſis. <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> among the ancient fathers, I find underſtood the apoſtle's words in the ſame ſenſe. It is worthy of notice, that <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> though much preſſed with this text by the Pelagians, who endeavoured by it to prove that men might attain to true righteouſneſs by the powers of nature, yet in his anſwer, never intimates that the apoſtle only means
<q>that the gentiles do the offices of the law,</q>
though this interpretation would have been very convenient for his purpoſe; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges that,
<q>Their thoughts will thus far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them in the day of judgment, that they ſhall receive a lighter puniſhment, becauſe by nature
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:012416_0142_0F8974A3899BB780"/>
they have in ſome ſort done the things of the law.</q>

I ſhall only add, that in the Syriac, which is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt ancient and valuable of all the old ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, this verſe is rendred, according to the ſenſe we plead for, as appears by the tranſlation of it in the polyglot bible. It ſeems that this ſenſe of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's words which we oppoſe was unknown in the ancient church. Mr. H. will perhaps think I have been <hi>very wickedly</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Pag. 90.</note> employed, in producing the ſuffrage of the learned reſpecting the ſenſe of a text. But in matters of criticiſm, the judgment of the learned, I ſuppoſe, is not altogether to be deſpiſed, at leaſt by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This exception, being I hope removed, and the true meaning of the text vindicated, our argument from it in ſupport of the point we have undertaken to defend, is now left to the conſideration of all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial enquirers after truth. To me, I confeſs, the text ſpeaks as home to the point as can be deſired.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The words of the evangeliſt, Mark vi. 20. will furniſh us with another proof of the doctrine we plead for.
<q>Herod feared John, knowing that he was a juſt man and a holy, and obſerved him, and when he heard him he did many things, and heard him gladly.</q>
Herod an unregenerate man, not only had a reverence for John Baptiſt as a righteous man, and heard him gladly, but he did many things which John taught and exhorted him to do. The ſame things that he heard he did. None can be ſo wild as to imagine the meaning to be, that Herod did many things contrary to what he was taught; or merely that he was buſy in doing ſomething.
<q>He
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:012416_0143_0F8974A45FD283D0"/>
was not only a hearer of the word, but in part a doer of the work.</q>

If then Herod did any thing that John ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted him to do (the text ſays he did many things) then John exhorted to ſuch duties as may be done by an unregenerate ſinner. Mr. H. indeed tells us that
<q>John ſaid not a word of unregenerate duties, but preached and inculcated nothing ſhort of true repentance.</q>
P. 148. But St. <hi>Mark,</hi> who was more likely to know, informs us that he preached ſuch duties as Herod practiſed. And we may now fairly return him his own compliment;
<q>Mr. H. and they who join with him are wiſer than John the Baptiſt; and if he was wiſe and right in his preaching they are not ſo.</q>
Ibid.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Another argument I ſhall take from Phil. iv. 8.
<q>Finally my brethren, whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things.</q>
It will perhaps be thought that this text is not ſo pertinently cited in the preſent controverſy, being addreſſed to profeſſed believers who for ought that I know were all regenerate. I have not cited it becauſe ſtraitned for proofs, but for a particular reaſon, which will preſently appear.</p>
               <p>Two things are to be enquired into for the opening this text, and our argument grounded upon it: viz. Whether the hearers of the goſpel in general are bound by this precept to an immediate attendance to the duties here enjoined? And whether the duties
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:012416_0144_0F8974A4F117DF00"/>
are of ſuch a nature, that an unregenerate ſinner is able to perform any thing of what is here inculcated? For the firſt Mr. H. has happily ſaved us the trouble of proving it; he having granted as fully, and more fully than we deſire, that the exhortations to duty which in ſcripture are addreſſed to the regenerate, bind the unregenerate to obedience, as much as if they had been particularly directed to them.</p>
               <p>All that is wanting then in order to form a ſolid argument to our purpoſe from this text, is to ſhew that the unregenerate have a next power to practiſe theſe duties; that is, to ſpeak the truth, to behave juſtly, temperately, amiably, and in a word, practiſe thoſe virtues which are of general good report. Now theſe things are ſo manifeſtly in the power of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, that no one I think will deny it on any other pretence than this; that the apoſtle means only ſuch a practice of theſe virtues as implies or preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a principle of true holineſs infuſed in regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Now though it be true that men ought to do all theſe things in the exerciſe of faith and love, and that the want of holy principles and ends is an eſſential defect in the moſt ſhining virtues; yet it is carefully to be obſerved, that it is not a principle of grace that conſtitutes or denominates mens behaviour true, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, &amp;c. in the common acceptation of the words. Though a man cannot live in a <hi>holy</hi> manner while unregenerate, yet he can live <hi>juſtly, temperately,</hi> and ſpeak the <hi>truth.</hi> It is the ſubſtance and matter of actions, not their flowing from ſupernatural princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that conſtitutes them juſt, laudable, and of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good report.

                  </gap>erate by virtue of this

precept. For <hi>whatſoever</hi> things are true, &amp;c. are ſtrictly enjoined. And it is a beggarly pretence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of any proof from ſcripture or reaſon, to ſay that there is no obligation on any one to ſpeak the truth, and practiſe the other virtues here recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, except on ſuppoſition of it's being done from a holy principle.</p>
               <p>It is not to be allowed to any arbitrarily to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that when only the ſubſtance and matter of a duty is expreſly enjoined in a ſcripture precept, there is no obligation on any to do what is enjoined, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the performance be every way qualified as it ought to be. To omit any requiſite circumſtances of a duty is a ſin, but to omit the ſubſtance of the duty alſo is a double ſin. Lying and injuſtice are in themſelves ſins abſtract from all circumſtances. Conſequently truth and righteouſneſs are in themſelves commanded duties. It is not to be allowed to any arbitrarily to ſuppoſe, that when the apoſtle urges a regard to <hi>whatſoever</hi> things are true without limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he means not to exhort men to regard truth, unleſs on certain ſuppoſitions, and with the conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch circumſtances, as are not neceſſary to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the virtue of truth, according to the common acceptation of the word, however neceſſary they may be to conſtitute an action ſpiritually good. The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are to be taken according to the common mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words and phraſes therein uſed, unleſs ſome weighty reaſon appear for a ſingular and appropriate ſenſe.</p>
               <p>The practice of moral virtues in men unregenerate is in it's kind good, lovely, laudable. It was on this account that God loved Cyrus. Iſai. 48.14.
<q>God loved Cyrus,</q>
ſays Mr. Pool,
<q>with that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular kind of love which God hath for ſuch men as excel others in any virtues, as Cyrus did. In
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:012416_0146_0F8974A671265238"/>
which ſenſe Chriſt loved the young man.</q>
Mark 10.21.
<q>Then Jeſus beholding him loved him, Not with a ſpecial and ſaving love,</q>
(ſays Dr. Collins, Mr. Pool's continuator)
<q>but he loved him with ſuch a common love as he loveth all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with, and eſpecially ſuch as are better than others. All that can be concluded from hence is, that acts of moral righteouſneſs are pleaſing to God.</q>
It was on account of ſuch virtues as the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle recommends that Jeſus loved this young ruler. It was not merely love of benevolence that is here chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended; much leſs pity to him as one peculiarly ſtupid and hardned in pride and enmity againſt God. The phariſees were as proper objects of pity on this account as any; while maliciouſly watching for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to accuſe him. But we do not read that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them he loved them, but
<q>he looked round with anger being grieved at the hardneſs of their hearts.</q>
His love to this perſon is commonly underſtood to have been a friendly complacency in him, on account of his amiable character and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. In this young man we have a proof and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that a virtuous behaviour is amiable even in the unregenerate. Mr. H. indeed gives a different account of this matter. "Nor is there any reaſon," ſays he,
<q>to think that Chriſt loved him on account of any thing amiable in his character. He "be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him," looking on him as a poor, ignorant, ſtupid, proud enemy to God, and in a moſt wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed condition, this excited in him the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve of pity and benevolence to him. This I ſuppoſe is all that is meant by his loving him</q>
P. 82. What "the happy people who ſhall live in the laſt days" (to whom Mr. H. makes his appeal <note n="*" place="bottom">Pag. 54.</note>) may think of this gloſs, I ſhall not pretend to divine. Thoſe who
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:012416_0147_0F8974A7322F84D8"/>
live in theſe degenerare times, for what I can yet find, are very generally of opinion that it is neither juſt, nor even handſomely probable. I ſhall not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtop to object to it, but return to the point in hand, from which we had almoſt digreſſed.</p>
               <p>Whenever any external duty is enjoined in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without any limitation of the performance to qualified ſubjects, or involving the <hi>circumſtances</hi> of the external <hi>action</hi> into the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the <hi>duty</hi> (as is the caſe in baptiſm, the Lord's ſupper, &amp;c.) There is then a general obligation to perform the ſubſtance of the duty, though it ſhould be defective in it's cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. Thus external moral duties are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and in themſelves enjoined on all, whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate or not. Thus when the Iſraelites were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to keep the paſſover, it was their duty to do it, and in ſo doing
<q>they did as the Lord command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Moſes and Aaron.</q>
(Exod. xii. 28.) Though we have no reaſon to think that the body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple kept it in a holy manner. When Paul in his voyage to Italy exhorted thoſe who ſailed with him to take ſome meat, becauſe it would be for their health; though it was their duty in eating to aim ſincerely at the glory of God, which as unregenerate many of them were not in a next capacity to do; yet if any one ſhould ſay, that the apoſtle did not mean to invite any to eat while unregenerate, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that none of this character did any thing that he invited them to do, but directly contrary, when they took ſome meat; muſt we not conclude that ſuch a one had confounded himſelf, and the plain ſenſe of the ſcripture, with fooliſh ſubtilties? Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe would conclude, that what Paul invited them to do, and what the hiſtorian ſays they did, was no more nor leſs than the natural action of eating ſimply conſidered; an action which neither includes,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:012416_0148_0F8974A7F0DA06F8"/>
nor excludes the exerciſe of a holy principle; and that there is no more difficulty in ſuppoſing that ſuch kind of actions may be enjoined by God, for wiſe and good ends; than that they may lawfully be adviſed to by a good man. God has a right indeed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the doing of thoſe things, which without a ſpecial direction from him it would not be lawful for any man to order or adviſe. But who will imagine that men may lawfully adviſe to the doing of that, which would be inconſiſtent with the holineſs of God to require? But of this more in the next ſection. To ſum up the matter, when the apoſtle in this text exhorts to the practice of moral duties, and when in other parts of the new teſtament men are called to an attendance on the outward means of converſion, is the duty of all thoſe who hear the call of the goſpel to perform theſe duties as to the ſubſtance, whether they are in an immediate capacity to perform them in a holy manner or not. That is, it is their duty to do that which an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſinner is able to do; which was to be proved. And this is what is meant by thoſe who ſay that God requires both the performance and the goodneſs of the duty. Nor is the diſtinction here ſuggeſted, either "<hi>new</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="unknown:012416_0149_0F8974A8B60D5F30"/>It is a vain and groundleſs ſuggeſtion, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did not exhort to any thing as matter of duty which the unregenerate are able to perform. To correct this miſtake which has been too confidently maintained by ſome, was my principal deſign in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing this text. The apoſtles often inculcate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal duties which the unregenerate are able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form as to the ſubſtance of them. And ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts oblige the hearers of the goſpel in general to ſuch a performance of them as they are capable of, whether regenerate or not; and are to be indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately inculcated on all, to ſtir them up to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of obedience. We have a good warrant to limit the duties of profeſſion of faith and baptiſm, to qualified ſubjects. For it is plain from ſcripture that the belief of the heart ought always to accompany the confeſſion of the mouth, otherwiſe it ought not to be made. And ſays Philip to the Eunuch, propoſing to be baptized,
<q>If thou believeſt with all thine heart thou mayeſt.</q>
But what warrant have we from ſcripture to ſay to men, "If ye are regenerate and true believers, then ye may and ought to ſpeak the truth one to another, to be juſt in your dealings, to be temperate and chaſte in your behaviour, to read and hear God's word, and pray to him: Otherwiſe, and without theſe qualifications, theſe things are not your duty, nor required at your hands; and all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to do any of theſe things while unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, are as unwarrantable and preſumptuous, as for an infidel to receive the outward ſeals of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant." Let any precept or authentic precedent for ſuch a manner of preaching be produced, and it ſhall be attended to. In the mean time; we have a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to urge an attendance to the precepts of the goſpel, without foiſting in any limitations or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not contained in thoſe precepts. We have a
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:012416_0150_0F8974A9717CD6A8"/>
warrant to call upon ſinners to reform their vicious lives, and attend ſeriouſly the means of converſion without delay according to their preſent ability, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regenerate or not. We have a warrant to aſſert that the apoſtolic writings abound with exhortations to ſuch actions as the unregenerate are able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; to challenge ſome ſubſtantial evidence of thoſe who aſſert the contrary; <note n="*" place="bottom">pag. 130.</note> or elſe reject it as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary hypotheſis, how importunately ſoever they may <hi>beg</hi> to have it conceded to them. How much good ſuch exhortations have done, (which Mr. H. is quite ſure is but very little <note n="†" place="bottom">pag. 132.</note>) I enquire not at preſent.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Another argument may be taken from divers teſtimonies from the old teſtament, manifeſting God's approbation or favourable notice of the actions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified men, when for the ſubſtance conformable to his will; and his rewarding them with temporal bleſſings, becauſe or on account of them. Thus Jeremiah was ſent with this meſſage to the Jews, chap. 34.15. "Ye were now turned, and had done right in my ſight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour"; though they ſoon after fell from it. 2 Chron. 25.2, 3, 4. "Amaziah did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart." And particularly, in puniſhing his father's murderers, he "did as it is written in the law in the book of Moſes." And of his father Joaſh it is ſaid, chap. 24.2. that "he did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord all the days of Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da"; though afterward he fell to idolatry, and put to death the prieſt who reproved him for it. 2 Kin. 10.30. "The Lord ſaid unto Jehu, becauſe thou haſt done well, in executing that which was right in mine eyes,—thy children of the fourth generation ſhall ſit on the throne of Iſrael. But Jehu took no
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:012416_0151_0F8974AB0F162308"/>
heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Iſrael with all his heart." 2 Chron. 11.4. "Rehoboam, and the people obeyed the words of the Lord, and returned from going againſt Jeroboam." And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards when he and all Iſrael were puniſhed for forſaking the law of the Lord, yet when they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelves, "the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, ſaying, they have humbled themſelves, <hi>therefore</hi> I will not deſtroy them, but I will grant them ſome deliverance," chap. 12.7. Ahab's humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation was favourably noticed by God. "Becauſe he humbleth himſelf," (ſaith God) "I will not bring the evil in his days." 1 Kings 21.25—29. So was the repentance and reformation of the Ninevites. Jonah 3—10. "God ſaw their works, that they turned from their evil ways, and God repented of the evil that he ſaid he would do unto them, and he did it not." And this inſtance is mentioned by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as what would in the day of judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the impenitent Jews. Other inſtances there are which I ſtay not to collect.</p>
               <p>It appears from theſe paſſages that unregenerate ſinners have done that which was in ſome reſpect <hi>right in God's ſight:</hi> Of which he has <hi>expreſſed his approbation:</hi> Which was <hi>commanded in his law:</hi> Which he calls <hi>obeying his word: Becauſe,</hi> or on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, of which he has <hi>averted threatned judgments, ſuſpended puniſhments, granted temporal bleſſings</hi>; even ſuch bleſſings as imply the <hi>continuance of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual privileges.</hi> Now theſe things cannot be ſaid of any actions, which it was not the duty of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to do. And if the unregenerate have done what was their duty in any inſtances, there is ſtill a power in the unregenerate to do ſome things which are their duty: And converſely ſome things are their duty, for the doing of which they have a power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="unknown:012416_0152_0F8974ABB2D6F808"/>Mr. H. labours in the fire to defend himſelf againſt theſe plain teſtimonies, which ſpeak ſo fully and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly in oppoſition to his cauſe. If he could have ſubmitted his reaſonings to the wiſdom of God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſcriptures, "I ſuppoſe" (to ſpeak in borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed language) "that a great part of his performance would never have ſeen the light." P. 6.</p>
               <p>His exceptions aim at theſe two things. 1. To confute the ſuppoſition, that the perſons here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned did any thing of which God expreſſed his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, or took a favourable notice, or out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect thereto granted any bleſſings to the perſons. 2. Shew that conſiſtent with the denial of all theſe things, a natural and eaſy meaning may be put on theſe texts.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt part of his reply, we will firſt review the evidence which theſe texts give to the points by him objected to; and then examine his objections.</p>
               <p>The ſcriptures declare in expreſs words that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons allowed to be unregenerate, did that which was right in God's ſight: According as it is written in the divine law: That they obeyed the words of the Lord: And that temporal favours were promiſed and granted, <hi>becauſe</hi> of their doing theſe things. If then it be any <hi>expreſſion of approbation</hi> to tell a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he has done right and well, and promiſe temporal bleſſings <hi>becauſe</hi> of ſuch doings; if this imports taking any <hi>favourable notice</hi> of ſuch performances; and if beſtowing a favour <hi>becauſe</hi> a perſon has done right, be the ſame with rewarding it, or beſtowing a bleſſing on account of, or out of reſpect to ſuch a right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; then none can deny that the unregenerate have done what they were commanded to do, what God expreſly approved, took favourable notice of, and rewarded, unleſs a man will dare contradict the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Mr. H. has however ventured to do it with
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:012416_0153_0F8974AC71A10C30"/>
much confidence. And though I ſhall upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the ſcriptures hold theſe things for unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable facts, and have a right to repel every objection that reaſon may preſume to offer againſt them; yet let us hear what is objected.</p>
               <p>Says he,
<q>If God granted favours to Ahab and Jehu, and a great deliverance to the Ninevites, <hi>purely</hi> out of reſpect to their repentance and good deeds, while they were impenitent, &amp;c. then he may and does ſhew favour to ſinners out of reſpect to what they are in themſelves, their exerciſes and doings, and without any reſpect and relation to Chriſt the mediator. Therefore if there was no ſuch mediator, he might ſhew favours to ſinners, take a favourable notice of their doings, and expreſs, &amp;c. his approbation of them; and <hi>purely</hi> out of reſpect to this ſuſpend his puniſhments, and grant them pardon and ſalvation. For if he grants a leſs good—out of reſpect to their character and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, becauſe they have done well,—he may as well grant a greater good, even pardon of ſin and eternal ſalvation out of reſpect to this.—What need then—of a mediator in order to obtain— the favour of God!</q>
And thus he concludes,
<q>the whole goſpel is overthrown, and Chriſt is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as dying in vain.</q>
P. 73, 74.</p>
               <p>It is here to be obſerved, that Mr. H. to give his conſequences the better colour, has foiſted in the word [purely] into the antecedent, implying that his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt meant to aſſert,
<q>that God granted temporal favours to unregenerate men becauſe they had done well, without any reſpect to Chriſt's mediation.</q>
But I find no ſuch thing aſſerted or intimated by Mr. Mills, or my other differing from Mr. H. on the
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:012416_0154_0F8974AD38FF52E8"/>
point in diſpute.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Mills, againſt whom Mr. H. is diſputing, does indeed ſay that a great ſalvation was granted to the Ninevites out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their repentance. But who excert a wrangler, that ſeeks a knot in a bulruſh, will pretend or ſuſpect that any thing more is intended than if it had been ſaid, in the ſcriptural phraſe, that this favor was granted to them <hi>becauſe</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented.</note> If then we take away the word <hi>purely,</hi> which ought not to have been inſerted, the antecedent is in every part fully ſupported by ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Certain it is that
<q>God granted favors to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab and Jehu, and a great deliverance to the Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, becauſe of their repentance and good deeds,</q>
let men object as they pleaſe. That the diſpenſation of favors to the children of men is founded on Chriſt's mediation, we have not denied. What chriſtian then ſhall dare ſuggeſt, that if God has done that which his word abundantly aſſures us he has in fact done, then the goſpel is overthrown, and Chriſt has died in vain. If thoſe unſound conſequences drawn out by Mr. H. from the principle he oppoſes, depend intirely on the ſuppoſition that favours are granted to men <hi>purely</hi> becauſe they have done well, without any reſpect to the diſpenſation of grace; why has he been at all this pains to confute his own figment, and deſtroy a man of ſtraw of his own making? His artillery muſt be better aimed, if he means it ſhould do any execution.</p>
               <p>He muſt not (while he allows the truth of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) deny that God granted favours to Ahab and Jehu, and a great deliverance to the Ninevites, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever were the ground or reaſon of it. And he muſt ſay that theſe favours were granted either out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Chriſt's mediation, or they were not. Let him chuſe his alternative.</p>
               <p>If he ſhall ſay that God grants favours to ſinners through Chriſt's mediation, takes a favourable notice,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:012416_0155_0F8974ADF2F37500"/>
and expreſſes his approbation of their doings; and if this be not ſubverſive of the goſpel; then neither is our argument: Unleſs it be inconſiſtent to ſuppoſe that a favour may be granted to men becauſe of their doings, and alſo out of reſpect to Chriſt's mediation. But this cannot be ſaid, unleſs we will be ſo profane as to ſay, that facts expreſly recorded in the ſcriptures are ſubverſive of the goſpel. For that God ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the puniſhment of Ahab, and promiſed temporal bleſſings to Jehu, <hi>becauſe</hi> the one humbled himſelf, and the other did well in executing that which was right, the ſcriptures in expreſs words declare.</p>
               <p>If he ſhall ſay that theſe temporal favours, and theſe expreſſions of divine approbation, are not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of reſpect to Chriſt; then his argument will, if it prove any thing, convict himſelf of overthrowing the goſpel. It will condemn himſelf as much as he ſuppoſes that it condemns his opponents; unleſs he ſhould ſay, that it is inconſiſtent with the neceſſity of Chriſt's atonement to beſtow favours on ſinners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their doings, without any reſpect to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; but not ſo, to beſtow favours on ſinners, neither becauſe of their doings, nor out of reſpect to the mediator. But this ſurely cannot be pretended. Whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>her it be more agreable to divine wiſdom, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that he grants favours to ſinners without any reſpect to the mediator, to grant them alſo without any regard to their behaviour, I enquire not. The neceſſity of an atonement in order to the pardon of ſin is no more nor leſs taken away on the one ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition than on the other. Would it not be as good reaſoning as Mr. H's to argue as follows? "If God by an act of ſovereign goodneſs, without any regard either to the mediation of Chriſt, or the behaviour of the ſinner, may grant a leſs good, a leſs deliverance and ſalvation; he may as well, in mere ſovereign

bounty, grant a greater good, even the pardon of all ſin, and eternal ſalvation. He may as well remit the puniſhment of ſin forever without any atonement, or any outward reformation of the ſinner, as he can ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend puniſhment for the leaſt moment.

If he may ſuſpend the puniſhment of ſin for a time, he may do ſo forever; and ſo not puniſh ſin at all Dr. Twiſſe argued in this manner againſt the abſolute neceſſity of ſatisfaction for ſin, as a foundation for it's being forgiven. He concluded that a mitigation and ſuſpenſion of puniſhment muſt be allowed to be conſiſtent with juſtice; and ſo argued as Mr. H. has done, that on this ſuppoſition, juſtice does not abſolutely and neceſſarily require that ſin ſhould be puniſhed at all. The learned may find this argument anſwered, in Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s latin <hi>Diatribe de juſtitia divina,</hi> and in <hi>Turretine</hi>'s diſputations <hi>de neceſſitate ſatisfactionis Chriſti</hi>; who have ſhewn, that juſtice admits of a latitude and variety of diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the puniſhment of ſin: That various manners, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and degrees of puniſhing a ſin, are alike conſiſtent with juſtice; and conſequently, theſe things are determined not by juſtice, but by a wiſe and holy ſovereignty. If the author's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences are juſt, I ſee not but that the <hi>abſolute</hi> neceſſity of the atonement a priori muſt be given up; which I would how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be loth to call a ſubverſion of the goſpel, when I find ſuch great and good divines as Auguſtine, Calvin, Muſculus, Twiſſe, Voſſius, Goodwin, Norton, Stoddar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, Rutherford, &amp;c. did not hold to it. I ſuppoſe it will not be thought by any that Chriſt purchaſed a ſuſpenſion and mitigation of puniſhment for the devils. And yet it is certain that the full degree of puniſhment to which they are condemned is not at preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on them. They are reſerved in chains under dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, like priſoners, to the judgment of the great day; to which there is a plain reference in their beſeeching and adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Chriſt not to torment them <hi>before the time.</hi> Now if our author's argument be valid, we may as well argue in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner. If the puniſhment of the devils may be mitigated and ſuſpended for a time, without any atonement for their ſin; it may be mitigated to the utmoſt ſuppoſable degree, and for the longeſt ſuppoſable duration; conſequently the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin may be perfectly remitted, and that forever. What need is there then of an atonement, when the ſinner may have a full and everlaſting reprieve, equivalent to a pardon without it? The truth is, it belongs not to us to limit the prerogative of the Deity. And they who are ſo raſh as to pretend to do it by reaſonings <hi>a priori,</hi> will find that they meddle with things too high for them.</note>

                  <pb n="153" facs="unknown:012416_0157_0F8974AF73A21808"/>The objections to the plain ſenſe of theſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies being found of no weight, let us now conſider the "natural and eaſy meaning" of theſe texts, which Mr. H. thinks is not preſſed with the intolerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences above mentioned. The ſum is, "God in his conduct towards theſe perſons aforementioned, and in what he ſays of them, acts and ſpeaks not as the ſearcher of hearts, but has reſpect only to what was viſible, to their external appearance and conduct." P. 75.</p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. That ſenſe of theſe texts on which our argument is founded, being obnoxious to none of thoſe abſurdities with which he charges it, nor any other, for what yet appears; we have a right to call for direct and poſitive ſcripture evidence of this hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, before we receive it. Of this, according to my beſt obſervation, his book affords nothing. Nor has he told us how it could properly be ſaid of any one, without any reſpect to his heart, that his <hi>heart</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="unknown:012416_0158_0F8974B0308FA400"/>
was or was not perfect, upright, &amp;c. when his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was externally right.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This hypotheſis affords no relief againſt any of thoſe abſurdities with which he ſuppoſes our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of theſe texts to be preſſed. The very ſame objections lie equally againſt the <hi>principle</hi> on which he proceeds in his expoſition. For I aſk, how is it, according to Mr. H's reaſoning, conſiſtent with the divine purity, and the neceſſity of an atonement for ſin, for God to ſpeak of, and conduct towards men, as if their character and behaviour was right and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him; having reſpect only to their exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conduct, without ſearching their hearts. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine conduct herein is either on account of Chriſt's mediation, or it is not. If not, then in caſe there had been no mediator or atonement, God might have ſpoken of, and conducted towards ſinners, as if their actions were right in his ſight. He might have taken a favourable notice of their external ſhews of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and reformation. He might have expreſſed his approbation of them as right in his ſight. He might have averted temporal judgments, ſuſpended puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, promiſed and granted temporal bleſſings, <hi>purely</hi> becauſe of, or out of reſpect to mens viſible character, without acting as the ſearcher of hearts. Not only ſo, but he might, without ſearching mens hearts, have forgiven their ſins, promiſed and beſtowed eternal life, having reſpect only to their outward behaviour. And thus there would be no neceſſity of Chriſt's dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to purchaſe theſe bleſſings for us, which might all be conferred by God on ſinners, acting herein not as the ſearcher of hearts, but having reſpect only to what is viſible, to their external conduct and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p>But if it be ſaid, that it is only on account of Chriſt's mediation that God can conſiſtently with his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:012416_0159_0F8974B1C29EBB08"/>
ſpeak of, and conduct towards ſinners as if they were truly penitent, and had done what was right in his ſight; promiſing and beſtowing tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bleſſings, not as the ſearcher of hearts, but having reſpect only to their external conduct; then we may on this principle as well vindicate our doctrine from his objections, as he can his own hypotheſis againſt the ſame objections, which lie full as ſtrong againſt it.</p>
               <p>Plainly then, when he will tell us how it can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with the divine purity to ſpeak of, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards ſinners, not as the ſearcher of hearts, but merely according to their viſible behaviour; and clear his own hypotheſis from the conſequences he draws from the doctrine he oppoſes; then I ſuppoſe that a man of his diſcernment, or even half an eye, will eaſily ſee that the doctrine he oppoſes may in the ſame way be as well vindicated. Methinks it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what odd, firſt to deny and diſpute againſt <hi>the fact,</hi> viz. that "God expreſſes his approbation of ſome actions of ſinners, and grants temporal rewards to them becauſe of ſuch actions," and then immediately ſuppoſe the ſame fact, and introduce a ſcheme to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it, or ſhew it to be conſiſtent with the divine perfections, and the truth of the goſpel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Allowing our author's interpretation, I would gladly be informed, why it may not be ſuppoſed that the divine being may as well act the part of a legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor as of a judge, not as the ſearcher of hearts, but having reſpect to mens outward behaviour? In other words, why may he not make laws which reſpect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the outward actions of men, as well as give judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and execute laws, only according to mens out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and viſible conduct? Is it not natural to think that the execution of laws ought to correſpond with the meaning of them, and of the legiſlator in them? That promiſes would not be fulfilled on a condition
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:012416_0160_0F8974B2CE267F60"/>
intirely diverſe from, and even contrary to that which is annexed to them? That a bleſſing promiſed to the performance of ſome duty, or act of obedience, would not be given by a righteous judge to an action im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying no duty, or obedience, or any part of it, but the very reverſe in a high degree? Does it any more imply God's giving up his right to holy obedience from his creatures, for him to require them to do ſomething, which in itſelf does not contain whatever is eſſential to true holineſs, than it does to declare his approbation of ſuch an action when done, and beſtow bleſſings on the doer <hi>becauſe</hi> of it? We may have occaſion before we have done to remind ourſelves of theſe things. <note n="*" place="bottom">That there may be no ground to ſuggeſt, that our author's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign has been miſrepreſented, the reader is to obſerve, that the argument of Mr. Mills from theſe paſſages is deſigned to prove that the awakened and reformed ſinner is leſs guilty in the ſight of God than the ſtupid profligate. Which is a diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rent point from that which is the ſubject of our preſent debate, viz. that ſome actions of the unregenerate are commanded duties. Mr. H. denies both: And though his direct deſign be to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer Mr. Mills's argument, yet he has ſhaped ſuch an anſwer as, if it concludes any thing to his purpoſe, will conclude equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt both theſe points; and indeed more directly againſt the latter than the former. For he contends, that if God has expreſſed his approbation and favorable notice of any actions of the unregenerate, promiſed and granted temporal bleſſings (purely) becauſe of them, then Chriſt is dead in vain. It was therefore neceſſary for us to conſider this argument, ſo far as it is pointed againſt ours. And accordingly I have endeavoured to ſhew that his exceptions are either impertinent, if they lie only againſt the word <hi>purely</hi> which himſelf has added, or if they lie againſt the facts as we have ſtated them, then the ſcriptures and his own principles are equally obnoxious to his own objections. It is the principle on which both arguments are founded that he objects to, and I defend. But indeed the diſpenſing of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral bleſſings, according to the <hi>real</hi> characters of men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with one another, as viewed by the ſearcher of hearts; and becauſe of their being comparatively better, is no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the neceſſity of an atonement, than diſpenſing the ſame bleſſings according to their viſible character, and becauſe they have in ſome inſtances behaved aright. I am far from thinking that men are in this world treated according to their real comparative character, or indeed always according to their external conduct. But if it were ſuppoſed, it could not be ſhewn to be inconſiſtent with the divine puri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="157" facs="unknown:012416_0161_0F8974B332BE18D8"/>On the whole, when the ſcriptures declare any act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions to be <hi>good</hi> and <hi>right, according to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord,</hi> and that the doers are rewarded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of them, this is as ſure an evidence that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof was their duty, as the requirement of them would be. This the ſcriptures declare of ſome actions of the unregenerate, which muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be concluded to be duties.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. The next argument is founded on a principle expreſly acknowledged by the author, as well as the generality of profeſſed chriſtians: <hi>That God has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged unregenerate ſinners to attend the means of grace.</hi> It will here be neceſſary to ſhew what is meant by encouragement; the rather becauſe it is ſaid the word is ambiguous, which has miſled many in their reaſonings on it. <note n="*" place="bottom">pag. 137.</note> But I have not obſerved ſuch an ambiguity as is here pretended. Encouragement I think properly ſignifies <hi>a ground or reaſon of hope.</hi> It may be uſed metonymically for the effects and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts of encouragement in the proper ſenſe. If a ſick man ſees reaſon of hope that he ſhall recover, he has then encouragement reſpecting his recovery. If any one has ground to hope his endeavours will be for his advantage, he has then encouragement to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.</p>
               <p>Commands, exhortations, invitations, &amp;c. may be reaſons and inducements to obedience, but ſimply conſidered they are not encouragements. When they are enforced with a proſpect of good to be obtained
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:012416_0162_0F8974B3F520A5A0"/>
by a compliance with them, there is then an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement or ground of hope annexed to them. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are encouragements: But there may be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements which are not promiſes: There may be other reaſons of hope. A divine promiſe is a ground of ſure hope: But if there be only a probable reaſon to hope for ſome good, there is then a lower encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. There are ſome encouragements for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to hope for ſalvation which are not connected with any of their endeavours; ſuch as the divine goodneſs, the al-ſufficient atonement, the abſolute promiſes of mercy. There are other encouragements or reaſons of hope to ſinners, if they attend on the means of grace; that is, the greater probability of obtaining ſalvation in this way. It is on theſe our argument is grounded.</p>
               <p>This may ſuffice to ſhew what we mean by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. It is ſimply a reaſon of hope. The other ſenſe mentioned by our author <note n="*" place="bottom">pag 137.</note> ſeems to be a miſtake. Exhortations are often enforced with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements. But exhortations are properly as diſtinct from annexed encouragements, as commands are from annexed reaſons. Be this as it may, it is in this ſenſe we ſay, and he acknowledges, that God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages the unregenerate to attend on the means of grace. "Sometimes," ſays he,
<q>encouragement means that which gives a hope and proſpect of ſucceſs in any buſineſs and purſuit.—In this ſenſe God encourages ſinners, let their hearts be as ſinful and oppoſite to him as they will, to attend the means of grace.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">ibid.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The manner in which God encourages human en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours is various. Sometimes by promiſing ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; ſometimes by ſignifying in his word that there is ſome probability our labour may not be in vain.
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:012416_0163_0F8974B4B5085310"/>
Thus the apoſtle encourages miniſters to inſtruct oppoſers in meekneſs, if peradventure God will give them repentance. <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. 2.25</note> And God having commanded Jeremiah to write the words he had ſpoken, adds this encouragement to the command.
<q>It may be that the houſe of Judah will hear all the evil that I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to do to them, that they may return every man from his evil way, that I may forgive their iniquity.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Jer. 36.3.</note> And there are exhortations to refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which ſeem to be enforced with this lower degree of encouragement. Daniel exhorted king Nebuchadnezzar to break off his ſins by righteouſneſs, and his iniquity by ſhewing mercy to the poor, if it might be a lengthening out of his tranquility. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Dan. 4 27.</note> This form of exhortation is not unfrequent in ſcripture. The words of Peter to Simon of Samaria are perhaps a parallel inſtance to that laſt quoted. "Repent of this thy wickedneſs, and pray to God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee." <note n="§" place="bottom">Acts 8.22.</note> God alſo encourages human endeavours <hi>by examples of ſucceſs</hi> recorded in his word. The proficiency David made in ſpiritual knowledge by ſtudying God's word is an encouragement to us to do as he did. The ſame is ſuggeſted from the happy fruits of the Bereans ſearching the ſcriptures daily. The numerous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples recorded in ſcripture of ſinners converted, and ſaints edified by the preaching of the goſpel, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage an attendance to this ordinance. The inſtances of God's hearing the prayer of ſaints and ſinners are a general encouragement to this duty. The mercy of God to ſinners on their humbling themſelves, and forſaking their evil courſes, is an encouragement to repentance and reformation. Again God encourages our endeavours <hi>when he ſhews us by our own obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they are commonly ſucceſsful:</hi> And finally
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:012416_0164_0F8974B5721AC070"/>
                  <hi>when according to the laws of nature they operate as cauſes or means of advantage to us.</hi> Thus men are encouraged to apply themſelves diligently to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of their lawful calling, becauſe ſuch endeavours are naturally conducive to the end at which they aim.</p>
               <p>But is ſeems to be a matter of no great importance in what manner God gives us a ground of hope that our endeavours will probably be of advantage to us. If the encouragement be real, and not a fond pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, it is a juſt reaſon of action laid before us by God, to excite us to it. If we have good evidence that a particular action is our duty, it matters not how we obtained it, whether by the natural light and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our own minds, or by ſupernatural inſtruction We are by the authority of God bound to do it. So if we have a juſt ground of hope that our doing a particular action will be to our real good, this encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement is a juſt reaſon for acting propoſed to us by God, to prompt us thereto, in whatever way it is propoſed to us.</p>
               <p>I now proceed to ſhew, how it appears from God's encouraging men unregenerate to attend the means of grace, that this is their duty. God never encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged any one to do that which was not his duty. He never prompts men to do that which ought not to be done, and which is indeed nothing but ſin, by giving them a juſt and real ground of hope that it will be to their everlaſting benefit. This we are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted to aſſert, not only from the holineſs of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but from the plain words of St. James. "Let no man ſay when he is tempted I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted of evil, neither tempteth he any man." <note n="*" place="bottom">Jam. 1.13.</note> There are two ſenſes in which men are ſaid to be tempted. 1. For the trial or diſcovery of what is in their hearts, whether they
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:012416_0165_0F8974B6339DB308"/>
will abide ſtedfaſt in the practice of duty, when it will expoſe them to trouble, and interferes with their worldly intereſts and enjoyments; or whether they will refrain from ſin, when there is a proſpect of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding the troubles of this life, and obtaining tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good things by the commiſſion of it. In this ſenſe God is ſaid to tempt or prove men; by putting them in ſuch circumſtances, that the practice of their duty ſhall coſt them much ſelf-denial, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of worldly riches honours and pleaſures, ſhall be apparently on the ſide of ſin; and by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſatan and wicked men to repreſent theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements in a ſtrong light to the mind, to intice and deceive it into a compliance, or otherwiſe ſuggeſt ſuch thoughts as tend to ſin. All this may eaſily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the divine purity; ſince there is no real encouragement given, no juſt ground of hope, that a conſent to the temptation will be of advantage to us in the end. The command of God, with the high ſanctions enforcing obedience, are motives infinitely ſtronger in themſelves, than can ever be urged in any temptation. 2. There is another ſenſe in which men are ſaid to be tempted, viz. when inducements or motives to ſin are ſet before them on purpoſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them to it. Whoever thus tempts any one, really aims to perſuade him to a compliance, and not to prove his integrity. Such a one will accordingly endeavour to propoſe ſuch inducements as will be moſt likely to prevail, and effect the deſign he has in view. In this ſenſe we are tempted by ſatan and wicked men; but let no man ſay or think in his heart that he is thus tempted to ſin by the holy God. He may put it to our choice whether we will chuſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction with the people of God, rather than enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon: But at the ſame time he propoſes a recompence of reward, to encourage us to
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:012416_0166_0F8974B6F226A368"/>
a firm adherence to our duty; and lets us know that bitterneſs and poiſon are mingled in the cup that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licits our appetite. If God gives men a real and juſt reaſon to hope that their attending the means of grace will be for their everlaſting advantage; it
<q>he has ſo ordered things that this is the moſt likely way to eſcape the greateſt evil, and be happy forever,</q>
and he "lets men know" it, as our author owns; <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 137.</note> then either what God encourages them to do is their duty, or what they ought to do; or elſe he lays before them I m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt powerful inducement to ſin: And that not to prove their integrity, but to perſuade them to do that which is in itſelf mere ſin. Mr. H. muſt on his own principle own that God encourages the unregenerate to ſin: That he lets them know that their doing what they ought not to do will probably be for their eternal intereſt; that ſo men might have a juſt and real (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot a deceitful) reaſon of hope to move them to the commiſſion of it. But muſt we not then ſay that this would be tempting men to evil? Laying before them ſo ſtrong an inducement, as muſt and will prevail it duly apprehended and weighed? And to give the greater efficacy to the inducement, or ſhall I call it temptation, the operation of the holy Spirit goes with it, to ſet it home on the heart. Theſe things ſeem almoſt too ſhocking to be mentioned. May any chriſtian admit the ſuppoſition, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine being has ſo ordered and conſtituted things, that any one ſhould have <hi>a reaſonable inducement, a real encouragement</hi> to an action, the doing of which is not his duty but utterly and totally ſinful? God forbid. If he has ſo ordered things that an attendance on the means of grace is the moſt likely way to eſcape eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miſery and be happy forever; and if he has let ſinners know it; this is as certain evidence that an
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:012416_0167_0F8974B7B05D39C0"/>
attendance on the means of grace is their duty, as the ſanctions annexed to a divine command are that it is our duty to obey it.</p>
               <p>This argument from encouragements Mr. H. ſeems rather to deſpiſe, then endeavour directly to confute. Some things however <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e has ſaid, which he thinks, if conſidered, muſt convince any one that "God may and does encourage his creatures to that in doing which they are utterly ſinful." P 138. This may be taken in two ſenſes. If he means, that the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate are ſinners for not doing w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to in a holy manner; and that the action in the compound ſenſe is unholy or ſinful, as being defective in principle and end; this is nothing to the purpoſe of anſwering our argument. We allow and contend for all this. But we ſay, that when God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages the performance in itſelf, or in the divided ſenſe, he does not encourage the ſinfulneſs of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, or the ſinful defects or irregular circumſtances cleaving to the performance. Theſe have no ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to his advantage. It is the ſubſtance of the duty that is the means of good. It is this that God encourages to; and to this ſinners ought to attend. It he means, that God encourages men to ſuch actions <hi>the doing of which is ſinful</hi>; (which it is incumbent on him to prove if he would anſwer our argument) I can ſee nothing, though I have conſidered what he has ſaid, that makes this appear in the leaſt probable. That the reader may judge for himſelf, I will lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in our author's words the ſubſtance of his reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>To encourage a perſon to any particular way of conduct is to let him know that this is the moſt hopeful way to miſs of the evil he dreads, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what he ſets up as the object of his purſuit, be that what it will.—In this ſenſe God encourages
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:012416_0168_0F8974B94F002238"/>
men, let their hearts be as ſinful and oppoſite to him as they will, to attend on the means of grace. He has ſo ordered things, that this is the moſt likely way to eſcape the greateſt evil, and be happy forever. So that when they come to view things in any meaſure as they are, and are above all things afraid of eternal deſtruction, and deſirous of future happineſs, they will be induced from a principle of ſelf love or ſelfiſhneſs even that very principle that ſets their hearts againſt God, and leads them into all the wickedneſs they practiſe, with great care and anxiety to attend on theſe means. The whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement as laid before them lies in it's being the moſt hopeful way to promote their intereſt, and anſwer the end which they are purſuing.</q>
P. 137.</p>
               <p>Here indeed ſomething is aſſerted; but how it weakens our argument, or proves that men are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to that the doing of which is ſin, I do not ſee: Unleſs the meaning be, "that God lets men know that attending the means of grace will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſecure their happineſs, at the expence of his own glory, and the intereſt of the univerſe:" Which how wild and extravagant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>les that ſelfiſhneſs is the only principle of action in the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate: That this principle is in it's own nature enmity to being in general: That it is directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to benevolence: That the end it propoſes is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the intereſt of being in general: That the unregenerate have no conception or deſire of true happineſs. Theſe things he inculcates abundantly. Now if we compare theſe things with what he has ſaid about God's encouraging an attendance on means, this muſt appear to be the ſum of his doctrine, "Though the end which unregenerate ſinners aim at be directly oppoſite to the intereſt of being in general;
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:012416_0169_0F8974BA41D63318"/>
though the object they are purſuing be not true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or ſalvation; yet God has ſo ordered things, that he lets them know that there is encouragement, or ground of hope, that by attending the means of grace they may obtain what they ſet up as the object of their purſuit; however oppoſite to his own glory, to the good of being in general, and their own true happineſs. Though they are aiming at the worſt end which can poſſibly be imagined; and acting from a principle directly oppoſite to benevolence, yet when they come to ſee things in any meaſure as they are, they find <hi>a real ground of hope,</hi> that by attending on the means of grace they ſhall carry their point. And this view of the caſe being exactly ſuited to touch and work upon their enmity againſt God and being in general, which is the only principle of action they have, whereby they can in their preſent ſtate be prompted to do any thing, hence they are moved with care and anxiety to attend on means." If this be the truth of the matter I own our argument muſt fall, but if it does it will carry away with it that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolic maxim on which it is grounded, and even the pillars of revealed and natural religion, leaving us afloat in the diſmal abyſs of manicheiſm or atheiſm.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. That it is the duty of the unregenerate to attend the means of grace will further appear, if we conſider the ends for which the ordinances of the goſpel were inſtituted, and it's precepts reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, and enjoined on, the children of men. This important argument I will endeavour to open diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the order following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Duties are enjoined in the word of God in order to ſome end beſides or beyond the bare performance of the actions required. They are required not barely as debts or duties, but as means deſigned, and fitted to ſubſerve the ends and purpoſes of divine wiſdom
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:012416_0170_0F8974BAB241FB68"/>
and goodneſs. This is eſpecially evident with reſpect to the means of grace. Thus an attendance to the word of God is enjoined, as the means of obtaining divine knowledge, faith, converſion, ſanctification, conſolation and the like: Conſideration is enjoined, as a means of eſcaping deſtruction: Prayer, as the means of obtaining needed bleſſings temporal and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual: Striving, as the means of obtaining an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the ſtrait gate: Seeking the Lord, as the means of finding him: Labouring for the mean which endureth to everlaſting life, as the means of obtaining it. In this reſpect the precepts of divine revelation, founded on the diſpenſation of grace, differ from the injunctions of the law of nature. This requires duties merely as right, or becauſe due. That requires them in order to certain ends, which the wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God has connected with them, and deſigns by means of them to accompliſh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such an attendance to duties, as unregenerate ſinners are capable of, may and does anſwer ſome of thoſe ends, for which theſe duties were enjoined in the word of God. God had various ends in view in the inſtitution of religious ordinances, and giving out his commands to mankind; ſome of which reſpect believers alone, ſome reſpect thoſe who are to be regenerated and effectually called, and ſome the world of mankind in general. By means of theſe precepts he deſigned to reſtrain the outbreakings of wickedneſs in the unregenerate; to direct and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence them to the practice of thoſe virtues, whereby they might be uſeful to others in the world, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thoſe temporal comforts and advantages which he is willing they ſhould here enjoy. And he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eſpecially that thoſe who are in due time to be effectually called, who by nature are equally depraved with the reſt of the world, might, while in their unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate

ſtate, be in ſome meaſure reſtrained from the full indulgence of their luſts. When they are ready to ruſh into ſuch courſes, as without a miraculous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition would undo them, and caſt them out of the reach of divine mercy, in the ordinary ways in which God is pleaſed to exerciſe it; then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand meets their conſcience like a flaming ſword, and turns their courſe. In this manner they are in ſome ſort bound to their good behaviour, and kept within reach of thoſe means, by which they are at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from darkneſs to light, and from the power of ſatan to God. And by thus bearing God's yoke, though with the ſpirit of bondage, they are in ſome manner trained to it, and fitted to walk and work in it the better when they receive the ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <note n="*" place="bottom">This uſe of the divine commands, is well repreſented by the great Calvin, as follows.

For he ſhews that it is a reſtraint on the triumphant luſts of the fleſh, which would otherwiſe run at large beyond meaſure. Some have need of a curb to hold them in, that they may not ſo give the reins to their carnal wantonneſs as utterly to caſt off all regard to righteouſneſs.

Thoſe therefore whom he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to inherit his kingdom, if he doth not immediately regenerate, he keeps unto the time of his viſitation by means of the law under fear; not indeed that holy and pure fear which ought to be in his children, but ſuch as is uſeful to this purpoſe, that they may be trained up to true piety, according to their preſent capacity: For whoever have lived any time in ignorance of God, will confeſs that this has happened to them, that by the curb of the law they might be held in ſome kind of fear and obedience to God, till being regenerate by the ſpirit they might begin to love him.</q>

                  <pb n="168" facs="unknown:012416_0172_0F8974BC32887660"/>To prepare thoſe for regeneration who are in due time to be the ſubjects of this grace, to keep them in a diligent attendance to thoſe means whereby God is wont to ingenerate faith and repentance in the hearts of his elect, is one end for which an attendance on theſe means is preſcribed to the hearers of the goſpel. They are therefore commanded to ſearch the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: To hear the preached word: To pray for the pardon of ſin; and for the holy Spirit, for all thoſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes (I ſuppoſe) for which he is ordinarily beſtowed; one of which is to be the efficient principle of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and converſion: To ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate: To conſider the iſſue of impenitent wickedneſs, leſt God fear them in pieces: To labour not for the meat which periſheth, but for that meat which endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to everlaſting life. By theſe and ſuch like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which God has in his word directed to the hearers of the goſpel in general, without limiting them to qualified ſubjects, he impreſſes their conſciences with a conviction, that an attendance to theſe means
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:012416_0173_0F8974BCF287F578"/>
is their preſent duty, whether they are regenerate or not; and that a neglect of ſuch attendance, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their preſent light and ability, will be an act of high diſobedience and contempt of God, and moſt dangerous to their own ſouls; ſo that they dare not live in the neglect of theſe means. And when they are tempted to caſt off fear, and return to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer courſes; they are bridled and kept back by theſe commands, and influenced, notwithſtanding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctances of their vain inclinations, to continue in the uſe of the common means of converſion.</p>
               <p>All who maintain that there is ordinarily a work of illumination and conviction, preparatory to regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, hold that this is wrought in the ſoul, in and by a ſerious attendance to the means of grace. It is alſo by attending to theſe means that the firſt acts of ſpiritual life are drawn and put forth. The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the goſpel were deſigned to awaken hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and prepare men for the grace of regeneration; to be inſtrumental of working faith in them, whereby they we firſt ſavingly united to Chriſt. Now that attendance on means whereby men are prepared for regeneration, muſt of neceſſity be previous to it. That attendance whereby faith is firſt obtained, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an act of acceptable obedience, according to the new covenant; ſince faith is implied in every act of goſpel holineſs. Such an attendance on means then as goes before regeneration and converſion, may and does anſwer an important end for which the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the goſpel were inſtituted.</p>
               <p>That theſe commands, enjoining on the hearers of the goſpel an attendance on the means of grace, were given to excite the unregenerate as well as others to ſerious endeavours of obedience, may be argued from God's making uſe of theſe commands to keep them waiting on him in the way of his bleſſing. For
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:012416_0174_0F8974BDB6C871D0"/>
if there be any weight in the common argument from final cauſes, we may juſtly argue that theſe commands were given with a deſign to anſwer all theſe wiſe and good ends, to which they appear ſo well adapted, and to which daily experience ſhews that they are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily applied. Therefore,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Since ſuch obedience to theſe commands as the unregenerate are capable of yielding, anſwers ſome of thoſe ends for which theſe commands were given; it appears that ſuch obedience is enjoined in and by them. For a command has no power or tendency to influence the conduct of men, otherwiſe than by binding them to ſuch a behaviour on their peril. It is no otherwiſe fitted to reſtrain the wickedneſs of ſinners, and prompt them to a laudable and uſeful behaviour, than by forbidding the one, and enjoining the other. It is a conviction of duty imprinted on the conſcience by the command, and of the danger of going preſumptuouſly contrary to it, that binds men to their good behaviour. It was then one deſign of God's promulging thoſe precepts which have been mentioned, to impreſs the hearers of the goſpel in general with a conviction that it is their duty to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to them, according to their preſent ability; and by this conviction to put the unregenerate as well as others upon endeavours of reformation, and an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on the means of converſion, as has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. We muſt therefore either ſay that theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands require ſuch endeavours of obedience in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, as they were deſigned by God to produce; or elſe we muſt ſay that God in giving theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands deſigned that they ſhould be inſtrumental unto the reformation of mens lives, and to excite and keep them in an attendance to the means of grace, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing a falſe and deceitful conviction of duty on the conſciences of the unregenerate. But ſince it is
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:012416_0175_0F8974BE864C78F8"/>
ſo neceſſary on various accounts that men ſhould think it to be their duty to reform their lives, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the means of converſion, though unregenerate; and without ſuch a conviction ſome of the wiſe and good ends of God's giving men th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe commands cannot be anſwered by them: Why on my ſeek to perſuade unregenerate ſinners that theſe things are not their duty, and ſo as much as in them lies fruſtrate God's wiſe and good deſigns? If any imagine themſelves to have found that theſe deſigns of divine goodneſs and wiſdom are ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed on by deluſion, I ſhould think they had acted more adviſedly to have kept ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries to themſelves.</p>
               <p>I do not find that our author has directly attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to anſwer this argument from the end of God's preſcribing duties to the unregenerate, ſomething how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I find capable of being framed into an objection; which is therefore to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, that ſuppoſing the command or God required an attendance on means previous and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory to regeneration,
<q>and the ſinner ſhould be urged hereto from this conſideration, it would not have the leaſt influence upon him, or be any motive to him to comply. He is by the ſuppoſition only ſeeking his own intereſt, and cares nothing about God or duty to him, in themſelves conſidered, or for their own ſakes.</q>
P. 149. Therefore it ſeems it would be in vain for God to make uſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, to influence the conduct of ſuch perſons.</p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. The commands of God carry other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of obedience with them, beſides the will and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the great legiſlator. They are inforced with moſt important ſanctions, which were deſigned to have their influence into the conduct of men. Our author ſays that "the authority of a law lies wholly in the threatning." This indeed is a grievous miſtake.
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:012416_0176_0F8974C01B260ED8"/>
Yet on the other hand it muſt be owned, that the threatning is one reaſonable inducement to comply with it's requirement. Men often ſubmit to the will of the higher powers, for wrath, as well as for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake. A ſervant will obey his maſter's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands if he fears the effects of his diſpleaſure though he may not love him, or have any regard to his will conſidered ſimply in itſelf. The commands God gave to the Iſraelites had an influence on the behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of thoſe whoſe hearts were not right with him. As ſoon as men know that they are commanded to do any particular actions, they may know that it is not ſafe for them to diſobey. Is it not ſtrange that men ſhould at one time ſay (in effect) that the threatning is the only thing that binds men to obey the laws of God; and at another time, that the command of God can have no influence on thoſe who are moved only by it's ſanctions? It is not in vain to preſs the commands of God on ſinners, to move them to a compliance with their duty, if any thing eſſential to the commands (as the ſanctions are allowed to be) tends to move them to a compliance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It will be impoſſible to convince thoſe, who view things in any meaſure as they are, that ſuch a conduct as is not their duty has any probable tendency to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their final intereſt. It would be a moſt irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar conſtitution of things, unſuitable to the wiſdom and holineſs of God, if that which was directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to duty, the doing of which was mere ſin, ſhould have ſuch a direct tendency to promote a man's final and eternal intereſt, as that he ſhould have a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able encouragement to do it. I know ſin may be overruled for good; but I deny that the word or providence of God holds forth any encouragement to do what is ſimply evil, that good may come to the evil doer. However then ſinners may diſregard the
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:012416_0177_0F8974C0B6D9B7B0"/>
conſideration that ſuch a conduct is their duty, yet it will be impoſſible for us on good grounds to perſuade them, that it will probably be conducive to their final good, unleſs we can aſſure them that it is agreable to their duty. Otherwiſe this doctrine muſt be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, viz. That "ſin is through the divine interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition an advantage to the ſinner, AND THIS IS AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO IT." Mr. H. <hi>in his great wiſdom</hi> (to compliment him again in his own ſtile <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 150.</note>) <hi>has deviſed</hi> this <hi>method of treating with ſinners,</hi> to encourage them to attend on means, though it be not their duty, and though their doing ſo is mere ſin, by <hi>perſuading</hi> them that this will be for their final intereſt. <hi>In this he is guilty of the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of ſuppoſing</hi> that a man may have juſt reaſon to think it will be for his final advantage to do that, the doing of which is ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is in human nature a moral ſenſe, which perceives the fitneſs and beauty of a creature's being obedient to the commands of it's creator and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſovereign. There is ſuch a ſenſe of duty imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on mens conſciences, from a natural view of the excellency greatneſs and majeſty of God, as diſpoſes them to ſome kind of obedience to his will, though deſtitute of a ſpiritual diſcernment and taſte. It is therefore Mr. H's ſuppoſition, not ours, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate act merely from ſelf-love. But this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has been before conſidered.</p>
               <p>Corollary. When a divine precept enjoins any human performances or endeavours as means in order to ſome further end, ſuch a manner of performance as is adapted to ſubſerve the end propoſed is thereby enjoined, however ſhort it may fall of what we are in duty obliged to. It is certain that ſuch doings as are very defective and worthleſs conſidered as duties,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:012416_0178_0F8974C171C8FEC0"/>
may be uſeful and important conſidered as means. The deſign and direct meaning of ſuch commands as require the uſe of means, is rather to be determined from a due conſideration of the ends to which ſuch means have relation, and what a manner of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance is fit to anſwer ſuch ends, than from conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is the whole of our duty in this matter, and in what manner we muſt behave, in order to anſwer fully our obligations. Such a manner of attending means as is ſufficient for thoſe ends for which they are principally enjoined, may not be ſufficient to acquit us, as having fully diſcharged our duty. When God commanded the Iſraelites to go forward when the Egyptians had purſued them to the red ſea, his direct deſign was to preſcribe a means of their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the enemy. And when we conſider the end for which he ſo commanded them, we muſt conclude the meaning was, that they ſhould go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward according to their preſent ability, though he knew that they were a rebellious generation. And though they would not obey in the manner they ought, unleſs they did it in the exerciſe of perfect love to and truſt in God; yet they might obey in ſuch a manner as to anſwer the end for which they were ordered to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, without any exerciſes of holy truſt or love. And we may truly ſay, as the ſcriptures do in like caſes, that they did as the Lord commanded them; they did what was their duty, and what they were required to do, according to the true meaning; at the ſame time that they did not act from ſuch holy principles, and for ſuch holy ends as they ought to have done. So when Chriſt commanded the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes to ſit down that he might feed them, we juſtly conclude from the end for which he ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>dered them, that his meaning was that they ſhould put themſelves in a convenient order to have food diſtributed among
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:012416_0179_0F8974C231FE9968"/>
them, whether they truly believed on him or not. And when they ſat down, though many of them no doubt in unbelief, they obeyed his orders in their true meaning; and the direct end of his ſo ordering them was anſwered, though they did not do all that was their duty. So when believers are commanded to ſhew forth their faith by their works, to give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to make their calling and election ſure, to work out their ſalvation, we juſtly conclude, that theſe precepts require ſuch ſincere though imperfect endeavours of obedience as they are capable of in this life. For ſuch endeavours are well fitted to anſwer the ends for which they are required, though they are never conducted in all reſpects as they ought to be. And in like manner the endeavours of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate in attending on means, are adapted to anſwer the ends for which they are required ſo to do. And the true and primary meaning of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands which preſcribe the uſe of ſuch means to them, is to be eſtimated from the ends for which ſuch an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance is preſcribed: And it muſt be concluded ſuch a manner of attendance as is conducive to ſuch ends is required, how far ſhort ſoever it may be of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their whole duty. If nothing ſhort of a full and perfect diſcharge of duty were preſcribed as the means of obtaining ſpiritual or temporal bleſſings, ſuch means would be ſo high above the reach of man in his depraved ſtate, that he never could hope for any advantage from endeavours to uſe them, though it be his own fault that he does not perfectly fulfil his duty.</p>
               <p>But for the further illuſtration and vindication of this argument, and of the evidence it gives to the point in hand, ſome ſcripture precepts which we have had occaſion to mention muſt be further attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to.</p>

                     <p>This may be of weight againſt our making uſe of this text in the preſent diſpute; but it will not really weaken our argument, which way ſoever it may be underſtood; ſince there are other texts not liable to this exception, as full to our purpoſe as this is according to the Engliſh tranſlation.

                     <p>It is true the word (ereunate) is the ſame in the indicative and imperative mood Yet I think as much and more may be ſaid in favour of our Engliſh tranſlation, than for the other reading. Mr. H. mentions the next following words as favouring the ſenſe by him propoſed. The reader muſt judge for himſelf. I cannot ſee much if any thing in it. He ſays further, that moſt of the noted critics tranſlate it indicatively, and refers us to Pool as an evidence. But Pool ſays no ſuch thing. He quotes four or five that have ſo rendred it. And he quotes as many who have rendred it imperatively. And I ſuppoſe, from what I have obſerved, that the greater part of modern expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and divines take it in the ſame ſenſe. It is well known to thoſe who have read the controverſies between the proteſtants and papiſts, that this text is commonly improved to ſhew that the people ought to ſearch the ſcriptures. The learned Piſcator, though he renders the word indicatively, yet he not only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the other way of rendring it, but makes this notable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in favour of it.
<q>It muſt be confeſſed that the verb at firſt fight ſeems to be put in the imperative mood; ſince the pronoun (humeis) is not prefixed, as indeed it ought to be (to the indicative) according to the cuſtom not only of the Greeks, but Hebrews, whoſe manner of expreſſion is uſual with John, and the other apoſtles.</q>
Comment. in loc. It was taken imperatively by the ancients, particularly by Irenaeus, Origen, Chryſoſtom, learned Greek fathers; as alſo by Auguſtin: and in the moſt ancient Syriac verſion. Our tranſlators there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeem to have had good reaſon for rendring the word in this manner. And I have accordingly choſen to follow their tranſlation. But if it ſhould be thought precarious, our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be well maintained without it, as will ſoon appear.</p>

                  <pb n="177" facs="unknown:012416_0181_0F8974C3B1E6E318"/>Our argument from this text is as follows. Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcriptures is an inſtrumental duty, conducing not only to the edification of believers, but alſo to prepare men for the ſtate of regeneration, to inſtruct awaken and humble ſinners, and by the bleſſing of God ingenerate faith in their hearts. It is an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance deſigned, and ordinarily bleſſed by God for the converſion of ſinners, and for producing in them thoſe preparatory diſpoſitions which uſually make way for this great change.</p>
               <p>When therefore our Savior directed the Jews to ſearch the ſcriptures, it is not to be doubted, but he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed this as a means in order to thoſe ends, to which an attendance to this ordinance is ordinarily condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive; and primarily for thoſe purpoſes which were in the firſt place neceſſary to be anſwered, in order to their being ſavingly benefited by them. And as they appear to have been not only unregenerate, but in a great meaſure unprepared for the exerciſes of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and faith, being filled with prejudices againſt Chriſt, and inſenſible of the ſinfulneſs and danger of their preſent ſtate; it was in the firſt place neceſſary that they be led into juſter apprehenſions of things, that they be awakened, and convinced of their need of a ſpiritual phyſician; and made to attend more ſeriouſly to the evidences of Chriſt's divine miſſion. This was the firſt ſtep towards their obtaining a ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:012416_0182_0F8974C470E6A958"/>
knowledge of him as Mediator, in order to which they are directed to ſearch the ſcriptures. It muſt not be thought that Jeſus in directing the Jews to the uſe of means, in order to their coming to the ſaving knowledge of him, ſhould wholly overlook the firſt or next end, to which the means he preſcribed were ordained; and have reſpect only to a remoter and conſequent end, which cannot ordinarily be attained without the intervention of the former. If a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory work of awakening and conviction, by means of the ſcriptures, was needful in order to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on him to ſalvation; then this was the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary or next end for which he directed them to ſearch the ſcriptures. And if they were unbelievers, it was firſt neceſſary that they obtain faith by attending to the ſcriptures, before they be thereby edified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in faith. In ſhort, Chriſt directed them to ſearch the ſcriptures for every neceſſary and uſeful purpoſe which they are fitted to ſubſerve, that they might be ſaved through faith in him. But an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance to the ſcriptures is conducive to valuable purpoſes previous to regeneration and faith: Theſe are therefore reſpected, and that primarily and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, when the unregenerate and unbelievers are called upon to attend this duty.</p>
               <p>Now whoever exhorts others to ſearch the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as the means of preparing them for the grace of regeneration, and ingenerating faith in them, muſt neceſſarily mean ſuch an attendance to this ordinance as they are capable of previous to regeneration and faith. For as the means muſt in nature go before the end, ſo whoever directs to any action or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, <hi>as means,</hi> cannot without manifeſt abſurdity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſuch endeavours as contain or preſuppoſe the end for which they are appointed. This would be, as if a phyſician ſhould preſcribe ſuch means in order
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:012416_0183_0F8974C534024CF0"/>
to recover his patient to health, as cannot poſſibly be uſed unleſs he is firſt in good health. Beſides, there is nothing in the expreſſion here uſed that would lead any one to ſuſpect, that ſuch an attendance and no other muſt be intended, as preſuppoſes regeneration and faith in Chriſt; or in ſhort any other manner of ſearching the ſcriptures than they had a preſent or next power for, though unbelievers. <note n="*" place="bottom">This is fully granted by Mr. H. when he ſays, the word in the text may as well be tranſlated indicatively "ye do ſearch;" un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he ſhall ſay that the ſame word neceſſarily means a holy act in the imperative mood, and an unholy act in the indicative.</note> On the whole, it appears to have been our Savior's deſign, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the Jews to ſearch the ſcriptures diligently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their preſent light and ability, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate. And he enforces his exhortation with a reaſon, which was ſuited to perſuade thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not on him to an immediate compliance, v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, for many I ſay unto you ſhall ſeek to enter in and ſhall not be able.</q>
Our author endeavours to prove that by the ſtrait gate is meant the entrance into heaven, and not the entrance into a ſtate of grace or holineſs. Striving, he ſays, in ſcripture ſignifies the exerciſes of true chriſtians. But it does not appear that ſtriving bears this appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate ſenſe more than ſeeking. He ſays further, that the unregenerate never truly ſtrive for what they do not truly deſire. But this will equally conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſeeking what they do not deſire. Yet the
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:012416_0184_0F8974C5F35841B0"/>
text ſays that many will ſeek in vain to enter in at the ſtrait gate. Other reaſons are mentioned (and more are in reſerve) which ſeem not to be concluſive. However I ſee no neceſſity of contending about this matter. But I ſay, if our Savior exhorts the heaters of the goſpel to ſtrive for ſalvation, then he exhorts to all thoſe endeavours which are ordinarily needful and ſubſervient to this end. For the word <hi>ſtrive,</hi> meaning no more than earneſt endeavour, is to be underſtood as including all neceſſary endeavours. Now ſome endeavours in the uſe of means are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily neceſſary previous to regeneration and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For Mr. H. owns that it is in the way of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and painful attendance on appointed means that men are uſually prepared for regeneration, and are enabled and perſuaded to turn to God by faith in Chriſt. This is that ſtriving which it is in the firſt place neceſſary that an unregenerate ſinner be perſuaded to in order to ſalvation; and therefore the exhortation in the text, as addreſſed to ſuch, primarily enjoins that ſtriving which is in the firſt place neceſſary for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this character; that is, ſuch endeavours as are in order to regeneration and converſion, and ſo are in nature previous thereto. When a ſeries of endeavours of a different kind are in their place and order all neceſſary and conducive to a certain end, not only the laſt link of the chain, which is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately connected with this end, but all the other links whoſe connection with it is more remote are really of the nature of means in order to it. And any one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting to the uſe of means in general in order to ſuch end, muſt be underſtood to direct to the whole ſeries of neceſſary means, in their proper place; and primarily to that the uſe of which is in the firſt place neceſſary, though but mediately and remotely, and perhaps in itſelf not infallibly connected with the end propoſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="unknown:012416_0185_0F8974C78FF9BCA8"/>The deſign of this exhortation is to excite the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the goſpel to ſtrive without delay, before the door of heaven is ſhut againſt them. Many of theſe are unregenerate; who muſt therefore either defer ſtriving until they are regenerate, or they muſt ſtrive in ſuch a manner as they have a preſent power to do. True it is, that their inability to act in a holy manner does not excuſe the defective manner of their attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on means; and they ought to be humbly ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it. But it is as true, that in their preſent ſtate they will not and cannot attend on means otherwiſe than in a defective manner. And ſhall their inability to do their duty in a holy manner, which is itſelf cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, cauſe that it ſhall not be their duty to do it at all, unleſs they do it in a holy manner? No ſurely.
<q>Do the thing as far as you can, (ſays Mr. Shepard) elſe if you owe another a debt, you will not pay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not for a good end.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Parable of the ten Virgins, part 1. chap. 7. ſect. 5.</note> Such a defective manner of attendance on means is in it's place uſeful and neceſſary, to reſtrain men from many ſins, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a ſtupid diſregard of their eternal intereſts, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane contempt of God and religion, to keep them in the ordinary way of God's bleſſing, to prepare them for the ſtate of regeneration, with the conſequent duties of the chriſtian life. It appears then well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of divine wiſdom and goodneſs to command and encourage ſuch endeavours, which however defective and worthleſs, conſidered as duties, are in their place ſubſervient to the deſigns of his mercy.</p>
               <p>To the ſame purpoſe are our Savior's words to the Jews, who followed him becauſe they had eaten of the loaves. Joh. 6.27.
<q>Labour not for the meat which periſheth, but for that meat which endureth to everlaſting life.</q>
Theſe words I have elſewhere explained to this effect. The meat which endureth
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:012416_0186_0F8974C831117A48"/>
to everlaſting life is the ſame with the bread of life mentioned ver. 35. And this is Chriſt; who is ſo called by an expreſſive metaphor, becauſe he is the object of a chriſtian's faith, that faith by which he lives, which is as it were his daily food. To labour for this food which nouriſhes the ſoul to everlaſting life, is to uſe the appointed means for obtaining a ſaying know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of and faith in Chriſt, with union to and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in him. <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr Collins in the continuation of Pool's annotations (which I had not conſulted when I wrote what is here referred t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>Under the notion of that meat which endureth to everlaſting life (ſays he) unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly cometh whatſoever is neceſſary by God's revealed will, that we may have in us the hopes of glory here and may actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally enter into that glory hereafter.

                        </gap>h made neceſſary to it.</q>
Though I ſee no ſufficient reaſon to correct the ſenſe I formerly gave of theſe words, yet if any ſhould think the expoſition of this learned author is to be preferred, our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the text would ſuffer no diſadvantage either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſtrength or plainneſs.</note> To this the unregenerate are exhorted. An attendance on all the means which God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and encouraged ſinners to uſe that they may obtain this bread of life, is here enjoined. Now there is an attendance on means ordinarily neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ſinners for the work of regeneration, to give them the firſt knowledge of Chriſt, and ſo perſuade and enable them ſavingly to believe on him, and turn to God through him. As therefore the word <hi>labour</hi> properly ſignifies any kind of endeavours, it muſt be underſtood to include all thoſe endeavours in the uſe of means, which are neceſſary, or any way conducive to the end propoſed; as well thoſe which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to regeneration and converſion, as thoſe which are afterwards to take place. Yea thoſe endeavours
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:012416_0187_0F8974C8F296BEA0"/>
are primarily intended, which are in the firſt place proper for perſons in the ſtate of thoſe Jews here ſpoken to; that is, ſuch endeavours as are prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to regeneration and converſion. <note n="*" place="bottom">In my ſermons from this text, I had argued, that Chriſt exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the unbelieving Jews to endeavours in order to obtain faith in him, and therefore ſince the uſe of means is in nature prior to their end, it muſt be concluded that he exhorted to ſuch endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours as unbelievers were capable of. It was ſame ſurprize to me to find that Mr. H. had ſo intirely miſtaken my deſign, which I then thought, and ſtill think, was obvious enough, as to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the argument in this abſurd light; "that becauſe theſe Jews were diſinclined to any thing truly good, therefore they were not exhorted to any thing contrary to their preſent inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;" <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>In the ſame manner we might argue from other texts: But theſe are I ſuppoſe ſufficient, unleſs our author's exceptions ſhould be found heavy enough to turn the ſcale againſt us. Let us then attend to them. Says he,</p>

                  <pb n="184" facs="unknown:012416_0188_0F8974C9B16DBF60"/>1.
<q>Our Savior does not direct the Jews to ſearch the ſcriptures with all their prejudices, and in the exerciſe of enmity againſt him, and with a deſire and deſign to prove from them that he was an impoſtor.</q>
P. 128. And the ſame anſwer is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applicable to what has been ſaid from the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to labour, and ſtrive, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Anſwer. Our Savior did not direct the Jews to be prejudiced againſt him, and hate him, while ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcriptures. Nor did he direct them to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate or unbelieving. But that he exhorted them to ſearch, and ſtrive, and labour according to their preſent ability, notwithſtanding their unbelief, unregeneracy, and even prejudices and enmity againſt him, we have good reaſon to conclude; ſince their ſerious attendance to theſe things appears to be a very fit means of removing their prejudices and enmity againſt him, and by the bleſſing of God leading them to a true knowledge of and faith in him. We have not the leaſt ſhadow of evidence that he thought an attendance on means could be of no advantage to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from their prejudices and evil diſpoſitions. What reaſon have we then to doubt, but that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of theſe impediments to their converſion, ſo far as they really took place in the minds of his hearers, was one end, for which he directed them to the uſe of means? And then we may be ſure that he did not intend ſolely or primarily ſuch an attendance as implies or preſuppoſes the removal of all theſe impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments.</p>
               <p>It is added,
<q>They ought to have ſearched the ſcriptures with a heart ready to embrace and practiſe the truth.</q>
(Who doubts it?)
<q>And therefore our Savior doubtleſs injoins this [only] upon them.</q>
This conſequence we muſt deny, until our author ſhall make it appear, that ſuch precepts
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:012416_0189_0F8974CDE4E61B20"/>
as injoin an attendance on the means of grace <hi>undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly</hi> require nothing ſhort of ſinleſs perfection, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to thoſe ends for which they are preſcribed, for this is no more than mens duty. Until then I ſhall hold it as a ſure maxim, that ſuch actions as are very defective, and fall far ſhort of that perfection which they ought to have, conſidered as duties, may yet be very uſeful as means, and well adapted to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer important purpoſes in ſubſerviency to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and ſalvation of men. And therefore when the ſcriptures direct men to duties, as means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſpiritual or temporal bleſſings, we ought not to think that the means preſcribed as neceſſary to theſe ends muſt needs include a perfect conformity to the law in all reſpects, (though this is no more than our duty) but ſuch a performance of duties as is fit to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe ends is, I ſhould think, <hi>doubtleſs</hi> preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, though much ſhort of what we ought to do. If I ſhould ſay, that men ought to ſearch the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and perform other duties with a ſinleſs perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of love and obedience to God, and therefore our Savior doubtleſs enjoins nothing ſhort of this, as the means of coming to the knowledge of him as medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; which he knew no man would ever do in this ſtate of imperfection; and ſo proceed to caſhier un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate and regenerate endeavours together, would it not be as good reaſoning as this of Mr. H's?</p>
               <p>But it is further pleaded,
<q>when Chriſt tells them to ſearch the ſcriptures, he directs them to do it diſpoſed and inclined to do the will of God, and not with a diſpoſition directly oppoſite to that which was neceſſary in order to anſwer the end propoſed.</q>
That ſuch a ſearch of the ſcriptures is intended as was neceſſary &amp; conducive, in it's proper place, to anſwer the end propoſed, I readily grant. But that a regenerate heart in ſearching the ſcriptures, and
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:012416_0190_0F8974CE0B561980"/>
attending the other means of grace, is not neceſſary in order to their anſwering ſome good purpoſes, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency to mens coming to the knowledge of Chriſt as mediator, (which Mr. H. grants was the end for which Chriſt directed to ſearch the ſcriptures) has been I ſuppoſe proved; and is upon the matter conceded by thoſe who allow that there is a preparatory work to regeneration, wrought in the ſoul by means of the word of God.</p>
               <p>Our author's firſt exception is, I would hope, now removed. But if this fails, he has another at hand. Says he,
<q>When Chriſt directs and commands to ſeek firſt the kingdom of God, and labour for the meat that endures to everlaſting life, he doubtleſs directs to that ſeeking and labour by which men will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly obtain what they ſeek and labour after.</q>
P. 128. And in another place he ſays,
<q>It ſeems to me very diſhonourable to Chriſt, and contrary to his wiſdom and faithfulneſs and goodneſs, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he has given any direction and command to ſinners in order to their ſalvation, which they may punctually obſerve and do, and yet miſs of ſalvation.</q>
Therefore he concludes that no endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the unregenerate are commanded or direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to.</p>
               <p>Anſw. There are many directions given to men, and various duties preſcribed as means ſome way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to their converſion or ſalvation. If men are ever ſo exact and punctual in obſerving ſome direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, and attending to ſome means directed to by Chriſt, but utterly negligent of others; is it any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to his wiſdom goodneſs and faithfulneſs, if they miſs of ſalvation? Hearing the goſpel is one of the means of ſalvation, but not the only one; we muſt alſo believe, and obey it. Studying the word of God is the means of attaining to all that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:012416_0191_0F8974CE34438FF8"/>
which is neceſſary to our glorifying God: But it is not a ſingle tranſient act of attention hereto that will be ſufficient to furniſh us for every good work. A courſe of diligent application to the means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is neceſſary for this purpoſe. That labour and ſtriving enjoined on men by Chriſt may be taken two ways, 1. In the <hi>compound ſenſe,</hi> as including all thoſe endeavours which are required in order to the end propoſed, whether previous or conſequent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. Now it is not to be thought that any one who thus labours and ſtrives, that is, who punctually obſerves all the directions Chriſt has given in order to ſalvation will miſs of it. 2. This labour and ſtriving may be taken in the <hi>divided ſenſe,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying any particular endeavour, or act of attendance to any one of the means of grace and ſalvation. Now though each particular endeavour in the uſe of means is in itſelf a compliance with our Savior's direction, which preſcribes a diligent attendance to <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>each</hi> of the means ſubſervient to the end propoſed; which includes at the ſame time <hi>each</hi> tranſient act, and a conſtant perſevering <hi>courſe</hi> or <hi>ſeries</hi> of acts; yet there is no difficulty at all in ſuppoſing, that men may in ſome particular inſtances comply with our Savior's direction, and yet neglecting ſome of the neceſſary means of ſalvation may miſs of it.</p>
               <p>But it may be aſked, if a man labours and ſtrives as well as he can while unregenerate, muſt we not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily conclude from the goodneſs and faithfulneſs of Chriſt that he will certainly attain to a ſaving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion? I anſwer 1. This does not neceſſarily follow. I do not know that there is any promiſe in the goſpel of regenerating and converting grace to the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the unregenerate. God may oblige us to wait upon him for his bleſſing, in the diligent uſe of appointed means, and let us know that we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:012416_0192_0F8974CEF0C24CC0"/>
to hope for a bleſſing in this way, and no other; and yet reſerve to himſelf a ſovereign li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of granting or withholding his bleſſing. This he has done in other caſes. He has commanded us to train up our children in the way wherein they ſhould go, in hopes that when they are old they will not depart from it; to uſe means for the preſervation of life and health; to labour working with our hands, that we may have to give to him that needeth; and yet has given us no abſolute aſſurance, that our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſhall ſecure to us the ends they are fitted to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. An unpromiſed bleſſing may be neceſſary to render the means effectual; and yet it may well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the wiſdom and goodneſs of God to command and encourage us to uſe the means. Surely Mr. H. will not ſay that it is diſhonourable to the faithfulneſs of God to grant unpromiſed favours, by bleſſing means ordinarily, though not always ſucceſsful. Nor can I think he will, on ſecond thought, find any thing more unworthy of the divine perfections, in requiring us to uſe ſuch means, in order to obtain ſuch unpromiſed favours. 2. I do not think there ever was a ſinner that attended the means of converſion as well as he was able while unregenerate. It ſeems then to be a matter of meet ſpeculation, how we reſolve a caſe, which we have no reaſon to think ever was, or will be found among the children of men. If it ſhould be ſuppoſed, that thoſe who ſtrive in all reſpects as well as they can while unregenerate, ſhall aſſuredly obtain converting grace; yet I think all that are the ſubjects of this grace muſt own, that it was to them a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign unpromiſed favour. But 3. If it did indeed follow from our doctrine (as it does not) that there is a ſure connection between ſinners attending God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed means according to their beſt ability, and their obtaining converting grace; this would be no confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:012416_0193_0F8974D0B39AD890"/>
of it. For we have much clearer and ſurer evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that unregenerate ſinners are commanded to attend the means of grace, than we have that their beſt endeavours may fail of iſſuing in their converſion. Our doctrine will therefore ſooner prove this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to be true, than this conſequence will prove our doctrine to be falſe. Our doctrine is ſupported by direct and poſitive evidence: But all that can be ſaid againſt an inſeperable connection between ſinners attending the means of grace according to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent capacity, and obtaining ſpecial and ſaving grace, is, that it wants proof. Mr. H. has indeed attempted a direct and poſitive proof, that there are no promiſes of ſpecial grace to the doings of the unregenerate. But his arguments only prove that there are no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of ſalvation to ſuch doings; which is quite a different point. This may be denied, quite conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently with the ſuppoſition of a ſure connection between a ſinner's attending the means of converſion, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining converting grace. It is thought an eaſy taſk to ſhew the inſufficiency of his arguments to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed deſign; and that he undertook needleſly an <hi>anus probandi</hi> to which he was unequal. Be this as it may, the iſſue of the preſent debate, and the force of the argument we have been inſiſting on, is not affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any thing he has ſaid.</p>
               <p>Having thus anſwered to our author's objections, it may here be proper to offer ſome remarks on what he has ſaid in confutation of a maxim, which he ſays many hold to, and build much upon; namely,
<q>that whatever is ſaid to the unregenerate in ſcripture by way of exhortation and command, can require and propoſe nothing but what they may do, and yet continue unregenerate.</q>
P. 133. I know of none who told to this doctrine; there may however be many for any thing I know. If there are, I wiſh he
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:012416_0194_0F8974D147F18220"/>
had argued more to the purpoſe in confutation of it, than the moſt of what he has ſaid appears to be. But indeed I cannot help ſuſpecting that he has miſtook the meaning of thoſe he diſputes againſt. If he has, it is not the only miſtake of this kind that he has made. I will therefore endeavour to ſtate the matter plainly as I underſtand it, and then conſider his arguments.</p>
               <p>The requirements of God's commands may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in a twofold view, viz. as <hi>duties,</hi> or debts of obedience ſimply; and as <hi>means,</hi> deſigned and fitted to ſubſerve the purpoſes of divine wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Divine commands, conſidered as mere decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of duty, oblige all mankind to perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and alſo to every ſuppoſable degree of holy obedience, however ſhort of perfection; and alſo to each part of the duty in the compound ſenſe; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſuch part taken by itſelf may not contain what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is implied in an act of perfect, or ſincere evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical obedience. In this view the law, and each command is to be preached and inculcated on all, in it's full length and breadth, <hi>as duty.</hi> Thus the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the goſpel requiring repentance, faith, new obedience, external reformation, attending on means, are to be urged as the preſent duty, of all to whom the goſpel is preached. And though it is certain that no man in this world will or can comply with theſe precepts, with that perfection of obedience in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects which is his duty, yet they who have a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of true holineſs may, by the aſſiſtance of ſpecial grace, have a ſincere reſpect to all God's commands; and this is their duty. And though the unregenerate have not a next power to yield ſincere evangelical o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to all or any of God's commands, yet they can, by God's common aſſiſtance, do many things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, as to the ſubſtance and matter, and this is their duty. But their not doing theſe things in a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:012416_0195_0F8974D1F2205238"/>
manner is their ſin; and a regenerate perſon's not doing his duty in a perfect manner is his ſin; for which both are equally inexcuſeable.</p>
               <p>But if we conſider duties <hi>as means</hi> appointed by God to ſubſerve the purpoſes of his goodneſs to the children of men; then we ſay, 1. That perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the rule of our duty not being an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed means of ſalvation is not, as ſuch, preſcribed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: That exerciſes of true faith not being appointed means to unbelievers of obtaining a ſaving knowledge of, and faith in Chriſt, are not, as means to this end, preſcribed to any unbeliever: That the exerciſes of a holy principle not being the appointed means of preparing the ſoul for the infuſion of a principle of holineſs are not, as ſuch, preſcribed to any unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſinner. 2. God has not enjoined on any the impracticable taſk of exerciſing ſupernatural powers or principles before they are furniſhed with them, as the means of obtaining any bleſſings temporal or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. To preſcribe impoſſible means would be the ſame thing as to preſcribe none. Faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are means of ſalvation only to thoſe who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to believe and repent. And commands to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and repent, in order to ſalvation, do not require men to do theſe duties by the powers of nature, but by the aſſiſtance of ſpecial grace. Such commands are deſigned, as moral inducements to excite and draw forth into act the principle or power for ſuch exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, communicated to the ſoul by the holy Spirit. Yet, 3. The hearers of the goſpel are to be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately called to believe and repent; and theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and exhortations are to be enforced with a promiſe of pardon and ſalvation if they comply with them, and a threatning of damnation if they remain impenitent and unbelievers. For this is the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate duty of all, whether regenerate or not. And
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:012416_0196_0F8974D2B0EC98E0"/>
the inculcation of it, by the bleſſing of God, is a means of good both to ſaints and ſinners. The former are hereby ſtirred up to renewed exerciſes of faith and repentance. And in the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>er the work of conviction and humiliation may, through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the holy Spirit, be promoted. Hereby they are led into a juſt view of the miſery and danger of a ſtate of ſin; and are excited earneſtly to implore the mercy of God, whoſe grace alone can renew and ſanctify their natures, and work in them that faith and repentance without which they cannot be ſaved; and diligently to attend on all the appointed means of converſion. Beſides, there is reaſon to hope, that the effectual influences of the holy Spirit will accompany theſe exhortations to ſome, enabling and perſuading them to a ſaving compliance. And finally the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to believe and repent imply, by neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, an obligation to ſomething which men have a power for while unregenerate: That is, a ſerious attendance to the means of grace; as ſhall hereafter be ſhewn. But 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some things are preſcribed in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as means conducive to the ſpiritual and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good of men, which they have a next power to comply with while unregenerate; as has been ſhewn. Theſe things are not only the immediate duty, but the next means, to which the hearers of the goſpel are called to attend without delay, according to their preſent ability, whether they are regenerate or not. The performance of theſe duties, as to the ſubſtance, is in the power of men, by God's common aſſiſtance; and this is <hi>abſolutely</hi> preſcribed, as means tending to their ſpiritual good. The performance of theſe things in a holy manner, is preſcribed as next means of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpiritual bleſſings <hi>conditionally</hi>; that is, if they are furniſhed with a principle or power enabling them to ſuch a manner of performance. But a holy manner
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:012416_0197_0F8974D376545B10"/>
of performance, though it be the <hi>preſent duty</hi> of all the hearers of the goſpel, and though it be the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary means of ſalvation to all, yet it is not abſolutely preſcribed, as the <hi>next means</hi> of obtaining ſpiritual bleſſings, to men while unregenerate. For, as was ſaid, acts of holineſs, as means of ſalvation, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to men to be done not by the powers of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but by the aſſiſtance of ſpecial grace. When therefore the unregenerate are in ſcripture called to an immediate attendance to ſuch means as they have a next power to attend on, by God's common aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; the abſolute and primary intendment of ſuch exhortations is, that they ſhould do it ſeriouſly and diligently, according to their preſent capacity. I add 5. That God's denying ſpecial and effectual grace to thoſe who are favoured with the outward means, is a penal conſequence of their neglecting to do what they had a next power to do in a way of attendance on means; and this neglect is accordingly to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the principal cauſe and occaſion of their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ruin. And conſequently, though free grace is the original cauſe of mens ſalvation, yet not unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy ſimply conſidered, nor the denial of ſpecial grace, but free will abuſed is the original proper cauſe of their perdition. <note n="*" place="bottom">

<q>If this maxim be true, then another is as true, viz. that it is not the duty of the unregenerate to repent and believe the goſpel.</q>
P. 133. Anſw. It is granted that the maxim as he has ſtated it is not true; and his inference from it is juſt, if ſuch a repentance and belief of the goſpel be intended as flows from a holy principle. But though repentance, and faith, and perfect obedience to the law be the preſent duty of the unregenerate, it will not follow that any of theſe things are the next means neceſſary for them to uſe, in order to obtain ſpiritual bleſſings; or that they are in this view preſcribed to them conſidered as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate. For, as was ſaid, though the end for which the goſpel directs men to the uſe of means may be their preſent duty, yet we are not to ſuppoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly, that it is therefore preſcribed as the means of itſelf. Our author's argument if deſigned to confute any maxim that we "hold to or build upon" aims <hi>toto caelo</hi> wide of the mark; and ſo I leave it. If he will prove that faith and repentance are not only the preſent duty of the unregenerate, but the preſcribed means for obtaining faith and repentance at firſt, and of preparing the ſoul for the grace of regeneration, we will conſider it.</p>
               <p n="2">2.
<q>It alſo follows, that ſinners are not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted or commanded to do any thing from higher and better views diſpoſitions and principles than they have.</q>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> Anſw. This does not follow, either from our principle, or from the maxim, as he calls it, which himſelf has mentioned. We ſay that ſuch endeavours as men have a preſent power for are preſcribed, and to be exhorted to as means; but we do not ſay that ſuch endeavours are all that is to be inculcated as duty. Beſides, how can it be proved to be a juſt conſequence, that if men are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:012416_0200_0F8973EF71794C68"/>
to act from ſuch <hi>principles</hi> and <hi>powers</hi> as they are furniſhed with, then they muſt be exhorted to act from no higher <hi>views</hi> than they have at preſent? It is the proper uſe of exhortations to lead men into differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent views from what they are ſuppoſed to have, not to create new principles and powers of action. True chriſtians have a principle of grace, and are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to act from it: But they ſometimes have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy views and diſpoſitions, from which they are not to be exhorted to act. And would any one of good underſtanding, except Mr. H. imagine that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations calling men to act from ſuch principles and powers as they have and are capable of exerciſing, imply that they muſt act from ſuch views and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions as at preſent actually take place? The unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and regenerate are endowed with ſuch princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as render them capable of acting from higher and better views than they often have: And it is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of exhortations or moral ſuaſion to work on theſe principles, and put them in exerciſe. But it is added,
<q>The only reaſon why impenitent enemies to God may not be exhorted to repent and love God, if there be any reaſon for this, is, that this requires higher principles than thoſe which they now act from. And for the ſame reaſon no perſon may be exhorted and commanded to do any thing which his heart is now ſet againſt.</q>
Anſw. We grant that ſinners are commanded to repent, and love God with all their hearts, and in one word to be perfect; and this is to be inculcated as duty. Yet though this is no more than their duty, there is a good reaſon why all this is not to be preſſed on them as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary means of ſalvation; for God has not preſcribed ſinleſs perfection, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> means or way of ſalvation. We grant that faith and repentance are to be inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on all the hearers of the goſpel, not only as duty,
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:012416_0201_0F8973F1024D9598"/>
but as neceſſary means of ſalvation. Yet there is a good reaſon, why a holy attendance on the means is not preſcribed to ſinners, as neceſſary in order to a ſaving converſion; viz becauſe this would make the end it's own means. Nevertheleſs men may, in order to converſion, be properly exhorted to act from other views, than they have at preſent; and to do thoſe things which their hearts may now be ſet againſt: And ſuch exhortations may prevail with them, by working on ſuch principles as they are at preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with. And if i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> be neceſſary that a man's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent views be changed, in order to his attending on means to any advantage, it is highly proper that this be exhorted to. Nor is this preſcribing the end as means of itſelf.</p>
               <p>When Peter exhorted Simon to pray to God; if he exhorted to this as a means of obtaining convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, he did not abſurdly direct him to exerciſe this grace in prayer, in order to obtain it; though he might properly exhort him to pray from
<q>higher views and motives than merely worldly ones.</q>
And when Chriſt exhorted the Jews to labour for the meat which endureth to everlaſting life; he directed to all thoſe endeavours which are ordinarily neceſſary, either by immediate or remote connection with the end here propounded. And ſince ſome endeavours are ordinarily neceſſary previous to regeneration, it is with good reaſon concluded, that ſuch endeavours are here exhorted to though far ſhort of their whole duty. But it does not follow from this concluſion that they were not directed to act for this end with higher views and aims than purely to get their fill of bread, (though this conſequence has been drawn "<hi>by one who would be loth to have his talent at clear reaſoning called in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>" to return him once more his own compliment) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be proved that ſo long as they were unregenerate
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:012416_0202_0F8973F1B2B7CF78"/>
they were mere animals incapable of acting with high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er views than to fill their bellies. Beſides, let Mr. H. if he can, ſhew that it is unſuitable to divine wiſdom, to allure men to an attendance on the means of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even with the hopes of temporal enjoyments. The Sinai covenant, would, I ſuſpect, prove a troubleſome objection againſt all arguments <hi>a priori,</hi> or from ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent fitneſs, which he, or any one elſe could offer to that purpoſe. But he goes on,</p>
               <p n="3">3.
<q>Yea it hence follows, that men are not to be exhorted to do any thing contrary to their prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inclination.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. This ſeems to be only a repetition of his laſt conſequence in other words. And the ſame anſwer may be returned. It is one thing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate acts of religious obedience, ſimply as duty; and another to inculcate ſuch acts, as means of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpiritual bleſſings.

The conſequence muſt therefore be denied. Our author however attempts to prove it. Says he,

That men are commanded to do that for which they have neither a preſent inclination, nor a preſent power to incline, through the mere influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of moral ſuaſion, we have often granted.

ſame thing with the act of inclination or willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which by means of motives is educed from it? In other words, is the ſubjective ground of action, the action itſelf? Is the cauſe and the effect the ſame thing? The author "ſeems to take this for granted, and build much upon it as an undoubted maxim. And he is not alone in it. Other preachers and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have repreſented the matter in this light," who (whether they are guilty of "<hi>ranſacking the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>" or not) would have been capable of "<hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing</hi>" and reaſoning "<hi>to</hi> better <hi>purpoſe.</hi>" had they not been deceived, by not duly attending to the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ideas confounded together under the name of <hi>moral inability.</hi> Whether an "expreſs vindication of this notion will be undertaken," time will ſhew.</p>
               <p>The propoſal and vindication of the preceding ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments has run out to ſuch a length, that I will mention but one more, and that very briefly.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The hearers of the goſpel are commanded to repent and be converted that they may be ſaved; and this infers an obligation on all to attend the means of converſion. Such commands implicitly require whatever is neceſſary to be done by us, in order to a compliance with them. Now ſome endeavours of men while unregenerate are ordinarily neceſſary to their firſt converſion. An active attendance to the divine word is the means of faith and repentance; and as ſuch is virtually enjoined in the command to believe and repent: <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>If men are under any obligation to attend to the command to repent and be converted, or to obey this command, they are under obligation to all that which is implied in this, or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary on their parts in order to it; therefore are under obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hear and attend to the truths contained in God's word with the utmoſt concern and diligence.</q>

<q>Quoniam eſt acutus, interdum contra epinionem ſuam viſa veritate ſuperatur.</q>
                  </note> But an attendance to the means of our firſt converſion is in nature prior to converſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="unknown:012416_0204_0F8973F3338521F8"/>If it be ſaid, that men are commanded to attend the means of converſion, provided they do it with an honeſt, that is, a new regenerate heart; and it is in ſuch a way of attending means that faith is obtained: I anſwer, 1. In order to converſion it is neceſſary that men attend means previous to regeneration; that thoſe preparatory diſpoſitions may thereby be wrought in the ſoul, without which the author ſays, it would not be a wiſe act in God to regenerate a ſinner. Such an attendance on means is then neceſſary on our part as does not imply a new heart; and of conſequence this is virtually enjoined in the command to repent. This is, if not the next, yet the remoter means of converſion. Though a man while unconverted does not comply with the command requiring converſion; yet if he diligently attends on God's appointed means, he therein does ſomething implicitly required in that command, and which is therefore his duty. 2. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man has a new heart, or a power for holy acts created in him; yet until he is a believer he is not united to Chriſt, or accepted in him. If then a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate unbeliever is called to the uſe of means in order to obtain faith, and is encouraged to do ſo with a promiſe that he ſhall in this way obtain a ſaving knowledge of, and ſo an intereſt in Chriſt the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; (which is Mr. H's opinion if I underſtand him) <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 128. Serm. on Regen. p. 44.</note> then methinks we have found a conditional promiſe of that grace whereby we are firſt united to Chriſt; the condition of which promiſe is complied with previous to our acceptance of and union to him; and ſo a bleſſing inſeperably connected with ſalvation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:012416_0205_0F8973F3F4F44640"/>
to us, not as being in Chriſt, but as acting with a good and honeſt heart, and it would ſeem (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his reaſoning) out of reſpect purely to the goodneſs and honeſty of our exerciſes, and ſo I fear this notion will prove as ſubverſive of the goſpel, as promiſes to unregenerate endeavours. For until we are united to Chriſt, our honeſt hearts with their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes are only an inherent qualification, which does not denote that ſpecial relation to the mediator which gives us an intereſt in the bleſſings of the covenant.</p>
               <p>I find nothing urged by Mr. H. tending to ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate our argument, but what has been already anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered. He ſays, the word of God always requires us to be ready to receive the truth in love; if we do this we ſhall not attend on means as do the unregenerate. True. This is always our duty. Hence he concludes that
<q>Sinners are not required to attend on means in any one inſtance as ſuch, or with an impenitent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing heart.</q>
P. 139. To this we anſwer, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that unregeneracy and an impenitent unbelieving heart, are not required as adjuncts or qualifications of mens attendance on means; but the attendance it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is abſolutely required of men, though unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and impenitent; and has, by the appointment and bleſſing of God, a ſubſerviency to their ſaving converſion, as well as to other deſirable purpoſes. Nor is it any objection, that ſuch an attendance comes far ſhort of the duty required of men in the word of God. A perfect compliance with our duty in any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is not an appointed means of ſalvation. Mr. H. ſays truly,
<q>As God does not make the depraved will of ſinners the rule of their duty, ſo he does not make the rule of their duty the rule of his conduct in giving or not giving a new heart;</q>
I add, neither does he make the rule of their duty the rule of his will and wiſdom, in preſcribing to us the means of
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:012416_0206_0F8973F4B982A800"/>
obtaining temporal and ſpiritual bleſſings. He goes on to aſk,
<q>Why did the apoſtles direct men immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to repent, and be converted, and believe on Jeſus Chriſt?</q>
I anſwer again, 1. Becauſe it was their duty. 2. It was the neceſſary means of ſalvation. 3. Such calls are <hi>vehicula gratiae,</hi> in and with which God is wont to convey his ſpecial grace to ſome, enabling and perſuading them to an immediate compliance. And 4. That a diligent waiting on God in the uſe of appointed means for further light and grace might be promoted in all, according to their preſent ability. It may be the next duty of ſinners to believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and yet a further attendance on the means of grace, with further degrees of light and conviction in conſequence of ſuch attendance, may be neceſſary for them, before they can ſavingly believe and repent; in which caſe this is to be exhorted to as the next means of ſalvation. <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <head>SECT. IV. A Reply to Mr. Hopkins's Arguments.</head>
               <p>MR. H's firſt and principal argument, founded on our Savior's diſcourſe with the ſcribe, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt and great commandment, has been already repreſented and anſwered to. But as he has, in order to illuſtrate and confirm his reaſoning, added ſome things, the examination of which did not then ſo properly fall in our way; I will here in the firſt place briefly attend to them.</p>
               <p>He quotes that text in Iſai. 1.12. as a clear confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his argument and doctrine.
<q>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required theſe things at your hands?</q>
On which he thus gloſſes.
<q>Theſe things were required, but not for their own ſake, but only as an expreſſion of their reſpect and love to God. Therefore when this ceaſed to be exerciſed and expreſſed, and they appeared not to have the love of God, but the contrary, their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on theſe externals was not doing any thing that was required of them. Theſe things were not required of them as they performed them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in their attendance on them they really did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was required of them, and ſo did not the leaſt part of their duty.</q>
P. 119.</p>
               <p>Anſw. We have no reaſon to think that their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on the externals of religious worſhip is here called an abomination, and what was not required of them, merely or principally becauſe they were unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:012416_0208_0F8973F634828140"/>
For at other times, when the Iſraelites at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on the ordinances of divine worſhip, there is no hint that what they did was not required of them, but on the contrary, it is repeatedly ſaid that "they did according to the commandment of the Lord," though they acted not from a principle of true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Some teſtimonies to this purpoſe I have had occaſion to mention, concerning that rebellious gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whoſe carcaſes fell in the wilderneſs; who not only were, but appeared to be deſtitute of true love to God, by their daily perverſeneſs and murmuring againſt him, for which they were rebuked, threatned and puniſhed from time to time. Yet there is not one word intimating in the leaſt that it was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them, ungodly as they were, to keep the paſſover, and ſabbath, and offer the ſacrifices preſcribed in their law: But on the contrary, in doing theſe things they are ſaid to have done according to the commandment of the Lord. <note n="*" place="bottom">

                     </gap> 12.28. Numb. 9.5.8.20, &amp;c.</note> If theſe things were required of the unregenerate Iſraelites, however deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of love to God, in the time of Moſes, we may be ſure that it was not their unregeneracy, or want of holy love, ſimply conſidered, that was the reaſon why they were in the time of Iſaiah challenged in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, "who hath required theſe things at your hands?"</p>
               <p>And here I muſt refreſh our author's memory, which ſeems a little to have failed him. We have lately heard him pleading, that
<q>God in his conduct toward the people of Iſrael, and in what he ſays of them, acted not as the ſearcher of hearts; but has reſpect only to their external appearance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</q>
If ſo, it was not the want of inward holineſs that was the cauſe why their religious performances are declared to be an abomination, and not required at their hands; but it was the irregularity of their
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:012416_0209_0F8973F6F1570310"/>
outward behaviour. The prophet appears evidently, in this paſſage, to reprove them for their tranſgreſſions of the Sinai covenant; the condition of which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal obedience, and it's ſanction, temporal bleſſings and judgments. The ſins with which he charges them are outward acts of diſobedience: And the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives with which he perſuades them to repentance are the promiſes and threatnings of the Sinai law. "If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good of the land: But if ye refuſe and rebel, ye ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with the ſword." Ver. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>The perſons here addreſſed were groſly immoral in their lives; and yet affected to appear zealous in their attendance on religious ordinances; thinking, it ſeems, as did the phariſees afterward, hereby to cloke their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the weightier matters of the law. For this end they overcharged God's altars, with their free will offerings; which though allowed and accepted when offered in a right manner, yet were not abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by any divine precept. There was not ſuch <hi>a multitude</hi> of ſacrifices abſolutely required, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion here naturally imports. They obſerved the ſacred feſtivals, it is probable, with a ſolemn parade; and yet in an irregular manner, not according to the rules preſcribed to them. They might then be very juſtly reprimanded with "who hath required theſe things at your hands, to tread my courts in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and on ſuch an errand, when your hands are full of blood, oppreſſion, and all kinds of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?" This text is therefore far from proving any thing to our author's purpoſe. His obſervations from it have been before conſidered.</p>
               <p>Another text quoted by him is Jer. 22.23.
<q>I ſpake not to your fathers, nor commanded them, in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings and ſacrifices:
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:012416_0210_0F8973F7B0D82298"/>
But this thing commanded I them, ſaying, obey my voice.</q>
From which he argues in the ſame manner as above. Expoſitors agree that the negative expreſſion is meant comparatively. The ſenſe is, To obey is better than ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>He goes on,
<q>None will ſuppoſe, I preſume, that the devils did any duty, when they cried out, Thou art the Chriſt the Son of God. Or when the chief devil in the poſſeſſed man prayed to Chriſt in the name of the reſt, in the moſt earneſt manner, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee torment me not. And will any one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine that the—unregenerate do any more duty in their external words and actions, than the devils did in the inſtances mentioned?</q>
P. 119. "Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful argument"! If he will prove that the devil confeſſed Chriſt voluntarily, and not by conſtraint; that he was by revelation from God commanded ſo to do; that this was the inſtituted means of obtaining a bleſſing; that God encouraged him to hope for mercy in this way; that he confeſſed Chriſt, and prayed to him from a conviction of conſcience that it was his duty; then this matter will be further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
               <p>Our author proceeds to diſcourſe of ſelf-love, and natural conſcience, endeavouring to ſhew that they are no principles of obedience. The ſubſtance of what he has ſaid, has been examined in the ſecond ſection. They are principles, whereby men are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and prompted to do ſuch kind of actions, as have been proved to be enjoined on them; ſo are their duty. But he objects, "there is no love to God and our neighbour, while men act only from natural principles." Anſw. Not to inſiſt that there is ſome kind of good will to others, natural to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; we ſay, that ſomething beſides love is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſomething which may be done from other
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:012416_0211_0F8973F950375A18"/>
principles than holy love; as has been proved. He pleads further, "there is no obedience in acting mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from natural principles." Anſw. It is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that all acts which flow from ſelf-love and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſcience, are acts of obedience to God. But the doing of ſuch actions as men are commanded to do, though from natural principles, is obedience; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the ſcriptures miſcall it. Though an erroneous conſcience is not a principle of obedience, in thoſe things wherein it errs; yet when it's dictates are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth, preſcribing what is really matter of duty, (which we have proved is the caſe, when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents to the unregenerate their obligation to do what is enjoined on them, according to their preſent ability) then it may be a principle directing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them to do what is their duty. It is added,
<q>If the dictates of conſcience are according to truth, they declare that love to God and our neighbour is all that is required.</q>
Anſw. Prove it, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer our reaſons to the contrary, otherwiſe you beg in vain. It is further pleaded,
<q>there is but one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of obedience, which is love to God and our neighbour.</q>
This alſo we deny, 1. Becauſe we have proved that there are other principles of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. 2. Becauſe love, being itſelf an act of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, (Mr. H. ſays it is the whole of obedience) muſt therefore flow from ſome principle prior to, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from itſelf. I add that love alone is not an ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate principle of obedience, in thoſe actions which may be ſuppoſed to flow from it. It's operations muſt be guided by faith, and a right conſcience, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they will be irregular; however good the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of love is in itſelf. As to what is ſaid of ſelf-love, I have elſewhere conſidered that point. I will not return thoſe exclamations of abſurdity, which our author ſo profuſely pours forth at all differing from
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:012416_0212_0F8973FA22067300"/>
him on theſe points; but only query in his own words on another occaſion, "are we the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are confuſed and bewildered?"</p>
               <p>His ſecond argument is as follows:
<q>All God's commands to his creatures are an expreſſion of his will and heart, which is the ſame with their being a tranſcript of his moral perfections, as the common phraſe is. But God's moral perfection is his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And his will is holy. Therefore whatever command is an expreſſion of his will, muſt require holineſs. That which requires any thing elſe, is no expreſſion of his moral perfections; therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the expreſſion of the will of God, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be his command.</q>
P. 122.</p>
               <p>Anſw. The holineſs of God may be expreſſed in thoſe commands, which require the doing of that which is not in itſelf holineſs; it what is commanded be not ſin, but good in it's kind; and if the end for which it is commanded be agreable to his wiſdom and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. All the works of God are expreſſions of his will and holy perfections; yet he is the proper cauſe of other effects beſides holineſs. There is an actual concurrence and co-operation of divine providence with men, even in their ſinful actions; though he be not the author, or poſitive cauſe of their ſinfulneſs. And this providential concourſe is an expreſſion of his holineſs; yet the effect is not a holy action in the creature. His moral perfections are manifeſted, in his ſo conſtituting the connection of things with each other, that thoſe means which have nothing of true holineſs in them ſhould conduce to the happineſs of thoſe who uſe them; and in letting men know it, that they might have encouragement, or a reaſonable inducement to be in the uſe of ſuch means; and in preſcribing an attendance to them by his ſovereign authority, on pain of incurring the effects of his high
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:012416_0213_0F8973FAB4C0A768"/>
diſpleaſure, as a motive to ſuch attendance. Indeed if ſuch actions were preſcribed, the doing of which is ſin; or if any real encouragement were held forth to men, either in God's word, or in the conſtituted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of means and ends, that they might have a reaſonable inducement to <hi>ſuch actions,</hi> (as our author maintains) we could not reconcile this with the divine holineſs. But far be ſuch imaginations. God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing to the Iſraelites the keeping of the paſſover, in order to their preſervation from death by the deſtroying angel; was it not an expreſſion of his moral perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? And yet the preſcribed means for this end was the outward act of killing a lamb, ſprinkling the blood, &amp;c. which the unregenerate performed. All the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, counſels, or advices of a good man, ought to be expreſſions of his holineſs; yet Paul, and even our Savior commanded, or adviſed to the doing of that, which did not imply any holy exerciſe, as has been noted. And, unleſs I am miſinformed, our author and others like minded will not ſcruple to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to an attendance on the means of grace, upon the ſuppoſition of a ſtate of unregeneracy; though they own that they have no inſtruction from the ſcriptures for ſo doing. I will ſuppoſe that ſuch advices are thought by them to be expreſſions of benevolence and holineſs; not of ſin, and enmity to being in general; notwithſtanding the actions adviſed to are not holy exerciſes. Why muſt it then be thought inconſiſtent with the holineſs of God to enjoin ſuch actions? Moreover the perfect holineſs of God is expreſſed in the conſtitution of the new covenant, with the means or conditions of ſalvation therein required; yet not perfect, but ſincere acts of holineſs, are, according to the new covenant, the preſcribed way of our walking with God, and obtaining eternal life. On the whole, the principle on which this argument of Mr. H. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends,
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:012416_0214_0F8973FB7151CF08"/>
viz <hi>That a command requiring any thing ſhort of our whole duty, can be no expreſſion of the holineſs of God,</hi> being intirely deſtitute of proof; a bare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of it had been ſufficient, according to the laws of diſputation. And yet I have, beyond what is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on a reſpondent, offered ſuch evidences of the falſhood of this principle, as are perhaps a ſufficient confutation. So I paſs to his</p>
               <p>Third argument, which ſtands thus:
<q>Duty to God always ſuppoſes ſomething given to God, and done for him, out of regard and reſpect to him. But where there is no true love to God there is no true reſpect paid to him; nothing is offered to him or done for him in the intention and deſign of the doer. Therefore there is really no duty done. Nothing that is due to God is given; and ſo no command that he can give is obeyed.</q>
P 122.</p>
               <p>Anſw. Duty may be taken either in the compound, or in the divided ſenſe. In the former ſenſe it eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially includes a holy reſpect to the will and authority of God, with every other circumſtance implied in an act of true holineſs. In the latter ſenſe, each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar part of the <hi>compound duty</hi> is in itſelf matter of duty. For whatever is contained in, and enjoined by the divine command, is duty: But actions externally good are enjoined in the divine command <hi>in themſelves,</hi> as well as a holy reſpect to God in the performance. If a man has no reſpect to God in doing an action good in itſelf, he is guilty of ſin in the manner of the performance; but the performance is not, for the ſubſtance, contrary to the divine command. On the other hand, if through culpable ignorance, or an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous conſcience, he neglects to do an external duty commanded by God; for inſtance, if he ſhould neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to pray, or give alms, when he ought to do it, thinking that it was his duty to forbear theſe things,
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:012416_0215_0F8973FC33BB6498"/>
until he had clear and ſore evidences of his regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he would undoubtedly be guilty of a ſin of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, however he might be ſuppoſed to ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere reſpect to God, and to what he apprehends is his will, in ſuch forbearance of his duty. But if a man ſhould <hi>neglect</hi> to do external duties, regardleſs of the command of God; ſuch a one would violate a double obligation, and incur a double guilt. Diſregard of the authority of God is in itſelf ſin: And the omiſſion of an external duty, as to the ſubſtance, is in itſelf ſin. Conſequently the performance is in itſelf required, ſo is duty. For it cannot be in itſelf ſin to omit that, the doing of which is not in itſelf duty. The commands of God enjoin duties both in the compound, and in the divided ſenſe: They enjoin the whole conjunctly, and each part ſeverally and by itſelf; as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewn. Our author's definition of duty being fallacious, his argument founded on the fallacy muſt fall.</p>
               <p>Something however ſeems to be aimed at, which will require further conſideration. And therefore (craving pardon for taking the liberty) I will endeavour to mend the argument a little by putting the word o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience inſtead of duty, as being of a leſs general ſignification. Obedience does indeed imply a reſpect to the will and command of another; though duty in the <hi>divided ſenſe,</hi> does not neceſſarily imply ſuch a reſpect. An act of religious obedience involves in it's ſubſtance not only the performance of an action which is in itſelf the matter of duty, but alſo a regard to the command of God, as a reaſon and motive to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. If it ſhould then be ſaid, that allowing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ſinners may perform actions materially good, which may be termed the matter of duty; yet ſince they have no true reſpect to God or his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in any of their performances, there is nothing
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:012416_0216_0F8973FCF3D2F3D8"/>
of obedience in what they do, however good and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in itſelf. I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Suppoſing there is nothing of religious obedience in their doings, yet they ought to do actions materially good; and if they do ſo they will not incur that guilt which inſeperably attends the neglect of them in itſelf, or for it's own ſake. There is an obligation to do the action, as well as to have a reſpect to the command of God in doing it, as has been obſerved. If we ſhould ſuppoſe the unregenerate to be perfect atheiſts, yet we may truly ſay that they ought to be juſt and kind in their behaviour towards mankind. And in this caſe, though there would be nothing of religious obedience in any of their actions, yet they could not be charged with the ſin of omitting thoſe acts of juſtice and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which they would otherwiſe be guilty of, beſides their atheiſtical diſregard of God. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are two kinds of obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God ſpoken of in ſcripture, and a twofold reſpect to him. A conviction of the greatneſs and majeſty of God, his power and right to puniſh his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious creatures, the righteouſneſs of his commands, and the obligation and fitneſs of a creature's being ſubject to the will of it's creator and ſupreme ruler, has a tendency to put men upon ſome endeavours of obedience to his commands, from the natural princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſelf-love and the moral ſenſe, however deſtitute of a principle of true holineſs. Such endeavours of obedience are good in their kind, as well as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and motives prompting thereto; and they are commanded by God, on ſuppoſition of a ſtate of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneracy, as has been proved. And they who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect diligent endeavours to do what God has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; according to their preſent ability, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, will find that their wilfully refuſing to do what they had a next power to do, in a way of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:012416_0217_0F8973FDB2CBD860"/>
obedience, will terribly add to the guilt they are chargeable with, for not doing ſuch duties as at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they are incapable of, for want of a principle of holineſs. There is another kind of obedience attended with, and flowing from a divine and ſupernatural prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, with a ſpiritual diſcernment of ſpiritual things. This is peculiar to the regenerate, who have a holy reſpect to God and his will. If then Mr. H. means to aſſert, that a holy reſpect to God is implied in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is duty, or obedience of any kind; he does but humbly beg the queſtion. If he means, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate have no kind of regard to God or his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, this we are warranted to deny, both from ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and experience; nor do I find one word offered in confirmation of it.</p>
               <p>His fourth argument is,
<q>If God ſhould command the unregenerate to do any thing, as ſuch, and which they may do conſiſtently with their having no love to him, and being under the power of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and reigning enmity againſt him; this is, in ſome degree, if not wholly giving up his demands on them which require them to love him, to repent, and embrace the goſpel.</q>
P. 122, 123.</p>
               <p>Anſw. We deny the conſequence. If indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was required of men, <hi>as duty,</hi> but what they were able to do from natural principles while unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate; this would imply that the demands of the law were, in ſome degree, given up. But this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition we reject. Will Mr. H. ſay, that God has given up the demands of his law, in preſcribing to men, endeavours which fall ſhort of ſinleſs perfection, as means of obtaining temporal or ſpiritual bleſſings? Or will he ſay, that nothing ſhort of ſinleſs perfection is preſcribed, as neceſſary, or ſubſervient to theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes? Has not God, in the new covenant, required ſuch duties and exerciſes, as means of ſalvation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:012416_0218_0F8973FE72D3BBE8"/>
which are practicable by them in this ſtate of imperfection, through the aſſiſtance of that grace which he affords to them, notwithſtanding this ſtate of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection is their ſin? It becomes not p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>God has more regard to his own honour, and the honour of his law, than we have; and he knows bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what becomes his divine majeſty. Yet he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſincere though imperfect endeavours of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as the way and means of making our calling and election ſure, and having an entrance miniſtred to us abundantly into his heavenly kingdom. And in the Sinai covenant, not a perfect conformity to the whole moral law was enjoined <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Yea further, the condition of this covenant did not neceſſarily imply any exerciſes of true holineſs.

                  <pb n="215" facs="unknown:012416_0219_0F8973FF31235C68"/>Our author introduces the ſimilitude of a king treating with his rebellious ſubjects: And argues, that if it would be diſhonourable to him and his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to require of, or propoſe to them, any thing low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than immediate ſubmiſſion, and a full return to their duty; then much more would it be diſhonourable to God, to enjoin on men any thing they can do while unregenerate. But it may eaſily be ſhewn, that a king might, without giving up his authority in the leaſt, propoſe to, and require his diſaffected ſubjects to do ſomething, much ſhort of a full return to their duty. And whatever the honour and ſupport of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man laws and government may require, a way has been found (bleſſed be God) wherein the honour of the divine law and government is maintained and magnified, without his making perfect obedience for the future the neceſſary means, and indiſpenſable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our obtaining mercy. It can no more be concluded that his demand of holy obedience is given up, becauſe he has preſcribed to men an attendance to the means of grace while unregenerate; than it can be concluded that his demand of perfect obedience is given up, becauſe he has enjoined on believers a ſincere reſpect to his commands, according to the meaſures of grace they have received; though they are unable in this life perfectly to keep any of his commandments. <note n="*" place="bottom">The concluſion of this argument ſeems worthy of notice.

<q>Such have not the true knowledge of God's law, and have not been convinced of ſin, as God's people are.</q>
That is they are unregenerate. Sermon on Rom 7.7. p. 21. All then without exception who think

I can ſay with ſincerity concerning him, (though he may hereafter twit me with it, as he has done by Mr. Mills, in like caſe) I charitably hope that he is a true ſervant of Chriſt: Though I muſt add, that chriſtians would regard him with more complacency, if his diſcourſes ſavoured more of that meekneſs of wiſdom recommended by the apoſtle. I may not imitate him in his hard cenſures, for I fear my God. Nor can I think that it would be any damage or diſadvantage to a good cauſe, if our zeal in contending for it were tempered with thoſe charitable ſentiments expreſſed by the great Dr. Owen.

<q>but that men may for a ſeaſon not know, may diſbelieve and deny ſome fundamental articles of chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and yet not be abſolutely concluded not to hold the head by any ſinew and ligament; to have no influence of life by any other means.

<q>I ſee not why this is

not a commanding ſin and rebellion, and making this their duty. It muſt be ſo, if all they do is ſin and rebellion, which, I think is certain to a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; for in the exerciſes of a moral agent there is, there can be no medium between holineſs and ſin.</q>
P. 124.</p>
               <p>Anſw. If we carefully and diſtinctly conſider what it is that God commands unregenerate ſinners to do, in order to obtain ſpiritual and temporal bleſſings; and then enquire wherein conſiſts the ſinfulneſs of their actions, or in other words, wherein they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformable to the divine law; we ſhall be able eaſily to ſee that what God requires is not ſin, but the whole ſinfulneſs of the performance is a circumſtance, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct, which the depraved creature has added to an action good in itſelf. What God has enjoined on ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as the means of good to them, is actions materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally good; for inſtance, the reformation of their lives, and an attendance on the means of grace. This ſurely is not ſin in itſelf: If it was, it would be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever unlawful for a man, in any caſe, to reform, or uſe means. Actions which are in themſelves eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſinful, that is, forbidden in all poſſible caſes, may not be done either by the unregenerate or the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; for inſtance, wilful lying; this is unlawful, even ſuppoſing the liar ſhould therein ſincerely aim at the
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:012416_0222_0F89740282F68B80"/>
glory of God; which, through error of conſcience, is a poſſible caſe. Such actions are for the ſubſtance and matter of them inconformable to the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. There is no need of enquiring into the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the agent, or for what ends he acted, in order to determine that he did evil. But an attendance on the means of grace is not abſolutely, and in all caſes forbidden. On the contrary, it is abſolutely enjoined on all the hearers of the goſpel; conſequently the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of it is ſin in itſelf: And we may be ſure, without any further enquiry, that he who neglects theſe means, having opportunity and capacity of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon them, therein is blameable. When any one ſins in attending on means, it is an accidental de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and the fault lies not in the <hi>action itſelf,</hi> or in the <hi>divided ſenſe,</hi> for that is abſolutely commanded, and the omiſſion would be ſin in itſelf; but the fault lies in the wrong manner and circumſtances of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance: And this irregularity in the circumſtances, conſtitutes the action a ſin taken in the compound ſenſe, as including it's circumſtances, though in itſelf it be good and a commanded duty.</p>
               <p>We ſay then, that God has abſolutely commanded the hearers of the goſpel, without diſtinction, to attend the means of religion: But he has not enjoined any of thoſe irregular circumſtances, or defects, with which the performances of the unregenerate are corrupted. Theſe defects he has forbidden: Yet he has abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoined the actions themſelves, in the divided ſenſe, as matter of duty, and as means of good to men; notwithſtanding the ſin men may be guilty of in the manner and circumſtances of the performance; and though it is certain, that ſo long as they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, they neither will nor can perform them in a holy and ſpiritual manner. And if it be doubted, whether this be not the ſame in effect as to command
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:012416_0223_0F897471F36D0DE8"/>
the ſinful defects, which through the agent's fault will certainly be conjoined with the commanded action, if he does it at all; however metaphyſicians may puzzle themſelves and others in their endeavours to anſwer the knotty queſtion, and perhaps after all their ſubtile reaſonings reſolve it wrong, I ſuppoſe a child that knows his right hand from his left would intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively know to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Euſebius had a little ſon ſcarce four years old, when he thought fit to ſend him to ſchool with his horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book. The child was very loth to go, having a mind to ſpend his time in play with idle companions. Child, ſays the father, I intend you ſhall go to ſchool to-day. I hope you will go willingly, and learn to read as faſt as you can. <hi>No,</hi> ſays the child, <hi>I don't want to go.</hi> What not want to learn to read? <hi>I do not want to learn.

I would have you go chearfully, and try to learn like a good boy; but whether you are willing or not, you muſt go; or I ſhall be angry with you. The child fearing the effects of his father's diſpleaſure, ſets out with great reluctance, fretting and crying as he goes. Preſently an acquaintance meets him. Where are you going, ſays he, in this ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mood? <hi>I am going to ſchool,</hi> ſays the child. But why do you go to ſchool? <hi>Becauſe my father bid me, and threatned me if I would not go.</hi> Did your father bid you to be loth to go, and to cry, and murmur as you was going? <hi>No: he bid me go willingly.

                  </gap>ſk now, would not ſuch an anſwer be perfectly agreable to the plain dictates of common ſenſe? Whatever cloſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners can do, I am much miſtaken, if children cannot plainly ſee, that to command one abſolutely to do an action, though it ſhould be ever ſo certain that it will be done in a faulty manner if done at all, is intirely different from commanding the faulty manner, as well as the performance. Nor is this in any meaſure im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in that.</p>
               <p>But ſays our author, "It muſt be ſo" (that is to command men to do any thing while unregenerate muſt be commanding ſin)
<q>if all they do is ſin, which is I think certain to a demonſtration.</q>
I anſwer, if we take the actions of the unregenerate in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſenſe, including the manner and all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of their performances; then it is true, they are not holy but ſinful; though the actions in themſelves, or in the divided ſenſe may be good. For an action muſt be conformable to the law in manner and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as well as in it's ſubſtance, otherwiſe it cannot be denominated holy. It may be conformable to the command in one reſpect, and not in another. In whatever reſpect it agrees with the command, it is good, and matter of duty; though if in any reſpect it be eſſentially defective, there is no true holineſs in it; but taken as including ſuch defects, it is on the whole ſinful. One ſin is enough to denominate a man a ſinner in the eye of the law, though all his other actions are conformable to it. And one defect or ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity in an action is enough to denominate it ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the eye of the law, though in all other reſpects conformable to it. But though all the actions of the unregenerate in the compound ſenſe ſwerve from the rule of duty in ſome reſpects, ſo are to be accounted ſinful;
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:012416_0225_0F897474741607B8"/>
yet ſome of their actions do not ſwerve from the rule in every reſpect, ſo are not all ſin, or every way ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but are materially good. Now it does not imply commanding ſin, to command the doing of that which is in itſelf good, though it ſhould be certain that it will not be done in a holy manner. For in this caſe the ſin does not lie in what is commanded, that is, in the ſubſtance of the performance, but wholly in the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular manner and circumſtances, which, though fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, are not commanded but forbidden.</p>
               <p>To prove that all the doings of the unregenerate are ſin, our author argues, that
<q>In the exerciſes of a moral agent there can be no medium between ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and ſin.</q>
But he either miſtakes the meaning of this maxim, and holds it in an untrue ſenſe; or elſe it makes nothing to the purpoſe of his argument. It may be true that no actions of a moral agent in the compound ſenſe, taking in all their adjuncts and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, are of an indifferent nature, neither right nor wrong upon the whole: And it is true, that no actions of the unregenerate are upon the whole, in all reſpects, either good or indifferent. They are all ſinful in their manner and circumſtances. But an action materially good, may, according to the different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and circumſtances of it's performance, become ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or holy in the compound ſenſe; though no poſſible circumſtances can make an action materially forbidden become an act of holineſs. And there are numberleſs actions materially indifferent, that is not abſolutely commanded or forbidden; which yet cannot be either done or forborn without ſuch concomitant circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as may render them on the whole, <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> either perfectly right, and ſo holy, or ſome way wrong and improper. Now an action right in ſome reſpects and wrong in others, is not holy in the eye of the law, which requires a rectitude in every reſpect; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:012416_0226_0F897474F1316240"/>
it is in the compound ſenſe ſinful: And yet being conformable to the law in ſome reſpect, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as to the matter of it, it has therefore ſomething belonging to it which is (not indifferent but) good, and matter of duty; which however does not contain all that goodneſs which is eſſential to true holineſs. Of this nature are the beſt actions of the unregenerate. To require theſe in themſelves, or in the divided ſenſe, is not requiring ſin; for in this ſenſe they are not ſin: Nor is it requiring indifferent actions, which would be an abſurd ſuppoſition; for when required, they would be no longer indifferent but duty, whatever they were before. And however certain it may be that men will defile theſe duties by their manner of performing them, this is no part of what God requires of them, nor has it any tendency to their good.</p>
               <p>I may further add, that ſince the beſt duties of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are ſinfully defective, it may as well be argued, that God commands ſin, in requiring of them ſuch duties as they are able to perform in this ſtate of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection; as that he commands ſin if he preſcribes an attendance on means previous to regeneration. It will be ſaid, that ſo far as they obey the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, their actions are not ſinful. True. But in one reſpect, that is in the ſtrength or intenſeneſs of their exerciſes, all they do comes far ſhort of what is their duty. Muſt we then conclude, that if God preſcribes evangelical obedience to chriſtians as duty, and as the neceſſary means of ſalvation, then he preſcribes the ſinful imperfection as well as the obedience, ſince he knows that it will be imperfect? I hope not. Nor is there any more neceſſity to conclude, that in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing an attendance on means to the unregenerate, the ſinful defilements with which he knows their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours will be corrupted, muſt be alſo commanded. In ſhort, Mr, H's argument is nothing but that ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical

               <p>He endeavours however to vindicate it. Says he,
<q>Take away the ſin, and ſeparate it from every thing elſe, and there remains nothing in which there is any moral agency, and ſo nothing in which there is either ſin or duty, and therefore nothing which can be the ſubject of command: Conſequently if the ſin be not commanded, nothing is commanded.</q>
Ibid.</p>
               <p>Anſw. The word ſin may be taken in two ſenſes. 1. As ſignifying the whole compound action with all it's circumſtances, which is in ſome reſpect irregular and wrong. But if this be the ſenſe here intended, our author's aſſertion will be abſurdly trifling, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his purpoſe; amounting only to this, take away the whole of the ſinful action, and no action will remain. And we may as well ſay, take away the whole imperfect action of a believer, which as being imperfect is ſinful, and nothing will remain wherein moral agency is exerciſed. 2. By the ſin of an action is properly meant that in or belonging to it which is in itſelf forbidden, and which conſtitutes the compound action in that reſpect faulty, or inconformable to the law; whether the fault lies in the ſubſtance of the action, or in it's end, or it's other circumſtances, or in all of them. Now if thoſe actions which are ſuppoſed to be enjoined on the unregenerate were contrary to the divine command in every reſpect, then indeed it would be true, taking away the ſin would remove them wholly; and if every thing in them were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed contrary to the command, it would be abſurd ever to make it a queſtion whether any thing in them were commanded. But this we deny. Such actions as God has enjoined on the unregenerate are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves good; their ſinfulneſs does not lie in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but in the manner of the performance. And if it
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:012416_0228_0F89747671962338"/>
ſhould be ſaid that there is no moral agency exerciſed in the matter of the performance, this would be the ſame as to ſay that there is no morality in the ſubſtance of external duties; which is demonſtrably falſe. The morality of an action is nothing elſe but it's relation to the divine law commanding or forbidding it; in other words, it's being commanded or forbidden by God. Now it has been proved, and is exceedingly evident from the ſcriptures, nor that I know of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly denied by any, that the divine laws extend to the imperate or effective, as well as the immanent acts of the ſoul. They require a right behaviour, as well as right principles, and affections. Mens outward actions may be contrary to the law, when their deſigns are good. And their behaviour may be right, when their ends are not ſuch as they ought to be. When men perform external duties from natural principles, the ſinfulneſs lies in their not having and exerciſing holy principles, rather than in their exerciſing natural principles in ſuch a manner of behaviour: It lies in not aiming at the end they ought, rather than in aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at an end they ought not to reſpect. Conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſin adhering to ſuch actions lies in omiſſion, rather than commiſſion. And it is ſo far from being true that to take away the ſin is taking away the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the divided ſenſe; that if we take away the action materially good, and leave the ſame principles, ends, and other circumſtances conjoined with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of it, the ſin inſtead of being taken away or leſſened, would be inhanced.</p>
               <p>Mr. H. proceeds in the defence of his argument.
<q>There is a natural connection between requiring the unregenerate to pray, as ſuch, and requiring them to ſin.</q>
Ibid. Anſw. To require their unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and ſinful exerciſes in their prayers, as well as the prayers themſelves, would indeed be requiring
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:012416_0229_0F89747733144F28"/>
them to ſin. Theſe God does not require. But to require the prayers in themſelves, notwithſtanding the ſin with which they will certainly be defiled, while men remain unregenerate, has no connection with the requirement of ſin, as has been ſhewn. Beſides, let our author conſider, whether God's requiring chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to perform evangelical duties, though imperfect, has a natural connection with his requiring their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, as well as the duties themſelves? Whether his encouraging the unregenerate to uſe the means of converſion, implies or has a natural connection with an encouragement of the ſinfulneſs, as well as the uſe of means? Whether when himſelf adviſes to the ſame, on ſuppoſition of a ſtate of unregeneracy, he really means to adviſe to the ſinfulneſs as well as to diligent endeavours? May we not hope that a due conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe things may yet lead him out of his miſtake?</p>
               <p>He adds,
<q>If the prayers of the wicked are an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination, i. e. wholly ſinful, then to require them to make ſuch prayers, is for God to require them to do what is an abomination to him, and wholly ſinful. And this is the ſame, I think, as to require them to ſin.</q>
P. 125. We may here return again the ſame anſwer as before. Prayers and other acts of religious obedience as performed by the unregenerate are, taking in all their circumſtances, ſinful; becauſe in ſome reſpects inconformable to the rule of their duty. And to require ſuch prayers, in the compound ſenſe, would be requiring the irregular circumſtances together with the ſubſtance of the performance. This God has not done. But the prayers and other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious actions of the unregenerate are ſometimes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially and in themſelves ſuch as they ought to be; and alſo right in ſome of their circumſtances. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, they are not all ſin, or in every reſpect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the divine law. And to require them to
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:012416_0230_0F897477F2DE8D70"/>
make ſuch prayers, and perform ſuch actions, as are right and good for matter, and manner in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; though it be certain that in other reſpects and circumſtances they will be eſſentially faulty, is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from commanding them to ſin, as has been often noted.</p>
               <p>But he further pleads,
<q>If it be mens immediate and indiſpenſable duty to be holy and embrace the goſpel, no reaſon can be given why this ſhould not be required of them immediately.</q>
Anſw. There is no reaſon why all this, and much more, even per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience to the law, ſhould not be required of men as their immediate duty. But he adds,
<q>Or why any thing leſs or lower than this ſhould be required at all.</q>
Ibid. Anſw. The wiſdom of God has ſeen fit to preſcribe ſomething leſs and lower than a perfect compliance with our whole duty, as the means of obtaining needed bleſſings. And we have good reaſon for what we do, when we ſpeak as the oracles of God.</p>
               <p>Something further is added to the ſame purpoſe; but I have not obſerved any thing which may be thought to require particular notice, except what has been already ſpoken to ſomewhere in this eſſay.</p>

               <p>I Have now in ſome manner gone through my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed undertaking. And upon the whole of our author's performance (ſo far as it has fallen under preſent examination) I muſt ſay, that it is not the "<hi>metaphyſical,</hi>" that is, as he explains it, the "cloſe ſound reaſoning" <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 63.</note> contained in it that has (in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) troubled thoſe diſſenting from him on this point.

The words indeed are often hard, but the arguments are ſoft and yielding enough. His deſign was, I charitably hope, in the main good; viz. to bring ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners off from a ſelf-righteous truſt in duties; but he has carried the matter to ſuch an extreme as, I think, will not abide the teſt of ſcripture and reaſon: And ſo it is to be feared has diſſerved, and raiſed prejudices againſt ſome important truths of the goſpel, for which he would appear a zealous advocate. However the whole is referred to the candid conſideration and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial judgment of thoſe who have their ſenſes exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed to diſcern good and evil, and who are diſpoſed to give every argument, or reaſon, it's juſt weight, how inconſiderable ſoever the perſon may be who ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it, or however defective his manner. Wiſhing that without favour or prejudice, truth may be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, and error rejected; which is all that any one can reaſonably deſire who diſputes in earneſt, and in the integrity of his heart, and not from a mean am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of worſting another in an argument. And may God in his infinite mercy pardon whatever is amiſs either in the matter or manner of theſe our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, preſerve us from unchriſtian animoſities, and uncharitable diſaffections towards one another, unite chriſtians more and more in judgment and heart, keep them from dangerous extremes, cauſe truth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to prevail, to the abundant edification of the church, and the honour of the glorious goſpel of the bleſſed God, and our Savior Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
