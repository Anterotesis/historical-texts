         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHereas many hurtful and dangerous Errors have taken place among too many called <hi>Christians,</hi> which are some of the Tares and evil Seeds that Sathan hath sown while men have slept in the dark Night of Apostacy, and that now some do think they are awakened and come to the Day, and in the Light of Gods Day see into the true Christian Doctrine, and pretend to great Openings, and Discoveries, and Revelations, and yet some even of such hold some false and unchristian Opinions; of which there are not

a few concerning the <hi>Resurrection of the Dead,</hi> although the Testimony of the holy Scriptures is very full and clear against these dangerous and hurtful Opinions and Principles, imbraced by some as if they were true Christian Doctrines. Some alledging, <hi>That there is no Resurrection of the Body at all,</hi> or <hi>That there is nothing of the Body that dyeth that riseth again.</hi> Others adedging, <hi>That the Resurrection is past already, and all the Resurrection they expect they have already attained, being</hi> (as they pretend) <hi>risen with Christ in all respects.</hi> Others say, <hi>Their vile or low Body is already changed, and made conform to his glorious Body.</hi> Others say, <hi>They receive all the Resurrection they do expect immediarely after Death.</hi> All which are most dangerous and unchristian Principles, and are directly contrary to the holy Scriptures; for there were in <hi>Pauls</hi> time who said, <hi>The Resurrection was past already, and did overthrow the Faith of some, such as</hi> Hymeneus <hi>and</hi> Philetus, <hi>whose words did eat as a Canker,</hi> as he declared, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17,18. And such who say, <hi>Their Vile Body is changed, and made conform to the glorious Body of Christ,</hi> contradict the Scripture, and speak reproachfully, but ignorantly against the Lord Jesus Christ; for <hi>Paul</hi> useth these words by way of Prophecy, as a thing not then fullfilled, but a thing to the fullfilled at the Resurrection of the Dead, <hi>Paul</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Who shall change our vile</hi> (or <hi>low) Body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious Body, &amp;c.</hi> he doth not say, that the Body was already changed, and made like to the Body of Christ, but by way of Prophecy related it as a thing to come; for the washing and cleansing of the Body from sin, is not that change, but it is necessary to prepare unto it; for even after the Bodies of the Saints are washed and cleansed from sin, they remain low, and weak, and mortal, and corruptible, subject to Hunger, Cold, Heat, Diseases, and Death, and therefore are not made like to his glorious Body until the Resurrection of the Dead. And such who say, <hi>Nothing of the Body that dyeth riseth again,</hi> do plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Testimony of the holy Spirit recorded in Scripture, and especially I <hi>Cor</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000607_0003_0FA95D4216E0C7F0"/>
Dead: Therefore the new Resurrection Body is raised out of the old Body, as the new Grain of Corn riseth out of the old; but if the Body of the Grain of Corn did wholly perish or come to Dust, nothing could arise; which is a plain Example given us by the the Wisdom of God; and that which rises is the Mortal that putteth on Immortality, and the Corruptible that putteth on Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and is not raised Flesh and Blood, such as men now have, but yet a true Body; for <hi>Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, neither doth Corruption inherit Incorruption;</hi> but the true Body of Man and Woman that shall arise at the Resurrection of the Dead, lieth hid within this visible gross appearance of Flesh and Blood, even as the true Body of the Seed in the Grain of Corn lieth within the Husk, or as the precious Gold lieth within the course Mineral or Mine until the pure and precious Metal be seperated from the Dross. And because this Seperation is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately effected, but requireth a Time after Death, and that even when the Seperation is made, the Body remaineth, and is lodged by the divine Providence, that giveth to every thing its proper place, as in a certain invisible Grave or Sepulchre, that was mysteriously figured by the Burial place called <hi>Machpala,</hi>) that signifieth a double or two fold Sepulchre) <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. which <hi>Ahraham</hi> purchased from <hi>Ephron</hi> the <hi>Hittite,</hi> (which word <hi>Ephron</hi> signifieth the <hi>Dust-eater</hi>) for four hundred pieces of Silver: The which, as it is litterally true, so is an Allegory, and points at the Resurrection of the Body, out of the Mystical and Invisible <hi>Machpelah</hi> or Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre in <hi>Hebron</hi> (which signifieth bordering) in the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> figuratively and Mystically understood; and by four hundred pieces of Silver, as by so many Virtues, signified by Silver, this most excellent Burial place is purchased from <hi>Ephron;</hi> but he who hath not these Virtues cannot have the Priviledge to be buried in this most excellent Burial place, and therefore <hi>an Untimely Birth is better than he,</hi> as the holy Scripture declareth, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 6. 3. For it is no such Misery nor Unhappiness not to have an outward and visible Sepulchre, which many of the dear Children of God have not had; but surely they have this other more excellent burial in the Mystical <hi>Hebron,</hi> in the Mystical Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> where all the dead Bodies of the Saints shall be raised up, and stand with

the Lamb upon <hi>Mount Zion,</hi> to wit, not the litteral <hi>Zion,</hi> but the Mystical.</p>
            <p>Now, that the Bodies of the Saints are not raised up imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after Death, or after this Spirit goeth out of the body (although the Souls and Spirits of the Righteous, and of all the faithful, both Men and Women, who dye in the Faith of the Lord Jesus Christs do immediately go unto God and Christ in Heaven, and enter into a very great and large enjoyment of the heavenly, Blessedness, after the Bodily decease) is clear from many express Testimonies of the holy Scripture. For the deceased Saints, though their Souls and Spirits are alive with the Lord in Heaven, and do not sleep, but are awake, and praise God continually; yet they are said to be a sleep in respect of their Bodies, which are rather fallen a sleep than dead, and are said to sleep in Christ, to wit, under his divine Care and Protection, until he awaken them; for which, I shall cite these sorrowing Scriptures, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 10. <hi>So</hi> David <hi>slept with his Fathers, and was <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Now what this Trump or Trumpet it, both <hi>Paul and John</hi> declareth, and the Time about which it is

            </p>
            <p>Moreover, it is very plain from Scripture, that the deceased Saints, who lived from the beginning of the World, although their Souls, and Spirits did ascend unto God and Christ in Heaven, yet waited for the Resurrection of the Body, and that more abundant

Glory that should follow thereupon; for it is said, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. <hi>These all dyed in Faith, not having received the Promises, but having seen them afar off, and were perswaded of them, and imbraced them, &amp;c.</hi> And vers. 39, 40. <hi>All these having obtained a good Report through Faith, received not the Promise, God having provided some better things for us, that they without us should not be made Perfect.</hi> Now what this Promise is, is clear from <hi>Vers.</hi> 35. <hi>And others were Tortured, not accepting Deliverance, that they might obtain the better Resurrection;</hi> which is the Resurrection of the Just, that is better than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the Unjust.</p>
            <p>Now if some say, <hi>The Promise that they waited for was Christs Coming in the Flesh.</hi>

            <p>But again, as concerning that <hi>Great Day of Judgment</hi> to come, wherein both the Righteous and the Wicked shall receive according to the Works done in the Body, Christ doth plainly else-where declare, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 36. <hi>But of that Day and Hour knoweth no man, no, not the Angels in Heaven, but my Father only.</hi> And <hi>Mark</hi> 13 32. <hi>But of that Day and Hour knoweth no man, no, not the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, neither the Son, but the Father;</hi> which is to be understood of Christ, the Son, as Man, to whom then it was not known; the which Day and Hour cannot be the time immediately after mens Decease; for though after Death there is a Judgment that followeth every one, according to <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. yet that is not the great and last Judgment, nor Universal, but Particular: And of this Last Day, Christ said, <hi>John</hi> 6. 40. <hi>And this is the Will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have Everlasting Life, and I will raise him up at the Last Day.

But as concerning the dead Bodies of the Saints and true Believers in Christ Jesus, it is prophecyed, <hi>Thy Dead, my Dead Body shall arise,</hi> (so the <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath it) for the Bodies of the deceased Saints are the Body and Temple of Christ, and Members of him; and therefore cannot perish) <hi>awake and sing, ye that dwell in the Dust, for thy Dew is as the Dew of Herbs, and the Earth shall cast out the Dead</hi> (to wit, the Earth not vulgarly understood) <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.19.

            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Lastly,</hi> That there is yet a Resurrection of the dead to come, of all such generally who have dyed in the Faith, is clear from <hi>Rev.</hi> 20 4,5,6. <hi>And they lived and reigned with Christ a Thousand Years; but the rest of the Dead lived not again until the Thousand Years were finished, this is the first Resurrection, blessed and holy is be that hath part in the first Resurrection.</hi> Where note well, that the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Saints in the Thousand Years, is called the first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which every true Believer, who is inwardly risen with Christ, as to his Soul and inward Man, is interested in, and hath a right unto, but is not possessed of until the Resurrection of the Dead; And therefore if any will call the inward rising of the Soul from the Death of sin, the first Resurrection, yet it is not <hi>That</hi> first Resurrection, mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4,5.</p>
            <p>Moreover, concerning the Nature and Manner of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Bodies of the Saints, how that the Body is not raised a mortal corruptible Body of Flesh and Blood, but immortal and incorruptible, <hi>Paul</hi> doth plainly declare; and it is altogether safe in this and all other matters of Faith, to hold to Scripture words. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. from V. 44, to 50.</p>
            <p>And here Note, <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> doth not call him a Fool that did believe either the Truth of the Resurrection of the Body, or the true Manner of it, but called him a Fool, that not believing the Truth of it, nor the true Manner of it, and by arguing against it, did enquire, <hi>How are the dead raised up?</hi> and for the Instruction of this Fool, <hi>Paul</hi> sendeth him to learn the manner of it from the sowing and rising of the Grain of Corn; and he reproveth such as <hi>Corints</hi> sharply, who did not believe the Resurrection of the Body, <hi>

            <p>Note, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That as the Bodies of the Saints, that shall be raised up at the Resurrection of the Dead, shall not be raised Mortal and Corruptible, but Immortal and Incorruptible, so they shall not need any Meats or <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
