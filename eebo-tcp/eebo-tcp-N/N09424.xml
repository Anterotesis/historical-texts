            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE materials for the following work were collected more than twenty years ago, and would then have been put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for public uſe, had it not been thought unſeaſonable; as the Colonies were not, at that time, diſpoſed to attend to the epiſcopal-diſpute: nor would this have been their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination at preſent, had it not been excited in them, more eſpecially by the clergy of the church of England, who, not being ſatisfied with having tranſmitted petitions to their ſuperiors at home, begging their influence in favor of the ſettlement of an Epiſcopate in America, deputiſed one of their number to write "an appeal to the Public," citing object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors to their impartial tribunal for tryal of the weight of their objections, if any they had to offer, againſt the reaſonableneſs of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. This conduct of their's has conſtrained
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:012009_0003_0F8941536DC86DB0"/>
thoſe of a different perſuaſion to ſpeak in their own behalf; and the rather, as it was, in a formal manner, given out, that, "if nothing was ſaid againſt an American Epiſcopate, it would be taken for granted, all parties acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſced, and were ſatisfied."</p>
            <p>IN conſequence of this extraordinary chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, <hi>that</hi> has been ſaid, which, I believe, the epiſcopalians will not find themſelves eaſily able to anſwer. But there is ſtill room for ſuch a work as that profeſſes to be, which is emitted herewith: and it was judged by many to be ſeaſonable at this day; more eſpecially, as it has been openly and repeatedly declared, 'that it is a <hi>FACT</hi> certainly and univerſally handed down by the Chriſtian Fathers, even from the earlieſt days, that <hi>GOVERNING</hi> and <hi>ORDAIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING AUTHORITY</hi> was exerciſed <hi>ONLY BY BISHOPS OF AN ORDER, IN THE CHURCH, DISTINCT FROM, AND SUPERIOR TO PRESBYTERS.</hi>'</p>
            <p>HOW far the above affirmation is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to truth, or whether it will at all conſiſt with it, every man of common underſtanding, who will be at the pains to read the ſubſequent pages, will be able, from what he may ſee with his own eyes, to judge. Thoſe, moſt certainly,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:012009_0004_0F8941542CF28010"/>
may be thought well qualified to form a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this matter, who are men of capacity and learning, though they have had neither oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, nor leiſure, to acquaint themſelves with the writings of the antient Fathers. It was principally for the ſake of perſons in each of theſe kinds, whether epiſcopalians, or Chriſtians of any other denomination, that the preſent work was engaged in, and made public. And for this reaſon it was thought proper to be more particular, than would otherwiſe have been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in giving an account, not only of theſe Fathers, but of their writings; diſtinguiſhing between thoſe that have been falſely attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, and thoſe that may he eſteemed truly genuine; as alſo between thoſe that are pure, and thoſe that have been adulterated with corrupt mixtures. In the doing of this, which has enlarged the work, and increaſed my labour, I pretend to be little more than a collector; though, inſtead of tranſcribing from others, I have uſed my own words, unleſs when I give notice to the contrary: and this I choſe to do, that I might be more conciſe, and have it in my power to convey only that to others, which I believe contains the exact truth.</p>
            <p>THE paſſages from the Fathers, called apoſtolical, that is, the Fathers who may be
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:012009_0005_0F894154EBFC21C0"/>
ſuppoſed to have converſed with one, or more, of the apoſtles, I have given in the verſion of Arch-Biſhop Wake; not ſo much to ſave my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the trouble of a tranſlation, as to prevent all ſuſpicion of too high, or too low, a turn to any modes of expreſſion, in order to favor my own ſenſe of the fact in diſpute. I ſhould have been glad, could I have done the like in regard of what is offered from the other Fathers. I am myſelf accountable for the tranſlation of the extracts from them; in which I have not ſo much ſtudied elegance, as an exact repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their real meaning. I can truly ſay, I have, to the beſt of my capacity, given the <hi>WHOLE</hi> that is contained in the writings of the Fathers, within the time ſpecified. Sure I am, I have willingly omitted no paſſage, or word, that may be found in any of their works; but have been as free to inſert thoſe, epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians would deſire might have a place here, as others they might wiſh had been kept out of ſight. It is poſſible, after all, there may be omiſſions, or miſtakes, through inattention, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs, or ſome other cauſe more or leſs faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; though I am not conſcious of any, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there are none that are material. If any ſuch there ſhould be, I ſhould eſteem it a favor to ſee them corrected. As to thoſe of ſmall importance, the learned and judicious, ſhould they
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:012009_0006_0F89415691138D30"/>
obſerve any ſuch, will candidly overlook and excuſe them.</p>
            <p>HAD there been a ſufficiency of Greek types in town, and dexterity to uſe them, more of the language in which many paſſages were wrote would have been printed: but this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect may be thought pardonable, as I have all along inſerted ſuch original words, though in Engliſh letters, as may be thought to be of importance in the preſent debate. I could eaſily have crowded the margin with references to the books, and particular pages in them, I have had occaſion to conſult; but this, to ſave room, and a vain ſhew of learning, I have omitted: at the ſame time, taking care to name my au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and particular places in their writings, in all inſtances that have an argumentative connection with any conſiderable part of the grand ſubject in diſpute.</p>
            <p>IT is hoped, the following work will not be altogether uſeleſs. Much indeed has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and repeatedly, publiſhed relative to the Fathers, and their writings; and nothing more frequently to be met with than quotations from them, in ſupport of the epiſcopal cauſe, by thoſe who have appeared in its defence. But no one, within the compaſs of my knowledge, has
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:012009_0007_0F8941572FB15DA8"/>
collected together, and brought to view, <hi>ALL</hi> that they have ſaid expreſſive of their ſentiments upon this head. This, if I miſtake not, was a work much needed, and may be improved to good purpoſe. The truth of the <hi>FACT</hi> in debate may herefrom be brought to a clear and full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.</p>
            <p>IF any ſhould complain of it as a fault, that I have confined myſelf within too narrow limits, not going beyond the cloſe of the ſecond century;— I would briefly ſay, when we have paſſed theſe bounds we have got into times, in which there was very viſibly a departure from the purity and ſimplicity of the goſpel. The <hi>MAN OF SIN</hi> now began to make his appearance, <note n="*" place="bottom">A Gentleman of learning beyond the Atlantic, to whom I had mentioned my confinement of the preſent view of Epiſcopacy within the two firſt centuries, expreſſes himſelf upon it in theſe words, "The third and following centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are deſervedly to be rejected with a kind of pious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation in an enquiry of this nature. For when Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine had deformed and corrupted chriſtianity; and from being "all glorious within," had dreſſed up the church of Chriſt in robes of external pomp, and made it all gaudy without, and decked and adorned it like the kingdoms of this world; no wonder that its native modeſty ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came tainted; that it yielded to the ſolicitations, and had criminal converſation with the princes of the earth; and by degrees ſunk into that MOTHER OF HARLOTS, which it at preſent ſhews itſelf to be, in almoſt every part of the world, where it is pretended to be eſtabliſhed by their power, and enriched with their wealth."</note> though it
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:012009_0008_0F894157EC8BC730"/>
was in a gradual way that he attained to that exaltation in dignity and power, as to be "above all that is called god." Beſides, if there are no witneſſes for the firſt two hundred years, or inſufficient ones only, to certify the truth of the fact in queſtion, the great argument in favor of epiſcopacy, fetched from the <hi>UNIVERSAL CONSENT OF ALL AGES FROM THE BEGIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NING OF CHRISTIANITY,</hi> muſt inevitably loſe its force. And this is acknowledged by the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Biſhop Hoadly, who has wrote, as I judge, in the moſt maſterly way, upon this ſide of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, of any who have handled it. Says he, <note n="†" place="bottom">Reaſonableneſs of conformity to the church of England, p. 249.</note>
               <q>We do not argue meerly from the teſtimony of ſo late writers as theſe [Jerom and St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin] that epiſcopacy is of apoſtolical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. We grant it doth not follow, St. Jerom thought ſo, therefore it is ſo. But writers of <hi>ALL AGES</hi> in the church witneſs that this was the government in their days, that it was inſtituted by the apoſtles, and delivered down as ſuch. All that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce St. Jerom for in this caſe is, that it was in his time, and that he believed it to be apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical, and received it as ſuch: <hi>but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the teſtimony of THE AGES BEFORE
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:012009_0009_0F894158ADDE7650"/>
HIM, I ſhould not eſteem this a ſufficient argument that it was really ſo.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I SHALL only add, that I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to exhibit the following account of the ancient epiſcopacy, not only with honeſt impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, but meekneſs and candor, ſo as to give no juſt occaſion for complaint, that I have wrote with bitterneſs, and under the influence of that "wrath of man which worketh not the rightouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God." All I deſire is, that thoſe into whoſe hands this work may fall, would read it with like impartiality and candor; in which caſe, I may venture to ſay, they will be at no loſs to determine on which ſide the truth lies, with reſpect to the <hi>fact,</hi> that is the ſubject in debate.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>IN all diſputes relative to goſpel-truth, the demand is juſt, "what ſaith the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? To the law, and to the teſtimony." Such a demand is eminently proper, when the point in diſpute is ſaid to be nearly and cloſely connected with the very being of chriſtianity itſelf. The ſacred books of the new-teſtament, if at all the rule of chriſtian truth, muſt be allowed to be ſo in inſtances that are thus highly intereſting and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant.</p>
            <p>IT were to be wiſhed, theſe inſpired books had been more generally honored, as the only ſufficient rule of judgment, by thoſe who have wrote in favor of EPISCOPACY, upon the plan of a DIVINE RIGHT; and the rather, as they ſpeak of it, not meerly as an inſtitution of the goſpel, but an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially neceſſary one; inſomuch, that goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-ordinances

            <p>IN a matter of ſuch momentous concern, they would not have acted an unworthy part, if they had confined their pleas to the ſacred writings; producing ſuch paſſages from them as ſpeak to the point, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly and darkly; but in peremptory and expreſs terms, ſo as to leave no reaſonable room for heſitation or doubt. It would be diſhonorary to the BIBLE, and a groſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on the penmen of it, to call that an "appointment of Chriſt," and an "eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially neceſſary" one, which is not contained in this ſacred volume, and with ſuch clearneſs and preciſion, that ſober and impartial inquirers may readily perceive it to be there, without foreign help to aſſiſt their ſight. And yet, ſuch help is made neceſſary by epiſcopal-writers. They ſcarce ever fail of turning us to the FATHERS in vindication of their cauſe; hereby vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually reflecting diſgrace on the ſcriptures, as though they were inſufficient, ſimply of themſelves, to bring this controverſy to an iſſue.</p>

               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:012009_0012_0F89415AEDD696B0"/>WE object not againſt paying all due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the primitive worthies, who were called after the name of Chriſt, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored that name by their faithful labors in the ſervice of the goſpel. But we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, our Savior has bid us "call no man maſter on earth," as we have "a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in heaven," the only one he will allow us to own by that name. We cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but judge it unwarrantable to take our ſentiments, relative to any chriſtian truth, from meer men, however pious, learned, or ancient; or however aſſembled in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils or ſynods. This, we imagine, would be a diſhonor to Chriſt, the founder and revealer of our holy religion. He has given us the writings of the evangeliſts and apoſtles to be the rule of our faith and practice; and it is, as we think, ſo perfect and ſufficient an one, that we have no need to have recourſe to <hi>human,</hi> and therefore fallible, writers, either ancient or modern; yea, it is our firm perſuaſion, that all that is delivered for "the truth as it is in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus" by the FATHERS of whatever age, ſtation, country, or character, ought to be judged of by this ſacred and unerring rule: and if what they ſay does not agree here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, there is, ſo far, no light nor truth in them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:012009_0013_0F89415BACBB56F8"/>IN order to reconcile the appeal that is ſo often made to the FATHERS with that honor which is due to the ſcriptures, the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalian-plea is, that they conſider theſe fathers, not as <hi>judges,</hi> but <hi>witneſſes</hi> only in their cauſe. But what are they brought to witneſs? Is it, that epiſcopacy is an inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt? If this is witneſſed to in the ſacred books, of which we, having theſe in our hands, are as good judges as they, it is ſufficient. There is no need of any foreign teſtimony. If it is not, no other teſtimony can ſupply this defect. Are theſe fathers cited as witneſſes to what was the PRACTICE in their day? This is now generally the pretence. They may, ſay the epiſcopalians, be properly appealed to, in order to know the truth of FACT in the ages in which they lived. And if, from their unanimous teſtimony, even from the firſt days of chriſtianity, it appears, that GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERNING and ORDAINING AUTHORITY was exerciſed by BISHOPS ONLY, in diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Preſbyters, and as an order in the the church above them, it would argue great arrogance, if not obſtinate perverſeneſs, to diſpute the divine original of epiſcopacy. But we muſt be excuſed, however perverſe we may be accounted, if we cannot bring
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:012009_0014_0F89415C71CA27A0"/>
our ſelves to think, that the practice of the church, ſince the apoſtles days, however univerſal, will juſtify our receiving that as an inſtitution of Chriſt, and an eſſentially important one, which he himſelf hath not clearly and evidently made ſo, either in his own perſon, or by thoſe inſpired writers, whom he commiſſioned and inſtructed to declare his will: nor can we believe, the great author of chriſtianity would have put the profeſſors of it to the difficult, I may ſay, as to moſt of them, the impoſſible taſk of collecting any thing eſſential to their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from the voluminous records of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. We are rather perſuaded, he has ordered every article that is neceſſary, either in point of faith or practice, to be ſo fairly and legibly wrote by the ſacred penmen, as that there ſhould be no need of having recourſe to the ancient Fathers as WITNESSES, any more than judges, to aſcertain his mind. To ſuppoſe the contrary, would, in reality of conſtruction, ſubſtitue TRADITION the rule of eſſential truth, in the room of the SCRIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURES, which were "given by inſpiration of God;" or, at leaſt, make the former ſo much a part of this rule, as that the latter, without it, would not be ſufficiently compleat. Such diſhonor ought not to be caſt on
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:012009_0015_0F89415D2C4C8BB0"/>
the one only ſtandard of the real mind of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>NOT that we ſhould be under any fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful apprehenſion, was the epiſcopal-diſpute to be decided SOLELY by what can be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be FACT, reſpecting the practice of the church before the coming on of thoſe ages, in which it is known that ſuperſtition and corruption had unhappily got mixed with moſt, if not all the appointments of Jeſus Chriſt. It has indeed been long given out, and of late with more poſitive aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance than common, that within the two firſt centuries, thoſe pureſt and truly primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ones, and all along through them, as well as in after ages, UNIVERSAL CONSENT is juſtly pleadable in favor of epiſcopacy. The deſign of the enſuing work is to put it in the power of all intelligent readers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learned or unlearned, to judge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this matter; and that they might be able to do it upon juſt and ſolid grounds, not here and there a detached teſtimony, from this and the other ſelected father, is brought to view, but the WHOLE, until towards the cloſe of the ſecond century, they have ALL ſaid relative to the affair of Biſhops. If the conſent of the church, through this long
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:012009_0016_0F89415DEC8FA760"/>
and important period, without which it is impoſſible it ſhould be UNIVERSAL, can be known at all, it may be known in this way; and it is the only one in which it can be known with any degree of certainty. The diſpute about epiſcopacy, ſo far as it depends upon UNIVERSAL CONSENT, may be fairly and fully determined by every one for himſelf, by what is herewith offered to his peruſal.</p>
            <p>THE method, according to which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to proceed, is this eaſy and plain one. The fathers will be diſtinctly mentioned one by one, their characters given, their writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſpecified, and what they ſay relative to EPISCOPACY faithfully ſet down, with ſuch obſervations and remarks as may be thought needful. And they will ſeverally be brought to view in the order in which they are commonly placed, by the learned in ſubjects of this nature; or, in other words, according to the time, in which it is ſuppoſed they wrote. <note n="*" place="bottom">It may be proper to give notice to the reader, that, in ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the date of the reſpective writings, from which I have extracted, I have only referred in general to the opinion of others, verſed in this kind of learning. It would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a volume of itſelf, to have fixed the moſt probable date of each writing, and to have aſſigned the reaſons, why this date, rather than any other was pitched upon; which would have been a needleſs labour to me, and of no benefit to the reader, in the preſent caſe.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:012009_0017_0F89415F923967C0"/>ONLY, before I proceed, I would make the following reaſonable requeſt. It is, that every one would keep critically in view, as he goes along, the SPECIFIED FACT in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. And that he may be able to do this without miſtake, I ſhall, in a few words, diſtinctly point it out.</p>
            <p>THE Biſhop, in whoſe defence an appeal is made to antiquity, is not related, by his office, to a ſingle congregation of chriſtians only, with one or more Preſbyters belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it; but his charge is a DIOCESS, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of a number of congregations, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or leſs, with their reſpective Preſbyters. The inquiry therefore is, whether it be an UNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERSALLY ATTESTED FACT, that epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, in this ſenſe, took place in, and through, the two firſt ages? A Biſhop, at the head of a number of congregations, greater or leſs, is an officer in the church of Chriſt quite different from the paſtor of a ſingle congregation; though he ſhould be called Biſhop, as being the HEAD-PRESBYTER, or veſted with the character of PRIMUS INTER PARES. It ſhould be particularly noted, which of theſe kinds of epiſcopacy has the voice of the ſpecified antiquity in its favor. It is willingly left with every man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:012009_0018_0F8941602C310CA0"/>
underſtanding, after he has gone over the following teſtimonies, to ſay, whether he thinks, that Biſhops, after the DIOCESANMODE, were known in the firſt ages of the church?</p>
            <p>THE Biſhop, for whom the fathers are called in as WITNESSES, is an officer in the church of an ORDER SUPERIOR to that of Preſbyters, and as diſtinct from it as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Preſbyters is for that of Deacons; the pretence being this, that Preſbyters were thought to have, in primitive times, no more right to meddle with the peculiar work of Biſhops, than Deacons have to concern themſelves with the peculiar work of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. The queſtion therefore is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will appear, from the following evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to be at all a FACT, much leſs an UNIVERSALLY known, and certainly atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one, that there were Biſhops, in this ſenſe, in any church, in any part of the chriſtian world, within the two firſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies?</p>
            <p>THE Biſhop, in whoſe favor the ancient Fathers are ſaid univerſally to ſpeak, is one to whom the EXCLUSIVE RIGHT OF GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERNMENT has been committed by the appointment of Jeſus Chriſt, or his apoſtles
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:012009_0019_0F894160ECE18468"/>
as commiſſioned by him. Says the famous Biſhop Hoadly, treating of the government of the church, as belonging to Biſhops only, in the above appropriated ſenſe, <note n="*" place="bottom">Reaſonableneſs of conformity to the church of England, p. 326, 327.</note>
               <q>And here—I think I may ſay, that we have as univerſal and as unanimous a teſtimony of all writers, and hiſtorians from the apoſtles days, as could reaſonably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected or deſired: every one, who ſpeaks of the government of the church, in any place, witneſſing, that epiſcopacy was the ſettled form; and every one, who hath occaſion to ſpeak of the original of it, tracing it up to the apoſtles days, and fixing it upon their decree.—Were there only teſtimonies to be produced, that this was the government of the church in all ages, it would be but reaſonable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it of apoſtolical inſtitution;—but when we find the ſame perſons witneſſing, not only that it was epiſcopal, but that it was of apoſtolical inſtitution, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down from the beginning as ſuch, this adds weight to the matter, and makes it more undoubted. So that here are two points to which they bear witneſs, that this was the government of the church
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:012009_0020_0F894161AD8FAE58"/>
in their days, and that it was of apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical inſtitution. And in theſe there is ſuch a conſtancy and unanimity, that even St. Jerom himſelf traces up epiſcopacy to the very apoſtles, and makes it of their inſtitution.</q>
— He adds,
<q>All churches and chriſtians, as far as we know, ſeem to have been agreed, in this point, amidſt all their other differences, as univerſally as can well be imagined.</q>
One would ſuppoſe, from the peremptory manner in which this citation is expreſſed, that the FACT it affirms was ſo evidently clear, as to leave no room for the leaſt doubt. Thoſe, who may think it worth while to look over the <hi>teſtimonies</hi> brought to view, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing pages, will perhaps, by critically ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their real and juſt import, be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, that any man of learning, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes a regard to truth, ſhould ſpeak of it, and with ſuch a degree of aſſurance, as the UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF ALL AGES from the apoſtles, that epiſcopacy, in the impleaded ſenſe, was the "form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the church in their day," and that it was by "apoſtolical inſtitution;" eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if they ſhould not be able to find, as it is certain they will not, ſo much as a ſingle witneſs, for two hundred years,
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:012009_0021_0F8941626C9613E8"/>
whoſe evidence is clear, direct, expreſs, and full, in affirming, either that this was the form of government in the church, or that it was ever inſtituted by Chriſt, or his aoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles: ſo far is it from the truth, that this is a FACT UNANIMOUSLY and CONSTANTLY TESTIFIED TO, even from the beginning, and through all ages.</p>
            <p>THE Biſhop, for the ſupport of whoſe claims antiquity is repaired to, is one with whom the SOLE POWER of ORDINATION is lodged; inſomuch, that he only can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey holy orders conformably to the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Jeſus Chriſt; and ſhould Preſbyters preſume to do this, they would take that upon them which they have no more a right to, than Deacons have to baptiſe, or admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Lord's ſupper. This part of the UNANIMOUS report of ALL AGES concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the EXCLUSIVE RIGHT of Biſhops de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves moſt of all the ſpecial notice of the reader; and he is particularly deſired, as he goes along, to point out to himſelf, for his own ſatisfaction; or to others, for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, any one among all the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies he will have placed before his view, that plainly and directly affirms the RIGHT OF ORDINATION to be peculiar to Biſhops as a diſtinct order from Preſbyters, and ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to them; or that this right was ever thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:012009_0022_0F8941632CA12008"/>
by them. If he ſhould not be able to do this, as unqueſtionably he will not, how ſtrange muſt that affirmation appear, which ſays, in the moſt poſitive terms, not only that this is FACT, but a fact CONSTANTLY and UNANIMOUSLY witneſſed to by the fathers, in ALL AGES from the days of the apoſtles.</p>
            <p>THE Biſhop, in whoſe defence antiquity is pleaded, is veſted with the power of CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIRMATION, according to the mode of the church of England; and it is appropriated to him as his right in diſtinction from all others. But I need not aſſure the reader, he will in vain look to find it a FACT, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the two firſt ages, that Biſhops were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther veſted with, or ever exerciſed this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. For he muſt come down below theſe ages, before a word is ſaid, by any one of the fathers, relative to this ſuperſtitious practice. Tertullian is the firſt that mentions it; and he mentions likewiſe ſome other corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which had got mingled with chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity in that day.</p>
            <p>IN ſhort, the queſtion in debate, ſo far as it relates to FACT, is, not whether there were officers in the chriſtian church, known by the name of Biſhops in the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolic age, and down along through the two firſt centuries? We join with the epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:012009_0023_0F894163ECDA1610"/>
in affirming this to be a truth univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally teſtified to in thoſe times: but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per queſtion is, what is FACT with refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the ORDER of theſe Biſhops, and the POWERS PECULIAR TO THEIR OFFICE, and as EXERCISED by them in it? The name of Biſhop is one thing, and the POWER claimed for, or exerciſed by him, is another. The diſpute is, not about the name, but the POWER appropriated to it. This therefore ſhould be heedfully attended to by all, in their examination of the evidences that will be produced; and they may, in this way, clearly and ſatisfactorily determine, each one for himſelf, whether it be at all an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted FACT, much leſs a CONSTANT and UNANIMOUSLY ATTESTED ONE, from the apoſtles days, and down along through the two firſt ages, as well as after ones, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were veſted with, and did actually exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, the above ſpecified powers, which are at this day claimed for them, as the appropriate work of their office by divine appointment?</p>
            <p>HAVING thus prepared the way, I now go on to introduce the FATHERS, and point out what they ſay upon the head of EPIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COPACY; and ſhall do it in the order that has been mentioned.</p>

            <head>BARNABAS.</head>
            <p>WE read, in the ſacred books, of an eminent convert to the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian faith, under the name of Barnabas. If our Barnabas was this venerable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he is juſtly placed <hi>firſt</hi> among the writers in our propoſed collection. For he lived in the days of the apoſtles, was then a preacher of the goſpel, and a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-laborer with Paul in a ſpecial miſſion to the gentile nations, to which they were both ſeparated by expreſs direction of the Holy Ghoſt. But whether he was this Barnabas, or ſome other perſon, in or near the apoſtolic age, who was called by this name, or choſe, for certain ends, to borrow it, is a point in which neither an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient nor modern writers are agreed; as we ſhall preſently have occaſion to make evident. If he was the ſcripture-Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas, the beſt account of him is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="16"
                   facs="unknown:012009_0025_0F8941656DE5C568"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the new-teſtament-books, which every one is at liberty to conſult at his leiſure. If he was not this Barnabas, we can know nothing about him, with any degree of certainty, but what may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the epiſtle that goes under this name.</p>
            <p>I SHALL not amuſe the reader with the hiſtory of his ſuppoſed ſufferings, as a martyr for the cauſe of Chriſt; much leſs with the MIRABILIA that are told of him, and with an air of too much faith, even by Arch-Biſhop Wake, as well as Dr. Cave. For, to ſpeak the truth, I pay no regard to the idle legandary ſtories, invented by monks, and other eccleſiaſtics, in the Roman church, after the viſible riſe of anti-chriſt, to impoſe upon the people to ſerve their own baſe and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſigns.</p>
            <p>LEAVING therefore theſe extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as not worthy of notice, I go on to ſpeak of his works. Tertullian ſeems to have been of the opinion, that he was the author of the epiſtle to the Hebrews; for he plainly quotes it as his: but it is, with Jerom, a matter of doubt, whether it
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012009_0026_0F8941662C958F18"/>
ought to be aſcribed to him, or Luke, or Clement, or Paul. It does not appear, that Barnabas wrote any thing more than an epiſtle that is ſtill extant, at leaſt in part, both in greek and latin. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin is thought to be a very ancient ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the greek; though, when, in what country, or by what hand, it was tranſlated, none, ſo far as I can learn, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo much as to conjecture. Neither the greek or latin copies are perfect. The beginning is wanting in the greek, and the end in the Latin. <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Lardener ſays of this epiſtle, "It is entire in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin verſion." Cotelerius declares the contrary. His words are theſe, "Vetus antem interpretatio eſt imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecta et mutila, tum paſſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m, tum precipue ad finem, ubi poſteriora capita reſecantur." The exact truth is, neither the greek or old latin copies are complete; but as the latin contains what was wanting in the greek, and the greek what was wanting in the latin, between them both the epiſtle is made entire.</note> Dr. Cave, who was apt to entertain as high an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ancient writings as they deſerve, deſcribes the epiſtle of Barnabas in the following words.
<q>The frame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of it is intricate and obſcure, made up of uncouth allegories, forced and improbable interpretations of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; though the main deſign of it is to ſhew, that the chriſtian religion has
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012009_0027_0F894166EDC68568"/>
ſuperſeded the rites and ceremonies of the Moſaic law. The latter part of it contains an uſeful and excellent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, managed under the notion of two ways; the one of light, the other of darkneſs; the one under the guidance of the angels of God, the other under the conduct of the angels of ſatan, the prince of the iniquity of the age.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE chief difficulty, relative to this epiſtle, is to know, whether the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Barnabas was its author, or ſome other perſon, really of this name, or by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary aſſumption.</p>
            <p>SOME of the ancient Fathers ſeem to have been of the mind, that the Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas, who was Paul's companion, was the writer of it. Clement of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria quotes it in that form, "ſays the apoſtle Barnabas." Origin, in his anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to Celſus, gives this epiſtle the title of catholic, "the catholic epiſtle of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas;" which it is ſuppoſed he would not have done, had he not eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its author to have been the Barnabas,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012009_0028_0F894167ADD20E88"/>
whoſe memory is celebrated in the inſpired writings. Others, among the fathers, to ſay the leaſt, were in doubt, whether this epiſtle was wrote by Barnabas, who, with Paul, was "ſeparated to the work, whereunto the Holy Ghoſt had called them." Euſebius and Jerom both reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it among the "apocryphal books;" and doubtleſs for the ſame reaſon. What this is, we may learn from the epiſtle of the latter of theſe fathers to Laeta, in which he ſays, "Thoſe books are apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal that do not belong to the authors whoſe name they bear."</p>
            <p>THE moderns differ likewiſe in their judgment. Pearſon, Cave, Du-pin, Wake, and others, ſuppoſe the ſcripture-Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas to have been the writer of this epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. Cotelerius rather thinks it was ſome other perſon <note n="*" place="bottom">"—magis inclino ut cenſeam, non eſſe apoſtoli." And again, "Certe vix credi poteſt, quod adeo eximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us apoſtolus—ea ſcripſerit quae in opuſculo preſenti con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinentur; coactas dico allegorias, enarrationes ſcriptura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum minus veriſimiles, fabulas de animalibus, aliaque."—</note> of this name, or that appeared under it. <note n="†" place="bottom">It may ſeem ſtrange to many, that writers, in the firſt ages of chriſtianity, ſhould appear, not under their own, but the names of thoſe who were in high reputation in their day. But the fact is inconteſtibly true. Says the learned Dr. Cave, "If it ſhall be inquired, why a man, after much pains, ſhould chuſe to publiſh his labors rather under another man's name than his own; there needs no other anſwer, than that this has been an old trade, which ſome men have taken up, either becauſe it was their humour to lay their own children at other men's doors, or to decline the cenſure which the notions they publiſhed were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to expoſe them to, or principally to conciliate the greater eſteem and value for them, by thruſting them forth under the name of thoſe for whom the world have a juſt regard and veneration."

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012009_0029_0F8941687350B030"/>
opinion, it is utterly unworthy of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a man as the Barnabas celebrated in the inſpired books. Baſnage and Jones have largely offered their objections againſt this epiſtle as the genuine work of Barnabas, the companion of Paul. And they appear to me, I truly confeſs, to be unanſwerable. It would carry me too far out of my way to give ſo much as an abſtract of theſe objections. I ſhall content myſelf with only tranſcribing a few paſſages in this epiſtle, as tranſlated by Arch-Biſhop Wake; leaving it with every judicious reader to ſay, whether he can think it at all probable, that ſuch a man as the ſcripture-Barnabas is known to have been, could have been the author
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012009_0030_0F8941692C29A230"/>
of them; a convert to the faith in the days of Chriſt; one perſonally acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the apoſtles; a fellow-laborer with them, by the expreſs appointment of heaven, in ſpreading the name and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Chriſt; and, in a word, one that is characteriſed by an inſpired pen as "a good man, full of the Holy Ghoſt, and of faith." Acts xi. 24.</p>
            <p>THE paſſages, I would bring to view, are theſe that follow.</p>
            <p>SECT. V.—"And when he choſe his apoſtles, which were afterwards to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh his goſpel, he took men that had been VERY GREAT SINNERS; that thereby he might plainly ſhew, "he came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance."</p>
            <p>THIS paſſage, in the Arch-Biſhop's tranſlation, may not appear very ſtriking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceptionable; but it really is ſo, both in the original greek, and old latin verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. What he tranſlates, "men that had been very great ſinners," is in the greek, <hi>uper paſan amartian anomôterous</hi>; juſtly tranſlated by Cotelerius, "omni peccato iniquiores." The old lattin ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012009_0031_0F894169EFC92398"/>
has it, "ſuper omne peccatum, pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catores;" in literal engliſh, "ſinners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all ſin." It is readily allowed, the mode of diction is hyperbolical. But the thought intended to be conveyed could be nothing ſhort of this, that the apoſtles of our Lord had been "the worſt of men, the vileſt of all ſinners." Is this the truth of fact? Will any thing, in the new-teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-books, juſtify this account of them? It is a falſe ſlanderous report, <note n="*" place="bottom">Cotelerius, in his note upon this paſſage, cites the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, from Origen's firſt book againſt Celſus, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end, 'extat ſane in Barnabae Catholica epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtola ſcriptum.

No ſuch reaſon was ever given by our Lord, or any of his inſpired apoſtles.</p>
            <p>SECT. IX.—"Underſtand therefore, children, theſe things more fully, that Abraham, who was the firſt that brought in circumciſion, looking forward in the ſpirit to Jeſus, circumciſed, having receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012009_0032_0F89416B9613A450"/>
the myſtery of THREE LETTERS. For the ſcripture ſays, "Abraham circumciſed THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN men of his houſe." But what therefore was the myſtery that was made known to him? Mark, firſt the EIGHTEEN; and next the THREE HUNDRED. For the numeral letters of TEN and EIGHT are I.H; and theſe denote JESUS. And becauſe the CROSS was that by which we were to find grace, therefore he adds, <hi>three hundred,</hi> the note of which is T [the figure of his croſs]. Wherefore, by two letters, he ſignified JESUS, and by the third his CROSS. He who has put the engrafted gift of his doctrine within us knows, that I never taught to any one a more certain truth: but I truſt that ye are worthy of it."</p>
            <p>SECT. X. "But why did Moſes ſay, "Ye ſhall not eat of the ſwine, neither the eagle, nor the hawk, nor the crow, nor any fiſh that has not a ſcale upon him?" I anſwer, that, in the ſpiritual ſenſe, he comprehended three doctrines that were to be gathered from thence. Beſides which he ſays to them in the book of Deuteronomy, "and I will give my ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012009_0033_0F89416C2E7FC348"/>
unto this people." Wherefore, it is not the command of God that they ſhould not eat theſe things; but Moſes in the ſpirit ſpake to them. Now, "the ſow he forbad them to eat"; meaning thus much, thou ſhalt not join thyſelf to ſuch perſons as are like unto ſwine.—"Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhalt thou eat of the hare." To what end? To ſignify this to us, thou ſhalt not be an adulterer, nor liken thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſuch perſons. For the hare eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year multiplies the places of its concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and as many years as it lives, ſo many it has. "Neither ſhalt thou eat of the hyaena;" that is, again, be not an adulterer, nor a corrupter of others, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be like unto ſuch. And wherefore ſo? Becauſe that creature every year changes its kind, and is ſometimes male, and ſometimes female. For which cauſe alſo he juſtly hated the weeſel; to the end they ſhould not be like ſuch perſons, who with their mouths commit wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by reaſon of their uncleanneſs; nor join themſelves with thoſe impure wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who with their mouths commit wickedneſs; becauſe that animal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives with its mouth." Moſes therefore ſpeaking as concerning meats, delivered
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012009_0034_0F89416CF08EAA00"/>
indeed three great precepts to them in the ſpiritual ſignification of thoſe commands. But they, according to the deſires of the fleſh, underſtood him as if he had only meant it of meats. And therefore David took aright the knowledge of his threefold command, ſaying in like manner; "bleſſed is the man that hath not walked in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the ungodly;" as the fiſhes before mentioned in the bottom of the deep in darkneſs: "nor ſtood in the way of ſinners;" as they who ſeem to fear the Lord, but yet ſin as the ſow. "And hath not ſat in the ſeat of the ſcorners;" as thoſe birds who ſit and watch that they may devour. Here you have the law concerning meat perfectly ſet forth, and according to the true knowledge of it.</p>
            <p>THESE paſſages are only a very ſmall part of thoſe, in which the ſcriptures are placed, in this epiſtle, in a moſt ludicrous point of light. It is, as I imagine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of man to reconcile ſuch trifling, uncouth, romantic explications of the holy word of God, with the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent character it has given us of the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic-Barnabas.</p>
            <p>I SHALL only add, no mention is made, in this epiſtle, of Biſhops, or Preſbyters;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012009_0035_0F89416DAC803640"/>
nor the leaſt hint given, from whence it may be collected, what was this writer's opinion about either of them. Both the greek and latin copies are abſolutely ſilent with reference to every thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted between the epiſcopalians and preſbyterians: for which reaſon I have ſaid leſs of this primitive writer, than might otherwiſe have been proper. I ſhall obſerve the ſame rule, reſpecting thoſe other fathers, whoſe writings have not reached us, or contain nothing in them to the purpoſe of the argument we are upon.</p>

            <head>DIONYSIUS AREOPAGITA.</head>
            <p>THIS Dionyſius is ſtiled the areopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gite, partly to diſtinguiſh him from ſeveral others of the ſame name; but principally becauſe he is thus pointed out by the inſpired writer of the book of the acts.</p>
            <p>THE areopagite-ſenate, ſo denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the famous areopagus, a court-houſe, built upon a hill in Athens, was the moſt ſacred and venerable tribunal in Greece. All the greater and more capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal cauſes were brought before it; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially matters of religion, blaſphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the gods, and contempt of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly myſteries. Dionyſius is ſuppoſed to have been one of the judges, when Paul was arraigned before this ſenate, as "a ſetter forth of ſtrange gods" for "preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jeſus and anaſtaſis," or the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is ſaid, and upon juſt grounds, that he was converted by this apoſtle, while, in the midſt of mars-hall, he made the addreſs to the men of Athens, recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012009_0037_0F89416F2DA16580"/>
in the 17th Chapter of the Acts. For though we are told, that "ſome mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed" at this preaching; it is alſo affirmed, that "certain men believed, among the which was Dionyſius the areopagite." Acts xvii. 32, 34.</p>
            <p>NOTHING more is recorded, in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred books, concerning this truly primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive father. Euſebius ſays, "he was the firſt Biſhop of Athens; and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces Dionyſius of Corinth mentioning the ſame thing. <note n="*" place="bottom">H. E. Lib. 3. cap. 4. lib. 4. cap. 22.</note> No further notice is taken of him, until we come to ages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from that in which he lived; on which account no great regard is to be paid to the commendations that are there beſtowed on him, in the higheſt ſtrains of hyperbolical language.</p>
            <p>NUMEROUS are the writings ſaid to be left by this Dionyſius; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon only I have given him, among the other fathers, a place in this work. Some there are who ſtrenuouſly plead for theſe writings as genuine; though it is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally thought by proteſtants, and by ſome of fame even in the roman commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that they are falſely attributed to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012009_0038_0F89416FEDC291B0"/>
him. None have wrote more largely, or with greater learning, in proof of their being ſpurious, than Monſieur D'aille; who has ſaid enough to convince all, that are capable of conviction, that this is their true character. The learned Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin not only entertained this opinion of them, but has ſaid that which is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſufficient to lead others into the ſame judgment about them. I ſhall here tranſcribe one of the many arguments, he has uſed to evidence their being ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious; and I have ſelected this for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that will obviouſly be ſuggeſted to the reader, when he ſees what may be offered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to the writings of another father, held in great reputation, at leaſt among ſome.</p>
            <p>HIS argument is this;
<q>The manner of the firſt appearing of theſe books ought to be ſuſpected. For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that, being unknown to all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, they were firſt quoted by the <hi>ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> heretics, in a conference holden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and the orthodox Biſhops at Conſtantinople, in the palace of the emperor <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> 532 years after the nativity of Jeſus Chriſt. The ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of all the ancient eccleſiaſtical
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012009_0039_0F894170ADAB3538"/>
writers is, without doubt, a very great prejudice to them; for who can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that ſo conſiderable an author as St. Denys (if theſe books had been real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compoſed by him) ſhould have been unknown to Euſebius and St. Jerom? And who can believe, that, if they had known them, they ſhould take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them, when they compoſed an exact catalogue of all the authors, of whom they had any knowledge; not omitting even thoſe that had <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> little reputation, that they were ſcarcely heard of in the world? Is it poſſible that Euſebius, in making mention of Dionyſius the aropagite, in tw<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſeveral places, ſhould not have obſerved, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his uſual method, that he had written ſeveral books? St. Jerom, in his epiſtle to Magnus, doth not omit the teſtimony of one ſingle author to prove, that it is lawful to make uſe of prophane books; whereas the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of St. Denys might have ſerved as a notable proof. Why then doth he not ſpeak ſo much as one word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them? He gives us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, in his catalogue, of Quadratus Biſhop of Athens, and of Ariſtides
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012009_0040_0F8941716CC9C648"/>
the athenian philoſopher: is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that St. Denys ſhould be more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure than theſe two writers, or leſs eſteemed by St. Jerom? How could it happen, that all the ancient writers mention St. Dionyſius the areopagite, as Dionyſius Corinthius, St. Chyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, St. Ambroſe, St. Auguſtine, and the author of the dialogues aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to St. Caeſarius, the brother of St. Gregory Nazianzen, ſhould give us no intimation of theſe books? In ſhort, why were theſe books, which contain many things relating to the doctrine and diſcipline of the chriſtian church, and that would have been of great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as proceeding from ſo ancient and conſiderable an author as St. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyſius the areopagite, never cited ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for, or againſt any heretic, or for the illuſtration of any point of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline before the ſixth age of the church?</q>—</p>
            <p>THE writings falſely atributed to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyſius the areopagite are as follow. A book "concerning the celeſtial hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy;" another of "the divine names," another of "myſtical divinity;" ten
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012009_0041_0F8941722C93B288"/>
epiſtles; four to "Caius," one to "Dorotheus," another to "Soſipater," another to "Polycarp," another to "De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mophilus," another to "Titus," another to "John the evangeliſt." Theſe have been printed, and reprinted, both in greek and latin, in many parts of Europe. Du-pin ſays, ſeveral other books were compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by this author, and quoted by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſuch as a book concerning "ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical knowledge;" another of "the ſoul;" another of "divine hymns;" another of the "juſt judgment of God; another of "thoſe things that are underſtood by the mind, and that may be perceived by the ſenſes."—But theſe are all loſt.</p>
            <p>THESE books, as Johannes Scotus, the firſt tranſlator of them into latin, tells us, are infinitely intricate and perplexed, far beyond the reach of modern apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and which few are able to pierce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by reaſon of the ſublimity of the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries whereof they treat. And, as Dr. Cave juſtly and judiciouſly obſerves,
<q>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was their genuine parent, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what account ſoever he wrote them, it is plain, that he laid the foundation of a myſtical and unintelligible divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012009_0042_0F894172F6D8F848"/>
among chriſtians, and that hence proceeded all thoſe wild roſicruſean notions, which ſome men are ſo fond of, and the life and practice whereof they cry up as the very ſoul and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the chriſtian religion. And that this author does immediately mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to this deſign, let the reader judge by one inſtance, and I aſſure him none of the moſt obſcure and intricate paſſages in theſe books.</q>
This inſtance he gives us, as he himſelf declares, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed word for word. It is as follows;
<q>God is known in all things, and without all things. He is known by knowledge, and by ignorance. There is both a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation of him, and a word, and a ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and a touch, and a ſenſe, and an opinion, and a name, and all other things; and yet, he is neither thought, nor ſpoken, nor named. He is not any thing of thoſe things that are, nor is he known in any of the things that are; he is both all things in all, and nothing in nothing; out of all things he is known to all, and out of nothing to nothing. Theſe are the things which we rightly diſcourſe concerning God. And this again is the moſt divine knowledge of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012009_0043_0F894173ABAE6368"/>
God, that which is known by ignorance, according to the union that is above un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; when the mind getting at a diſtance from all things that are, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſmiſſed itſelf, is united to thoſe ſuperilluſtrious beams from whence, and where, it is enlightened in the unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomable depths of wiſdom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>MORE of this, (ſay the Doctor,) and the like ſtuff is plentifully ſcattered up and down theſe books. And if this be not myſtical and profound enough, I know not what is; and which certainly any man, but one well verſed in this ſort of theology, would look upon as ſtrange jargon of nonſenſe and contradiction. And yet, this is the height of devotion and piety, which ſome men earneſtly preſs after, and wherein they glory: as if a man could not truly underſtand the myſteries of religion, until he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his reaſon; nor be a chriſtian, without firſt becoming an enthuſiaſt, nor be able to ſpeak ſenſe, unleſs in a language which none can underſtand.</q>

            <p>THIS Hermas has ſometimes been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for Hermes, brother to Pius I. an eccleſiaſtic beyond the middle of the ſecond century. The author of the "pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal" fathered upon Damaſus, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended "decretals of the Biſhops of Rome," together with ſome other ancient, as well as modern writers, have fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this error, as Du-pin calls it, and has, in common with many other learned men, proved it to be, from all the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive fathers, Clement of Alexandria, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, Origin, Euſebius, and Jerom; who always call him <hi>Hermas</hi> never <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:012009_0045_0F894175F283FDD8"/>IT is unqueſtionable, that there was, in the firſt age, a perſon of this name; as the apoſtle Paul, among other chriſtians at Rome, ſalutes <hi>Hermas</hi> by name. <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 16.14.</note> It is certain alſo, that ſeveral of the fathers thought the ſcripture-Hermas to be the ſame with him, of whom we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This was the opinion of Origin, Euſebius, and Jerom. But that he was really this perſon, is not certain: nor have we any particular account of his juſt character; where he lived; what he did in promoting the cauſe of Chriſt; when, how, and in what place, he died. Arch-Biſhop Wake, from ſome paſſages in his "Paſtor," mentions ſeveral things, by way of conjecture, deſcriptive of him; but, as the more ancient records are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent about him, I ſhall paſs from his perſon to his</p>

in antiquity. And yet, it is not eaſy to ſay, what its authority was in thoſe days. Irenaeus ſeems to quote it under <note n="*" place="bottom">"Bene ergo pronunciavit ſcriptura."</note> "the name of ſcripture." Clement of Alexandria introduces a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from it in that language, <note n="†" place="bottom">"Theios to Erma meta apokalupſin lalouſa."</note> "the power which ſpake divinely to Hermas by revelation." Tertullian, before his profeſſing himſelf a montaniſt, ſpeaks of it, if not with any high encomium, yet without intimating a ſuſpicion as if it was of no good authority. Origin calls it <note n="‡" place="bottom">"Valde mihi utilis videtur et, ut puto, divinitus inſpirata."</note> "a very uſeful writing, and in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on divinely inſpired. Euſebius brings it in doubted of, as to its "canonical au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;" but allows that it was received as a "juſtifiable book, publicly read in the churches, and quoted by ancient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors." Jerom ſtiles it, "a truly profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table book, cited by the greek fathers."</p>
               <p>BUT notwithſtanding all this, it is ſometimes even deſpiſed as a work of no value; and this, by ſome of the very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons above-named. Tertullian, after his
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:012009_0047_0F8941776CA857B0"/>
being infected with the monaſtical errors, ſpeaks of it in language denoting the higheſt contempt. It was ſays he, <note n="*" place="bottom">"Ab omni<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

"rejected by all the churches as a falſe and ſpurious writing." Origin ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times makes the ſuppoſition, <note n="†" place="bottom">"Si cui tamen libellus ille recipiendus videtur."</note> "if it be a book to be received;" and mentions it moreover, "as deſpiſed by ſome." Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom calls it <note n="‡" place="bottom">"Liber ille apocryphus ſtultitiae condemnandus eſt."</note> "an apocryphal book, to be condemned for the folly contained in it." Such difficulty is there in aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the true eſtimate put upon this writing in ancient times.</p>
               <p>NOR are the moderns united in the judgment they paſs on it. They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed unanimouſly agreed to renounce it as "a canonical book;" yet, they differ widely in the value they expreſs for it. Some receive it with reſpect, as "a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ancient piece;" while others look upon it as of "little worth." The learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Du-pin gives that account of it,
<q>It hath not been ſo much valued by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern authors; and there are very few,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012009_0048_0F8941782DA33658"/>
at preſent, that commend it, or that have the ſame regard to it as thoſe that lived in the primitive ages of the church. And indeed, if we may judge by the method according to which it is wrote, and by the things therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, it does not ſeem to deſerve much eſteem. The firſt part, entitled, "the viſions," is full of many revelations that are explained to Hermas by "a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man" repreſenting the church. They all relate to the ſtate of the church, and the manners of chriſtians. The ſecond part, which is moſt uſeful, is called "the ordinances," wherein are compriſed diverſe precepts of morality, and pious inſtructions, which the paſtor," or "angel of Hermas" pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to him. The third part is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the "ſimilitudes," becauſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with ſeveral "ſimilies," or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons, and concludes with viſions. Theſe three books comprehend very many moral inſtructions concerning the practice of chriſtian virtues; but the great number of viſions, allegories, and ſimilitudes, make them tedious. And all theſe moral truths would, in my opinion, have been more uſeful, if

the author had propounded them ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, as the apoſtles had done in their epiſtles.</q>

               <p>THIS work was penned in greek; though we have now extant only an old latin verſion. Barthius ſuppoſes it not to have been tranſlated until the days of Jerom, becauſe that writer ſpeaks of it as "much uſed among the greeks, but ſcarce known to the latins" But Cote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius herein oppoſes him, proving it to have been read, by ſeveral of the latins before the age of Jerom; and probably they read it in the preſent tranſlation: though it is not known, at this day, by whom it was made: nor can the time of writing this "paſtor" be brought, with certainty, to an exact period. Arch-Biſhop Wake places it the laſt piece but one in his "apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical fathers." He might probably think it was wrote after the epiſtles of Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius and Polycarp. But it is moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſed to have been wrote much ſooner. Some place its date about the year 90, a little before the diocleſian perſecution which he is thought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to in his "fourth viſion." Others
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012009_0050_0F894179AD57D578"/>
are perſuaded, it was wrote ſooner yet, before the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, and not many years after ſome of the epiſtles of the apoſtle Paul. Of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was the learned Dodwell; and he ſays that in defence of it, which is well worthy of conſideration.</p>

               <head>OBSERVATIONS and REMARKS upon the foregoing teſtimonies.</head>
               <p>FROM theſe paſſages in Hermas, which are all I can find to the purpoſe of the preſent controverſy, the reader may, in ſome meaſure, perceive the obſcurity, with which his writings are perplexed. It appears that he has, here and there, drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a few words that bear relation to the point we are upon; but what he has ſaid is generally ſo blended with viſionary or parabolical matter, that it is not eaſy, by any rational connection in his diſcourſe, to determine his meaning; and if we would underſtand him, we muſt ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily confine ourſelves to the words bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they lie; unleſs, by comparing them with others of the like import, in other parts of his writing, we may be helped in fixing their true ſenſe.</p>
               <p>BUT dark as he is, there are ſome plain intimations, that the world, in his day, were not acquainted with Biſhops, as offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſuperior in their ORDER to Preſbyters; yea, that the churches were ſo far from being modelled after the preſent epiſcopal form, that the management of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:012009_0058_0F8941806F733F50"/>
affairs was in the hands, not of SINGLE PERSONS, but a PLURALITY; and this, of EQUAL RANK. It is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon phraſe in theſe writings, "qui praeſunt eccleſiae," that is, "who are ſet over the church." And leſt it ſhould be pretended, the word, church, is uſed to ſignify the church-catholic, in which ſenſe it might be true, that it had a plurality ſet over it, though parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular churches had only a ſingle Biſhop at their head: I ſay, to take away all ground for ſuch a pretence, we have ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable paſſage as that, <note n="*" place="bottom">Viſ. II. Sect. IV.</note> "And thou (Hermas) ſhalt read in THIS CITY with the elders who are ſet over the church." A more expreſs teſtimony could not well be given to this FACT, that the church of Rome, at leaſt, was, in this age, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, not by any <hi>ſingle paſtor</hi> but a <hi>plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,</hi> which plurality were <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> or if you pleaſe <hi>Biſhops</hi>; meaning hereby the SAME ORDER of officers in the church. For it is remarkable, the word, Biſhops, (Epiſcopi) is explained by Hermas him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſignify, "Praeſides eccleſiarum;" <note n="†" place="bottom">Sim. IX. Sect. XXVII.</note> that is to ſay, he deſcribes Biſhops by
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:012009_0059_0F8941812D411158"/>
their being "thoſe who are ſet over the church;" and thoſe who are "ſet over the church" he expreſſly calls <note n="*" place="bottom">Viſ. II. Sect. IV.</note> ("Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niores") Elders, or Preſbyters; ſo that, as it happily falls out, Biſhops and Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, according to Hermas's own explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf, are one and the ſame offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the church, ſpoken of promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly, as in the new-teſtament-writings, under the names of Biſhops or Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</p>
               <p>BUT that this matter may be ſet in a yet ſtronger point of light, I ſhall bring to view, and conſider, what is brought from Hermas in favor of the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he is ſuppoſed, by epiſcopalian writers, to make between Biſhops and Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And,</p>
               <p>THE firſt paſſage to this purpoſe, we have in Viſ. II. Sect. IV, in which it is ſaid, "Thou ſhalt write two books, and ſend one to Clement, and one to Grapte. And Clement ſhall ſend it to the foreign cities; for to him it is permitted." In theſe words, ſome are ſo ſharp-ſighted as
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:012009_0060_0F894181EDA637E0"/>
to perceive plain evidence of epiſcopal ſuperiority. For, ſay they, Clement was now Biſhop of Rome, and the care of "ſending this book," or letter, to the "foreign cities," was devolved on him, without all doubt, in virtue of his office, as head of the church; to whom, upon this account, this buſineſs moſt properly belonged.</p>
               <p>THE anſwer is eaſy. That Clement was now Biſhop of Rome, meaning here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſingle head, or governor of this church, is ſo far from being probable, that the direct contrary hereto is moſt evidently ſignified by Hermas's "paſtor," in the latter part of this very paragraph; where he ſpeaks of the church of Rome as under the government, not of any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſon. And thou "ſhalt read in THIS CITY with the ELDERS who are ſet over the church:" which words, I am perſuaded, can never be made to conſiſt with Clement's being now the epiſcopal head of this church. He might, at this time, be related to the church of Rome, as one of their Biſhops, or Elders; and he might alſo be the moſt accompliſhed and diſtinguiſhed among them; the moſt
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:012009_0061_0F894182AC6036D8"/>
known, valued, and reſpected: to whom, upon theſe accounts, it might be given in charge, rather than to any of the other Elders or Biſhops, to ſend this book, or epiſtle; but not becauſe it ſo belonged to him of right, and in virtue of his office, as that it could not have been devolved upon any other. It does not appear, either from Hermas, or any other ancient writer, that the care of ſending letters to the churches was the work of Biſhops, as a peculiar badge of their office. The moſt capable, or moſt univerſally known officer, in any church, might ordinarily be pitched upon to do this; and nothing more can be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued from it, than that he was thought the beſt qualified perſon for ſuch a work. Moſt certainly, it is too trifling a matter on which to found a diſtinction of order between the officers of a church.</p>
               <p>THE next paſſage recurred to we have, in Viſ. III. Sect. V. in which are theſe words; "The ſquare and the white ſtones are the Apoſtles, and Biſhops, and Doctors, and Miniſters, who, through the mercy of God, have come in, and exerciſed epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and taught, and miniſtred." Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telerius's note here is. "Hic habes.—In
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:012009_0062_0F8941836CB39A80"/>
Engliſh thus, "You have here the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct orders of the hierarchy, in apoſtles, in Biſhops exerciſing epiſcopacy, in Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or Preſbyters teaching, and in Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons miniſtring." And the common plea of prelatical writers, from this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, is, that the three officers of the church, <hi>Biſhops, Preſbyters,</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> are here directly mentioned; and the diſtinction of their offices plainly inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated by diſtinct work aſſigned them; the Biſhops being deſcribed by their "ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing epiſcopacy," the Doctors or Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters by their "teaching," and the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons by their "miniſtring."</p>
               <p>THIS turn given to the words, may, to thoſe who have not read the "paſtor of Hermas," carry the appearance of plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility; but, when fairly and impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined, they will be found to make nothing againſt the affirmation, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Preſbyters are one and the ſame order of officers in the church of Chriſt. Two things are here pleaded.</p>
               <p>THE firſt is, that direct mention is here made of three ſorts of officers in the church, viz. <hi>Biſhops, Doctors</hi> or <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="unknown:012009_0063_0F8941842DC34178"/>
and <hi>Miniſters</hi> or <hi>Deacons.</hi>" But if the word, <hi>Doctors,</hi> is here uſed exegeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally; not ſpecifying diſtinct officers from Biſhops, but meaning only a difference in the work of one and the ſame officers, there is plainly no force in the argument from this enumeration. And that this is really the truth of the matter, I ſhall now make evident, beyond all reaſonable diſpute, even from Hermas himſelf. In order whereto,</p>
               <p>LET us turn to Simil. IX. Sect. XXVII. where we have theſe words, "As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the tenth mountain, in which were trees that covered the cattle, they are ſuch as have believed, certain Biſhops, that is, perſons ſet over the churches,— and then ſuch as are ſet over the ſervices, who have protected the poor and widows," In this paſſage two or three things are very obſervable. (1) That the word, Biſhops, is particularly explained, and its ſenſe, as uſed in the writings of Hermas, punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually aſcertained: which I thus notice, preſuming it will be acknowledged rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſtand to that ſenſe of a word, in an author, which he himſelf has given of it. (2) It is plain, the words, "Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi," and "Praeſides eccleſiarum," do, in
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:012009_0064_0F894184EC0A17F8"/>
Hermas, ſignify preciſely one and the ſame thing. That is to ſay, "Biſhops," and "ſuch as are ſet over the church," do intend one and the ſame order of church-officers. For the explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, given by Hermas, of the word "Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops," is, their being perſons that are "ſet over the church." (3) Here are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently TWO, and ONLY TWO ORDERS of church-officers ſpecified; namely, <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi>: Biſhops, under that ſtile, "Praeſides eccleſiarum," perſons "ſet over the church;" and DEACONS, characteriſed by the phraſe, "Praeſides miniſteriorum," ſuch as were "ſet over the ſervices;" that is, that had the care of "the poor, and the widows," as follows in the next words; which perfectly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incide with the original reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Deacon's office, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe its proper work.</p>
               <p>THESE things conſidered, I fear not to ſay, that there is good reaſon, why, when Hermas ſpeaks of "Biſhops, and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and Miniſters," we ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the words, "Doctors," exegetically, or explicative of the word, "Biſhops;" not intending a diſtinct order of officers,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:012009_0065_0F894185ABA631C0"/>
but rather pointing our thoughts to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent work of the ſame officers. And, in truth, unleſs we interpret the word after this, or ſome ſuch ſenſe, we ſhall ſet Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas at odds with himſelf. For he has moſt punctually aſcertained the meaning of the word, "Biſhops," making it to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify preciſely the ſame thing with "prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides eccleſiarum," perſons "ſet over the church." Now the phraſe, "Praeſides ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiarum," is perfectly the ſame with, "qui praeſunt eccleſiae;" which, in Viſ. II. Sect. IV, is, in the moſt expreſs man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, applied to <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Elders.</hi> "Thou ſhalt read [cum Senioribus, qui praeſunt eccleſiae] with the <hi>Elders,</hi> or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> that are ſet over the church." So that, by the moſt eaſy and natural deduction, Biſhops and Preſbyters, according to Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, are the SAME ORDER of officers in the church: Nor can Hermas be ever made conſiſtent with himſelf, unleſs, when he ſpeaks of "Biſhops and Doctors," we take him to uſe the word, "Doctors," as exegetical of the word, "Biſhops," or a ſynonimous expletive; meaning only the ſame order of perſons by both theſe terms. And, this interpretation will appear more eaſy, if it be conſidered, that the words,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:012009_0066_0F89418751FE5A90"/>
"Biſhops" and "Doctors," are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed in the writings of all antiquity, as ſynonimous terms. Nor is the term, "Doctor," ever appropriated to Preſbyters in diſtinction from Biſhops. Far from this, even after the diſtinction between Biſhops obtained in the church, the word, "Doctors", is commonly applied to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: nor was it ever an appropriated term to point out Preſbyters in diſtinction from Biſhops.</p>
               <p>MOREOVER, it ought to be conſidered, Hermas never makes the like enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, "Apoſtles, and Biſhops, and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and Miniſters;" but ſeveral times makes another, by which this ought, in all reaſon, to be explained. In Simil IV. Sect. XV. it is ſaid, "the forty ſtones are the Apoſtles and Doctors of the preaching of the ſon of God. Again, in Sim. ib. Sect. XVI. Theſe ſame "forty ſtones" are explained to mean, "the Apoſtles and Doctors of the preaching of the name of the Son of God." Yet again Sim. ib. Sect. XXV. We read of ſuch as "be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Apoſtles and certain Doctors, who ſincerely preached the word." In all theſe places, mention is made only of
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:012009_0067_0F894187EC62D6B8"/>
"Apoſtles" and "Doctors." But, if Doctors did not mean the ſame thing with Biſhops, it is very extraordinary, and no epiſcopalian can account for it, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſhould always be omitted in theſe enumerations, and "Doctors" always men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. And truly, by this frequent coupling of Apoſtles and Doctors, it is quite natural to think, that Doctors were, in the opinion of Hermas, the next offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the church to Apoſtles, and by no means an order INFERIOR to Biſhops.</p>
               <p>IT may be properly added, as Hermas had been ſpeaking of "four-cornered ſtones," it is highly probable, if not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that he mentions the four names, "apoſtles, Biſhops, Doctors, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters," only to make out ſomething that might look like an analogy. In other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where he had not to do with "ſquare ſtones," he gives us no ſuch enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For myſelf, I am fully perſuaded, we ſhould not have had it here, had it not been for this trifling circumſtance. Put if any ſhould inſiſt upon the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a ſtrict and proper analogy, and that it was Hermas's deſign to exhibit one, the conſequence would be as fatal
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:012009_0068_0F894188AC43A658"/>
to the cauſe of epiſcopacy, as to that of preſbyterianiſm. For, upon this ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there muſt be FOUR ORDERS in the church, not THREE, anſwering to the "four corners" of theſe "ſquare-ſtones;" and the "Apoſtles," here mentioned, muſt be officers as <hi>diſtinct</hi> from the "Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops," as the "Biſhops" are from the "Doctors:" but how conſiſtent this will be with the pretence, that Biſhops are veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the apoſtolic office, as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and only ſucceſſors; I muſt leave thoſe to determine, whoſe concern it is to do ſo.</p>
               <p>THE other branch of the plea is, that Hermas not only mentions "Biſhops, and Doctors or Preſbyters, and Miniſters or Deacons;" but plainly inſinuates a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of order between them, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct works aſſigned them: for, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the Biſhops, as "exerciſing epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy;" the Doctors, as "teaching;" and the miniſters, as "miniſtring."</p>
               <p>AND it is confeſſed, if, in the age of Hermas, the work of "exerciſing epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy," and the work of "preaching," were ſeparated from each other, as they too commonly are now a days, the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:012009_0069_0F8941896C08DF78"/>
would carry with it ſome force. It is in fact true, at preſent, that thoſe "exerciſe epiſcopacy," who ſeldom or never exerciſe themſelves in "preaching." And, indeed, it rarely happens, that the perſons veſted with the epiſcopal office concern themſelves much with this other buſineſs. But it was not thus from the beginning. Preaching was not then looked upon as the diſtinguiſhing mark of officers inferior to Biſhops: but, for many ages, the work of "exerciſing epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy," and the work of "preaching," were both united in one and the ſame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of the church; and "laboring in the word and doctrine" was the moſt known, and diſtinguiſhing character of all that were Biſhops: inſomuch, that a ſingle inſtance cannot be produced (I ſpeak it with great poſitiveneſs) of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon "exerciſing epiſcopacy," that did not, at the ſame time, make it his <hi>chief</hi> buſineſs to "preach;" until we come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe ages, in which the groſſeſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions were prevalent among all orders and degrees of men in the church. So that, it is no argument, that the "Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors" in Hermas were diſtinct officers from Biſhops, becauſe they are ſpoken of
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:012009_0070_0F89418A2D8CA8E8"/>
as "preaching," and the Biſhops as "ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing epiſcopacy." For theſe are both parts of one and the ſame office; and were always joined together, until, by corruption, they were ſeparated. A Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop that was not a "Doctor," or "teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er," was not known in the world in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times. It is therefore impoſſible, the "Doctors", in this paſſage, could be diſtinct officers from the "Biſhops," for this reaſon; as it had no exiſtence until hundreds of years after its being penned. It is far more reaſonable to ſuppoſe, the ſame order of officers are here called both "Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops" and "Doctors," as pointing us to both parts of their office, "exerciſing epiſcopacy" and "preaching," or "teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>
               <p>THE only remaining places in Hermas, in which epiſcopacy is ſought for, are Viſ. III. Sect. IX. "I ſay unto you who are ſet over the church, and love the <hi>firſt ſeats.</hi>" Mand. XII. Sect. VII. "The earthly ſpirit exalteth itſelf, and will have the <hi>firſt chair.</hi>" Simil. VI. Sect. VII. "They are ſuch—as had ſome envy and ſtrife among themſelves for <hi>principality</hi> and <hi>dignity.</hi>" The plea here is, though
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:012009_0071_0F89418AEDA8B0B0"/>
Hermas blames all contention about "precedence;" yet he plainly ſuppoſes, at the ſame time, a <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>chief ſeat</hi>; ſome ſuperior place in the church, proper to perſons of a ſuperior rank or order; ſuch as Biſhops in that, and ſucceeding ages.</p>
               <p>TO which I would ſay, it is very plain, from theſe paſſages in Hermas, that there was an aſſuming ambitious ſpirit then prevailing among thoſe, who were "ſet over the church," which "earthly ſpirit," as he terms it, he cautions againſt, as what ought not to be encouraged. But that he ſuppoſes, when he warns againſt "pride, envy, and a love of the firſt ſeats," there were any officers in the church of a rank or order ſuperior to that of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, there is no juſt ground to think. When Hermas dehorts from "loving the firſt ſeats, deſiring the firſt chair, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for principality and dignity;" he undoubtedly intends, by all theſe phraſes, one and the ſame thing: that is to ſay, he had it in view to diſcountenance that proud, ambitious ſpirit, which reigned in ſome; unreaſonably puſhing them on to aſpire after ſuperiority and prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. It does not appear to have been
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:012009_0072_0F89418BACA2AE78"/>
his aim to inſinuate a ſuperiority of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der between Biſhops and Preſbyters; but to check the growing vanity of thoſe, who, being of one and the ſame rank, yet ſought for pre-eminence, and ſtrove to get exalted above their brethren. The temper of the perſons Hermas here finds fault with, ſeems to have been much the ſame with that, which the Apoſtles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered when they contended, "who among them ſhould be greateſt:" or, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, like that of Diotrephes, of whom it is ſaid, "that he loved to have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence;" or (as the word <hi>Philopró<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuein</hi> ſignifies) "loved to hold the firſt place." But, as it is no argument, that there was among the Apoſtles any <hi>ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of order,</hi> becauſe they affected ſome to be greateſt; or, that there was a like ſuperior office in the church, to which a chief ſeat was appropriated, becauſe Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trephes was of an aſpiring haughty ſpirit: ſo neither is it any argument of the ſame thing, that Hermas blames the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and warns againſt it.</p>
               <p>NOR if, in the days of Hermas, there had been a known <hi>firſt ſeat,</hi> or <hi>chief chair,</hi> appropriated to ſome ſpecial perſon, would
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:012009_0073_0F89418C6D7BD450"/>
it at once follow from hence, that there was a SUPERIORITY OF ORDER between Biſhops and Preſbyters. Hermas, to be ſure, neither plainly mentions, or tacitly ſuggeſts, ſuch a thing; nor makes any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of <hi>theſe ſeats</hi> to this purpoſe. And as a <hi>chief ſeat,</hi> or <hi>firſt chair,</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly aſſigned to the moderators of all eccleſiaſtical conſiſtories, whether greater or leſs, who yet have no PRIMACY OF POWER, no SUPERIORITY OF OFFICE, but meerly for the ſake of decency and order, this might be the caſe here: though I am rather inclined to think, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more is intended by theſe phraſes, than an indication of that pride and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which too much prevailed, even in thoſe early days, among the officers of the chriſtian church; which Hermas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavours, by proper conſiderations, to reſtrain and curb.</p>

            <head>CLEMENT OF ROME.</head>
            <head type="sub">His character, writings, and teſtimonies from them, with obſervations and remarks.</head>
            <p>THE account we have in the "Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitions" falſely aſcribed to this Clement, of his noble birth and parentage; his being ſent by his father Fauſtinus to be a ſtudent at Athens; the manner and circumſtances of his converſion; his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction under Barnabas; his baptiſm by the Apoſtle Peter, together with the various adventures of ſome of his neareſt relatives I ſhall paſs over in ſilence: not looking upon that ſuppoſititious piece of authority ſufficient to encourage a belief of theſe things.</p>
            <p>NOR is it abſolutely certain, that this is that Clement, of whom we read in the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:012009_0075_0F89418DEC4D2020"/>
fourth chapter to the Philippians; though, as we know of no one under this name, to whom this text may be ſo well applied, the conjecture in which the generality of learned writers are agreed, ſeems no ways improbable, that he is the perſon there intended: eſpecially, conſidering the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers do either expreſſly call him the ſcripture-Clement, or ſo deſcribe him as naturally to point our thoughts to this father, rather than any other of the ſame name. Irenaeus ſpeaks of him as one that "had ſeen the Apoſtles, converſed with them, and attended on their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing." Origen, Euſebius, and Jerom do all of them directly take notice of him, as the Clement "ſpoken of in ſcripture." And if this was he, the honorable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion an inſpired pen makes of him, as "an Apoſtle's fellow-laborer in the goſpel, and one whoſe name was in the book of life," is a very recommending cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, and cannot well fail of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us a favorable opinion of any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine writing, we may meet with under his name.</p>
            <p>BUT however this be, he was a perſon anciently had in great veneration. Scarce
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:012009_0076_0F89418EAC00D0F8"/>
any of the firſt fathers are more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned in antiquity, or their names remembered in higher expreſſions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and honor. Clement of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria ſpeaks of him in the ſtile of "an Apoſtle"; Origin (or Ruffin his tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor) calls him "the faithful Clement"; the author of "the queſtions and anſwers" aſcribed to Juſtin Martyr, "the bleſſed Clement;" Jerom, "an apoſtolical man."</p>
            <p>HE is ſaid to have been Biſhop of Rome: though It muſt be obſerved here, we ſhall be much miſtaken, if, from his being ſpoken of in the ſtile of Biſhop, we ſhould imagine him like one of our Engliſh dioceſans. It is indeed probable enough, the ancients, that call him Biſhop, after the epiſcopal power and grandeur had aroſe to ſome height, might, by this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, mean ſuch a kind of eccleſiaſtic as the Biſhop was in their day. But this is no argument that he was ſo, either in reality, or in the eſteem of the more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive fathers. We ſhall afterwards ſee it to be the truth, that, until towards the cloſe of the ſecond century, Biſhops and Preſbyters were only different names for one and the ſame order of officers in the
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:012009_0077_0F89418F6B974958"/>
chriſtian church, and promiſcuouſly uſed juſt in the ſame manner, as in the Apoſtles days: upon which account, when Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſpoken of as Biſhop of Rome, it amounts to no more than if he had been called the Paſtor, or one of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of that church. Agreably Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, in mentioning the perſons that ſucceeded in the roman church, ſometimes does it under the name of Biſhops, and ſometimes under the names of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters; evidently uſing theſe names pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly, as ſignifying one and the ſame order of church officers. This will be fully ſhewn in its proper place.</p>
            <p>BUT though he was Biſhop, or Paſtor, of the church of Rome, yet the particular time of his entering upon this charge is matter of great difficulty; as is alſo the exact place he bears in the order of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion: the ancient fathers being ſo ſtrangely divided in their accounts upon this head. Tertullian derives the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from Peter; and makes Clement his immediate ſucceſſor. The author of the "apoſtolical conſtitutions" places at the head of the ſucceſſion the Apoſtle Paul, as well as Peter; and make Linus
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:012009_0078_0F8941911434E1D0"/>
to ſucceed Paul, and Clement Peter; but not until after the death of Linus. Irenaeus and Euſebius, beſides Linus, name Anacletus before Clement; giving the order thus, Linus, Anacletus, Clement. And, after the days of Euſebius, ſtill grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confuſion is to be ſeen in the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of this ſucceſſion. In ſome Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletus is expunged, and Cletus placed in his room; while others retain both Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus and Anacletus. And the order in which theſe are placed, is much varied. In ſome the line is ſeen running thus, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Clement, Cletus, Anacletus. In others, Linus, Cletus, Clement, Anacle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. And again in others, Linus, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Anacletus, Clement. And agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the later Greeks (as Biſhop Pearſon obſerves from Cotelerius) do call Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſometimes the ſecond, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the third Biſhop of Rome.</p>
            <p>IN ſuch confuſion is the line, in one of the greateſt and moſt celebrated chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in primitive antiquity: upon which the learned Stillingfleet pleaſantly obſerves, "The ſucceſſion here is as muddy as Tyber itſelf." Nor would the remark Dr. Cave makes upon the writers of the
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:012009_0079_0F894191AC14DDC8"/>
Romiſh church, be leſs pertinent, if we ſhould apply it to thoſe of the Engliſh: "They are (ſays he) involved in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable labyrinth about the firſt four Biſhops of this (the Roman) ſee; ſcarce two of them, of any note, bringing in the ſame account." And after all that has been, or can be ſaid, perhaps, there is no way of accommodating this matter, but by ſuppoſing Linus, Cletus, and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be Biſhops of Rome, not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, but at the ſame time: which, though it breaks in upon the unity of the Epiſcopate, gives no juſt occaſion for terror, ſince the old maxim, "one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop one altar," does not appear to be ſacred and inviolable, either from reaſon, ſcripture, or antiquity.</p>
            <p>I CANNOT help digreſſing ſo far here, as to inſert a few words from the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Dr. Calamy.
<q>If (ſays he) ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion reigns here, (in the ſucceſſion at Rome) where one would apprehend the matter to be cleareſt, how weak is it to place our whole dependance on theſe ſort of tables? How poor a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation do thoſe Gentlemen chuſe to build upon, who lay their main ſtreſs
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:012009_0080_0F8941926C4F98F0"/>
on their derivation from the Roman table, in proof of their miniſterial au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? Were it not a thouſand times more candid, and ingenuous, to confeſs we are in the dark, and left at uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than to make pompous boaſts, the ground of which examined, vaniſh from under us? Theſe ſort of pretences to apoſtolical right, and apoſtolical tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, backed with the tables of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, in the ſeveral churches, make, I confeſs, a mighty noiſe, and may dazzle the eyes of the weak, and paſs for a juſtification with thoſe that have the civil authority on their ſide, which may ſeem to give them validity: but they diſappear, whenever they are exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in cold blood, and viewed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked as they are themſelves. When we make the beſt of them we can, Euſebius is the main author that we have to depend on for the credit of theſe tables. And his account of the ſucceſſion, in the ſeveral churches, is made up moſtly of conjectures at three hundred years diſtance from apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical times, vouched by uncertain au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. And where he has left vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Nicephorus Calliſtus, and Simeon
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:012009_0081_0F8941932C58D820"/>
the Metaphraſt, and other ſuch hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal tinkers, as Biſhop Stillingfleet plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly calls them, have taken effectual care to fill them up.—He that from the blind, broken, and uncertain ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of ſucceſſion, that are tranſmitted to us in the records of antiquity, can infer the neceſſity of epiſcopal, and the invalidity of preſbyterian ordination, muſt either have a ſtrong faith, or a predominant fancy. If they cannot be cleared, it is vain to argue from them: but if they can, they will ſerve us as much as they will them.</q>
But to return.</p>
            <p>BEING Biſhop of Rome, he was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, laborious preacher of the word, and diſpenſer of goſpel ordinances to that church. For this is the moſt juſt and true idea of a faithful Biſhop or Paſtor in primitive times. The name Biſhop was not then looked upon ſo much a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of honor, as implying in it great watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, labor and pains: and this, not in "inſpecting and governing inferior clergymen," but in "feeding the flock of Chriſt" with the word and ſacraments. Nor is there a fact more unqueſtionably
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:012009_0082_0F894193ED742778"/>
clear, from the whole ſtrain of primitive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, than that it was the ſtated, known, perpetual employment of all that were Biſhops, to exerciſe themſelves chiefly in this work. And this true ſcripture no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the work of a Biſhop, was ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally prevalent, even after the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Biſhop and Preſbyter took place, that the fourth council of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage came into ſuch a decree as that, "the Biſhop ſhall wholly occupy himſelf in reading, and praying, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word." But the reader that has a mind to ſee this matter indiſputably cleared up, has it done ready to his hand by that wonder of learning, the great Jameſon, in his "Nazianzeni Querela" and his "Cyprianus Iſotimus".</p>
            <p>It is common in modern authors to read of this Clement as baniſhed from his church, and at laſt dying a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr for the cauſe of Chriſt: though theſe things, to ſay the leaſt, are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great uncertainty. None of the fathers of the three firſt centuries, that I can find, make mention of him as an exile, or martyr. And what is pretty extraordinary, Euſebius, who is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very particular in theſe caſes, is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſilent upon this head. If we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:012009_0083_0F894194AC4A16C8"/>
on the credit of Cotelerius, Ruffin, who lived in latter end of the fourth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, is the firſt that ſpeaks of him as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored with martyrdom. After him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Simeon Metaphraſtes has exhibited to the world a moſt particular and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal account of his "baniſhment to Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to dig in the marble quarries and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor in the mines; and afterwards of his being carried and thrown into the bottom of the ſea." St. Ephraem alſo, Biſhop of Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, relates ſeveral very extraordinary mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, that followed upon his being then put to death: but theſe are authors too much given to the romantic ſtrain to place any dependance on; eſpecially in matters ſo diſtant from their own times, about which the firſt fathers are wholly ſilent. Nor is it much to the honor of the learned, and otherwiſe valuable, Dr. Cave, that he takes ſo much notice, with ſeeming faith, of theſe and ſuch like plainly fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous relations: though I could wiſh, he he had not, upon this account, been quite ſo ſeverely cenſured by my Lord Barring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, when he ſays of him, "that he has little that is not common and obvious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſome idle and legendary ſtories, with which he abounds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:012009_0084_0F8941956D898C08"/>BUT whatever was the manner of his death, Euſebius places it in the third of Trajan, that is, in the year of our Lord one hundred, after he had been Biſhop of Rome nine years: which, whether it be the true account, I leave to others to determine.</p>
            <p>THE writings that go under the name of this Clement are many, and may be diſtinguiſh'd into GENUINE, DOUBTFUL, and SUPPOSITITIOUS.</p>

               <p>IN this rank is placed that excellent epiſtle to the Corinthians, concerning which the great Du-pin has dropped that remark, "next to the holy ſcripture, it is, in my opinion, one of the moſt eminent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of antiquity." It was certainly ſo accounted by the primitive fathers; who ſcarce mention it without ſome epithet of honor. It is called by Irenaeus (as Dr. Cave tranſlates the phraſe) "the moſt excellent and abſolute writing;" by Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius "the truly great and admirable epiſtle:" and what the ſame author adds, may further aſſure us of its high va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue

in ancient times."; this epiſtle we have known to have been publicly read in many churches, both of old, and among ourſelves alſo." Nor is it unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy obſervation, that the only copy of this epiſtle, known in the world, was found written in the ſame volume with the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred books of the new-teſtament: to which happy circumſtance we may aſcribe it, that we are favored with it, after it had been bewailed as loſt for many ages.</p>
               <p>THE manner of its diſcovery and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication was thus.—When Cyrill, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of Conſtantinople, returned from his Alexandrian ſeat in Egypt, he brought with him a large collection of books; among which was an ancient copy of the old and new-teſtament, wrote by the hand of Thecla, a noble Egyptian virgin, about the time of the firſt nicene coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. This he ſent as a preſent to King Charles the firſt, by Sir Thomas Roe, his Majeſty's then Embaſſador at the Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man court, upon his return into England. At the end of this copy was added this epiſtle of Clement, wrote by the ſame hand; though ſomething broken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced:
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:012009_0086_0F894196EC3E1878"/>
which, when the learned Patrick Young, his Majeſty's library-keeper, had diſcovered, he was commanded by the King, to make it public; which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did at Oxford, in the year 1633, with a latin tranſlation, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed notes.</p>
               <p>THE occaſion of Clement's writing this epiſtle, we may learn from Irenaeus, who ſays, "In the days of Clement, the church of Rome wrote a very pathetical letter [they are ſaid to have wrote it, though it was penned by Clement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was wrote and ſent in their name] to reſtore them to peace." Euſebius ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits the like teſtimony, when he tells us, "that Clement wrote this epiſtle from Rome to Corinth, when ſedition was raiſed among the Corinthians." He adds a few words after, "that there was, at that time, a ſedition among the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, Hegeſippus is a witneſs. Nor can any one that reads this epiſtle be at a loſs as to the truth of this. It is plain, through the whole of it, there was a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſturbance in the church; and this chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt its Preſbyters: ſome of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being vainly conceited of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:012009_0087_0F894197AD716088"/>
gifts, and therefore riſing up againſt their guides and teachers. Now, to heal this difference, and reſtore peace and good order, this epiſtle was principally deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and to this end it is admirably well adapted: being wrote in a plain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected ſtile; yet with great ſtrength and perſpicuity, and evidently breathing the true ſpirit and genius of the apoſtolic age.</p>
               <p>THE epiſtle is wrote in the name of the church of Rome to the church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth: upon which a noted author per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently remarks, "Had he (Clement) known himſelf to be the infallible judge of controverſies, to whoſe ſentence the whole chriſtian world was bound to ſtand, inveſted with a ſupreme, unaccountable power, from which there lay no appeal, we might have expected to hear him ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue at another rate." And as there is no mention in this epiſtle of any ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as the head and Governor of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian church, I cannot forbear adding another remark, which ſeems full as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; namely, That if there had been, at that time, at the head of this church, an eccleſiaſtical officer, in any meaſure, reſembling one of our modern Biſhops,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:012009_0088_0F8941986C1F3A20"/>
it is altogether unaccountable, how both Clement and the church of Rome ſhould treat him with ſuch neglect, as to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſilent about him. It would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look ſtrange, and be reſented ill, if one of our preſent Biſhops ſhould be ſo ſhamefully overlooked; his church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, rebuked, exhorted, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a proper method of peace: and all, without referring the matter to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or indeed taking the leaſt notice of him.—But of this we may hear more afterwards.</p>
               <p>THE exact time, when this epiſtle was wrote, is not eaſy to be ſtated; as we may be fully ſatisfied from the diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the moſt learned writers on this head. Mr. Young's thought is, that it was wrote about two years before his death, in the time that he ſuppoſes him to be under baniſhment. Dr. Cave fixes the period a few years ſooner, a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Diocleſian perſecution. Vende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus places it in the year 95, when he apprehends this perſecution was at its heighth. Cotelerius agrees with him as to the year, but rather thinks the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution was drawing to an end. But the
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:012009_0089_0F89419970C62CF0"/>
conjecture of Grotius, Dodwell, Arch-Biſhop Wake, and ſome others, makes it to have been wrote much ſooner; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the latter end of Nero's reign, and the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, that is, between the years 64 and 70; which they very much ground on that paſſage in the epiſtle, where they ſuppoſe the Jewiſh prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Levitical miniſtrations are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of as yet continuing.—But as it would be a going too far out of my way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the particular reaſons, on which theſe conjectures are built, I have barely referred to them, without pretending to ſay which are moſt probable: but leaving it to the reader to examine the matter, and determine as he ſees fit:</p>
               <p>THE only colour of an objection againſt the genuineſs of this epiſtle, is taken from the "fable of the phaenix," which Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment particularly relates, and then uſes to repreſent the credibility of the doctrine of the reſurrection. But it is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of much notice. This was a ſtory, however ridiculous, generally believed in that day, by the learned as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, both Jews and Gentiles. And as the account of that "bird's reviving out
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:012009_0090_0F89419B1723A138"/>
of the aſhes of the body conſumed by fire," was capable of being improved as an illuſtration of the doctrine of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, where is the great abſurdity of its being applied to this purpoſe? And if Clement had himſelf really believed this ſtory, being too far carried away with the prevailing opinion, what greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity would it argue, than the beſt and moſt valuable men always have been, and now are, ſubject to. <note n="*" place="bottom">The learned reader, that is curious, may be gratified by reading what is ſaid upon the "fable of the phaenix," to ſilence the objections againſt this epiſtle of Clement, on account of his making uſe of it, in the notes in the body of the epiſtle, and in the prefixed judgment of ſome of the greateſt antiquaries, as they may be ſeen in Le Clere's edition of Cotelerius's "apoſtolical Fathers."</note>
               </p>
               <p>GROTIUS's thoughts concerning this epiſtle, in his letter to Bignorius, are worth tranſcribing here. "I have (ſays he) read it over and over again, with the utmoſt care and diligence, and cannot think any other, than that it is the ſame epiſtle which Photius read: in whoſe day, ſince it was in being, it is not wonderful, it has been preſerved to our's, among the ſacred writings. Neither ſee I any reaſon, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther why the epiſtle which Photius read,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:012009_0091_0F89419B6C802E70"/>
ſhould not be the ſame which Jerom had, and before him Clement of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, and Irenaeus, yet nearer to the time of Clement of Rome: or why we ſhould aſcribe it to any other, than Clement of Rome himſelf; ſince this has been hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down to us, with ſo great and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal conſent." To which I would only add, there is no one ancient piece, we have greater reaſon, both from its internal cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and external evidence, to depend upon as genuine. It is perhaps the moſt frequently quoted, by the more primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Fathers, of any uninſpired book; between all which quotations, and the preſent copy of this epiſtle, there is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful agreement. And it carries in it none of thoſe marks of impoſtor that are to be met with, in ſome other pieces, and theſe too, palmed upon even this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Clement: but every thing is delivered both as to matter, and manner, as might be expected from one that lived in the apoſtolic age, and was a worthy faithful laborer in the vineyard of Chriſt.</p>

Clement.

               <p>THE pieces of this ſort, aſcribed to Clement, as their author, or the penman of others, are the "apoſtolical conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions," the "apoſtolical canons," the
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:012009_0093_0F89419CEC873350"/>
"recognitions," the "Clementines" with the "prefixt epiſtle of Clement to James," and the "epitome of the acts of Peter."</p>
               <p>AS to the conſtitutions; Mr. Whiſton, the lateſt patron of them, has given them the moſt ſacred character; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, that they are the work of even the whole body of the Apoſtles, and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Clement as their amanuenſis: than which, perhaps, there never was an opinion attended with more, or greater abſurdities. It is obvious to all, in any meaſure, verſed in the ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that there is a total ſilence of all primitive antiquity about theſe conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And however Mr. Whiſton's authorities out of the fathers have ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led even into a volume, yet that they are only a vaſt heap of miſapplications is ſo evident, that no one, ſo far as I can learn, has ever thought it worth while to be at the pains to take them out of that ſtrangly falſe light, in which he has placed them: nor is there any need of it, there being enough in the books them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to make it clearly evident, that no one of the apoſtles had any hand in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; yea, that they never were in
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:012009_0094_0F89419DAD819CC8"/>
being, at leaſt as we now have them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the church of Chriſt was gone far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to corruption and degeneracy. A few of thoſe many things, which are open to every one's obſervation, upon the bare reading of them, and that are ſufficient indications of this, I ſhall here inſert.</p>
               <p>THE manner in which they ſpeak of Biſhops is very extraordinary. They repreſent them as "bearing the character of God among men;" as "ſet over all men, Prieſts, Kings, Princes, fathers, ſons, maſters, and all that are ſubject to them." They command them to "judge with like authority as God himſelf." They call the Biſhop, "the miniſter of the word, the keeper of knowledge, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between God and his people in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip, the maſter of piety, next unto God, the chriſtian's father, his Prince, Governor, King, Potentate;" and declare, that he is to be "honor'd next to God as an earthly God." They ſpeak of Biſhops, as thoſe that are to be "venerated and honoured with all kind of honor;" as thoſe who have "received from God the power of life and death, in judging ſinners, and condemning them to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:012009_0095_0F89419E6C120F08"/>
flames, and abſolving thoſe who are converted." They exhort the people to "reverence their Biſhops as Kings, and to honor them as their Lord."</p>
               <p>THIS is a taſte of the ſpirit, and ſtile, in which Biſhops are here ſpoken of; between which, and the ſtile and ſpirit of the truly apoſtolical writings, upon the ſame ſubject, there cannot be a greater contrariety. Let a man read, over and over again, the genuine writings of the apoſtles, and he ſhall ever find what they ſay concerning Biſhops, to be delivered in plain ſimple language, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſuited to the ſpiritual nature of that kingdom of Chriſt, in which they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers: whereas, theſe "conſtitutions" ſo ſtrangely differ from the apoſtolic genius, that, if the writings of the moſt corrupt ages be looked into, we ſhall not be able to find in them any expreſſions, more unboundedly aggrandiſing Biſhops, and claiming for them higher degrees of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and reverence.</p>
               <p>AND if we turn to the epiſtle of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the pretended amanuenſis of the Apoſtles, we ſhall find as great a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:012009_0096_0F89419F2D5C32A8"/>
between that, and theſe conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: which is truly wonderful, if he had ſuch an intimate acquaintance with them, as he muſt have had, if he was the penman of them. Nor can it, in any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional way, be accounted for, that, in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Corinthians, he ſhould whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſs by this moſt valuable and canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal part of ſacred ſcripture, (as it muſt certainly be, if, as is ſaid, it was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the whole body of Apoſtles) which yet he does; and this, when it was far better adapted to anſwer the deſign of his "epiſtle," than all the other books of the new-teſtament put together. For here, the boundaries, not only between Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Preſbyters, but between Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and Laics, are moſt punctually fixed; their duty to them preſcribed; their obedience ſecured; and, in a word, the whole controverſy among the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, the occaſion of Clement's writing to them, intirely ſettled. And yet, he takes not the leaſt notice of theſe "con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions," though, from the mouth of the Apoſtles, he had penned them; while<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the ſame time, he makes great uſe of the books both of the old and new-teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to fetch in arguments to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But to proceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="unknown:012009_0097_0F89419FED741FA8"/>IN theſe "conſtitutions," we have forms of prayer preſcribed for a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of occaſions: particularly for both ſacraments, "baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper;" for the "ordination of Biſhops, Preſbyters, Deacons, Readers, Singers," and ſo on. But that theſe were, any of them, ever uſed in the primitive church, there are no footſteps in antiquity: nor is there the leaſt reference made to them, by any truly ancient Father, upon any occaſion: which is altogether unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, if, as is pretended, they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, even by the whole body of Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; and this, purpoſely for the uſe of the chriſtian church.</p>
               <p>WE here read of the uſe of "oyl in baptiſm;" nor is it allowed to be valid without a prayer for the efficacy of it on the baptiſed perſon: and he is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, without this prayer, as "de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending into the water to no better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than a meer Jew;" and as "waſhing off the defilements of his body, but not of his ſoul."</p>
               <p>WE have here preſcribed an "office for the dead;" in which ſupplication is
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:012009_0098_0F8941A0AD794FC8"/>
made for the deceaſed, that God would "pardon his ſins, both involuntary and voluntary, and receive his ſoul to be with Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob."</p>
               <p>WE are here commanded to attend "prayer at church," not only daily, but no leſs than "ſix times a day;" the particular ſeaſons for which, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the trifling reaſons on which they are grounded, are all particularly ſpecified.</p>
               <p>PARTICULAR care is here taken about the "form and ſituation of churches;" an appointment made, that they ſhall be "oblong and facing the eaſt." Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence in churches is alſo commanded, the "Biſhops throne" adjuſted, the place where he is to ſtand appointed, namely, "the altar;" where he muſt appear clothed with a "ſhining ſplendid veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;" and before he begins prayer, he is ordered, in the ſight of all the people, "to make upon his forehead the ſign of the croſs." The Deacons are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to wait on each ſide of the altar, with a "fan in their hands made of thin membranes, or the feathers of a peacock,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:012009_0099_0F894086AF990348"/>
or of fine cloth, to drive away the ſmall animals from the ſacramental cups." A very minute account is alſo exhibited of "places to ſit in" in churches, and the "junior ordered to be turned of his place," if he does not yield it to a "more honorable ſtranger;" together with other like inſtances of ceremony and good manners.</p>
               <p>WE are here directed to "obſerve days in honor to deceaſed ſaints;" to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany "their funerals with ſinging," and to "aſſemble in the dormitories of the martyrs, and there to celebrate the holy euchariſt."</p>
               <p>PARTICULAR mention is here made of "Sub-deacons, Readers, Singers, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, Porters, Miniſters, Virgins, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſts," as BEARING OFFICE in the church. We read alſo of "Energumens, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens," together with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of "faſts and feaſts," and a deal more ſuch trumpery, which was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely unknown in the apoſtolic age; but viſible enough in the church, in after days, when ſhe had become ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and corrupt. And this I ſhould
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:012009_0100_0F8940877345D6D8"/>
now particularly and largely have ſhewn, but that I muſt have taken conſiderable pains, in my own apprehenſion, to little purpoſe; not doubting, but the bare nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of the above articles will be thought by moſt, a full juſtification of thoſe, who diſcard all pretence to theſe books, as apoſtolically compoſed.</p>
               <p>THIS opinion then being thrown aſide, it is not eaſy to conceive of theſe "con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions" in their preſent form, as any other, than the work of ſome very bold and impudent impoſtor; ſince he perſonates the Apoſtles with all freedom; ſpeaking in the name, ſometimes of one, ſometimes of another, and ſometimes of them all; with the greateſt ſolemnity and formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty commanding this thing, and prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another. Inſtances of this are ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be met with, that it is needleſs to adduce any. And it demonſtrably argues, that the author was a vile cheat, and ought accordingly to be ſo thought of.</p>
               <p>AS to the time in which theſe books may be ſuppoſed to come abroad in the world, I know of none (thoſe few excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted who plead for them as penned by
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:012009_0101_0F8940882D56AC98"/>
Clement) who pretend to fix the period higher than the latter end of the ſecond, or the beginning of the third century. <note n="*" place="bottom">Biſhop Beveridge has expended no ſmall labor to give date to theſe "conſtitutions," about the cloſe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, or the beginning of the third century: but to no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable purpoſe. For, ſhould it be even allowed, that they were then in being, it is abſolutely certain, they are not NOW, as they muſt have been THEN. And, unleſs ſome way could be pointed out (which has never yet been done) to diſtinguiſh the ORIGINAL CONTENTS, from the MULTIPLICITY OF CORRUPTIONS that have crept into them, they can be of no real ſervice; as there is no knowing what is GENUINE, and what the WORK of ſenſeleſs and knaviſh INTERPOLAORTS.</note> But whether thoſe, who thus fix the time, are in the right; or others, who bring it down to the fourth or fifth century, I ſhall not diſpute. Probably, they were not complete, as we now have them, at once; but have been, from time to time, corrected, altered, augmented, according to the various cuſtoms of different ages and countries.</p>
               <p>MR. Whiſton pretends the ſame of the "canons" that he does of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that they were wrote by Clement, as the work of the whole apoſtolic body: but there does not appear any reaſon, why the ſame judgment ſhould not be paſſed
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:012009_0102_0F894088ED31B7A8"/>
upon them, that we have given of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, in point of their being apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically compoſed. As for myſelf, nothing more was needful to convince me of this, after I had once read them: ſo many of them being either trifling in themſelves, or inconſiſtent with the truly apoſtolical writings, or containing ſuch things as were not known in the church until ages after the apoſtles. I ſhall not think it beyond my deſign, to preſent here to the reader's view a few of them.</p>
               <p>CAN. II. "If any Biſhop or Preſbyter, beſides what our Lord has appointed for ſacrifice, ſhall offer upon the altar other things; as honey, or milk, or cyder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of wine, or things made by the confectioner, or birds, or animals, or pulſe: let him be depoſed. Excepting ears of corn, or grapes, it is not lawful to offer any thing upon the altar, ſave only oyl for the holy lamp, and incenſe of thyme in divine oblation." Thoſe who are in the leaſt acquainted with the writings of the apoſtolic age, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter corrupt ages of the church, can be at no loſs to determine, in which of theſe ages, it is moſt likely, this canon ſhould
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:012009_0103_0F89408A980323F8"/>
be formed. And the curious reader, that will be at the pains to run over the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dodwell's "book of incenſe," cannot well help being ſatisfied, particularly as to the article of offering incenſe, that it was abſolutely unknown in the church, for ſome ages after the death of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>CAN. V. "If any Biſhop, Preſbyter, or Deacon, ſhall celebrate with the Jews, the holy day of eaſter before the vernal aequinox, let him be depoſed." The controverſy between the eaſtern and weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern churches, about the time of keeping eaſter, that happened in the ſecond cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, long after the death of the Apoſtles, might, by this canon, have been ſettled: and yet, in the whole management of this diſpute, (which was prodigiouſly fierce) it was never once appealed to, nor the leaſt hint given, by either party, as if any ſuch canon was in being: which is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very ſtrange thing, if, before this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, this cannon had been made, and committed to writing by direction from the Apoſtles: eſpecially conſidering, the chief managers of this diſpute were the Paſtors of the ſeveral churches, the moſt
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:012009_0104_0F89408B4166B808"/>
learned and famous among them; who muſt have known of this canon, if it had been in being; and cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed not to have made uſe of it, ſince it was an apoſtolical one, and muſt at once have ended the controverſy.</p>
               <p>CAN. XVII. "Forbids any one's being made a Clergyman, who hath made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an eunuch; and commands every Clergyman, who hath ſo made himſelf, to be depoſed: and, if he be a Laic, to be ſeparated for three years:" which looks too much like the production of after ages, when this practice became ſo common, as to need ſome reſtraints to be laid upon it, to be admitted for apoſtolical.</p>
               <p>CAN. XIX. "Of thoſe who were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſons, when they were made Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen, we command, that only Readers and Singers may take wives." A perſon can ſcarce read this canon, without turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his thoughts to a ſcripture paſſage, which founds as if, by ſpecial foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it had been purpoſely inſerted, to confront the authority of theſe and ſuch like decrees. Says one of the Apoſtles of our Lord, "Now the ſpirit ſpeaketh
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:012009_0105_0F89408BEDD2BE50"/>
expreſſly, that in the latter times, ſome ſhall depart from the faith,—FORBID<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING TO MARRY."</p>
               <p>CAN. XXVII. "Subjects all Biſhops, of every province, to one that is firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, or the Metropolitan." But as nothing is more clearly evident, than that Metropolitans were not known, in the church, until ages after the Apoſtles; to theſe times this canon ought to be referred.</p>
               <p>I SHALL only add two or three more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, which ſeem to be of trifling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and not to merit a formal decree of the whole body of Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>CAN. LXIX. "If any Clergyman hath laughed at one that is dumb, or blind, or lame in his feet, let him be ſeparated: ſo alſo let the Layman."</p>
               <p>CAN. LXX. "If any one hath a devil, he may not be made a Clergyman: nor may he pray with the faithful."</p>

                  <pb n="97" facs="unknown:012009_0106_0F89408CB15FB5A0"/>HAVING thus offered what may be thought ſufficient to evince the abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that opinion, which makes theſe canons the compoſure of the Apoſtles, I ſhall not be ſo much concerned to inquire into other things of leſs importance. Who the author of theſe canons was, is a matter of the greateſt uncertainty. But whether he was an impoſtor, that deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to impoſe upon the world, by putting them forth under the name of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles: or whether they are only the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of ancient councils collected toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this form, by ſome perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of honeſt intention; and ſtiled apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolical, not as if they had been made by the Apoſtles, but as containing things, in their apprehenſion, conſonant to the rules delivered by the Apoſtles; or as made up of uſages and traditions ſuppoſed, to be handed down from them: I ſay, whether of theſe opinions are the trueſt, I ſhall not at preſent debate. Nor is it a matter agreed on, when theſe canons firſt made their appearance in the world. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur D'aille does not allow them any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, until towards the fifth century: in oppoſition whereto, Biſhop Beveridge has ranſacked all antiquity to confirm the
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:012009_0107_0F89408D6EA0B0F8"/>
opinion, that they ought to be placed in the third century. But inſtead of examining the arguments of theſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors to know which are in the right, I ſhall rather obſerve concerning both the apoſtolical conſtitutions, and canons, as a concluſion of what I ſhall offer about them,</p>
               <p>THAT however thoſe learned writers, who have given the world their thoughts about theſe books, may differ in matters of ſmaller importance; as the time, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and occaſion of their being wrote; yet, with great unanimity, they reject them as the work of inſpired Apoſtles. And indeed, Mr. Whiſton (depending on the credit of Dr. Smallbroke) is the firſt perſon, either ancient or modern, ſo far as we are informed by eccleſiaſtical hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, that ever had this opinion of them:
<q>Even Bovius, and Turrianus, (to uſe the language of that author) who firſt recommended the conſtitutions to the learned world, how vainly ſoever they ſpent their time in writing forced and unnatural apologies for them, were not ſo fond of novelty, as to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they were truly apoſtolical, and
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:012009_0108_0F89408E2D90EEA8"/>
the product of divine inſpiration. Much leſs did they ever dream of ſo high a degree of inſpiration, as renders them (according to Mr. Whiſton) more ſacred than the authentic goſpels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. All that they pretended to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert was, that Clemens Romanus had collected ſome apoſtolical traditions, which he formed into the eight books of conſtitutions, then retrieved and publiſhed by them. They, therefore, agreably to their hypotheſis, weak and precarious as it was, labored to eſtabliſh the antiquity of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, as a body of eccleſiaſtical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; but expreſſly diſclaimed all pretenſions to divine authority, or to their being a ſacred rule of life and manners.</q>
He goes on in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that I ſhall think worth tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing:
<q>Indeed their principal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to oppoſe thoſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation by them. And that it was ſo, both thoſe warm patrons of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions very frankly acknowledge. Bovius, who tranſlated them firſt into latin, and commented upon them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated his work to the Pope's legates that preſided in the council of Trent:
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:012009_0109_0F89408EEEF4A528"/>
In the epiſtle dedicatory to whom, he acquaints us, that, upon a recital of ſome paſſages of the clementine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, at a meeting of the fathers of the council of Trent, thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages were thought ſo very ſerviceable to what was there tranſacting in that ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, as to give the firſt hint to the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole body of the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. After which, Bovius aſſerts, that there is ſcarce any thing that is oppoſed by the Heretics, that is, Proteſtants, as crept into the church by error and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, but may be defended by the authority of theſe conſtitutions, and ſhewn to be of primitive antiquity. Turrianus, likewiſe, who made theſe conſtitutions a conſiderable part of his ſtudies, aſſures us, that they were thought very beneficial to the church, that is, the church of Rome, by the cenſors of books in the council of Trent; and that their moſt grave and weighty judgment of them was ſealed, and laid up at Rome, in the public records of the inquiſition. Again, he affirms, that nothing of antiquity could be publiſhed more proper for that age, and better adapted to the confutation
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:012009_0110_0F89408FADC934E8"/>
of thoſe innovators, the Proteſtants.</q>
He adds,
<q>That theſe books were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially publiſhed in that age, when there was the greateſt occaſion for them, as witneſſes againſt thoſe of the reformation: (at whom he rails very plentifully) and that it ſeemed, nothing more was either wanting, or could be expected for their convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That theſe books were ſent by God to triumph over theſe Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and to ſhew the world how juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were condemned in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Trent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>DR. Smallbroke adds, the reaſon that he tranſcribed theſe paſſages from Bovius and Turrianus was,
<q>That the reader might be rightly informed of the avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſign of publiſhing the clementine conſtitutions, even the confutation of the reformed religion,</q>
And I have thus tranſcribed the paſſages from him, becauſe he ſtiles himſelf "Canon-Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiary of Hereford, Treaſurer of the church of Landaff, and Chaplain to his Grace, the Lord Arch-Biſhop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="unknown:012009_0111_0F8940906F5C1D70"/>THE next piece, that preſents itſelf under the name of Clement, is the "re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitions," as in the tranſlation of Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin. But it is ſo empty of every thing ſavoring of the ſimplicity of the firſt and pure ages of chriſtianity, and ſo full of fable, and feigned conferences about fate, and the influence of the ſtars, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly conſtellations, and ſuch like ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous ſtuff, that it is univerſally placed below the time of Clement, as altogether unworthy of him.</p>
               <p>AND the ſame may be ſaid of the other writings, we have mentioned under the head of ſuppoſititious, if indeed they may be allowed to be called different ones. The "clementines" are thought, by ſome, to be that "other edition of the recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions," Ruffin mentions in his preface to Gaudentius, prefixed to the recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he made a verſion of: ſince they ſo exactly agree with the character he there gives of them, differing in ſome things from that he tranſlated, but the ſame in many. And for the "epitome of the acts of Peter," Dr. Cave calls it "a third edition of the recognitions," or rather an "abſtract of both the recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:012009_0112_0F894091328D2980"/>
and clementines," though keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more cloſely to the latter. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe are different compoſitions, or only one and the ſame piece, ſomething varied and differently modelled, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not; ſo long as we have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the main body of the learned world in throwing them aſide as evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſititious.</p>

               <head>REMARKS and OBSERVATIONS on the foregoing teſtimonies.</head>
               <p>HAVING laid before the reader's view all the paſſages, in Clement's epiſtle, that relate to the Epiſcopalian controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, I ſhall now take particular notice of thoſe among them, I have met with as uſed to ſupport the opinion, which would make Biſhops an order in the church diſtinct from, and ſuperior to, Preſbyters: which when I have done, I ſhall then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch obſervations, in favor of the parity of the order of theſe officers, as are evidently deducible from the whole of what Clement has ſaid upon this point.</p>
               <p>THE paſſages inſiſted upon to ſupport the ſuperiority of Biſhops to Preſbyters, I ſhall conſider without obſerving any other method, than the order in which they lie in the epiſtle.</p>
               <p>THE firſt paſſage I meet with, recurred to by epiſcopal writers, we have in</p>
               <p>SECT. I.—"And ye walked accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the laws of God, being ſubject to
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:012009_0125_0F89409C9BED98E0"/>
thoſe [<hi>upotaſſamenoi tois êgoumenois umôn</hi>] who had the rule over you, and giving the honor that was fitting [<hi>tois par umin Preſbuterois</hi>] to ſuch as were aged among you." To which they add thoſe parallel words, in ſect. xxi. "Let us honor thoſe that are ſet over us; [<hi>tous proêgoumenous êmon</hi>] let us reſpect [<hi>tous Preſbuterous êmôn</hi>] the aged that are among us."</p>
               <p>THESE paſſages, it is pleaded, afford clear evidence, that there was, in the days of Clement, a diſtinction between Biſhops and Preſbyters. Being ſubject, <hi>êgoumenois umôn,</hi> that is, ſay they, to your eccleſiaſtical rulers; by whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude are meant Biſhops: and this, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers diſtinct from Preſbyters; becauſe it follows, paying due honor <hi>tois par umin Preſbuterois</hi>; by whom, they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, we are to underſtand, not aged men, but thoſe officers in the church, called Preſbyters.</p>
               <p>NOW, in order to ſhow the invalidity of this plea, I have no need to go into the opinion of the learned Salmaſius, and Burton, who unſterſtand by theſe <hi>êgou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menoi,</hi> not eccleſiaſtical, but civil rulers; which opinion they ſtrengthen by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:012009_0126_0F89409D4BDD4EC8"/>
that this word is ſeveral times uſed in this epiſtle; but always as ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying thoſe, who were civil rulers. The places referred to by Salmaſius are five; and except thoſe under conſideration, they are all, in which it is uſed; and it is uſed in them with reference to civil officers. But this notwithſtanding, as the word may, with propriety, be applied to eccleſiaſtical rulers, and is frequently applied to them in the ſacred books; and as there is no hint given, any where in Clement's epiſtle, as if the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were blameable for their diſobedience to their civil rulers; and its chief deſign is to teach them a ſutable conduct, not towards thoſe in the ſtate, but in the church, that were ſet over them: I ſay conſidering theſe things, I am willing to allow, that, by theſe rulers, we are to underſtand, not thoſe of the civil, but eccleſiaſtical order: but muſt ſay, at the ſame time, that we have abundant reaſon to conclude, they were Preſbyters, and not Biſhops; unleſs we take Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and Preſbyter, to be only different words for the ſame officer. For let it be obſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:012009_0127_0F89409DEDA56CC0"/>THERE was, at this time, a plurality of theſe rulers in the church of Corinth; as is plain from the word, [<hi>êgoumenois</hi>] which is of a plural ſignification. Now, it is certain, that there was a plurality of Preſbyters in this church; and Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters too, who had been "ſet over them," to whom they were commanded to "be in SUBJECTION." Says Clement, [<hi>upo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagête tois Preſbuterois</hi>] "Be ye ſubject to your Preſbyters." And it is obſervable, the ſame word, here joned with Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, requiring the ſubjection of the Corinthian church to them, is joined alſo with the word, <hi>êgoumenois,</hi> beſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame ſubjection. The interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is therefore ſmooth, natural, and conſiſtent with the current ſtrain of the whole epiſtle, while by theſe <hi>êgoumenois</hi> we underſtand the Preſbyters of the church; eſpecially, if it be further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that Preſbyter-Biſhops are the higheſt eccleſiaſtical rulers any where men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Clement: nor is his epiſtle at all acquainted with Biſhops, only as they mean officers in the church, preciſely of the ſame rank with the Preſbyters of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="unknown:012009_0128_0F89409EAE5A7480"/>BESIDES, it may be worth a remark, the word <hi>êgoumenoi</hi> is one of the names uſed in ſcripture to point out Preſbyters, or, in other words, thoſe officers in the chriſtian church, that are elſewhere, in the ſacred writings, promiſcuouſly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently called either Biſhops, or Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Thus in the epiſtle to the Hebrews, when they are minded of their duty to their eccleſiaſtical guides, or rulers, it is expreſſed after that manner, "Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber [<hi>tôn êgoumenôn umôn</hi>] them which have the rule over you, and have ſpoken to you the word of God." <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. xiii.7.</note> And a few verſes below, "obey [<hi>tois êgoumenois umôn</hi>] all them that have the rule over you." And the epiſtle concludes in that ſtile, "ſalute [<hi>pantas tous êgoume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous umôn</hi>] them that have the rule over you." And this uſe of the word, in this epiſtle, is the rather to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe Euſebius and Jerom ſpeak, both of them, of ſo great an affinity, in many things, both as to words and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, between this and the epiſtle of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it was from thence thought, that Clement was, at leaſt, the tranſlator of
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:012009_0129_0F89409F6DE4A840"/>
the epiſtle to the Hebrews. And cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks make uſe of it as a ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in proof of the genuineneſs of the preſent copy of Clement's epiſtle, that it is found to agree ſo well with this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Euſebius and Jerom.</p>
               <p>BUT if, with the Epiſcopalians, we ſhould ſuppoſe theſe <hi>êgoumenoi</hi> mean Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, in diſtinction from Preſbyters; will it not follow, as an inevitable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that there was in the church of Corinth, at the ſame time, a plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Biſhops? It is obſervable, the word is <hi>êgoumenois,</hi> not in the ſingular, but plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral number: which can never be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with the doctrine of one "Biſhop in a church, as the center of unity." The dilemma here is plain: either theſe <hi>êgou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menoi</hi> were not Biſhops in the ſenſe pleaded for, or there were more of theſe Biſhops than one, in the ſame church, at the ſame time. That is to ſay, either this teſtimony from Clement muſt be given up, or the old ſacred maxim, "one Biſhop one altar." But rather than part with this, I doubt not we ſhall be left in quiet poſſeſſion of any teſtimony whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="unknown:012009_0130_0F8940A02E075340"/>IT will perhaps be objected againſt what has been offered, that theſe rulers are diſtinguiſhued, in the paſſages them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, from Preſbyters; and therefore can never mean the ſame officers.</p>
               <p>IN anſwer whereto, I freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the Greek words, <hi>êgoumenois,</hi> and <hi>Preſbuterois,</hi> are diſtinguiſhed from each other; but that the word, <hi>Preſbuterois,</hi> means here thoſe officers in the church, that are called Preſbyters, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think. It is certain, this term is ſometimes uſed in its common and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appropriated ſenſe, as ſignifying only aged perſons. In this ſenſe it is taken in 1. Tim. v. i. "Rebuke not [<hi>Preſbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terô</hi>] an Elder, but intreat him as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,"—Dr. Whitby's note here is, "In the judgment of Chryſoſtom, Theodoret, Oecumenius, and Theophylact, the Elder here ſignifies, not a Prieſt, but a grave and ancient man; ſuch being in all ages and nations ſtiled fathers. And this ſenſe, the diſtinction here of ages, and of ſexes, ſeems to plead for. For ſo it follows, "the younger men (intreat) as brethren, the elder women as mothers," and ſo on. In the ſame ſenſe, this word
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:012009_0131_0F8940A0EF884620"/>
is to be taken in theſe paſſages of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for the ſame reaſon; though much ſtrengthened by its manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection. For let it be obſerved,</p>
               <p>IN the firſt of theſe paſſages, Clement is commending the Corinthians for what was FORMERLY worthy in their conduct; and, among other things, mentions it to their praiſe, that they "had been ſubject to their <hi>êgoumenois,</hi>" and had "paid due honor to their <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterois</hi>;" where, by <hi>Preſbyterois,</hi> he means, and muſt mean, not their Preſbyters, but the AGED among them, not only becauſe it immediately follows, "ye commanded the YOUNG men to think thoſe things that were modeſt and grave;" but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>êgoumenoi,</hi> they had, in their FORMER orderly ſtate, been ſubject to, were the PRESBYTERS of the church: for theſe, as has been proved, he elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where mentions as "ſet over the church," and accordingly enjoins their "ſubjection to them;" nor are any higher church officers ſpoken of in his epiſtle; and what is more, he ſpeaks of theſe, as has been ſaid, and will hereafter be further prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as actually veſted with EPISCOPACY.
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:012009_0132_0F8940A1AE8AB410"/>
The interpretation therefore is natural, obvious, and conſiſtent, which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the word <hi>preſbyteroi,</hi> in this place, not as pointing out the officers in the church, called Preſbyters, who had been ſpoken of in the immediately foregoing words; but as ſignifying, in its unappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated ſenſe, AGED PERSONS: whereas, to conſtrue it otherwiſe, would make Clement a careleſs, inattentive, not to ſay blundering, inconſiſtent writer.</p>
               <p>IN the other paſſage, Clement, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the PRESENT diſorderly, ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious behavior of ſome in the Corinthian church, exhorts them to a temper and conduct better befiting their character as Chriſtians. Says he, "Let us rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe blood was given for us; let us honor [<hi>tous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>êgoumenous êmôn</hi>] thoſe who are ſet over us; let us reſpect [<hi>tous Preſbyterous êmôn</hi>] the aged among us; let us inſtruct the younger men [<hi>neous</hi>] in the fear of the Lord." The <hi>Proêgoumenoi</hi> here are the ſame that are ſpoken of in the above paſſage, that is, the Preſbyters who had been ſet over the church. The word, <hi>preſbyteroi,</hi> therefore muſt mean their
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:012009_0133_0F8940A26F852D28"/>
aged people. There will, in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the word, be order, propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and beauty, in the exhortations that are ſeverally made: whereas, if the word is tranſlated ſo as to ſignify the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the church, there will be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced tautology, and a breach of order in the advices that are here given.</p>
               <p>THE interpretation I have exhibited of theſe paſſages will more evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be juſt; if we turn to ſect. iiid, where Clement ſpecifies the diſorders he would blame in the church at Corinth. His words are theſe, "They who were of no renown lifted themſelves up againſt the honorable; thoſe of no reputation againſt thoſe that were in reſpect; the fooliſh againſt the wiſe; the young men againſt the aged, <hi>neous epi tous Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterous:</hi> therefore righteouſneſs and peace are departed from you."—The op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition between the young men and the aged, is ſo plain here, that none ever pretended to diſpute this ſenſe of the word, <hi>preſbyteroi,</hi> in this place. And this, being its ſenſe here, muſt be its ſenſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the other paſſages we have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:012009_0134_0F8940A32D767168"/>
for they all relate to one and the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>I SHALL only ſubjoin upon this head; in Cotelerius's "apoſtolical fathers" by L'Clerc, in all theſe ſections, the word <hi>preſbuteroi</hi> is tranſlated AGED PERSONS. Arch-Biſhop Wake alſo, in his "epiſtles of the fathers," renders, the ſame word, in all the above places, in the ſame manner: which I thus give notice of, becauſe their thus tranſlating the word, muſt have proceeded from a full conviction of the neceſſary propriety of this verſion, and not from want of a good heart to ſerve the epiſcopal cauſe, as far as they could with a good conſcience.</p>
               <p>THE next plea, made in favor of the diſtinction between Biſhops and Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is fetched from ſect. xld, where Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpeaks of the threefold order in the Jewiſh church, "High-Prieſt, Prieſts, and Levites:" which is ſuppoſed to be a plain intimation of a like threefold order in the Chriſtian church, in the diſtinct officers of Biſhops, Preſbyters, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons. And as this is an argument
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:012009_0135_0F8940A3EF6D1918"/>
great ſtreſs is laid upon, I ſhall be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in conſidering it.</p>
               <p>ONLY I muſt firſt deſire the reader care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to look over ſect. xxxvii, xl, xli, xlii, xliv, which I have ſet down entire, that he may be able to judge of the manner in which theſe words are introduced, the purpoſe they are brought to ſerve, and the ſpecial application that is made of them; which muſt certainly be allowed to be the beſt method to come at their genuine meaning. Nor can it be thought fair to fix upon a few words, in a connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed argumentative diſcourſe, and plead for them as they be diſ-joined from what preceeds, and follows: but their ſenſe muſt be determined by the place they bear in the argument of which they are a part. Having obſerved this,</p>
               <p>I AM free to own, Clement, in order to reduce the church of Corinth to a ſtate of regularity, preſents to their view the oeconomy of the Jewiſh church; in which proper order and decorum had been conſtituted, and was obſerved. But when he mentions the "Jewiſh High-Prieſt, Prieſts, and Levites," that it was his
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:012009_0136_0F8940A4AE1D7F08"/>
intention to exhibit a pattern of the Chriſtian church, under the threefold order of Biſhops, Preſbyters, and Deacons, there is no appearance of a probability to ſuppoſe: as will be evident if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what follows in one conjunct view.</p>
               <p n="1">I. LET us compare this with the like kind of arguing, in this epiſtle. In ſect. xxxvii, Clement ſets before the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians the example of an army: in which every one has his proper place. "Some are only common Soldiers; ſome are Praefects; ſome Chiliarchs; ſome Centurions; ſome Chieftains of fifty; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of whom keeps to his own ſtation". Now, the deſign of this compariſon is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, namely, to repreſent the beauty and neceſſity of the like regularity in the church of Corinth. And the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is intirely abſolved in this general accommodation, without going ſo far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the parallel, as to ſuppoſe preciſely as many diſtinct officers in the church, as there are in an army.</p>
               <p>SURELY, it was not his meaning, "that the church militant muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimented into order, under Patriarchs.
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:012009_0137_0F8940A56D7D5320"/>
Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Prieſts, and other officers, ſuperior to the common chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian military!" There is no imaginable reaſon to ſuppoſe, ſuch a thought ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into his heart.</p>
               <p>IN Sect. XLII, he, in like manner, propoſes to the conſideration of the Corinthian church the good order that was obſerved in the Jewiſh church, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in their worſhip. They had (as he repreſents) "their ſacrifices both propitiatory and euchariſtical:" but theſe were not to be offered "every where," but "at Jeruſalem only;" and not in every place even at Jeruſalem, but in "the temple on the altar." And his aim here is plain, to encourage, among the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, from this example, the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent regularity; without carrying the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo far, as to make the Jewiſh worſhip an exact model for the Chriſtian. So in the caſe before us: when Clement men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the "High-Prieſt, Prieſts, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites," with each "their proper ſervices aſſigned them," though he ſo far accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modates this inſtance, as to argue it to be reaſonable, that there ſhould be, in like manner, perſons in the Chriſtian
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:012009_0138_0F8940A62CDAF0D0"/>
church, whoſe proper buſineſs it might be to attend its miniſtrations; yet, that there ought to be exactly a threefold or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them, in anſwer to the threefold order in the Jewiſh church, there is no more ground to think, than that the parallel in the foregoing caſes, ought to be intirely completed. It is enough that the parallel anſwer in the general deſign, he has in view, without making it, as we vulgarly ſpeak, "run on all four." And it deſerves particular notice, in the uſe Clement makes of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the words immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he regards only its general accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation. For thus he goes on, "Let every one of you, Brethren, in his own proper order give God thanks; living in good conſcience, and keeping within the defined rule of his ſervice." He infers nothing in particular from the example of the Jewiſh "High-Prieſt, Prieſts, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites" with their "appointed ſervices;" but only, in general, takes occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to every one, in his proper place, to keep the duties of his ſtation; without ſo much as giving the leaſt hint, as if there were juſt three ſtations in the church of Corinth, as there were in the
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:012009_0139_0F8940A7D75E6048"/>
church of the Jews; which muſt needs be deemed an argument of great negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, if he had intended any thing like an exact parallel. To go on,</p>
               <p n="2">II. IT is moſt obviouſly remarkable, Clement purpoſely ſets himſelf, in ſect. xliid, to exhibit an account of the apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic appointment of officers in the Chriſtian church: in which he quite lays aſide the Jewiſh conſtitution in a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold order, and mentions, inſtead of it, only the twofold order of Biſhops and Deacons. Says he, "The Apoſtles have preached the goſpel to us from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and Jeſus Chriſt from God. For Chriſt was ſent by God, and the Apoſtles by Chriſt.—Preaching there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore through cities and countries, they conſtituted their firſt fruits for BISHOPS and DEACONS."</p>
               <p>IT certainly would have been natural, if Clement had intended a parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Jewiſh "High-Prieſt, Prieſts, and Levites," and Chriſtian "Biſhops, Preſbyters, and Deacons;" I ſay, it would have been obvious for him to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:012009_0140_0F8940A89638E378"/>
here his diſcourſe but a few lines above: eſpecially, conſidering he was ſtill upon the ſame argument, purſuing one and the ſame deſign. But is there the leaſt hint of any ſuch application? So far from it, that he ſays not a ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a threefold, but expreſſly mentions a twofold order; and this, as appointed by the Apoſtles: which is an inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, upon the impleaded interpretation, not capable of being removed by any art of man.</p>
               <p>NOR is it unworthy of a remark, that, in proving this conſtitution of Biſhops and Deacons to be, not a novel thing, but what had long before been wrote about, Clement refers us to that paſſage in Iſaiah, "I will appoint their Biſhops in righteouſneſs, and Deacons in faith." Whether this text is pertinently quoted, or not, is not my buſineſs to inquire: but thus much is undeniable, that, had Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment perceived any reſemblance between the Jewiſh "High-Prieſt and Levites," (of whom he had but juſt before ſpoken) and chriſtian "Biſhops and Deacons", he would have much ſooner have turned us back to that conſtitution, then to this
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:012009_0141_0F8940A92D29B0F8"/>
text; and his omitting to do this, can be aſcribed to no other rational cauſe, but its not having entered his heart, to ſuppoſe any exact parallel between the Jewiſh, and Chriſtian conſtitution, in point of a threefold order of officers.</p>
               <p n="3">III. IT may not be amiſs to inquire, upon ſuppoſition Clement really intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the conſtitution of the Jewiſh church, in "High-Prieſt, Prieſts, and Levites," as a pattern for the conſtitution of the chriſtian church; I ſay, it may not be improper to inquire; whether, even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſuppoſition, he ſays any thing in favor of a diſtinction of order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Biſhops and Preſbyters. And it is plain he does not. For Biſhops, in the days of Clement, (according to the higheſt demand of prelatical writers) were the heads only of a few congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in particular cities, and their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring villages: whereas, nothing is more known, than that the "High-Prieſt" ſtood related, not to a few ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues in this, and the other city, and the towns bordering thereon; but to the whole Jewiſh church. There is therefore no analogy between Biſhops,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:012009_0142_0F8940A9ED9FC388"/>
and the Jewiſh High-Prieſt: nor ſhall we be able to find one any where ſhort of ROME. For, beſides the POPE, there is no viſible head to the chriſtian church, in any proper ſenſe, anſwering to the High-Prieſt among the Jews. One in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible one indeed there is, "Jeſus the HIGH-PRIEST of our profeſſion;" under whom are placed, in the church, Biſhops or Preſbyters, and Deacons. And in this ſenſe, the parallel is ſtrictly juſt, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly conſonant to the whole tenor of Clement's epiſtle: in which Chriſt is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly ſpoken of in the ſtile of HIGH-PRIEST <note n="*" place="bottom">In ſect. xxxvi, we have theſe words, "This is the way, beloved, in which we may find our Savior, Jeſus Chriſt, TON ARCHIEREA TÔN PROSPHORÔN EMÔN," that is, the "HIGH-PRIEST of our offerings."</note>; and under him, no other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are mentioned, as conſtituted in the chriſtian church, but Biſhops, who are alſo called Preſbyters, and Deacons. But if we muſt have a viſible head to the church, correſponding to the High-Prieſt in the Jewiſh model, there is no avoiding a ſubmiſſion to the PAPAL CHAIR. And, accordingly, to this purpoſe the Romaniſts conſtantly make uſe of this paſſage in Clement: and every one, with half an
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:012009_0143_0F8940AAB17D5F60"/>
eye, may ſee, that the parallel is far more juſt and natural between the POPE and the High-Prieſt, than between the High-Prieſt and Biſhops: ſince there may be hundreds of Biſhops in the chriſtian church; whereas there neither was, nor could be, but one High-Prieſt in the Jewiſh.</p>
               <p>IT will no doubt be here ſaid, it was the manner, in ancient times, to argue from the conſtitution of the Jewiſh church, in High-Prieſt, Prieſts, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, to the conſtitution of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church in Biſhops, Preſbyters, and Deacons: and, therefore, that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel ought here to be thus run, however unnatural it may appear. In anſwer whereto,</p>
               <p>I READILY acknowledge, it was an ancient cuſtom to argue from the Jewiſh to the Chriſtian conſtitution, as is plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but, at the ſame time, muſt obſerve, this method of arguing was not in uſe, in the days of Clement. It was plainly the invention of later times, when Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy (in ſome ſort analagous to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern ſenſe of the word) began to ſhow it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:012009_0144_0F8940AB6F6846B8"/>
nor can an inſtance be produced, from any writer, until long after the days of Clement, wherein it is thus uſed. It is not therefore fair to argue for this application of the words in Clement, from the like application of the ſame words, in thoſe authors, who had no being in the world, until Clement had been dead, and turned into duſt, for many years. Beſides, it ought to be conſidered, the writers, in after times, directly ſpeak of Biſhops in the ſtile of High-Prieſts, and expreſsly make them, in the parallel, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Jewiſh High-Prieſt; leaving no room for doubt in the matter, with how much weakneſs and aukwardneſs ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they, upon this account, become chargeable. But is this the caſe with Clement? Does he ever call a Biſhop, High-Prieſt? Does he ever go about to apply the Jewiſh conſtitution, ſo as to make Biſhops anſwer in the parallel to the High-Prieſt? So far from any thing of this tendency, that he makes mention (as we have ſeen) only of a twofold order of officers in the chriſtian church, and gives not the leaſt hint, as if he ever thought of a third that was higher.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="136" facs="unknown:012009_0145_0F8940AC2F51EFF8"/>IV. I SHALL add to what has been ſaid, if Clement is interpreted in the ſenſe I am oppoſing, there will be no harmony between his diſcourſe here, and the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtrain of his epiſtle; which, through the whole, perfectly agrees with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he gives of the twofold order of Biſhops and Deacons; but not at all with a threefold one, in imitation of the Jewiſh hierarchy. It is common in this epiſtle, it muſt be acknowledged, to meet with the word Biſhops as well as Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; to which if Deacons are added, ſome may think, the parallel will be made out. But it is obſervable, there never once oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs, in Clement's epiſtle, ſuch a mode of ſpeech, as Biſhops, Preſbyters, and Deacons, the almoſt ſacred and invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way of writing, after the diſtinction between Biſhops and Preſbyters took place. And though (as was ſaid) we read of Biſhops, as well as Preſbyters, yet it is ſo ordered, that the Biſhops are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much as once diſtinguiſhed from Preſbyters: nay, ſo far is Clement from repreſenting any diſtinction of order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, that he directly conſiders the Preſbyters of Corinth, as veſted with the Epiſcopal office, and in the moſt plain
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:012009_0146_0F8940ACEF6E5D50"/>
manner reflects blame upon that church, for "caſting their Preſbyters out of their Epiſcopacy."—But of this we ſhall more particularly ſpeak, under the laſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, brought from Clement in defence of modern Epiſcopacy.</p>
               <p>AND this is taken from thoſe words in ſect. xliv, "And the Apoſtles knew by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that there would be contention about the name of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy: therefore, being endued with perfect foreknowledge, they conſtituted the before-mentioned perſons (namely, Biſhops and Deacons;) and moreover gave direction how, if they ſhould die, other approved men ſhould ſucceed in their miniſtry."—Here it is urged, the Apoſtles are repreſented as knowing there would ariſe thoſe, who would appear againſt the cauſe of Epiſcopacy; and, as it were on purpoſe, to guard againſt it, did themſelves appoint Biſhops in the church, and provide for a ſucceſſion of others in this office, after the deceaſe of thoſe they appointed.</p>
               <p>THIS plea, however often it has been urged, I ſhall ſhow to be altogether inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:012009_0147_0F8940ADAE292768"/>
by making it evident, even from Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment himſelf, that his diſcourſe in this paſſage is ſo far from favoring any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of order between Biſhops and Preſbyters, that it is the ſtrongeſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, in his whole epiſtle, for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame order of officers in the church; and ſuch an one, that we could not have deſired a ſtronger, if we had been preſent, when this was exhibited, to direct his pen.</p>
               <p>THE teſtimony begins," And the Apoſtles knew by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, there would be contention about the name of Epiſcopacy."—But what are we to underſtand by this "Epiſcopacy?" Is it ſuch an one, as they only are veſted with, who are officers in the church ſuperior in their order to Preſbyters? The modern uſe, and ſound, of the word, may poſſibly be apt to lead the leſs thinking reader into ſuch an imagination: but the term Epiſcopacy, in the days of Clement, had quite another meaning from what it has now. With him, it intends only an overſight of the flock; ſuch an Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, as perſons nothing more than Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters might be, and actually were,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:012009_0148_0F8940AE6EDE36F8"/>
veſted with. And for the proof of this, I ſhall appeal to Clement himſelf; who, in this very ſection, tells us as much in the moſt plain language. His words are theſe, "For it is no ſmall ſin, if we caſt thoſe out of their Epiſcopacy, [<hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kopês,</hi> the very word uſed above] who have offered their gifts in an holy manner: Bleſſed are thoſe PRESBYTERS who have firſt finiſhed their courſe." It ſeems then Preſbyters might, in Clement's opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be veſted with Epiſcopacy, becauſe he declares the Preſbyters of Corinth were in fact thus veſted. Nor was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, "the Apoſtles knew there would be about the name of Epiſcopacy," any other than ſuch a contention as then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſubſiſted in the church of Corinth. And what was this? Not a contention, whether there was a diſtinction of order between Biſhops and Preſbyters: we have no hint of any ſuch thing any where in the epiſtle; but it was a contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the miniſterial order itſelf; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention about the office of Preſbyters, or (as they are likewiſe called) Biſhops; which the people had carried to ſuch an height, as that they had roſe up againſt their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops or Preſbyters, and turned them out of their Epiſcopacy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="unknown:012009_0149_0F8940AF2E1F6368"/>THE plea goes on, the Apoſtles, to guard againſt this contention about Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, "conſtituted Biſhops and Deacons, and moreover gave direction (according to others a roll or liſt) that, when they ſhould die, other approved men might ſucceed in the miniſtry." And no one doubts, but the Apoſtles appointed Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and provided for a ſucceſſion of ſuch officers in the church. But the queſtion is, Who are here meant by theſe Biſhops? Were they an order in the church diſtinct from, and ſuperior to, Preſbyters? Clement himſelf can beſt inform us. And this he has done ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that we cannot well fail of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his mind, if we will but attend to what he has ſaid. Let us then examine the connection of his diſcourſe in this paragraph.</p>
               <p>AND he very plainly lays it down (1) That "the Apoſtles knew there would be contention about Epiſcopacy." (2) To guard againſt this, they did them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves "appoint Biſhops and Deacons in the church"; that is, (if we turn to ſect. xlii, the place he himſelf has refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:012009_0150_0F8940AFF008BCD8"/>
to) they conſtituted of the "firſt fruits of their converſions, a number of Biſhops and Deacons" for the benefit of the church, as believers ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards increaſe. (3) Beſides this conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of perſons, they "gave direction," as deaths ſhould happen, that "others ſhould be conſtituted to ſucceed in their room." (4) From theſe premiſes, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it to be an unjuſtifiable thing to "caſt thoſe out of their Epiſcopacy," who have behaved well; whether they had been conſtituted by the Apoſtles themſelves, or other excellent men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. And now (5) To bring his argument to a point, and to let the church of Corinth certainly know, that he aimed at them in all this diſcourſe; and deſigned to condemn their unſutable conduct towards their Preſbyters, he offers to their conſideration the "bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe Preſbyters, who have gone off the ſtage," in this article in ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, "that they could not be removed out of the place where they were fixed, as they had removed ſome of their Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters from their honorable miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="unknown:012009_0151_0F8940B0B4A60AE8"/>THIS is the unqueſtionable connection of Clement's arguing in this paragraph. Upon which I would appeal to any perſon of common underſtanding, whether he could have any other intention, in this train of reaſoning, than to offer conviction to the church of Corinth, of their faulty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in "caſting their Preſbyters out of their office?" But if their Preſbyters had been any other than thoſe Biſhops, he had ſpoken of as conſtituted, either by the Apoſtles themſelves, or other famous men afterwards, what pertinency is there in this method of reaſoning? He men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions only Biſhops and Deacons as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by the Apoſtles, or to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted afterwards by others, by their direction. If therefore the Preſbyters of Corinth had not been in the number of thoſe Biſhops, they had not acted againſt any apoſtolical conſtitution, and could not fall by the force of this arguing: whereas, on the other hand, if by theſe Preſbyters we underſtand the ſame order of officers with the Biſhops here ſpoken of, and conſider the words Biſhops and Preſbyters, as only different names to point out the ſame perſons, the reaſoning will not only be clear and forceable, but
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:012009_0152_0F8940B16CDA1610"/>
perfectly conſonant to the connection of his whole diſcourſe; which ſo obviouſly and neceſſarily leads to this, that I am well ſatisfied no art of man can elude the evidence there is for it.</p>
               <p>BESIDES, if theſe Biſhops were an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of officers ſuperior to Preſbyters, why ſhould Clement ſo particularly mention the apoſtolic conſtitution of Biſhops, about whom (as officers diſtinct from, and ſuperior to, Preſbyters) there is no hint, in the epiſtle, as if there was any conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, at the ſame time, omit ſaying a word about the conſtitution of Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, (as he certainly does, if they are an order diſtinct from Biſhops) againſt whom the church of Corinth had roſe up in the moſt unſeemly manner? This ſeems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unintelligible: eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, it is the governing deſign of this whole epiſtle, and of this paragraph in ſpecial, to correct the conduct of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians towards their PRESBYTERS, and ſet them right in their behavior for time to come.</p>
               <p>AND now, being let into the true meaning of Clement's Biſhops, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:012009_0153_0F8940B22CE6C428"/>
among the learned, about that difficult word <hi>epinomin,</hi> in that part of the paragraph, where mention is made of the apoſtolic proviſion for the ſucceſſion of Biſhops, is quite ſuperſeded. For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we tranſlate it with Arch-Biſhop Wake, and Boyſe, direction; or with Burton, Salmaſius, and Biſhop Pearſon, command; or with Young and Dr. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, deſcription, liſt, roll, catalogue: I ſay, in which ſoever of theſe ſenſes we take the word, it matters not; ſo long as the Biſhops in Clement are preciſely the ſame order of officers with Preſbyters.</p>
               <p>ONLY I cannot omit obſerving, that the conſtruction, which ſuppoſes the Apoſtles to have given a liſt, or roll of ſucceſſors, does not ſeem at all probable. For, as the learned Boyſe argues againſt this interpretation,
<q>Who ever heard of ſuch a liſt or roll? Was it a catalogue of all their ſucceſſors to the worlds end? Or a liſt of their ſucceſſors, for one, two, or three centuries? How came this liſt, or roll to be loſt? when the preſervation of it would have been of ſuch vaſt conſequence, to prevent all diſputes about future elections. For
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:012009_0154_0F8940B3D5A64068"/>
doubtleſs the churches would readily have concurred in the choice of ſuch, as the Apoſtles, from certain foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, had marked down for Biſhops and Deacons. So that it is certain, either this catalogue was never given by them, or thoſe churches, to whom it was given, were guilty of inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble negligence, in ſuffering ſo valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a roll, that would have cleared up the uninterrupted line of Epiſcopal ſucceſſion, beyond diſpute, to be ſo ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly loſt, that no notion, no monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, ſhould be heard of to this day, and no Biſhop ever once appeal to it, to juſtifie his claim againſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE evidence ſupppoſed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this epiſtle, for the ſuperiority of Biſhops to Preſbyters, being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the way; I am under the fairer advantage to propoſe a few obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, which ſeem abundantly ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſhow it to have been the mind of Clement, that Biſhops and Preſbyters were, in his day, one and the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of officers in the Chriſtian church. And,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="146" facs="unknown:012009_0155_0F8940B48B77AF28"/>1. I OBSERVE, when Clement ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ex profeſſo, to give an account of the apoſtolical conſtitution of officers in the Chriſtian church; and this, not in one or two particular places only, but throughout cities and countries, as they travelled to propagate the faith of Chriſt; he makes mention only of the two or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Biſhops and Deacons. And it is remarkable, how exactly conſonant this account is, to the ſcripture account of the conſtitution of the church of Philippi; in writing to whom, the Apoſtle Paul takes notice of no other officers among them, ſave only Biſhops and Deacons. And the ſame Apoſtle writing to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy about church officers, deſcribes only the qualifications of Biſhops and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I OBSERVE what is yet more full to my purpoſe, thoſe Biſhops, Clement men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as conſtituted by the Apoſtles, or other famous men afterwards, were one and the ſame order of men with Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: otherwiſe, he paſſes over a whole order of eccleſiaſtical officers; and this, at a time when he had undertaken to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit an account of the apoſtolic conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:012009_0156_0F8940B52D7851E0"/>
of officers, in the Chriſtian church; which cannot but be thought an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable omiſſion. The only officers he takes notice of, as appointed by the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, are Biſhops and Deacons. But if by the term Biſhops, he does not mean the ſame kind of officers with thoſe that are called Preſbyters, he has certainly not ſaid a word about any appointment of this order of officers; which is unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countably ſtrange, conſidering he makes particular mention of the lower order in the church, that of Deacons. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, unleſs we ſuppoſe Clement to mean preciſely the ſame ſort of officers, when he uſes, ſometimes the word Biſhops, and ſometimes the word Preſbyters, we ſhall make him a moſt blundering writer. For one of the main arguments he uſes, to reflect blame upon the church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, for riſing up againſt their Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, is, the apoſtolic conſtitution of Biſhops: but if by this term, he did not mean the ſame ſort of officers, where would be the force of this reaſoning? How would it tend to afford conviction to the Corinthians, that they had done ill in acting againſt their Preſbyters, to be told of the apoſtolic appointment of one
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:012009_0157_0F8940B5ED60ED98"/>
order of officers ſuperior to their Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and another inferior to them; while, at the ſame time, not a word is ſaid whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the order of Preſbyters was ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted at all? Such a method of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning is certainly very extraordinary, and much better calculated to encourage them in their ſedition, than to bring them to repentance, and put a ſtop to it. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops therefore with Clement are the ſame rank of officers with Preſbyters. And, as if he had it in deſign, that we ſhould not miſtake him, he plainly ſpeaks of the Preſbyters of Corinth, as ſome of thoſe very Biſhops that were conſtituted either by the Apoſtles, or others after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by their direction: for he ſuppoſes them placed in the epiſcopal office, in that he directly finds fault with the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans "for caſting them out of their Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy."</p>
               <p>AND upon this, it is moſt obvious to take notice of the perfect harmony there is, between the language of Clement and the Apoſtle Paul; who, when he had left Titus in Crete to ordain Elders in every city, writes to him to acquaint him with the qualifications that ought to
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:012009_0158_0F8940B6ADD84460"/>
be found in thoſe, who were to be conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Biſhops; evidently uſing the words, Preſbyters and Biſhops, as ſignifying the ſame order of church officers. The Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt Luke likewiſe ſpeaks of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, as ordaining Elders in every church; which is moſt plainly the ſame account with this of Clement, who mentions them as conſtituting Biſhops in the churches they founded: for theſe Biſhops were no other than Elders; and if Clement had ſpoken of the Apoſtles, as appointing Elders or Preſbyters in the churches they planted, it would have been perfectly the ſame thing with his ſaying, that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Biſhops.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I OBSERVE, as a yet further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of what we are upon, that Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter-Biſhops are the higheſt order of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical officers ſpoken of in this epiſtle. They are the only perſons mentioned as "ſet over the church of Corinth;" they are the only perſons that church are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to be "in ſubjection to:" nor is there a word liſped of any duty owing from them to any ſuperior order of men; no, nor the leaſt hint given of any ſuch order; which leads me to obſerve in the laſt place,</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="150" facs="unknown:012009_0159_0F8940B76F1901C0"/>4. THE moral aſſurance we have, that Clement knew of no Biſhop, at leaſt, in the church of Corinth, of a ſuperior or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that of Preſbyter.—Let us conſider the direction of the epiſtle: it runs in that ſtile, "the church of Rome to the church of Corinth," without any notice at all of their Biſhop; which is ſo much unlike the manner of inſcriptions in after times, when Biſhops were diſtinguiſhed from Preſbyters, that, from this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance only, it looks probable, there was no ſingle Biſhop at the head of that church. But the probability will be heightened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to certainty, if we add, there is as intire ſilence, through the whole epiſtle, of the Biſhop of this church: whereas, if any ſingle perſon had been at their head of an order diſtinct from their Preſbyters, and inveſted with a ſuperior right of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively managing in all eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affairs, it is not conceivable but he muſt, ſome how or other, have been plainly pointed out.</p>
               <p>THE firſt, moſt ſuperior, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed officer in this church, could not but have been intereſted in the ſhameful diſturbance that was the occaſion of this
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:012009_0160_0F8940B82EA11A70"/>
letter. He muſt have joined, either with the Preſbyters, or the people, or have been an idle ſpectator of the preſent quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; and, in either caſe, there are great difficulties to be accounted for.</p>
               <p>IF he had been united with the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and made uſe of his Epiſcopal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to oblige the people to peace, and their duty to their Preſbyters, it is ſtrange they are no where reprimanded for diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the authority of their Biſhop! nor can it well be imagined, that Clement ſhould be ſo ſevere upon them for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent carriage to their Preſbyters, and yet ſilently paſs over their diſobedience to their Biſhop; which muſt ſurely have deſerved a rebuke, if they had oppoſed his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in their uſage of their Preſbyters.</p>
               <p>OR, if he had favoured the Corinthian church, in their ill treatment of their Preſbyters, it is much lie is not reaſoned with, that he might be convinced of his miſtake: ſince the church are ſo ſharply rebuked, and earneſtly exhorted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendment: nor is it eaſy to conceive of the propriety (according to the epiſcopal ſcheme) of their being
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:012009_0161_0F8940B8EF652DC0"/>
thus blamed, and condemned, while they had the countenance of their Biſhop in what they did. Upon this ſuppoſition, the firſt thing neceſſary, in order to peace, muſt have been to have offered conviction to the Biſhop, and engaged him to deſiſt from encouraging the church, in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious practice againſt their Preſbyters.</p>
               <p>OR if we might imagine it poſſible for a Biſhop, to be ſo thoughtleſs of the peace and quiet of his church, as to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned ſpectator of this faction, which had increaſed to ſuch an height, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the compaſſion of the church of Rome, it is wonderful he is not admoniſhed, at leaſt, in a ſoft and gentle manner, of his neglect; and beſought to interpoſe with his authority to heal this diviſion! But inſtead of this, to complete the unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table conduct both of Clement, and the church of Rome, though the Biſhop was the moſt ſutable perſon to be applied to in this caſe, neither Preſbyters, nor people are directed to refer the matter to him; nor to aſk his advice: nor is his name, or any thing relating to him, or his office, ſo much as diſtantly hinted at.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="unknown:012009_0162_0F8940B9ADA3A7A0"/>OR if it be ſuppoſed, without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of proof, that the church of Corinth happened to be without a Biſhop, juſt at the time of this ſedition, and the compoſure of this epiſtle: I ſay, even ſuppoſing this, meerly to ſerve an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, it is a great difficulty no mention ſhould be made of their late Biſhop, nor any advice given them to come into a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy choice of a new Biſhop, as the moſt ſutable remedy to heal their differences. This was thought one of the beſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents to compoſe differences, in after times. And it is the very method, the Preſbyters of Rome, when that ſee was vacant by the death of Fabian, mention in their letter to Cyprian, in order to the removal of their difficulties. And it was as fit a method in the days of Clement, as in the days of Cyprian; and no other reaſon can be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned of his being wholly ſilent about it, but that he knew of no difference between the order of Biſhops, and Preſbyters.</p>
               <p>UPON the whole, if Biſhops, in the days of Clement, were officers in the church any way reſembling our modern Prelates, theſe are certainly moſt inexcuſable omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: nor are they capable of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for to reaſonable ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="unknown:012009_0163_0F8940BA6D3ABC40"/>I SHALL finiſh my examination of Clement, with inſerting the opinion of two as learned men as ever appeared, upon the matter we have laſt been diſputing. "They that can find any one ſingle Biſhop at Corinth, at the time, when Clement wrote this epiſtle to them, muſt have better eyes, and judgment, than the deſervedly admired Grotius": ſo ſpeaks the great Biſhop of Worceſter. Grotius's judgment (here referred to) was plainly this, he mentions it as a proof of the antiquity and genuineneſs of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Copy of Clement's epiſtle, "That he no where takes notice of that exorbitant power of Biſhops, which was firſt intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in Alexandria, after the death of Mark, and from that example into other churches; but evidently ſhows, that the churches were governed by the common council of Preſbyters, who, by him, and the Apoſtle Paul, are called Biſhops."</p>

            <head type="sub">His character, writings, and teſtimonies from them, with obſervations and remarks.</head>
            <p>PREVIOUS to what may be offered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to this Father, I would give notice, that the order of time is a little broke in upon, by giving him a place here; for his "epiſtle to the Philippians" was not wrote until after the death of Ignatius, who muſt therefore have wrote before him. But, as there are ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant paſſages, in his "epiſtle," the reader ſhould be acquainted with, before he comes to Ignatius, it was thought beſt to place him firſt. Having obſerved this, I go on;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="unknown:012009_0165_0F8940BCD708BA80"/>POLYCARP had his birth in the apoſtolic age; and probably not a great many years on this ſide, the middle of the firſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. Some modern authors ſpeak of him as born in Smyrna; as being a ſlave in his younger years, and bought by a certain Lady named Caleſto, who, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with giving him his freedom, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed him in the Chriſtian religion, and afterwards made him her heir. But as theſe accounts, with many other of a like import, are extracted from writers great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remote from the age in which Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp lived, and that were too much given to the romantic ſtrain, they are not to be depended on.</p>
            <p>IT may, upon much better authority, be eſteemed a juſt ſtroke in his character, that he was one that "ſat under the teaching of the Apoſtles," and was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly "converſant with thoſe that knew our Lord," and particularly "with the Apoſtle John." This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we have from Irenaeus, which we may the rather give credit to, becauſe he ſpeaks not only of his having, "in his younger years, ſeen Polycarp;" but as
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:012009_0166_0F8940BD6D66C998"/>
"retaining in his mind a diſtinct remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of having heard him relate theſe things."</p>
            <p>HE likewiſe makes mention of him as Biſhop of Smyrna, and as placed in this office by the Apoſtles; though Tertullian names none of the Apoſtles, ſave "John," as having an hand in his conſtitution. And Euſebius only ſays in general, "He was made Biſhop by thoſe, who ſaw the Lord, and miniſtred to him." But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it might be as to this circumſtance, there is no difficulty about the thing it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He is readily allowed to have been Biſhop of Smyrna.</p>
            <p>AND from hence a mighty argument is drawn, in favor of his having been of an order in the church, ſuperior to that of Preſbyters; eſpecially, when, in conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion herewith, that is ſuppoſed to be true, which Arch-Biſhop Uſher has endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to prove to be ſo, namely, That he was Biſhop of Smyrna, when the Apoſtle John ſent his "apocalyptical letter" to the "Angel of that church." But the foundation of the argument at once vaniſhes, when it is conſidered, that,
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:012009_0167_0F8940BE2E89C5C8"/>
in the age of Polycarp, no ſuch thing as a diſtinction of order, between Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Preſbyters, was known in the church. This we have already proved from Clement of Rome, and Hermas, both Polycarp's contemporaries; and ſhall further confirm from Polycarp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when we come to take notice of his "epiſtle to the Philippians." And what is particularly obſervable, in the caſe of Polycarp, he is by Irenaeus called Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, as well as Biſhop. In his epiſtle to Florinus, that is the ſtile in which he ſpeaks of him, "Polycarp, [<hi>apoſtolikos Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteros</hi>] the apoſtolical Preſbyter"; which is the more worthy of notice, becauſe, with Irenaeus, the reciprocal uſe of the words, Biſhop and Preſbyter, is very common. And herein (as we ſhall ſee in the progreſs of this work) there is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful agreement among the writers of this age, Ignatius only excepted, which we ſhall account for afterwards. So that if we ſhould, even, ſuppoſe, the "An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the church of Smyrna" to be Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp, a then Biſhop of that church, ſo long as we are juſt to interpret the word Biſhop, in the ſenſe, in which it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, in this age of Chriſtianity, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:012009_0168_0F8940BEEE11D2C0"/>
more can be made of it, than that he was an officer in that church, of the ſame order with the reſt of the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it: though he might be the moſt eminent, known, and diſtinguiſhed among them; and the moſt proper, upon theſe accounts, to receive a letter which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the whole church.</p>
            <p>IT is commonly, in modern accounts of the life of Polycarp, mentioned as an article particularly redounding to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that the venerable Ignatius had ſuch an opinion of him, as a truly apoſtolical man, that he pitched upon him, as the moſt ſuitable perſon he could commend the care of his church at Antioch to, when he was parted from them, and on his journey to Rome, to ſuffer mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom. He is likewiſe highly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in love, and reverenced, as being the ſuppoſed collector of the epiſtles of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius: which, together with one of his own, he is ſaid to have ſent, by one Creſcens, to the church of Philippi.—But theſe things we ſhall have occaſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, at large, in a more proper place; and ſo ſhall leave them at preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="unknown:012009_0169_0F8940BFAE586910"/>NOTHING more is found recorded of this primitive Father, until the eaſtern and weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern churches began to controvert about the time of keeping eaſter; which occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his going to Rome (about the middle of the ſecond century) in the days of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetus, to confer with him upon that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And notwithſtanding all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, theſe grave Fathers might have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this head, they could not come to an agreement; the one pleading apoſtolical practice for one time of obſerving this feaſt, and the other the cuſtom of his predeceſſors, even up to the Apoſtles, for another: yet they were charitably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed towards each other; which they ſignified, by communicating together: and Anicetus, for the reverence he had for Polycarp, gave him the euchariſt in his church; after which they ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably parted; and, as Euſebius ſays, "in the univerſal church, they were at peace with one another."</p>
            <p>HOWEVER this might be, I cannot help going out of my way to obſerve, that peace did not continue very long; for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, far from having a final ſtop now put to it, ſtrangely increaſed afterwards,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:012009_0170_0F8940C06DAD7370"/>
until it had even overſpread the whole Chriſtian world, and filled it with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs and contention. It ſeems to have been at a monſtrous height, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter end of the ſecond centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the days of Victor, who (to rely on the authority of Sir Peter King) was ſo very turbulent and imperious, that he excommunicated the Aſiatics, for their not complying with the church of Rome in this matter; condemning them for Heretics, and beſtowing upon them a long and frightful name, becauſe they kept their eaſter upon the fourteenth day after the appearance of the moon, or at full moon, on what day ſoever it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. Nor was this controverſy ſettled, until the council of Nice, anno 325, by their authority, decided it; decreeing, that, throughout the whole Chriſtian world, eaſter ſhould be obſerved, not on the day that the Jewiſh paſſover fell, that is, at full moon; but on the Lord's day enſuing, as it was afterwards kept.</p>
            <p>THE learned Stillingfleet improves this controverſy, by deducing from it an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt the certainty of preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded apoſtolic tradition, in a manner well
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:012009_0171_0F8940C12DC4D3D0"/>
worth our inſerting.
<q>For my part (ſays he) I ſee not how any man, that would ſee reaſon for what he does, can adhere to the church for an unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable tradition, received from the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; when, in the caſe of keeping eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whether with the Jews on the fourteenth moon, or only on the Lord's day, there was ſo much unreaſonable heat ſhewed on both ſides, and ſuch confidence that, on either ſide, their tradition was apoſtolical. They had herein all the advantages imaginable, in order to the knowing the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the thing then in queſtion among them; as their nearneſs to apoſtolical times, being but one remove from them; yea, the perſons contending, pleading perſonal acquaintance with ſome of the Apoſtles themſelves, as Polycarp with John, and Anicetus of Rome that he had the tradition from Peter: and yet, ſo great were the heats, ſo irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable the controverſy, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to dart the thunderbolt of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication in one anothers faces.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I WILL here add, what makes this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy the more ſtrange, is, that there
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:012009_0172_0F8940C1EEEF55C8"/>
is no account in ſcripture of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any ſuch annual feaſt; nor the leaſt intimation, that it was ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by Chriſtians in the Apoſtle's days. Upon which, I cannot reſtrain myſelf from tranſcribing the thoughts of Socrates, one of our moſt ancient and valuable eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical hiſtorians, upon this head. <note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. V. Cap. 22.</note> Says he,
<q>Neither the ancients, nor the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, who have ſtudiouſly followed the Jews, had, in my judgment, any juſt or rational cauſe of contending ſo much about this feſtival. For they conſidered not with themſelves, that, when the Jewiſh religion was changed into Chriſtianity, thoſe accurate obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the moſaic law, and the types of things future, ceaſed. And this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries along with it, its own demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For no one of Chriſt's laws has permitted the Chriſtians to obſerve the rites of the Jews. Moreover, on the contrary, the Apoſtle has expreſſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid this, and does not only reject cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, but always adviſes againſt contending about feſtival days. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in his epiſtle to the Galatians, his
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:012009_0173_0F8940C2ADEDEF40"/>
words are theſe, "Tell me, ye that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?" And having ſpent ſome few words in his diſcourſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he demonſtrates, that the people of the Jews are "ſervants," but that thoſe who followed Chriſt are "called to liberty." Moreover, it is his admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, "that days, and months, and years, ſhould in no wiſe be obſerved". Beſides, in his epiſtle to the Coloſſians, he loudly affirms, that ſuch obſervations "are a ſhadow." Wherefore he ſays, Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in reſpect of any holy-day, or of the new moons, or of the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath days; which are a ſhadow of things to come.</q>
               <q>—The Apoſtles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the goſpels, have no where impoſed the yoke of ſervitude on thoſe, who have approached the preaching of faith; but have left the feaſt of eaſter, and the other feſtivals, to be honored by their gratitude and benevolence, who have had benefits conferred on them on theſe days. Wherefore, in regard men love feſtivals, becauſe thereon they have ceſſation from their labours, each perſon, in every place, according to his
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:012009_0174_0F8940C3702B67D8"/>
own pleaſure, has, by a certain cuſtom, celebrated the memory of the ſaving paſſion. For neither our Savior, nor his Apoſtles, have enjoined us by any law to obſerve this feſtival. Nor have the goſpels, or the Apoſtles, threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with any mulct, puniſhment, or curſe, as the moſaic law does the Jews. Moreover, it was not the Apoſtle's deſign to make laws concerning feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val days, but to introduce good life and piety. And it ſeems to me, that, as many other things, in ſeveral places, have been eſtabliſhed by cuſtom, ſo the feaſt of eaſter alſo had a peculiar ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation among all perſons, from ſome old uſage, in regard none of the Apoſtles (as I have ſaid) have made any determinate decree about it. Now, that the obſervation of this feſtival had its original, among all men, in the primitive times, from cuſtom ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than law, the things themſelves do demonſtrate.</q>
And this he goes on in ſeveral pages clearly to make out. But I muſt now return,</p>
            <p>POLYCARP, being at Rome, did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his character as a miniſter of Jeſus
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:012009_0175_0F8940C42D4EF7F0"/>
Chriſt; but ſet himſelf to defend the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the goſpel: which he did to good purpoſe, confirming the ſouls of many, and recovering ſome from the poiſonous errors of thoſe two arch-heretics Marci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Valentinus. The former of theſe he once accidentally met in the ſtreets of Rome, but had no other converſation with him, than to let him know, that he eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be the "firſt-born of ſatan." This may poſſibly be thought a rough compliment; but it is a ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his great indignation againſt thoſe, who had ſo abominably corrupted the faith of Chriſt. Irenaeus attributes this ſeverity of language to his ſtrict ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to that apoſtolic rule, "A man that is an heretic, after the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond admonition, reject: knowing that he that is ſuch is perverted, and ſinneth, being condemned of himſelf."</p>
            <p>THE next thing we meet with, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Polycarp, relates to his death; which he did not ſuffer until he had long la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored in the ſervice of Chriſt. He is univerſally acknowledged to have lived to be very old, not under ninety; and ſome think, conſiderably upwards of an
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:012009_0176_0F8940C4ECB36F88"/>
hundred years: and yet, he did not go out of the world in the ordinary way, but fell a martyr in the cauſe of Chriſt. We have extant an "epiſtle of the church of Smyrna", giving a particular account of his martyrdom, as to its time, occaſion, manner, and circumſtances. Dr. Cave calls it a piece "that challenges a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar eſteem and reverence, both for its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter, and antiquity; with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of which, he joins with Scaliger in ſaying, every ſerious and devout mind muſt needs be ſo affected, as to think he can never have enough of it." And it is very true, ſome parts of this epiſtle are well calculated to affect a ſerious and well-diſpoſed mind; but then, it has ſuch a mixture of what ſo evidently carries the face of meer fable, as to make it queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable, whether it be an exact repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of what was real fact. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this we have in Sect. xv, where we read of "the flames diſpoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the reſemblance of an arch, like the ſails of a ſhip ſwelled with the wind, gently encircling the body of the martyr; who ſtood all the while in the midſt, not like roaſted fleſh, but gold pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in the furnace; his body ſending
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:012009_0177_0F8940C699A0D250"/>
forth a delightful fragrancy, like frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe or coſtly ſpices, preſenting it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the ſenſes of the by-ſtanders." Of the ſame nature is ſect. xvi, which ſpeaks of "his body as incapable of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by the fire; upon which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner, being commanded, thruſt a launce into him: which he had no ſooner done, but a pigeon came forth out of the wound; and, together therewith, ſuch a large quantity of blood as extinguiſhed the fire." Some other things, in the like ſtrain, are here to be met with; which, perhaps, not many will find a faith wide enough to ſwallow.</p>
            <p>IT muſt not indeed be concealed, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius has thought it worth while, not only to mention this "epiſtle," but to give the greateſt part of it a place in his "eccleſiaſtical hiſtory." But then, it ought to be obſerved, he is the firſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that takes any notice of it. And if his mentioning it be uſed as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to eſtabliſh its authority, the total ſilence of antiquity, from the time of its ſuppoſed compoſure to his day, which was at leaſt an hundred and fifty years, may be oppoſed thereto as a counter-ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance.
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:012009_0178_0F8940C72E13E600"/>
The Engliſh reader may meet with this "epiſtle" in Arch-Biſhop Wake's "apoſtolical fathers," complete, or the ſubſtance of it, in Dr. Cave's "lives of the primitive Fathers," and the "biographia eccleſiaſtica" of an anonimous author.</p>
            <p>I SHALL obſerve nothing further of Polycarp, but that the learned are at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance about the particular time of his death. Biſhop Pearſon ſuppoſes him to have been martyred under Antoninus Pius, in the year 147: but he is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally thought to have ſuffered under Aurelius Verus; ſome think in the year 167; others in 169; others in 170; others in 175. His memory is ſaid to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by the Greek church, February 23; by the Latin, January 26.</p>

               <p>IRENAEUS, in his letter to Florinus, mentions "ſeveral epiſtles" which he wrote; ſome to the "neighbouring churches for their confirmation in the faith;" and others to certain of his "brethren for their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and admonition."

               <head>OBSERVATIONS and REMARKS on the foregoing teſtimonies.</head>
               <p>UPON a review of the above paſſages, nothing is more evident than that Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp ſpeaks only of two orders of officers in the church at Philippi; in which he
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:012009_0185_0F8940CC6D451C80"/>
remarkably harmoniſes with Clement of Rome: only, whereas Clement promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly makes uſe of the names, Biſhop and Preſbyter to ſignify the higheſt, or firſt, of theſe orders, Polycarp confines himſelf to the term Preſbyter, not ſo much as once naming the word Biſhop, any where in his epiſtle. Nor is there a leſs agreement between Polycarp, and the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Paul upon this head: only, whereas the Apoſtle Paul, in writing to this church at Philippi, ſpeaks of its officers in the ſtile of "Biſhops and Deacons;" Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp alters the denomination, mentioning the firſt of theſe orders, under the name of "Preſbyters." And as they both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend one and the ſame order of officers, the change of ſtile, in which they ſpeak of them, is a ſignal illuſtration of the Preſbyterian gloſs upon the Apoſtle's words; as well as a good argument, that, in the language of theſe times, the terms Biſhop and Preſbyter meant preciſely the ſame order of eccleſiaſtical officers.</p>
               <p>NOR does Polycarp barely mention Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters as the higheſt of the two orders
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:012009_0186_0F8940CD2CDD4678"/>
he takes notice of, in the church at Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi; but he likewiſe ſpeaks of theſe Preſbyters, as having devolved on them the "inſpection and rule" of the church. He therefore exhorts the Philippians "to be ſubject to their Preſbyters;" and the Preſbyters he exhorts, "to abſtain from reſpect of perſons and unrighteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not haſtily believing a report againſt any man; not being rigid in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:" which plainly ſuppoſes them, in his opinion, to have been veſted with the power of eccleſiaſtical diſcipline: and this, without any perſon of a ſuperior or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at their head. For it happens here, as in the epiſtle of Clement, there is a total ſilence about the Biſhop of this church. Neither his name, or authority, are once mentioned: nor is there, through the whole epiſtle, ſo much as a glance, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our thoughts to any perſon, related to this church, of ſuperior authority to the Preſbyters of it.</p>
               <p>THE reply ſometimes made to this is, perhaps the Biſhop was dead. But what intimation is there, the epiſtle, or elſewhere, that he was ever alive? It
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:012009_0187_0F8940CF2F9EA898"/>
ought firſt to be proved, and not taken for granted, that he once had exiſtence; before it will, in reaſon, account for the ſilence there is about him, to ſay he was dead. Nor is it conceivable, if this had really been the caſe, but Polycarp would have offered the Philippians matter of comfort under ſo heavy a loſs: at leaſt, he might have wiſhed them another Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or recommended it to them, to take care to get his place filled up.</p>
               <p>IT may be worth while juſt to obſerve here, how frequently, according to the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſcheme, the primitive ſees were vacant by the death of their Biſhops. When Clement wrote to the Corinthians, one plea is, their Biſhop was dead, in order to ſatiſfy for the ſilence there is about him. When we come to Philippi, the ſame anſwer is made; the Biſhop is dead. And he was doubtleſs dead too in the days of the Apoſtle Paul: for he is as ſilent about him as Polycarp. The words of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Mr. Jameſon deſerve a place here. Says he
<q>Philippi is no leſs fatal to the Epiſcopals, than its neighbouring plains were to the Pompeians: for they are
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:012009_0188_0F8940CF6DC64AD0"/>
ſtung and confounded with the very firſt words of Paul to that church: and among their other wild ſhifts, they anſwer, that the Biſhop was often ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. But there was a good number of years between the writing of Paul, and that of Polycarp, to the Philippians; and yet, we ſee the Biſhop is never come home. Why tarry the wheels of his Lordſhip's chariot? Hath he not ſped at court, that, after ſo long abſence, there is no news of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn? nor are we like ever to hear any more of him, for now (ſay they) he is dead.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THERE being, in the body of this epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, nothing but what makes much againſt the cauſe of modern Epiſcopacy, great ſtreſs is laid upon theſe words in the "inſcription" to it, "Polycarp and the Preſbyters that are with him." But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that can be made of theſe words, it will be impoſſible to find in them any marks of a ſuperiority of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der between Polycarp, and theſe Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="unknown:012009_0189_0F8940D02CDEEC58"/>IT is true, Polycarp is firſt mentioned, and then the other Preſbyters of Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na: but what is this to prove his epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal juriſdiction, his being placed at the head of theſe Preſbyters, as an officer of diſtinct and ſuperior rank? Certainly, no ſuch thing can be collected, by any genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine deduction from this mode of diction. It rather plainly imports a parity of order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the perſons directing the epiſtle; for they are evidently aſſociated as a body, without any ſign of diſtinction at all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a meer primacy may be ſo called: whereas, if Polycarp had been the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal head of the Preſbyters of Smyrna, the inſcription (as the learned Salmatius ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) had more properly run, "Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp the Biſhop, and the Preſbyters of Smyrna:"—or rather, the epiſtle had been ſent in his own name, without any mention of the Preſbyters. And there is the more reaſon for this obſervation, if we may ſuppoſe the truth of what this ſame author adds; namely, "There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be produced a ſingle inſtance, after the diſtinction between Biſhops and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters took place, of any epiſtle wrote by any Biſhop, who, in the inſcription, made
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:012009_0190_0F8940D11FF94D80"/>
himſelf a co-partner with Preſbyters." This is evidently the caſe here; the moſt natural meaning of the inſcription being obviouſly this, "Polycarp and the reſt of the Preſbyters of that college." Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp plainly here joins himſelf with the other Preſbyters: they are all repreſented as ſo many co-partners in ſending the epiſtle: nor is there any diſtinction in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated between them; only, Polycarp is particularly named, and firſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: which may eaſily, and ſatisfactorily, be accounted for, without going into the ſuppoſition of his being of an order in the church ſuperior to that of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</p>
               <p>ONE great argument (exactly ſimilar to this, from this inſcription) the Romaniſts make uſe of to prove "Peter's primacy," or ſuperiority over the reſt of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, is taken from his name's being firſt placed in the catalogues, and narrations, we have of him and them, both in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and antiquity: to which the great Dr. Barrow (allowing the fact at leaſt to be ſo conſtant as not to ſeem caſual) anſwers,
<q>That poſition of names does
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:012009_0191_0F8940D2C4AE8068"/>
not argue difference of degree, or ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority in power; any ſmall advantage of age, ſtanding, merit, or wealth, ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ground ſuch precedence; as common experience doth ſhew.</q>
Now this obſervation will help us to account for the particular, and firſt, mention of Polycarp, in the inſcription under debate.</p>
               <p>HE was probably the firſt in age among the Preſbyters of Smyrna; being, at leaſt, between forty and fifty years old, when he wrote this "epiſtle to the Philippians." Or however this might be, he was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the firſt in ſtanding among them, that is, he was before any of them placed in the miniſterial office; was the ſenior Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of this church; and perhaps the very firſt Paſtor, the Smyrnaeans ever had fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them: to be ſure, no mention is made in antiquity of any one before him; but he is always placed at the head of the ſucceſſion. Now ſeniority of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, eſpecially when ſeniority of age is added thereto, is always found to be an occaſion of precedence: and it is ſo natural for it to be ſo, that it is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:012009_0192_0F8940D32E10E090"/>
granted without ſo much as laying in any claim to it. And among Paſtors of preciſely the ſame order, theſe take place; and their names, when put into writing, are always firſt mentioned: and ſometimes theſe only are mentioned, while others of more late ſtanding are entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left out.</p>
               <p>BESIDES, Polycarp was one of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed perſonal worth; firſt among theſe Preſbyters, as being, it may be, of ſuperior endowments, both intellectual and moral: and as he was, by this means, in a more eminent manner qualified for the paſtoral office, his more eminent qualifications were a good ground of precedence. He might, from a juſt ſenſe of his own ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior merit, be diſpoſed to aſſume the firſt place; and, by this means, cuſtom might give him poſſeſſion of it: or, his more ſhining abilities might, being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, procure from others a voluntary giving him the pre-eminence. "For to thoſe, who indiſputably excell in good qualities, honeſt and meek perſons eaſily will yield precedence; eſpecially on occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of public concernment, wherein it is
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:012009_0193_0F8940D3EE0F4668"/>
expedient the beſt qualified perſons ſhould be firſt ſeen." And if, upon the account of his perſonal worth in ſpecial, the church of Smyrna had expreſſed a diſtinguiſhing regard for Polycarp, it is nothing ſtrange: nor if the Preſbyters of this church had honored him as their father; had allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a primacy of order or dignity; waiting for him to lead in all public mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and name himſelf firſt in all epiſtles, as the firſt, or moſt diſtinguiſhed perſon of their body, is it any more than is now commonly practiſed.</p>
               <p>MOREOVER, it may be worth our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, Polycarp was one that had acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Apoſtles of our Lord; and, what is more, was placed in the paſtoral office at Smyrna, by at leaſt one of them: which are advantages that greatly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed him. And if, in virtue hereof, being, diſtinguiſhly honored and reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, he had aſſigned him the firſt place in the college of Preſbyters, belonging to this church, it is no more than might naturally be expected. Upon the whole,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="unknown:012009_0194_0F8940D4AE5125B0"/>THERE is no reaſon to think, Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp's being firſt named, in this inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was owing to any other cauſe, than ſome or all of thoſe we have mentioned. To be ſure, it could not be becauſe of his epiſcopal authority and pre-eminence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the church of Smyrna was far differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in its conſtitution from the church at Philippi: and this is not in the leaſt probable, ſince there are no traces in this epiſtle of any ſuperiority of order between Biſhops and Preſbyters.</p>
               <p>THERE is but one objection, what I have offered is liable to, that I know of: and this is, that Polycarp is ſpoken of, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, as Biſhop of Smyrna; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered at the ſame time that we read this inſcription, it will naturally lead us to conſtrue his particularly naming himſelf; and this, before the Preſbyters, as ſignifying his being of an order ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to them.</p>
               <p>BUT as the whole weight of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection (if there be any at all in it) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends intirely upon the true import of the word Biſhop, in the age of Polycarp,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:012009_0195_0F8940D56F558208"/>
there is no reaſon to be moved by it: ſince we ſhall ſee in theſe papers (which are through the whole of them an anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to it) full evidence, that this word, in this age, was certainly ſynonimous with the word Preſbyter, and uſed to ſignify nothing more than preciſely the ſame order of church officers.</p>

            <head type="sub">His character, writings, and teſtimonies from them, with obſervations and remarks.</head>
            <p>THE name, epithet, or whatever elſe any may pleaſe to call it, given this Father, in all his epiſtles, is THEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHOROS; which, as the learned ſay, may be written differently accented: either THEOPHÓROS, meaning, a "divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon," one who "carried God in his breaſt;" or THEÓPHOROS ſignifying a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon "carried by God." The generality of thoſe, who entertain a favorable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Ignatius's "epiſtles," think he was ordinarily ſpoken of, in the age in which he lived, in the ſtile of THEOPHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROS;
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:012009_0197_0F8940D6EE966C10"/>
and that this name was applied to him, in the firſt of the above ſenſes, on account of his great piety, his "ſoul's being full of God." But both theſe points may, with good reaſon, be called in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is undoubted fact, that he is never mentioned by any of the truly pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Fathers in the ſtile of THEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHOROS. And what may be worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, thoſe, among the later ones, who give him this name, do, at the ſame time, ſpeak of him as the "child" our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or "took up into his arms," and "ſat before his diſciples" as a pattern of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. And this is the ſpecial reaſon they aſſign of the application of this name. But, as the greateſt admirers of Ignatius eſteem this a fabulous ſtory, falling in with Chryſoſtom, who ſays of this Father, that he never ſaw our Lord, nor enjoyed any converſe with him," the name THEOPHOROS, founded on it, ought not to be aſcribed to him. And, probably, it was not originally inſerted in the "inſcriptions" to his "epiſtles;" unleſs we ſhould ſuppoſe them ſpurious, and not wrote until the fable itſelf, that is the foundation of this name, in this ſenſe, began to obtain a currency.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="unknown:012009_0198_0F8940D7B2C05AF8"/>IT is ſaid, in ſupport of the other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the application of this name, that it ſeems to have been the very one, Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius himſelf is repreſented to have given, in the extant account we have of his "martyrdom." For being aſked, "Who was THEOPHOROS?" His reply was, "He who has Chriſt in his breaſt." From whence it is ſuppoſed, that he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known by this name, and for this reaſon. But, as "the acts of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom of Ignatius" are no where quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, mentioned, or ſo much as referred to, in any manner whatever, by any Father, until we have got into thoſe times that were greatly remote from his day, they muſt be acknowledged to be, at leaſt, of dubious authority, and not to be depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on in point of argument.—But it would take up too much room, to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpoſe, to enlarge here.</p>
            <p>WHETHER Ignatius was called Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoros or not; or whatever was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of giving him this name, we are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at a loſs to know, where he was born; how educated; when, and by what means, converted to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith. And, in truth, the ancient
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:012009_0199_0F8941A16DD805E0"/>
records are ſurprizingly ſilent about him; ſeldom mentioning ſo much as his name, until we come into the fourth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. He is highly celebrated by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern writers; and were we to judge, from the honorary manner, in which they ſpeak of him, we muſt ſuppoſe, that he was not only the moſt pious and holy man, but the moſt faithful, and ſignally accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed goſpel-miniſter, that ever lived. This, poſſibly, may be his juſt character; but none can ſay that it is upon any other foot, than that of meer conjecture.</p>
            <p>HE is commonly ſpoken of as Biſhop of Antioch; but it ought to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that Origin, a writer in the third century, is the firſt Father that mentions him under this character. He is follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſucceeding Fathers, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ages in which they reſpectively flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. And when they ſpeak of him in the ſtile of Biſhop, they doubtleſs took into the meaning of the word, the whole that was underſtood by it in their day. But this will, by no means, let us into the true idea of this term, as uſed in the days of Ignatius. It is readily conced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he was Biſhop of Antioch; but utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:012009_0200_0F8941A22D7062A0"/>
denied, that he was Biſhop of this church in the ſenſe, in which this word was uſed, either in the age of Origen, or in thoſe ages that followed after. He might as properly be called the Paſtor, the firſt, or moſt eminent Preſbyter, or Elder, of that church, as the Biſhop of it; for nothing more was meant by the word Biſhop, in the age in which Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius flouriſhed.</p>
            <p>IT may properly be obſerved here, the different account the Fathers give of the order, or place, of his ſucceſſion in the church of Antioch, makes a difficulty not unlike that of Clement's ſucceſſion in the church of Rome. The difficulty is, where to place Ignatius in the line of ſucceſſion; ſome of the Fathers putting Euodius be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and others placing Ignatius next after ſome Apoſtle. The Epiſcopalians are much puzzled to ſolve this matter, and go into very different ſchemes, which it is not my buſineſs, at preſent, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine.</p>
            <p>THE preciſe time of his taking upon him the charge of the Antiochian church cannot be aſcertained; nor is it particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:012009_0201_0F8941A2ED8411B0"/>
known, how he executed this truſt: though it may, in general, be charitably thought, that he approved himſelf a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſter of Chriſt; as he couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly choſe to die rather than diſown his Maſter and Lord. There is no room to doubt his having laid down his life for the ſake of the religion of Jeſus; but as to the manner and circumſtances of his death, as related in the "acts of his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom," it may be juſtly queſtioned, whether full credit is due to them. In ſpecial, it is difficult to think that he ſhould be ſent from Antioch to ſuffer at Rome. The moſt able writers are at a loſs to account for this; and ſome look upon it as plainly an incredible ſtory. The great Jameſon has this opinion of it. Says he,
<q>Why ſhould Trajan be at the pains to ſend him guarded thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Certainly not for an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the people, as the pretended "acts of Ignatius" affirm. They had ſtore of Chriſtians of all ſorts at Rome, with the ſpectacle of whoſe ſufferings they might daily be cloyed. Neither, as ſome anſwer, becauſe he was a famous Chriſtian Biſhop, at whoſe death the Roman Chriſtians might be terrified;
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:012009_0202_0F8941A3AC1F16F8"/>
ſeeing the Emperor might conclude, from Ignatius's great reſolution and boldneſs, which himſelf had perceived, that he would much animate them. But the perpetual practice of theſe times frees us from further debate herein. I can never find, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans brought Chriſtians from Aſia, or ſuch remote places, to be executed at Rome; but to the neareſt ſeats of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; as is clear in Polycarp, and other moſt famous Biſhops, or Paſtors.</q>
He goes on, quoting a paſſage from Dr. Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet, in theſe words, <q>And truly the ſtory of Ignatius, as much as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with his epiſtles, doth not ſeem to be any of the moſt probable. For wherefore ſhould Ignatius, of all others, be brought to Rome to ſuffer? when the Pro-Conſuls, and the Praeſides Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciarum, did every where, in the time of perſecution, execute their power in puniſhing of Chriſtians at their own tribunals, without ſending them ſo long a journey to Rome to be martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there.</q>
—But however it might be as to this, and other circumſtances, the fact itſelf, that he died a martyr, is not diſputed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="unknown:012009_0203_0F8941A46D6093C0"/>THE year of his martyrdom is variouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed. Some place it in the year 107; others in 110; and others ſtill in 116. It would take up too much room, and to no great purpoſe, to examine the reaſons which have induced critical writers thus to differ in ſetling the period of Ignatius's death; upon which account I ſhall ſay nothing more about it.</p>

               <p>CONCERNING theſe, it will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per I ſhould be more particular, than would have been neceſſary, had they not been the occaſion of ſo much diſpute in the learned world.</p>
               <p>No leſs than fifteen "Epiſtles" go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Ignatius; and they have commonly been divided into three claſſes. The firſt contains the three epiſtles that are extant only in latin, and wrote, one of them to the "Virgin Mary," the other two to "St. John." The ſecond compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the five Greek epiſtles, which are not mentioned either by Euſebius, or Jerom. The firſt, to "Mary Caſſaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta;" the ſecond, to the inhabitants of
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:012009_0204_0F8941A52D7106B0"/>
Tarſus;" the third "to the Antiochians;" the fourth, "to Hero," Deacon of the church at Antioch;" the fifth, "to the Philippians." A few Roman-catholic writers give credit to theſe epiſtles, as wrote by Ignatius; but they are herein univerſally oppoſed by Epiſcopalian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, as well as others, who look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as evidently ſuppoſititious. The third claſs compriſes the ſeven epiſtles ſuppoſed to be taken notice of by Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius; which are the following ones. The firſt, "to the Epheſians;" the ſecond, "to the Magneſians;" the third, "to the Trallians;" the fourth, "to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;" the fifth, "to the Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phians;" the ſixth, "to the Smyrnae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;" the ſeventh "to Polycarp." N. B. Arch-Biſhop Uſher, <note n="*" place="bottom">This noted Antiquary was clearly and fully of the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the "epiſtle to Polycarp," which is reckoned among, and makes up, the ſeven "epiſtles of Ignatius," is falſely attributed to him; as he ſuppoſes, this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Father wrote no peculiar epiſtle to Polycarp, but that his "epiſtle to the church of Smyrna" was wrote, both to them and their Biſhop, and directed joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them both. And he was in no doubt, but that this was the ſentiment of Jerom alſo. And others think ſo too; and the rather, becauſe Honorius Auguſtodumenſis, in his book "de luminaribus eccleſiae," which is an epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of Jerom, Bennadius, Iſadore Hiſpalenſis, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, and others, enumerating the "epiſtles of Ignatius," altogether omits that to "Polycarp." It ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be, and, by the great Uſher, is ranked among thoſe "epiſtles," which, to ſay the leaſt, are debious.</note> and ſome others
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:012009_0205_0F8941A5ED5C1F20"/>
after him, reject this laſt; ſuppoſing the ſix former to be the only truly genuine ones.</p>
               <p>THESE ſeven epiſtles, it may be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are again conſidered in two views. The firſt exhibits them in the editions that were publiſhed before the days of the celebrated Uſher and Voſſius; and thus conſidered, they are ſtiled the "larger epiſtles," and are now almoſt univerſally given up as incapable of a defence, on account of the CORRUP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS that have ſome how or other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily got mixed with them: though it ought always to be kept in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, that the former advocates for Prelacy, who had no other editions but theſe, ſtrenuouſly pleaded for them as the genuine valuable remains of the truly primitive Ignatius, and appealed to them as ſuch, in the cauſe of Epiſcopacy, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with as much frequency, and zeal, as any of their Epiſcopal brethren have done ſince.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="unknown:012009_0206_0F8941A6ACFB5D98"/>THE other view we have of theſe epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles is, as they are ſet forth by Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Uſher, from two latin copies he met with in England, one in the library of Caius college, the other in the library of Biſhop Montague; and by the learned Voſſius, from a Greek manuſcript copy he found in the Florentine library. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in this view, they are called the "ſhorter epiſtles," and repreſented as both genuine and uncorrupted. They are accordingly the only ones now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to, in proof of the ſuperiority of Biſhops to Preſbyters in order and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. —May it not be pertinently queried here. Do not Epiſcopalians evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn themſelves, while they zealouſly adhere to <hi>theſe,</hi> and reject the <hi>former</hi> edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the "Ignatian epiſtles?" They would not be wrought upon, by any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of reaſoning, to give up "epiſtles" they now acknowledge to be baſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlarded with corruption, until they had got them, from other manuſcripts, in a ſtate they could better defend. Does it not look, as though they imagined their cauſe ſtood in abſolute need of Ignatius, and were willing to part with him in the former editions, only becauſe they have
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:012009_0207_0F8941A76D758320"/>
others to ſubſtitute in their room, that have not ſo glaring an appearance of a baſe mixture.? One can ſcarce help thinking, if other editions ſhould be ſet forth, from ſtill other manuſcripts, more defenſible than theſe they now have, they would as readily quit theſe, as they have done the former ones.</p>
               <p>BUT however pure and uncorrupt theſe "ſhorter epiſtles," publiſhed from the more lately diſcovered manuſcripts, are ſuppoſed to be, there are ſome, and of the firſt character too for learning, who have openly declared it to be their opinion, that they are SPURIOUS; and a ſtill grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number are perſuaded they have been corrupted, if they are not ſpurious, to a degree that unfits them to be appealed to, as exhibiting the real ſenſe of the true Ignatius.</p>
               <p>THE ſtrange ſilence of primitive antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concerning "epiſtles," under the name of Ignatius, is mentioned by ſome, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately acquainted with the Fathers, as a ſufficient reaſon to ſuſpect that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wrote any. There is no diſpute about the fact itſelf namely, that none
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:012009_0208_0F8941A82CC88210"/>
of the Fathers, whoſe works are ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, in whole, or in part, give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of "epiſtles" wrote by IGNATIUS, either a leſs or greater number, until we come into the fourth century, three only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; of whom we ſhall particularly ſpeak, in ſome proper place, afterwards. But then the plea is, this is a <hi>negative</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and proves nothing. It is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, <hi>negative evidence,</hi> conſidered in itſelf nakedly, is of no great weight. But ſtill, this kind of evidence may be ſo attended with circumſtances as to yield conviction, not much ſhort of that which is grounded on poſitive proof. Should a pretended writing be ſo circumſtanced, in regard of its ſuppoſed author, ſubject-matter, occaſion, and manner of penning, as that there would be as much reaſon to expect, it ſhould be taken notice of by thoſe, who muſt be thought to have been acquainted with it, as other writings of the ſame age; and they are commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, while this is ſilently paſſed over with neglect, not by here and there a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the whole body of writers for two hundred years:—theſe are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of no ſmall importance, and add ſtrength to a <hi>negative</hi> teſtimony, rendering
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:012009_0209_0F8941A8EC1C09B8"/>
it almoſt equal in force to that which is poſitive. Now, this is the caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting theſe "Ignatian epiſtles." For it ought to be remembered, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,</p>
               <p>IGNATIUS lived in the firſt age of Chriſtianity, was perſonally known to, at leaſt, ſome of the Apoſtles, and many of thoſe who had been familiarly converſant with them. And he was conſtituted, if we may believe the Epiſcopalians, by one of the Apoſtles, at leaſt, Biſhop of the church of Antioch, a noted city in itſelf, and remarkable on account of its being the place, where believers were firſt diſtinguiſhed by the name of CHRISTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANS. Theſe are circumſtances, leaving it indiſputable, that Ignatius was no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure perſon, but as likely to be known as any in that day. Beſides all this, he was a glorious martyr for the religion of Jeſus; and, if he really wrote theſe epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, the circumſtances of his martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom were truly extraordinary. For he was condemned at Antioch, to die at Rome. And, in order to the execution of this ſentence, was conveyed, by a band of ſoldiers, as a priſoner of death for the
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:012009_0210_0F8941A9AB5C20D0"/>
ſake of Chriſt, through all the places, in which his name was named, that lay in the way between the greatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant cities from each other, Antioch and Rome. This is a circumſtance that would naturally ſpread his fame, and occaſion his being held in veneration by all the Chriſtian churches, as he paſſed along. Had he been before a perſon of no figure, this alone would have given him an exalted reputation: nor is it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeable, that any of the Fathers, of the ſame age, ſhould be more extenſively known, or more frequently ſpoken of with honor. Theſe are the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under which we are to conceive of the author of theſe "epiſtles."</p>
               <p>AND as extraordinary ones attend the "epiſtles" themſelves; for they were wrote (if wrote by him) in the character of one that was a priſoner, in bonds, for the name of Chriſt, and actually on his journey to be devoured by wild beaſts: nor were they wrote to private friends, upon meer private concerns; but to no leſs than ſix as famous churches as were then in the world; and, if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Epiſcopalians, upon matters of
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:012009_0211_0F8941AB52139BF8"/>
the moſt eſſential importance. Theſe, ſurely, are conſiderations that will not ſuffer us to think, that theſe "epiſtles" were unknown, or not eſteemed worthy of particular notice. Epiſtles wrote, and ſent, to a number of ſuch noted chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, by ſo good and great a Biſhop, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt weighty points, at ſo ſolemn a time as that of his dying for the cauſe of Chriſt, muſt have occaſioned much talk among Chriſtians. They would have put a diſtinguiſhing value upon ſuch epiſtles; yea, they would have eſteemed them the moſt celebrated monuments of all unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired antiquity. How unaccountable then is it, that ſo little notice ſhould be taken of them, for the full ſpace of two hundred years after the ſuppoſed date of their compoſure! And what makes the matter ſtill more ſtrange is, that nothing more frequently occurs, than the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of other writings of the ſame age with theſe. There is ſcarce an author, about the time in which Ignatius flouriſhed, but his works are particularly named, or quoted. And why ſhould Ignatius, the moſt celebrated of them all, be ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully treated with ſilence and neglect? And this is the more to be wondered at,
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:012009_0212_0F8941ABEBF3D0D8"/>
as his writings were, in ſome caſes, the moſt pertinent that could have been referred to; far more ſo than other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings that are particularly mentioned, and remembered with honor.</p>
               <p>BUT the force of this <hi>negative</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will appear in a yet ſtronger point of light, if, by way of ſpecimen, we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly conſider one or two of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers, who take no notice of theſe "epiſtles."</p>
               <p>THE firſt ſhall be Irenaeus. We have extant of his a large volume, entitled, "the confutation of that which is falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called knowledge;" the main deſign of which is, to explain and refute the erronious notions of Simon, Menander, Valentinus, Marcion, Cerinthus, Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don," and as many other heretics as had appeared in his day, and for an hundred years before. In ſuch a work as this, of ſo great length, and ſuch variety of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and argument, it might well be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, ſome mention would have been made of ſo celebrated a writer, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, as Ignatius, who both wrote and died in this very age: eſpecially, if it be
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:012009_0213_0F8941ACAC31C438"/>
conſidered, that his "epiſtles" are peculiarly pertinent to the great deſign of Irenaeus's argument, more ſo by far than any other ancient writing, we know any thing of, then extant in the world. For ſome (perhaps the moſt) of thoſe very errors he oppoſes, were both noted and rejected by Ignatius. I need not be at the pains to produce inſtances of this for the ſake of thoſe, who are acquainted with theſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; and for others, if they will only compare the "Ignatian epiſtles", with the firſt of "Irenaeus's five books", they may, with their own eyes, ſee a number of them. What therefore more natural than to look for references to "theſe epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles", in the works of Irenaeus? And how can it be accounted for, that he ſhould take no notice of them, but that he knew of no ſuch epiſtles? Had he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined himſelf to reaſon, or ſcripture, in confutation of theſe heretics, having no recourſe to former writers, it would be ſome apology for his ſilence: but, far from this, one of his chief arguments is taken from "the ſucceſſion of doctrine in the Chriſtian church;" in order to confirm which, he recurs to the WRIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGS, as well as SAYINGS, of thoſe who
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:012009_0214_0F8941AD6C381568"/>
were older than the heretics he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing. He makes a very particular and honorable mention of CLEMENT, and his "epiſtle to the Corinthians," and oppoſes even the whole of it againſt the hereſies he had under conſideration. <note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. iii. Cap. iii.</note> And yet, not a word is ſaid, either here, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, in his whole book, in commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of "Ignatius's epiſtles;" nor is there one word quoted from him to the purpoſe of the grand argument he has in proſecution.</p>
               <p>THE anſwer to this is, That, in the place where Irenaeus mentions "Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment," he had, to prevent being tedious, expreſſly limited himſelf to "the ſucceſſion of doctrine in the church at Rome," of which Clement had been Biſhop; and as, in the name of that church, he had wrote an "epiſtle to the Corinthians," wherein the doctrine of that church, and its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the doctrine of theſe heretics, might be eaſily diſcerned, there was good reaſon, why he ſhould diſtinguiſh Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; a pertinency in appealing to him, while there would have been none in
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:012009_0215_0F8941AE2C13A160"/>
appealing to Ignatius. But, it is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in this very place, where he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined his argument to the church of Rome, he takes occaſion to commemorate "Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp's epiſtle to the Philippians." <note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. iii. Cap. iii.</note> And why might he not, with as much propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, have taken ſome notice of the "epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Ignatius?" To this alſo it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, Irenaeus introduces the mention he makes of Polycarp, by ſaying, he had been at Rome, where he oppoſed theſe heretics, and recovered many from the errors wherewith they had been infected: upon which account it was to his purpoſe to name Polycarp, while there was no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, at this time, to mention Ignatius. But, it deſerves conſideration, over and above mentioning Polycarp's being at Rome, and confuting the Heretics there, which was the only point directly to his argument, he takes occaſion to celebrate his "epiſtle to the Philippians". There is little, or nothing, in this epiſtle to the deſign he was upon, and accordingly he makes no uſe of it, or any ſentence in it, to oppoſe the heretics: yet, this primitive Father having an epiſtle extant,
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:012009_0216_0F8941AEED503070"/>
he could not forbear making a record of it. And it might have been as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and pertinent, even in this very place, to have done the like by the "epiſtles of Ignatius. For it is particularly worthy of notice, Ignatius had been at Rome as well as Polycarp; and, what is more, died there a glorious martyr in the cauſe of Chriſt: Nor ſhould it be forgot, that "theſe epiſtles," as Epiſcopalians tell us, were collected by Polycarp, at leaſt, ſome of them, and annexed by him to his "own epiſtle" as part of one and the ſame volume. Irenaeus, therefore, having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned "Polycarp's epiſtle", would, it may reaſonably and naturally be ſuppoſed, have mentioned the others alſo under the ſame cover, if he had known of them; and the rather, becauſe they were the work of ſo eminent a primitive Father, and of all the writings, then extant, the beſt adapted to confound the heretics he was arguing againſt.</p>
               <p>BUT ſhould it be allowed, that, in this particular place, while his argument was under a ſpecial limitation, it was more proper to take notice of the "epiſtles of Clement and Polycarp", than of "Ignatius";
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:012009_0217_0F8941AFAD5D1538"/>
yea, that there was good reaſon for men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the former, and none at all for the latter; yet, what is this to account for the ſilence there every where elſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears concerning theſe epiſtles? Becauſe it was more proper in one place to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Clement and Polycarp, than Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, will it therefore follow there was a propriety in making no mention of him at all? If this was a proper place to ſpeak of Clement, and Polycarp, might he not, in ſome other place, have done the like honor to Ignatius? And his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence with reſpect to this moſt noted Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is the more ſtrange, as he has found ſome ſuitable place to remember, not only Clement, and Polycarp, but Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, Ignatius's contemporary, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias, and Juſtin, not a great way poſterior to him. Surely, no one, who eſteems "Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius's epiſtles to be genuine, will ſay, that Irenaeus had more reaſon, or could with greater propriety, record the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of theſe Fathers, than thoſe of the more famed and memorable Ignatius. Beſides all which, it may be worth minding, that nothing is more common with Irenaeus, than to have recourſe to the ſayings, both ORAL and WRITTEN, of thoſe Elders
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:012009_0218_0F8941B06DC65A70"/>
who preceeded him. "As a certain El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſays," "as was ſaid by the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters," "as I heard from ſuch a Senior," "as was delivered by thoſe who were diſciples of the Apoſtles," are phraſes very familiar with him. He often, in this manner, introduces the words of the ancients. And yet, in ſo many referen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he never makes uſe of ſo much as a ſingle ſentence from Ignatius, to his grand purpoſe, that of refuting the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics; though, in moſt of his epiſtles, there was that which was well adapted to ſuch a deſign. It certainly looks, as if he knew nothing of "theſe epiſtles": if he had, he muſt needs have dropped, at leaſt, ſome hint about them, ſomewhere or other, in ſo large a work.</p>
               <p>I SHALL next mention Clement of Alexandria; a perſon of vaſt learning, ſecond to none in the age in which he lived, for his acquaintance with all ſorts of writers. Thoſe works of his that are ſtill in being are crouded with an immenſe variety of quotations from philoſophers, poets, hiſtorians, and all kinds of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whether Pagan or Chriſtian. He particularly mentions the "epiſtle of
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:012009_0219_0F8941B12CD12CD0"/>
Barnabas," the "epiſtle of Clement of Rome," the "paſtor of Hermas," all writers in the age in which Ignatius liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And if the "Ignatian epiſtles" had been extant in his day, one of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious learning muſt have had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it; and if he had, it is ſcarce credible he ſhould have paſſed them over in ſilence. He often takes occaſion to ſpeak of the heretics that corrupted the Chriſtian faith; and there being ſo much in Ignatius upon this head, it is really ſtrange, he ſhould never once comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate ſo famous a writer, and martyr. It is quite natural to think, he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen, or heard of "epiſtles" under the name of Ignatius.</p>
               <p>AND the ſame may be ſaid of Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, and other writers, <note n="*" place="bottom">It may not be unworthy of notice, that, among the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous writings of the Fathers, which are now loſt, but were extant in the days of Euſebius, and red by him, he has named no one that ſpeaks of Ignatius as having wrote "epiſtles": from whence it may be fairly concluded, that they made no mention of epiſtles of his, any more than thoſe which have been handed down to us. For nothing more common with Euſebius, than to cite paſſages from the writings that are now loſt, and paſſages too which mention the names of writers con-temporary with Ignatius, and poſterior to him. It is therefore to the higheſt degree probable, if Euſebius had met with any writers before his own day, who had mentioned epiſtles of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius, that he would have given us, at leaſt, ſome inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it. It is obſervable, he has preſerved a frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an anonymous author, [ſome think Maximus, for reaſons it would be needleſs to inſert here] in which he ſays, in confutation of the hereſy of Artemon, who held that "Chriſt was only a meer man," that it was "firſt of all oppoſed by the holy ſcriptures, and next by the books of ſundry men long before the time of Victor, I mean Juſtin, Miltiades, Tatian, Clement, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, Melito, and many others;" H. E. Lib. v. Cap. xviii. No notice is here taken of Ignatius, in whoſe epiſtles, if his, in thoſe editions of them that are contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, this hereſy of Artemon is as directly and fully condemned, as by any of the writers whoſe names are particularly mentioned. Surely, if this author had known of theſe epiſtles, he would not have omitted to refer to them, when it would have been ſo pertinent to the argument he was upon. And it muſt be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to be altogether unaccountable, if epiſtles of Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us had been mentioned, or quoted, in any of the writings now loſt, but in being in the days of Euſebius, and ſeen and celebrated by him, that he ſhould paſs over ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant an article in total ſilence; eſpecially, as it would have been ſo much to his purpoſe to have been particular in taking notice of it.</note> between the days

of Ignatius and Euſebius, who take no notice of "theſe epiſtles"; as might be particularly illuſtrated with reference to them, but that enough has been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid to let the reader ſee, that this <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi> evidence is ſo circumſtanced as to give juſt occaſion to ſuſpect, whether Ignatius ever wrote the "epiſtles" that are aſcribed to him.</p>

               <p>IT is thought a ſtrong confirmation of this teſtimony from Polycarp, that Euſebius, when ſpeaking of the "Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian epiſtles," as commemorated by him, quotes from him this paſſage in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Greek, which exhibits the very idea that is conveyed by the above ancient verſion.</p>
               <p>UPON this "Polycarpian teſtimony" it may be obſerved, that the whole para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, from whence it is taken, is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have been an after addition, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to give credit to the "Ignatian epiſtles". And two things are offered in ſupport of ſuch a ſuſpicion.</p>
               <p>THE firſt is, its apparent abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and want of relation to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going diſcourſe. There is no connection between this, and what went before: nor had Polycarp dropped any hint, that would lead one to expect this notice of "Ignatius epiſtles": and what is ſaid, with reference to them, is ſo inſerted, as
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:012009_0224_0F8941B5AC079F28"/>
to its manner, that no one, when he had read the foregoing words, could begin upon theſe without naturally making a pauſe, as meeting with what he had no reaſon given him to look for. Some, of great intimacy with the ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, have, from this conſideration on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, been inclined to ſuſpect, that the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was unfairly crouded into the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. —But I only mention this as a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, that may give weight to what may be further offered of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
               <p>The other ground of ſuſpicion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is, an apparent inconſiſtency, or contradiction, between what is affirmed in one of theſe paſſages, and another in the body of the epiſtle. The ninth ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contains theſe words, "Wherefore I exhort all of you to obey the word of righteouſneſs, and exerciſe all patience, which ye have ſeen ſet before your eyes, not only in the bleſſed IGNATIUS, and Zozimus, and Rufus, but in others among yourſelves, and in Paul himſelf, and the reſt of the Apoſtles: being <note n="*" place="bottom">Confidentes quia hi omnes non in vacuum concutrerunt, ſed in fide et juſtitia; et ad debitum ſibi locum a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino, cui et compaſſi ſunt, abierunt.</note> confident
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:012009_0225_0F8941B66C467130"/>
in this, that all theſe have not run in vain, but in faith and righteouſneſs; and ARE GONE TO THE PLACE DUE TO THEM FROM THE LORD, for whom they alſo ſuffered".—Ignatius is ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently here ſpoken of, as having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his ſufferings, and gone to the Lord, that there can be no reaſonable room for doubt in the caſe. THESE ALL [HI OMNES] that is, IGNATIUS, Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus, Rufus, and others, HAVE NOT RUN IN VAIN, but are GONE TO THE PLACE DUE TO THEM FROM THE LORD. No one that reads theſe words can be at a loſs to determine, that Ignatius, in the thoughts of Polycarp, was really dead, and actually gone to the place of future rewards. And yet, this very Ignatius is here directly ſuppoſed to be alive, and not come to his laſt ſufferings. "Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify to me what ye know about IGNA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIUS, and THOSE THAT ARE WITH HIM." Is not this a manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether abſurd, unleſs it had been preſumed, that Ignatius was yet alive? The moſt plain ſignification of the words is, that this was the real truth. Can it now be imagined, that Polycarp, after he had ſpoken of Ignatius as actually
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:012009_0226_0F8941B72D508A48"/>
dead, and recommended his ſufferings and death as an example to others, ſhould, in the ſame ſhort epiſtle, ſpeak of him as alive, and deſire to know about him; and this, from the very perſons to whom he had recommended his death as an example? This would be very ſtrange; and it would be diſhonorary to ſo famous a Father to ſuppoſe, he ſhould be thus inconſiſtent with himſelf: but it is no uncommon thing for knaviſh perſons to do that, which, through want of cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſerves to diſcover their fraud.</p>
               <p>BUT we ſhall be able to perceive more fully the force of what has been offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if we attend a while to what has been ſaid to weaken its ſtrength.</p>
               <p>IT is pleaded, Polycarp does not, in the objected words, inſinuate that Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius was now <hi>alive,</hi> as is pretended, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to what he had ſaid of him as <hi>dead,</hi> in ſect. ix. But, the Philippians, being likely to know conſiderable about Ignatius, both while hs was alive, and while he was ſuffering martyrdom, he writes to them, as it was proper and natural for to him to do, to communicate
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:012009_0227_0F8941B7ED74D358"/>
to him what they knew, both about him, and thoſe that were his companions. This doth not ſeem ſatisfactory. The queſtion is not, what the Philippians might know about Ignatius, nor whether it was proper for Polycarp to deſire them to tell him what they knew about him? but whether the manner of writing, here uſed, is not ſuch as evidently ſuppoſes Ignatius had not yet come to his laſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, contrary to what he had before expreſſly declared? The words, "ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy to me what ye certainly know about Ignatius, and thoſe THAT ARE WITH HIM," obviouſly ſuppoſe the perſon wrote about to be alive. And it is obſervable, he is repreſented as having his companions about him. "Ignatius, and thoſe that are with him;" ARE, in the preſent tenſe. And if Polycarp had not known that he was dead, the mode of diction is eaſy and natural; but uncouth, I may ſay unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, if compared with the firm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion he had before expreſſed, that he had finiſhed his courſe, and obtained the crown of martyrdom.</p>
               <p>OTHERS endeavor to remove the difficulty another way. They argue,
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:012009_0228_0F8941B8AC189EB8"/>
Polycarp, when he wrote this epiſtle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in his own mind, that Ignatius, by this time, had gone through his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; for which reaſon, he pertinently writes as in ſect. ix: yet, having receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no certain account of his death, and not being fully ſatisfied, whether he had ſuffered, or not; or, if he had, how he had been treated by his perſecutors, and how he had behaved in his laſt encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the beaſts, deſires the Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who were much nearer to Rome than he was, and might therefore very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have heard much later from thence then he had, to ſend him an account of what they knew relative to theſe matters. And in all this, what, they ſay, is there, not that locks like a contradiction, but that is not very natural, and particularly moſt becoming the love and friendſhip of the bleſſed Polycarp towards him, concerning whom he ſo diligently enquired? It is obvious, at firſt ſight, that this plea di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contradicts the foregoing one; and yet, it is as far from unfolding the difficulty. For, from the whole ſtrain of ſect. ix, it appears with a meridian luſtre, that Polycarp was fully perſuaded that Ignatius was dead, and gone to reap
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:012009_0229_0F8941B96D385EC8"/>
the fruit of his fidelity to his Lord. He was in no doubt as to the truth of this fact, nor needed any information about it. He ſpeaks of it as a matter that was well known both to himſelf, and to the Philippians: nor can words more clearly and ſtrongly ſignify this, than thoſe he has uſed to the purpoſe. "THESE ALL," therefore IGNATIUS among the reſt, and as truly as Paul, and the other Apoſtles, "have not run in vain, but ARE with the Lord in the place due to them." And yet, according to the plea here made, it is ſuppoſed that Polycarp, in the objected words, ſpeaks of it as a matter of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, whether Ignatius had come to his encounter with the beaſts; which is no way reconcileable with the clear perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his being dead, he had before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in ſect. ix.</p>
               <p>IT is further ſaid, in favor of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numeneſs of this paſſage, that no one who deſigned to ſerve a turn by corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this epiſtle would have been, either ſo negligent as not carefully to read it over, or having done this, would have been ſo fooliſh as to have ſubjoined a requeſt to the Philippians in direct
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:012009_0230_0F8941BA2C3801E0"/>
contradiction to what the true Polycarp had told them before; and which, by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, muſt diſcover the fraud, and fruſtrate the deſign in view. This, it is poſſible, may ſeem an argument of weight to thoſe unacquainted with antiquity; but it will not appear in the ſame light to ſuch as are verſed in this kind of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; as they have often met with like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of folly. Whether the perſons guilty of ſuch fraudulent dealing were commonly weak; or whether they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined thoſe they deſigned to impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were of this character; or whether, though artful and cunning, they were left in Providence (as is often the caſe at preſent in regard of all kinds of cheats) to do that, through careleſſneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attention, which ſerves to diſcover their fraud, I ſhall not pretend to ſay: but it is a fact notoriouſly known, that WHOLE PIECES, as well as INTERPOLATED SEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TENCES were, in thoſe days, obtruded upon the world, full as ridiculous as this ſuppoſed corruption can be repreſented to be. Signal inſtances of this nature are to be met with in the "apoſtolical conſtitutions and canons," which are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally allowed to have been fraudulently
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:012009_0231_0F8941BAEC152800"/>
dealt with, even by thoſe who have not an opinion of them as ſpurious. The interpolations, and additions, made in theſe writings, do ſo groſſly break in upon the order of time, the declared mind of the Apoſtles in the inſpired books, and are ſo often chargeable with contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other parts of the ſame writings, that one could ſcarce believe it poſſible a perſon of common ſenſe ſhould be guilty of ſuch ridiculous weakneſs, but that there is no arguing againſt ſtubborn fact. The reader that is inclined to ſee this ſuppoſed addition to "Polycarp's epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle" fully matched for the weakneſs, and folly, it is ſaid to contain, may meet with it done to his mind, in what has been offered, under the head of "Clement's writings," in the preceeding pages. To the like purpoſe he may conſult Dr. Smallbroke's "Clementine conſtitutions confuted, in anſwer to Mr. Whiſton."</p>
               <p>BUT if we drop the ſuppoſition of an "interpolation," and even allow this "Polycarpian teſtimony," to be unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly genuine, it will not, at once, as too many have imagined, decide the controverſy relative to the "Ignatian
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:012009_0232_0F8941BBABF6EDB8"/>
epiſtles. " For it does not prove what it is brought for; but leaves the greateſt part of " theſe epiſtles" deſtitute of all real evidence in their ſupport. At moſt, two only of theſe epiſtles are certainly taken notice of. No more are couched under thoſe words of Polycarp, "the epiſtles of Ignatius which he ſent to us:" nor do the greateſt patrons of "Ignatius's writings" pretend, that any other are here referred to, than his "epiſtle to the Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeans," and a particular one to "Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp himſelf." And as to the words that immediately follow, "and as many other epiſtles as we had by us;" though they are interpreted, by epiſcopal writers, to mean " the other epiſtles of IGNATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>US," there is not the leaſt need, unleſs to ſerve a turn, to look upon them as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring at all to any of the "Ignatian epiſtles." They are generally wrote, without any limitation to Ignatius. Arch-Biſhop Wake indeed has been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, no leſs than three times <note n="*" place="bottom">Apoſt. Fathers, p. 22, 31, and in his tranſlation of the epiſtle, p. 59.</note> to inſert the words OF HIS, without giving the reader any notice that they were words of his own putting in; by means whereof the meer
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:012009_0233_0F8941BC6B679A50"/>
Engliſh reader, and all who have ſeen on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his tranſlation, are unavoidably led to imagine, that the words, in "Polycarp's epiſtle," are abſolutely confined to Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius; when, in truth, they are generally expreſſed, having nothing to anſwer the Arch-Biſhop's limiting words OF HIS. In the "old verſion" of Polycarp, the words run thus, "Epiſtolas ſané Ignatii, quae tranſmiſſae ſunt vobis [pro nobis] ab eo, et ALIAS QUANTASCUMQUE apud nos habuimus, tranſmiſſimus vobis, ſecundum quod mandaſtis." The original Greek, as quoted by Euſebius, perfectly agrees herewith. What is tranſlated in the old copy, " ET ALIAS QUANTASCUMQUE," is in the Greek, KAI ALLAS OSAS. It is acknowledged, in the firſt part of this paſſage, "Epiſtles of Ignatius" are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly mentioned; that is, the Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians themſelves being judges, <note n="*" place="bottom">"Epiſtolas ſanè Ignatii," Arch-Biſhop Wake tranſlates "the epiſtles of IGANATIUS;" and in the margin has theſe words, " that is, to himſelf, and to the church of Smyrna". Cotelerius's note upon the ſame words is this, "deſignantur duae Ignatii epiſtolae: una ad Polycar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum; altera ad Polycarpi ſeu Smyrnemſem eccleſiam.</note> two of the epiſtles ſaid to be his, "one to Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp;" the "other to the church of Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na:" but, in the latter part of it, the
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:012009_0234_0F8941BE13ABB4A0"/>
words are general, and ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing limited to Ignatius, that they may, with propriety, be interpreted of ANY EPISTLES WHATEVER, Polycarp, or the church of Smyrna, might have had by them, of other famous primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And there are ſome conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that fairly lead to ſuch a general conſtruction of the words. For it is plain, theſe epiſtles were ſent, by Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp and his church, to the church at Philippi, at their deſire which had been ſignified to them. "We have ſent the epiſtles as you deſired." And it is quite eaſy and natural to conceive of their ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon the deſire of the Philippians, the "epiſtles" Ignatius had wrote to THEM. But how ſhould they come by his other epiſtles, thoſe which he wrote to the "Magneſians," to the "Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphians," to the "Epheſians," to the "Romans," and to the "Trallians?" And why ſhould the church at Philippi ſend to them for theſe epiſtles? If Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius had really wrote to theſe churches, and the Philippians had a mind to ſee his epiſtles to them, it would have been na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for them to have ſent to thoſe chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for a copy of their reſpective letters;
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:012009_0235_0F8941BEACAF25E0"/>
and in every reſpect as natural as was their ſending to Polycarp, and his church, for the letters he wrote to them. It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore looks as if the "epiſtles", here ſpoken of, as ſent to the Philippians, were thoſe "epiſtles of Ignatius" which he had wrote to Polycarp, and the Smyrnaeans; and "ſuch other epiſtles", of other famous perſons, as they had by them, that might be of more ſpecial value. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this conſtruction of the words that appears ſtrained, or unnatural; nor is there the leaſt need of any other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation. And ſhould this prove to be the true conſtruction, only TWO of the "SEVEN Ignatian epiſtles" are here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. The remaining five muſt be taken care of by others. Yea, ſhould we allow of the Epiſcopalian interpretation, the matter would not be a great deal mended. In this caſe, it is true, it might be argued, that Ignatius wrote more than two epiſtles; but what other epiſtles, to whom, or how many, would, after all, remain an utter uncertainty. The words ſpecify nothing. "And as many other epiſtles as we had by us:"—No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is here ſaid by which it can be
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:012009_0236_0F8941BF6BED1E00"/>
determined, how many epiſtles were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, nor whether any of the preſent collection were of their number.</p>
               <p>BUT, if we ſhould ſuppoſe all that is pleaded for this teſtimony, from Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp, to be really true, the controverſy about theſe "epiſtles," in point of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on them, as containing the ſenſe of Ignatius, will remain ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined. For if it be allowed, that Polycarp ſent a collection of "ſeven Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natian epiſtles" to the church at Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi; it will not follow from hence, that the preſent collection of the like number of epiſtles, under the name of Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius, is the ſame incorrupt, unadulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated collection with that of Polycarp's. It is granted, it was not the ſame before the days of Uſher, and Voſſius. And, ſince the appearance of thoſe learned antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the caſe may poſſibly be the ſame; and it muſt evidently be ſo, if the collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe "epiſtles," in their ſuppoſed beſt edition, contain ſuch things as argue a date poſterior to the age in which Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius lived, and that are altogether unworthy of that primitive Father, and martyr:
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:012009_0237_0F8941C02C800F30"/>
and that they contain ſuch things as theſe, we ſhall have occaſion, in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, particularly to evince.</p>
               <p>IN the mean time, let us go on to Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, the next writer, within the ſecond century, cited in favor of the "epiſtles of Ignatius". His words are theſe, "as one from among us SAID, being adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the beaſts that he might be a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr for God; <hi>I am the corn of Chriſt, and am ground with the teeth of beaſts, that I may be found the pure bread of God".</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Quemadmodum quidam de noſtris DIXIT, prompter martyrium in Deum adjudicatus ad beſtias; "quoniam frumentnm ſum Chriſti, et per dentes beſtiarum molor, ut mundus panis Dei inveniar." Adverſ. Heret. Lib. v. Cap. xxviii.</note> Theſe words are found in the epiſtle to the Romans, under the name of Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, ſect. iv. And it is thought a weighty circumſtance attending this teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, that Euſebius has quoted it, and after this manner; "and Irenaeus knew of his [Ignatius's] martyrdom, and makes mention of his epiſtles in theſe words, "as one among us SAID, [<hi>eipe</hi>] being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to the beaſts for the teſtimony of
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:012009_0238_0F8941C0ED4591B0"/>
God,<hi>I am the what of God, and am ground with the teeth of beaſts, that I may be found pure bread.</hi>" <note n="*" place="bottom">H. E. Lib. iii. Cap. xxxvi, where the Greek of Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius well agrees with the Latin of Irenaeus.</note>
               </p>
               <p>IN anſwer to this teſtimony of Irenaeus, it is allowed, that Ignatius is the perſon here referred to, and that the cited words are to be ſeen in one of the extant epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles under his name.</p>
               <p>BUT this notwithſtanding, it does not appear ſufficiently evident, that Irenaeus either knew of this "epiſtle," or took this ſentence out of it. It is certain, he makes no mention of the "epiſtle," nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does he anywhere ſay, that he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed theſe words from it. And it is obſervable, the words are not introduced, "as one from among us WROTE;" but "as one from among us SAID." A great deal of pains has been taken to prove, that the phraſe," as was ſaid," is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper, but frequently uſed, even by Irenaeus himſelf, to introduce citations from known written books. And no one ever queſtioned its being a phraſe,
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:012009_0239_0F8941C1AC934528"/>
both proper, and commonly uſed, by all kinds of authors, by which to bring in the written words of others. But the queſtion is, whether it is not as proper a mode of ſpeech, and as commonly uſed, to introduce the <hi>vocal</hi> as the <hi>written</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of others? And ſince the point in debate is, whether Ignatius wrote theſe epiſtles, how can it be thought a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory proof, that he did, to bring a quotation from Irenaeus, introduced af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that manner," as one of us SAID?" which phraſe, to ſay the leaſt, is as well capable of being interpreted to refer to a VOCAL, as a WRITTEN, ſaying? It is replied to this, the words here quoted are found in one of the <hi>written</hi> "epiſtles" aſcribed to Ignatius, which is a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that ought, in all reaſon, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the matter, that Irenaeus took them from this "epiſtle." I anſwer, the total ſilence of Irenaeus about any epiſtles of Ignatius, when he had the faireſt, the moſt frequent, and moſt urgent occaſions, to have mentioned them, is a circumſtance full as ſtrong to induce a belief, that he knew nothing of them. But this is not all. Nothing more common with Irenaeus, than to
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:012009_0240_0F8941C26D3C3EF8"/>
have recourſe to the VOCAL ſayings of thoſe that were ancienter than himſelf; and a great number of them are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, in the very ſame manner with theſe words of Ignatius, "as ſuch an one ſaid." And as Irenaeus was acquainted with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp, Ignatius's contemporary, and a vaſt number of other ancients; why might he not have received this ſaying from them, as what had been uttered by Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, in the day of his martyrdom? nor is this meer conjecture only. For theſe very words are mentioned by Jerom, as delivered by Ignatius in his laſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. His words are theſe: <note n="*" place="bottom">"Cum jam damnatus eſſet ad beſtias, et ardore patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, rugientes audiret leones, ait: frumentum Chriſti ſum, dentibus beſtiarum molor, ut panis mundus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniar." Vid. lib. de viris illuſt. Cap. 16.</note> "Now, when he had been condemned to the beaſts, and in the heat of his ſuffering had heard the roaring of the lions, he ſaid, <hi>I am the corn of Chriſt, I am ground with the teeth of beaſts, that I may be found pure bread.</hi> And "the acts of Ignatius's martyrdom," both the Greek and Latin acts, exhibit the ſame account with Jerom; and ſo do Simeon the Metaphraſt, and the Roman breviary. Epiſcopalians will not deny, that
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:012009_0241_0F8941C32C14E1B0"/>
theſe words were uttered by Ignatius, in the time of his ſuffering. What diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty can there then be in ſuppoſing, that Irenaeus ſhould make mention of them, as a known, memorable SAYING of his? And why ſhould not this be rather ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, than that he ſhould take them from that "epiſtle" which is attributed to him as its author? Eſpecially, as there are ſuch notorious circumſtances, all conſpiring to encourage the thought, that he never ſaw it.</p>
               <p>BUT if we ſhould allow this teſtimony its utmoſt force, no more can be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it, than that there was extant in the days of Irenaeus one SEVENTH PART of thoſe epiſtles that now go under the name of Ignatius. For it is only the "epiſtle to the Romans," one of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that are attributed to him, that is here referred to. And every one, at the firſt view, muſt be ſenſible, how weak a teſtimony this is; and that if it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, or diſallowed, it will neither much hurt, or benefit, the general credit of theſe "epiſtles." And what may be thought worthy of notice, this "epiſtle to the Romans," the only one, upon the
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:012009_0242_0F8941C3EB62FAB8"/>
largeſt ſuppoſition, here referred to, is the only one, among all the "Ignatian epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles," that is ſilent about the cauſe of Epiſcopacy. Nothing, as I remember, is ſaid here upon this head; not ſo much as the name Biſhop mentioned, unleſs once very tranſiently. So that this is the only "epiſtle," among the "ſeven," that is inſignificant to the controverſy we are upon. And if it be received as quoted by Irenaeus, it will do the Preſbyterians no diſſervice; neither, if it be rejected as unknown to him, will it do the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians any harm. It is perfectly a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of no importance, as to the preſent diſpute, what becomes of it, or is ſaid about it.</p>
               <p>AFTER Irenaeus, Origen, who flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the third century, is recurred to. In his "prologue to the commentaries on canticles," he ſays, "We remember one to have ſaid, Ignatius by name, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, <hi>but my love is crucified</hi>: nor do I judge him worthy of reproof for this." <note n="*" place="bottom">"Meminimus aliquem dixiſſe, nomine Ignatium, de Chriſto, "meus autem amor crucifixus eſt": nec reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="234" facs="unknown:012009_0243_0F8941C4ABF82E08"/>
"Ignatian epiſtle to the Romans," ſection vii. This ſame Origen, in his "ſixth homily on Luke," ſpeaks thus, "I have found it elegantly wrote in the epiſtle of a certain martyr, Ignatius I mean, Biſhop of Antioch, the ſecond after Peter, who fought with beaſts in the perſecution at Rome, <hi>the virginity of Mary was kept ſecret from the prince of this world.</hi>

               <p>TO theſe teſtimonies from Origen, it muſt be ſaid, that they lie under the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs of being as exceptionable, as well as thoſe we have already conſidered. As to the firſt of them, it is taken from a piece that is thought, by many of the moſt learned writers, not to be Origen's, (who was a Preſbyter of the Greek church) but the work of ſome Latin author: or, ſhould it be ſuppoſed to be his, we have it only in the tranſlation of Ruffin, who has taken ſuch a ſhameful liberty in all his tranſlations of Origen, to add, alter,
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:012009_0244_0F8941C5A64950B8"/>
and diminiſh, that there is no knowing what is his own, and what Origen's: and this is ſo generally acknowledged, and lamented, by the learned, that a word need not be ſaid in proof of it. It is, I ſuppoſe, for this, or the foregoing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or both, that thoſe celebrated anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries, Uſher, and Voſſius, do neither of them make uſe of this Origenical teſtimony, in the evidence they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit in favor of the "epiſtles of Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us"; as may be ſeen in their "prefaces" to their editions of theſe "epiſtles," in Le' Clerc's edition of Cotelerius's "apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Fathers." They were certainly well acquainted with it; and if they had thought it of any ſignificancy, they would have inſiſted on it.—As for the other teſtimony, taken from the "homily on Luke," this alſo is ſuſpected to be the work, not of Origen, but of ſome Latin writer: or otherwiſe, it is extant only in Latin; and if it was tranſlated from the Greek by Jerom, as is pretended, there is no knowing what is Origen's. Du-pin ſays, "the verſions of Jerom are not more exact than Ruffin's: and Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin complains of the liberty Jerom took in his tranſlations, as Jerom complains of
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:012009_0245_0F8941C74D25A190"/>
Ruffin." And, ſurely, no great credit ought to be given to meer tranſlations, which are known to have been done with an unbounded licence: and as this is the caſe here, theſe teſtimonies, brought to view, in evidence that Ignatius wrote "epiſtles," are of little weight, and will be eſteemed ſo by impartial judges.</p>
               <p>IT would be an omiſſion if I did not add, it is a ſhrewd circumſtance, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of Origen's having never made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the "Ignatian epiſtles," that Euſebius takes not the leaſt notice of it. No one was a greater admirer, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of Origen's works than Euſebius; nor was there an ancient Father more thoroughly verſed in them. It cannot therefore be accounted for, if Origin had, in the above ſpecified places, commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Ignatius, that he ſhould be totally ſilent about it. It is much more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to think, they are not the words of Origen, but of ſome interpolator, or falſe interpreter.</p>
               <p>WE have now conſidered the whole evidence, in proof that Ignatius wrote ſuch "epiſtles" as go under his name,
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:012009_0246_0F8941C7AC633090"/>
until we come into the fourth century. And, I doubt not, that has been offered, which, to every unbiaſſed mind, will appear ſufficient to induce a ſuſpicion, leſt the venerable Ignatius ſhould have been perſonated by ſome bold impoſtor. Moſt certainly, the evidence, in ſupport of his being the real author of theſe "epiſtles," falls vaſtly ſhort of what might reaſonably have been expected. There are, in all, but three writers, for the full ſpace of two hundred years, that are produced as witneſſes, and the evidence they give is ſo clogged with difficulties, as to occaſion great doubt and heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And, in truth, conſidering the character of Ignatius, his nearneſs to the Apoſtles, the extraordinary circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his death, the uncommon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his writing theſe "epiſtles" (if they are truly his): conſidering, I ſay, theſe things, I may venture to appeal to the common ſenſe of mankind, whether it is not aſtoniſhing, that ſuch epiſtles, of ſuch a man, ſhould be paſſed over in ſuch ſilence for two hundred years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; no one writer making mention of them, unleſs in ſuch a manner, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch marks of ſuſpicion, as to leave
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:012009_0247_0F8941C86F1E58F0"/>
the mind in a ſtate of uncertainty, to ſay the leaſt? I will not affirm, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that has been offered, that Ignatius wrote none of the "epiſtles" he is ſaid to have wrote, though, to me, it appears highly improbable that he ever did.</p>
               <p>I SHOULD now have gone on to ſhow, that the "Ignatian epiſtles" are, if not ſpurious, yet ſo intermixed with corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to be unfit to be recurred to in the preſent controverſy. But previous to this, I ſhall take notice of a difficulty that is urged, upon the ſuppoſition Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius is not allowed to have wrote theſe "epiſtles" that are aſcribed to him, and ſaid to be his.</p>
               <p>IT is this, that Euſebius certainly thought, "theſe epiſtles" were wrote by Ignatius himſelf. And as he was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon well capable of judging in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, much better than we who live at ſo great a diſtance from the times of Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, it is ſaid to be a very bold thing now to plead, that "theſe epiſtles" are ſpurious.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="unknown:012009_0248_0F8941C92D4B0820"/>TO this the reply is, Euſebius was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a perſon of great learning, ſome think, the moſt learned among all the chriſtian Greek Fathers. And we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly beholden to him for many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable fragments of the works of many valuable primitive authors, which have long ſince periſhed by the injury of time; as alſo for a great variety of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, relative to the Chriſtian hiſtory, we muſt otherwiſe have been deſtitute of. But this notwithſtanding, we are not obliged to call him <hi>Maſter,</hi> and, at all adventures, to take every thing for truth juſt as he has delivered it. For, after all his learning, and whatever good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities he might be poſſeſſed of, he was a man "ſubject to like infirmities" with others; and there are too many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in his writings, of careleſſneſs, want of due attention, and a more thorough examination, not to ſay any thing worſe. And he is, on all ſides, frequently charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſlips and miſtakes, and ſome that are very groſs. The great Scaliger ſays of him, "No one has contributed more to the Chriſtian hiſtory, and no one is guilty of more miſtakes." Of the ſame mind was the learned Du-pin, though he
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:012009_0249_0F8941C9ED46D5E8"/>
expreſſes himſelf in ſofter terms. For, having ſaid what he judged proper in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of his "eccleſiaſtical hiſtory," he adds, "it muſt nevertheleſs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, it is not altogether ſo perfect as were to be wiſhed: for it is not written ſmoothly, neither is it always exact." And in his note here, he reckons up, at leaſt, half a ſcore of faults, which, ſays he, "are contrary both to the truth of hiſtory, and chronology." Nor do any of the noted antiquaries, either Proteſtant or Romiſh, Epiſcopal or Preſbyterian, think themſelves obliged ſacredly to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to him; but do all, in their turns, take liberty to differ from him, and, as they imagine, upon juſt grounds.</p>
               <p>BUT what is more particularly perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to what we are upon, Euſebius too credulouſly ſuffered himſelf to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times betrayed into the belief of that, which, if he had examined with more care, caution, and ſuſpicion, he would readily have rejected. There are inſtances of this to be met with in his valuable hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. One I ſhall here mention, as being full to the point under conſideration. In the laſt chapter but one of the firſt book
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:012009_0250_0F8941CAAD4E8A90"/>
of this hiſtory, we have a moſt formal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of "Agbarus's letter, King of Edeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, to our Savior Jeſus Chriſt, ſent to him at Jeruſalem by Ananias his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;" and our "Savior's letter to King Agbarus in anſwer to it." And, in the following chapter, both theſe letters are inſerted at large, Euſebius having tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated them out of the Syriac language, in which they were wrote, as he found the copies of them in the archieves of Edeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa. And theſe epiſtles, which he thus publiſhed to the world, he as verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved were wrote, one of them by our Savior, and the other by King Agbarus, as he did, that the epiſtles he mentions under the name of Ignatius were wrote by him. What regard now do the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world pay to Euſebius's judgment, with reſpect to theſe letters? Do they hold themſelves bound to receive them as "the epiſtles of Jeſus Chriſt, and King Agba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus," becauſe Euſebius was too haſtily led into this opinion of them? No; but, notwithſtanding the learning, the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the integrity of Euſebius, and his nearneſs to the primitive times, they are ſo free with him as to think, he was credulous in eſteeming "theſe letters"
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:012009_0251_0F8941CB6D4591B0"/>
genuine; and that he did it without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient caution and enquiry. Even Arch-Biſhop Wake has very plainly ſignified this to have been his opinion. Says he, <note n="*" place="bottom">"Apoſtol. Fathers" p. 93.</note>
                  <q>Natalis Alexander delivers this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; the "epiſtle of Agbarus" to our Savior, and "his anſwer" to it, are ſuppoſititious, and apocryphal: and, at large, anſwers all that is uſually urged in favor of them. And Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin, after him, yet more ſolidly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of ſuch manifeſt errors, as may ſerve to ſatisfy all conſidering perſons, that Euſebius and Ephraaem were too eaſy of belief in this particular; and did not ſufficiently examine into it, when they delivered that as a certain truth, which, from ſeveral circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, appears to have been evidently otherwiſe.</q>
Now, from this inſtance, produced from Euſebius, the arguing is both natural and forcible. If he might be miſtaken in his opinion about "theſe letters," he might alſo be miſtaken in his opinion about the "Ignatian epiſtles." If he was too credulouſly betrayed into a belief of the genuineneſs of "theſe
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:012009_0252_0F8941CC2C184CB0"/>
letters," which are moſt palpably ſpurious, he might alſo too credulouſly come into the belief of the genuineneſs of the "epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Ignatius." If, with reſpect to "theſe letters," he was too inattentive, not ſufficiently ſuſpicious, too thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of being impoſed upon by religious fraud, this might alſo have been the caſe with reſpect to the "epiſtles" in diſpute. Nor if the learned world do, without any difficulty, reject "theſe letters" as ſpuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in contradiction to the judgment of Euſebius, ought it to be objected as a difficulty in the way of rejecting "Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius's epiſtles," that herein Euſebius's judgment is oppoſed: nor can this be urged as a difficulty without evident par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality. For, in the inſtance we have mentioned, no difficulty is pretended; but the whole body of writers, both Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh and Proteſtant (a few only excepted) reject "theſe letters" as a fraudulent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition upon the world, without making any compliment to the great Euſebius for their oppoſition to him in this matter.</p>
               <p>BUT, beſides what has been offered, Euſebius has, in the caſe before us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the evidence upon which he
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:012009_0253_0F8941CCED396098"/>
received theſe "epiſtles;" which, if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, we have plainly no reaſon to be moved by his judgment: and that it really is ſo we before proved, when the teſtimonies of Polycarp and Irenaeus were conſidered, the two only ones he has men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in ſupport of the credit of "theſe epiſtles." It may, perhaps, be thought ſtrange, that Euſebius ſhould judge, from the teſtimonies of Polycarp and Irenaeus, that Ignatius wrote "theſe epiſtles," if what they ſay, be, as we have already endeavored to evince, inſufficient for the purpoſe. But, why might not Euſebius make more of theſe teſtimonies than they really contained, and argue too much from them, as others have done ſince? And that he has ſo done (whether "theſe epiſtles" are true or falſe) is too evident to be called in queſtion; as appears from what has been before offered upon this head. For, let it be obſerved, he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces Irenaeus ſpeaking upon the matter after this manner, "and Irenaeus remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered his EPISTLES, writing thus, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am the wheat of God.</hi>"—Theſe words are to be found no where in the writings of Ignatius, but in the "epiſtle to the Romans:" nor does Irenaeus any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:012009_0254_0F8941CDAD40F600"/>
where elſe mention any writing of Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, or refer to any paſſage in his ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed works. So that the utmoſt that can be collected, in point of argument, from theſe words is, that "the epiſtle to the Romans" was commemorated by Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus. But the concluſion, which Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius draws, reſpects the "epiſtles in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral;" which is certainly an inſtance of inattention to the juſt import of the words he argues from. He goes on, "and Polycarp maketh mention hereof, in his epiſtle to the Philippians, writing thus,—<hi>the epiſtle of Ignatius which he ſent to us, and as many other epiſtles.</hi>"—It is far from being evident, as has been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved already, that Polycarp here mentions any more than TWO EPISTLES of Ignatius; and yet, the words are brought in evidence of the EPISTLES WITHOUT LIMITATION; which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtance of a curſory conſideration only of this paſſage. Had he been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently cautious, he might have ſeen rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect, whether this teſtimony was at all Polycarp's.—The true ſtate of the caſe ſeems to have been this;—There were extant, in the days of Euſebius, "epiſtles under the name of Ignatius to
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:012009_0255_0F8941CE6C13D428"/>
ſeveral famous churches;" and, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a paſſage in Polycarp's letter, that made mention of "epiſtles of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius," and another in Irenaeus, citing words that are to be found in ONE of "theſe epiſtles," he haſtily concluded, without more ado, that Ignatius wrote ALL THE EPISTLES he had ſeen under his name: whereas, if he had thoroughly examined the matter, he would have found theſe teſtimonies too weak to ſupport the concluſion he makes from them; as they moſt certainly are, whatever is the truth as touching "theſe epiſtles."</p>
               <p>I SHALL only add, that Euſebius ſeems not to have been without ſome biaſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his mind, in favor of the "Ignatian epiſtles." For it is a plain caſe, the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ancients, reſpecting particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar writings, is, with him, an argument much weakening the credit of them. The "ſecond epiſtle of Clement" he eſteems, if not ſuppoſititious, at leaſt "leſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and leſs worthy of notice," be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe "no teſtimonies are alleged for it by the Elders." And the "dialogues of Peter and Apion" he looks upon as plainly ſpurious, for this, among other

reaſons, "that none of the Elders have mentioned it." But, in the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, though, as we have ſeen, there is a moſt ſurprizing ſilence in primitive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity about any writings of Ignatius, yet he takes no notice at all of it; but receives the "epiſtles" extant in his day, under the name of "this Father," with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt heſitation, and by the lump too. And if Mr. Whiſton's reaſoning may be thought valid, a good account may be given of this matter. According to him, the "epiſtles of Ignatius," ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the days of Euſebius, were the LARGER ONES, that is, theſe epiſtles as we have them in the editions before thoſe of Uſher and Voſſius. As to the SHOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER EPISTLES," that is, thoſe we have in the editions of theſe learned antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he ſpeaks of them as the LARGER EPISTLES arbitrarily mangled and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed. And his arguments, upon this head, appear to me, I freely confeſs, to be exceeding weighty: nor do I think, they ever have been, or can be, fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. And ſhould this be the truth, there is no great difficulty in ſuppoſing, that Euſebius might be inclined to think as well of them as might be. For, as he
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:012009_0257_0F8941D00109CAF8"/>
and Whiſton were nearly of the ſame ſentiments, relative to an important point of Chriſtian doctrine, it was but natural for him to be well affected to "theſe epiſtles," which are well known to look with a favorable eye on this diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tenet of their's. So that, upon the whole, it is but reaſonable we ſhould be left fairly to judge of the evidence in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, or diſ-favor, of "theſe epiſtles," without being at all ſwayed by the judgment of Euſebius: nor ought it to be looked upon as an objection of any weight againſt our rejecting them, that that learned au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thought them genuine; provided we have good reaſon ſo to do.</p>
               <p>I WILL not take upon me to ſay, that Ignatius did not write "epiſtles" that were ſeen by Euſebius; but thus much I will venture to ſay, that it is highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, moſt unprejudiced perſons, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of what has been offered, will be ſtrongly inclined to queſtion, whether they were ſo certainly HIS, as to leave no reaſonable room for doubt in the caſe.— But I muſt now go on,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="unknown:012009_0258_0F8941D1A48895B8"/>TO offer what may be thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſhow, that "theſe epiſtles," if not ſpurious, have yet been corrupted to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degree that unfits them to be appealed to, as exhibiting the real mind of Ignatius; eſpecially with reſpect to Epiſcopacy, the point now under debate.</p>
               <p>WHAT I here propoſe to conſider, meerly as interlarded corruption, is made uſe of by Daille, La'roque, and other learned writers, to prove, from the IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERNAL CONTENTS of "theſe epiſtles" themſelves, that they were not wrote by Ignatius, but by ſome later hand. And it muſt be acknowledged, the EXTERNAL EVIDENCE in proof, that Ignatius did not write "theſe epiſtles," if conſidered in connection with this INTERNAL EVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENCE, will give great additional force to the argument, and leave ſcarce any room for doubt in the caſe.—But I chuſe to give the Epiſcopalians all the advantage they can deſire; and ſhall therefore here argue upon the ſuppoſition, that Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius really wrote "epiſtles" that were extant in the days of Euſebius: but, even upon this ſuppoſition, we claim to be excuſed from placing any manner of
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:012009_0259_0F8941D2325FE3A8"/>
dependance upon what they ſay, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon the head of Epiſcopacy; and for this very good reaſon, becauſe we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and ſhall prove, that they are ſo mingled with corruption, as not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the mind of the truly venerable Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius.</p>
               <p>SOME, perhaps, may think it owing to prejudice, when it is ſo much as inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, as if there were any corrupt mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in ſuch eminently valuable "epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles" as thoſe of Ignatius. But it ought to be known, and remembered, that Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius has been impudently and frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently dealt with, no leſs than EIGHT of the fifteen epiſtles, that bear his name, being FORGERIES, and owned to be ſo: beſides which, it is true likewiſe, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as the truth, even by Biſhop Pearſon himſelf, the great advocate for Ignatius, that the other "ſeven epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles," in all the editions of them, before Uſher and Voſſius, were ſo CORRUPTED by ſome knaviſh interpolator or other, as that they ought not to be depended on as exhibiting the real mind of the true Ignatius. It is not argued from hence, that the Uſherian and Voſſian editions
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:012009_0260_0F8941D2EC0B0258"/>
muſt needs be corrupted alſo; but thus much is obviouſly, and certainly dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible herefrom, that they MAY be ſo; that to ſuppoſe ſuch a thing is no indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of prejudice againſt them, as it is no more than has been actually done, with reſpect to theſe very "epiſtles," in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer editions.</p>
               <p>MUCH might eaſily be offered in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the affirmation, that the "epiſtles of Ignatius," in their lateſt, beſt, and moſt purged editions, are too much mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with interpolated corruption to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on, as letting us into his true and real ſentiments. I might particularly conſider the "inſcriptions" to theſe epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; all which carry with them this ſhrewd mark of time, LATER than the days of Ignatius, their ſpeaking of him in the ſtile of THEOPHOROS, an epithet never applied to him, until ages after his death.—I might take notice of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Ignatius's being "carried in bonds, from Syria to Rome, to be thrown to wild beaſts," on the truth of which his epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles intirely depend; and yet, the ſtory is in itſelf a very ſtrange and unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table one, and ſo eſteemed by many of
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:012009_0261_0F8941D3AC3BD658"/>
the moſt learned writers.—I might inſiſt upon what is ſaid of the "<hi>word's</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from <hi>Sigê,</hi>" a term of art in the <hi>Valentinian</hi> theology, not known to be uſed as ſuch, until after the departure of Ignatius out of our world.—In a word, I might bring to view a great number of paſſages, which it would be a diſhonor to Ignatius to aſcribe to him, they are either ſo weak, or abſurd, or ridiculous, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with what he has elſewhere ſaid, and ſometimes in the ſame epiſtle.— But it would be too great, as well as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, a tryal of the reader's patience to conſider ſo many articles. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paſs them over, and wholly confine myſelf to what, more eſpecially, relates to the preſent controverſy, the things that are ſaid concerning the OFFICERS OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. And I the rather chuſe to enlarge upon this head, as it is enlarged upon in ALL the "Ignatian epiſtles" (the epiſtle to the Romans on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted,) and in a MANNER evidently ſhewing, if theſe "epiſtles" are not ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that they have been tampered with, and baſely corrupted by ſome over-heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed zealot for eccleſiaſtical dignity, and power, ſo as to be unfitted to hand to us
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:012009_0262_0F8941D46D4AE8E0"/>
the true ſentiments of the real Ignatius. And here it may be offered as follows.</p>
               <p>CONSIDERING the circumſtances of Ignatius, when he is ſaid to have wrote theſe epiſtles;—his being a priſoner of death, and on his journey to Rome to ſuffer martyrdom, it is not at all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he ſhould have his heart ſo ſet on exalting the Clergy, as, in all his epiſtles, to write, as if the main thing ſuitable to be told the churches, was, that they had "worthy and God-becoming Biſhops and Preſbyters, whom they ought to honor, and obey, even as Jeſus Chriſt honored and obeyed the Father." There is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently more, much more, ſaid, in theſe epiſtles, upon the rights of the Clergy, and the ſubjection that was due to them, than upon any other ſubject, though of fundamental importance.—Does not this appear ſtrange? It would certainly do ſo in any epiſtles wrote, at preſent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der like circumſtances. And what makes the matter ſtill more extraordinary, the ſame words and phraſes, upon the ſame beloved ſubject, not only come over in every epiſtle, ſave one; but in moſt of them, they are needleſſly repeated; and,
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:012009_0263_0F8941D52D4AC1D0"/>
in ſome of them, their repetition over and over again is quite fulſome. To this it is ſaid by Epiſcopalians,</p>
               <p>THAT hereſies now began to be broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and to infect the minds of many; and therefore, as the moſt proper expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient that could, at that time, be thought on, to preſerve the churches pure, Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius exhorts them, and with preſſing earneſtneſs, to an adherence to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, union with, and ſubjection to, their Biſhops and Preſbyters. And his ſo zealouſly, and frequently, inſiſting upon this head, is made even a ſign of his ſoul's flaming with love to the churches; diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in ardent deſires that they might flouriſh in peace, truth, and holineſs, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had been devoured by wild beaſts. In anſwer whereto,</p>
               <p>I WOULD not go about to detract, in the leaſt, from the piety of Ignatius, his concern for the purity of the churches, and deſire to preſerve them from hereſy: but, at the ſame time, cannot but think it very wonderful, if "ſubjection to church-governors" an implicit adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the "Biſhop and his Clergy,"
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:012009_0264_0F8941D5ED2CAE98"/>
ſuch a notable expedient, ſo ſure and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual an one, to guard againſt hereſy, that none of the Fathers contemporary with Ignatius ſhould be ſo happy as to hit upon it. It was as good an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to cure diviſions, as to ſecure from hereſy; and yet, Clement of Rome makes no mention at all of it to the church of Corinth, when he wrote to them as rent with ſtrife and ſciſm. And it is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Polycarp, who wrote juſt after Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, and with his "epiſtles" in keeping (as is pretended), among other things, cautions the church at Philippi againſt the ERRORS that then prevailed among many. But how does he preſs the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation? Why, not a word does he liſp about their adhering to <hi>their Biſhop, with the reſt of the Clergy,</hi> the great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument here ſaid to be uſed by Ignatius: but he beſpeaks them in theſe words, "Theſe things, <hi>my brethren,</hi> I took not the liberty of myſelf to write unto you.—For neither I, nor any other ſuch as I am, come up to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the bleſſed and renowned Paul, who, being himſelf in perſon with thoſe that then lived, did, with exactneſs and ſoundneſs, teach the word of truth; and
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:012009_0265_0F8941D6B0EC6DE8"/>
being gone from you wrote an epiſtle to you, into which if you look, you will be able to edify yourſelves in the faith that hath been delivered to you, which is the mother of us all."—And a little onwards, "Wherefore, leaving the vanity of many, and their falſe doctrines, let us return to the word that was delivered to us from the beginning." If Ignatius had been as particular, and full, in recommending an adherence to the SCRIPTURE, an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the APOSTOLIC WRITINGS, as he is in urging an adherence to the CLER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GY, and SUBJECTION TO THEM, it might, poſſibly, have been as good a guard againſt "infection by hereſy." He does, indeed, ſometimes exhorts thoſe he writes to, "to ſtudy to be confirmed in the doctrine of our Lord, and his Apoſtles;" but where he ONCE adviſes to this, I will venture to ſay, he TEN TIMES preſſes a regard to the CLERGY; and this he does in very unguarded language, without ever making the ſuppoſition, that they alſo might be corrupted with error; and, in this caſe, cautioning the churches againſt being led aſide by their governors: which is making much more of the Clergy, than the Apoſtles ever made of themſelves.—
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:012009_0266_0F8941D76B3D61B8"/>
But I ſhall not enlarge here, having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned what has been offered as a ſmall circumſtance only, in compariſon with what I have yet to ſay. To go on there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p>IT is of more weighty conſideration, that the officers of the chriſtian church are commonly ſpoken of, in "theſe epiſtles," in language not at all conſonant to the age in which the true Ignatius lived, nor indeed in the leaſt worthy of ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and primitive a Father and martyr. What other thought can reaſonably be entertained of thoſe paſſages, in which Biſhops are repreſented as "preſiding in the place of God:" in which they are compared to "God the Father, to Jeſus Chriſt the Son of the Father:" in which the churches are taught it to be their duty "to receive them as the Lord, to reverence them as Jeſus Chriſt;" yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "to follow them as Chriſt does the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:" in which they are commanded "ſo to obey and ſubject themſelves to the Biſhop as to do nothing without him, however reaſonable it might appear to them:" in which they are exhorted to be "ſo one with the Biſhop, as Chriſt is
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:012009_0267_0F8941D914354F30"/>
one with the Father;" and "ſo to do nothing without him, as Chriſt did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without the Father:" in which ſo great account is made of obedience and ſubjection to the Biſhop, that they that "do any thing without him" are eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed "doing the devil a ſervice;" and thoſe that remain with him" are, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count only, thought worthy of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of "belonging to Chriſt;" and are repreſented as "walking not as men, but according to Chriſt:" yea, in which obedience to the officers of the church is ſo highly eſtimated by the writer, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpolator, of "theſe epiſtles," that he even "pawns his ſoul for thoſe that obey the Biſhop, Preſbyters, and Deacons; and deſires his portion in God may be with ſuch."</p>
               <p>THESE, and like expreſſions, to be met with in "theſe epiſtles," are not eaſily to be accounted for, upon the ſuppoſition that they have not been interlaced with corruption. In their literal and moſt obvious ſenſe, they are unworthy of any pious writer; much more of ſo venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Father, and illuſtrious a martyr, as Ignatius: nor can it be diſowned, that,
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:012009_0268_0F8941D9ABFB1FF0"/>
in this ſenſe, they exalt the Clergy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all reaſonable bounds, claiming for them the moſt abſolutely blind obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and ſhould we qualify their ſenſe, to the utmoſt extent they are capable of, they carry the dignity and power of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Preſbyters, and the ſubjection due to them, not only far above their deſerts, but ſo as to diſcover the TRUE SPIRIT of AFTER-TIMES, and not that in which Ignatius is known to have lived.</p>
               <p>IT may, with the exacteſt truth, be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that none of the writers, in the days of Ignatius, or near the age in which he flouriſhed, do bear the leaſt likeneſs to him in his mode of ſpeaking, relative to the officers of the church. Theſe unite, as one, in language becoming the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the goſpel, and the purity and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of thoſe primitive times: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, the general ſtrain of "Ignatus's epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles" is evidently adapted, I may ſay, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely contrived, to aggrandiſe the Clergy, and beſpeak for them the higheſt rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, honor, and ſubmiſſion. How can this be accounted for, without the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſome medling interpolator?
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:012009_0269_0F8941DA70D61EF8"/>
Why, otherwiſe, ſhould there be ſuch a ſignal difference between his manner of writing, and that of all the ancients in his day, and for a long time after his life had come to a period here on earth?</p>
               <p>THE difference of ſtile, in different writers, will not, as is pleaded here, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for this. The ſtile of Hermas wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differs fromt hat of Clement, as Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's does. from that of Polycarp, and Polycarp's from that of Juſtin Martyr, and Irenaeus; and yet, they all lead us to think much the ſame thing about the Clergy; and this, with all deſirable clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and certainty, though they ſeverally expreſs themſelves in a manner peculiar each one to himſelf. And why might not Ignatius have wrote in his own ſtile, and yet have concurred with his contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries, in a like account of the officers of the church? It ought, moſt certainly, to be aſcribed, not to meer difference in ſtile, but to ſome other cauſe, that he ſo ſtrangely differs from them. And what cauſe can this be, but the interlading hand of ſome zealot for clerical power and honor?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="unknown:012009_0270_0F8941DB2C2358D0"/>HIS being a SYRIAN may, poſſibly, account for his ſometimes barbarous Greek, as well as high-ſounding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded words, <note n="*" place="bottom">No writer was ever more pleaſed with compounding words to make them look big with meaning, than Ignatius. Thoſe he could join with PHOROS in the end, and AXIOS in the beginning, are particularly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in his "epiſtles." He ſpeaks of one, or another of the churches he writers to, as THEOPHOROI, NAOPHOROI, AGIOPHOROI, CHRISTOPHOROI, PNEUMATOPHOROI, &amp;c. The words alſo, AXIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THEOS, AXIOMAKARISTOS, AXIONOMASTOS, AX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IOGAPEETOS, AXIOTHAUMASTOS, &amp;c. are favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite compounds of his making. Arch-Biſhop Wake ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom tranſlates theſe, and ſuch like words, ſo as that the original Greek could from thence be ſo much as gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at.</note> peculiar to himſelf; but it will, by no means, account for his ſentimes concerning the Clergy, as differing from thoſe of all his contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries. For not only the mode of language in "theſe epiſtles," but the idea conveyed by it, is quite different from that which is contained in the "other writings" in, and near, the ſame age. Bring down the high ſtrains uſed in "theſe epiſtles," and put them into plain ſimple language, ſtill keeping to their true ſpirit, and genuine intendment; and they will carry the power of the Clergy, and the reverence and honor due to them, far
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:012009_0271_0F8941DBED24DE98"/>
beyond what it is carried, either in the ſcripture, or the writings of all contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Fathers united together: nor can a perſon read the "epiſtles of Ignatius," and not have excited in his mind a much more exalted idea, both of Biſhops and Preſbyters, than by reading all the other writers, within the two firſt centuries. Any common reader, by going over the collection of teſtimonies brought to view, in this volume, may, with his own eyes, ſee this to be the truth of fact.</p>
               <p>LET the diſpute about the ſuperiority of Biſhops to Preſbyters be as it may, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more evident, than that the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage relative to the Clergy, beſpeaking for them reverence and ſubjection, was quite different after the ſecond century, from what it was before. And as the language, in the "Ignatian epiſtles," up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this head, is ſo unlike that of the age in which he lived, and agrees ſo well with that, which was, in fact, uſed afterwards, it is a ſure mark of unfair dealing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>how or other. Either Ignatius was not the writer of "theſe epiſtles," or they have been baſely and fraudulently corrupted, ſince his death. No one, unbiaſſed in his
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:012009_0272_0F8941DCACDB98C8"/>
mind, can, I ſhould think, be at any loſe to determine thus.—To proceed,</p>
               <p>IT is moſt of all worthy of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the words, BISHOP and PRES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BYTER, are, in the Ignation epiſtles, AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PROPRIATED terms; not uſed PROMIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CUOUSLY, but in a DISTINCTIVE ſenſe. Biſhops are never here called Preſbyters; nor, on the other hand, are Preſbyters ever called Biſhops. The mode of diction is this; "Being ſubject to your Biſhop, and the Preſbytery."—"Obeying your Biſhop, and the Preſbytery, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire affection."—"Seeing I have been judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worthy to ſee you by Damas, your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop; and by your worthy Preſbyters, Baſſus and Apollonius".—"In whom I rejoice, for that he is ſubject unto his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, as the grace of God; and to the Preſbyter, as to the law of Jeſus Chriſt."— "He that does any thing without the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and Preſbyters is not pure in his conſcience."—"Being ſubject to your Biſhop, as to the command of God; and ſo likewiſe to the Preſbytery."—"I cried, whilſt I was among you, I ſpake with a loud voice, attend to the Biſhop, and to the Preſbytery."—"See that ye all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:012009_0273_0F8941DD6D310BC8"/>
your Biſhop, as Jeſus Chriſt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; andt he Preſbytery as the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles." —"I ſalute your very worthy Biſhops, and your venerable Preſbytery."—You obſerve the terms Biſhop and Preſbyter, are uſed, in theſe paſſages, in the APPRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRIATED ſenſe; and they are uſed in the ſame ſenſe throughout the epiſtles. Nor can an inſtance be given to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. The APPROPRIATION of theſe terms is not accidental, but deſigned; and it runs through all the copies of theſe epiſtles, the Uſherian and Voſſian, as well as thoſe that were extant before them: is, in no caſe, at no time, upon no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, departed from.</p>
               <p>WHAT agreement, now, is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſuppoſed Ignatius, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries, upon this head? Do they uſe the words, Biſhop and Preſbyter, as he does, in an appropriated fixed ſenſe? It cannot, with any face of truth, be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that they do. Far from this, they differ as much from him, in their uſe of theſe terms, as they do from any of the writers of the third, or fourth centuries. There is indeed no writer, either before
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:012009_0274_0F8941DE2D29F360"/>
Ignatius, or at the time when he wrote, or even afterwards for more than an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, that uſes theſe words as he does, in a ſenſe ſo certainly, and invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, fixed and appropriated. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is deſired to compare the pretended Ignatius's <hi>mode of diction,</hi> upon this point, with <hi>that</hi> which is held out to view, in the preſent volume, from all the writers until towards the cloſe of the ſecond cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury; and he may then, from ocular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, be convinced, that he greatly differs fromt hem all; and eminently in this reſpect, that he invariably uſes the words, Biſhop and Preſbyter, in the AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PROPRIATED ſenſe; while they uſe them promiſcuouſly, ſometimes calling Biſhops, Preſbyters; and ſometimes Preſbyters, Biſhops: meaning by both terms one and the ſame order of officers in the church. He will evidently ſee, in "Hermas's paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor," that the word, Biſhops, is explained to ſignify, "thoſe that preſide in the church;" and that thoſe who preſide in the church are "the Preſbyters of it." He will at once perceive, in "Clement's epiſtle to the Corinthians," that the ſame officers who are called "Preſbyters," are directly ſpoken of as "caſt out of their

Epiſcopacy." When he turns to Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp, the ſuppoſed collector of the "Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natian epiſtles," and the next and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt writer to him, ſo far will he be from finding an analogy between "his epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle," and the "epiſtles of Ignatius," that he no where ſpeaks of the Biſhop of Philippi, or of any other church: nor does he ſo much as mention the word, Biſhop; which is really unaccountable, if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, conformably to the ſentiments of Epiſcopalians, that Ignatius had very lately, and under the moſt extraordinary circumſtances too, wrote "his epiſtles," and that Polycarp was particularly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them; yea, that he had wrote "one epiſtle to Polycarp" himſelf, and another to "his church at Smyrna," in one of which he "pawns his ſoul for them that were obedient to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and the other Clergy;" and, in the other, makes the Biſhop ſo neceſſary, that "no adminiſtration could be valid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, but whatever he ſhould approve would be pleaſing to God." And he will be no more able to find in Juſtin Martyr, or Irenaeus, an APPROPRIATED uſe of the terms, Biſhop and Preſbyter, than in either of the foregoing writers.
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:012009_0276_0F8941DFAB411AD8"/>
Irenaeus, it is true, frequently uſes theſe terms, but in the PROMISCUOUS ſenſe; as no one can be at a loſs to perceive, who will be at the trouble of reading over the teſtimonies, in this work, produced out of his writings: nor are the words, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and Preſbyter, uſed as APPROPRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATED ones, until towards the cloſe of the ſecond century; and, even then, the AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PROPRIATION was not ſteadily fixed. Clement of Alexandria, who chiefly flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the latter end of the ſecond cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, and the beginning of the third, is the firſt writer who uſes the mode of ſpeech, ſo common, and invariable, with Ignatius, "Biſhops, Preſbyters, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons; and yet, ſo long after the days of Ignatius, the diſtinct APPROPRIATION of theſe names was not certainly fixed. We muſt go into the third century, I may rather ſay, beyond it, before the appropriation, after the manner of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius, is conſtant, ſacred, and invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>UPON which, the enquiry is highly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, how ſhould Ignatius conſtantly, and forever, uſe the words, Biſhop and Preſbyter, not in the ſenſe in which they
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:012009_0277_0F8941E153771BC8"/>
were uſed, in the age in which he wrote; but in the ſenſe, in which they were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in other ages, long after his death? This certainly looks ſuſpicious, and ought, in all reaſon, to put us upon our guard, leſt we ſhould take ſome jugling impoſtor for the worthy, and primitive Ignatius. Words, we know, often vary in their ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification; and ſometimes, when uſed in this or that particular ſenſe, are as ſure a mark of ſuch a particular age, as the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial mode or faſhion of garments. And this is plainly the caſe here. Before the days of Ignatius, about the time of his living, and dying, and for many years after, the words, Biſhop and Preſbyter, were not APPROPRIATED names, and as ſuch applied to different perſons; but were INDIFFERENTLY uſed to point out either Biſhops, or Preſbyters: whereas, towards the going out of this age, or rather the coming on of the next, they began to looſe their PROMISCUOUS uſe, and to become APPROPRIATED terms, conveying the idea of different perſons, who were commonly known, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, by the application of theſe now different names: though, it ought to be remembered, this appropriation was not
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:012009_0278_0F8941E1EE88B070"/>
ſo SACRED and INVIOLABLE, as in the "epiſtles of Ignatius", till we have got much farther from the age in which he lived. And we are herefrom preſented with a criterion, by which we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, with all deſirable certainty, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Ignatius did not write the "epiſtles" that go under his name, or that they have been ſafely, and fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, corrupted by ſome bigot for cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal honor and power; inſomuch, that there is no knowing the real ſentiments of the true Ignatius.</p>
               <p>I HAVE now, with conſcious care and impartiality, endeavoured to exhibit the true ſtate of the "epiſtles" called "Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natian;" leaving it with the reader to judge for himſelf, how far they may, with certainty, be depended on; more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the preſent debate. Poſſibly, he may be diſpoſed to queſtion, whether Ignatius was at all the writer of the "epiſtles" that are aſcribed to him: or, ſhould he be inclined to think he was, it is ſcarce ſuppoſable, but he ſhould be clearly ſatisfied, that ſome fraudulent hand has made him write in a manner quite
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:012009_0279_0F8941E2ACF56A28"/>
diſſonant from the times in which he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and to ſuch a degree, as to unfit his "epiſtles" to be repaired to, with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in the debate concerning epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.</p>

               <head>OBSERVATIONS and REMARKS upon the TESTIMONIES from IGNATIUS.</head>
               <p>THOUGH I have enlarged, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going pages, upon the reaſons we have to think, that the "ſeven epiſtles" of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius are either SPURIOUS, or ſo INTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LARDED WITH AFTER ADDITIONS as not to be depended on; yet, I can truly ſay, I was not moved to this from an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, that "theſe epiſtles," unleſs ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the way, would be ruinous, or indeed at all hurtful, to the cauſe in the defence of which I am engaged. Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians, I know, ever repair to them as their main ſtrength; and are ready to think, and ſay, that we are diſpoſed to ſpeak injuriouſly of them, upon any
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:012009_0299_0F89422F2D018BA0"/>
pretences, however ſlighty, becauſe they ſpeak ſo clearly and fully againſt us. But they are herein greatly miſtaken. It is owing to the force of truth, and not to prejudice, or fear leſt our cauſe ſhould ſuffer, if tried by them, that we repreſent them as under very ſtrong marks of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion. And to induce a belief of this, and, at the ſame time, to do juſtice to our ſide of the diſpute, I ſhall, in what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, ſuppoſe theſe "epiſtles" to be GE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUINE, as truly ſo as the writings of Clement, or any other primitive Father; and, in this view of them, endeavor to ſhew, that they furniſh much more evidence in favor of us, than of the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians; and that they may be juſtly brought as witneſſes in defence of our cauſe, rather than their's.</p>
               <p>IN order to ſet this matter in a fair point of light, let it be remembered, the Biſhops pleaded for by our antagoniſts are DIOCESAN ones; and the POWERS they make ESSENTIAL to the epiſcopal office, and exclude Preſbyters from, are thoſe of GOVERNMENT, ORDINATION, and CONFIRMATION. Let us now review the "Ignatian teſtimonies," and ſee whether
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:012009_0300_0F89422FEC483A38"/>
they ſpeak of SUCH BISHOPS, or THESE POWERS that are ſaid to be ESSENTIAL to their office, and characteriſtical of it.</p>
               <p>I SHALL begin with ſaying, that, upon the ſtricteſt examination of all that is ſaid in the "epiſtles of Ignatius," nothing can be found that will lead one into the idea of a DIOCESAN Biſhop. It is as evident as it well can be, from the whole tenor of "theſe epiſtles," that the Ignatian Biſhop was the paſtoral head of a SINGLE CONGREGATION, who uſually met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one place, and united in an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the inſtitutions of Chriſtianity. So much is to be met with upon this point, and in language ſo full and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, that no reaſonable room is left for heſitation or doubt.</p>
               <p>IGNATIUS "inſcribes" all theſe epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles to SINGLE ſocieties of Chriſtians, in this and the other particular place. "To the church in Epheſus," in "Magneſia," in "Philadelphia," and ſo on. And he applies ſeverally to theſe churches, as one would ſpeak to a ſingle congregation of Chriſtians, whoſe cuſtom it was frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to aſſemble in one place, and join as
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:012009_0301_0F894230AC40B470"/>
one in worſhipping God through Jeſus Chriſt. And not only ſo, but the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and exhortations he gives, both to theſe churches, and their Biſhops, are ſuch as make it morally certain, that he writes to ſingle congregations of Chriſtians, and not a number of them conſtituting one church. Inſtances to this purpoſe might eaſily be produced out of each of "theſe epiſtles." But, as ſuch an enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration would be both needleſs, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, I ſhall ſelect only a few ſtriking ſpecimens that muſt be convincing to prejudice itſelf.</p>
               <p>HE ſays to the church at Epheſus, "If the prayer of one or two has ſuch efficacy, how much more that of the Biſhop, and the WHOLE CHURCH! HE that cometh not to the SAME PLACE <note n="*" place="bottom">The phraſe EPI TO AUTO, may be underſtood as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring either to TIME, PLACE, or DESIGN, and is accordingly tranſlated, by the beſt critics, in all theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. It's propriety as meaning PLACE or TIME, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then DESIGN; and DESIGN rather than either of the former, can be determined only by the import of the ſentence in which it is found, and the part it bears as connected with the diſcourſe. In this view of the phraſe, it cannot be better tranſlated here, than in the words of Arch-Biſhop Wake, TO THE SAME PLACE. He was as cloſe a friend to the church of England as any man in his day, and would not have given this turn to the words, could he have pitched upon any other more favorable to the cauſe of Epiſcopacy. The plain truth is, whether the phraſe is tranſlated here, or in the other places where it is uſed in "Ignatius's epiſtles," TO THE SAME PLACE, or WITH ONE MIND, or DESIGN, the argument, in ſupport of the cauſe we are defending, is equally ſtrong. For it lies in this, that the Chriſtians, conſtituting the Epheſian, and other churches, wrote to by Ignatius, are evidently ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of as SINGLE CONGREGATIONS, which might, and ordinarily did, meet together for the worſhip of God: and if ſo, it muſt be IN THE SAME PLACE, and more certainly than with ONE MIND. It is true, if theſe churches were PREVIOUSLY known to conſiſt of a number of congregations, more or leſs, each having a Biſhop at their head, as their uniting principle, they might be ſaid to come together with ONE HEART, UP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON ONE DESIGN, though the congregations, of which they conſiſted, aſſembled for worſhip in fifty DIFFER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENT PLACES. But it ought not to be taken for granted, but firſt fully proved, that they were churches of this kind. Until this is done, it ought to be ſuppoſed, that they were SINGLE CONGREGATIONS; eſpecially, as this is the natural and moſt obvious meaning of all the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, in which the phraſe is uſed, and of the whole diſcourſe with which it is connected.</note> is
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:012009_0302_0F8942316B744868"/>
puffed up with pride.—Endeavor to meet frequently to praiſe and glorify God. For when you are often together in the SAME PLACE, the ſtrength of ſatan is broken.—Since EVERY ONE OF YOU BY NAME, with common conſent meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one faith, and one Jeſus Chriſt, breaking ONE LOAF, which is the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine of immortality."—This is proper language, if applied to a ſingle ſociety of
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:012009_0303_0F8942322BA23A20"/>
worſhipping Chriſtians; but not eaſily underſtood, if conſidered as directed to a dioceſan church; or, in other words, a church conſtituted of a number of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, more or leſs, incapable of meeting together in one place, and of having perſonal communion there in the public offices of religion. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in this way of application, quite unintelligible, unleſs we recur to that figurative mode of ſpeech, which was made neceſſary in AFTER AGES, when the church began to appear with the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent marks of antichriſt.</p>
               <p>HE writes to the church in Magneſia in theſe words, "When you meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let there be one prayer, one depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <note n="*" place="bottom">It has been urged, that the MIA PROSEUCHEE, and MIA DEEESIS, to which the "Magneſian church" is here exhorted, is no proof, that it did not conſiſt of a number of congregations, who, in DIFFERENT PLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CES, offered up their prayers to God. It is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, was it a PREVIOUSLY indiſputed fact, that this church did conſiſt of a number of congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, "the one prayer," and "one ſupplication," here ſpoken of, ought to be underſtood in a ſenſe that would comport with the nature of ſuch a church. And it is not denied, but that a ſenſe might be invented, in which there might be "one prayer," and "one ſupplication," though the church, that joins in it, ſhould aſſemble in an hundred different places. But what is all this to the purpoſe? It is nothing more than firſt ſuppoſing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proving, that this "Magneſian church" was of the DIOCESAN KIND, a complex body, made ONE by the union of its ſeveral parts with a Biſhop at its head, and then putting a ſenſe on theſe words, as grounded on this ſuppoſition. Such reaſoning, if uſed by others, would be called a meer begging the queſtion. Every one knows, that the church of England, though a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex body, made up of a conſiderable number of DIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CESSES, in each of which there are MANY worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping aſſemblies of Chriſtians, does, and muſt, join in "one prayer," and in "one ſupplication", becauſe they are obliged to uſe preciſely the ſame words in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic addreſſes to Heaven. And was it as certain, that the churches Ignatius writes to conſiſted of a number of worſhipping aſſemblies, more or leſs, who, in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, uſed the ſame words, no argument could be deduced from their "one prayer," and "one ſupplication," in evidence of their being ſingle ſocieties of Chriſtians. But the point in queſtion is, whether theſe churches were DIOCESAN, or SINGLE CONGREGATIONS; and it is a good argument, in proof of the latter, that they are called upon to meet together, that they may unite as ONE in prayer and ſupplication to God. They might, in ſome contrived ſenſe, be ſaid to do this, if they met in different aſſemblies; but it ought to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully proved, that they thus met, before this ſenſe can reaſonably be put upon the words. They are moſt naturally, eaſily, and obviouſly applicable to ONE aſſembly of Chriſtians, uniting in prayer to Almighty God: nor ſhould this ſenſe be departed from, unleſs evident neceſſity ſhould call for it.</note> one mind.—There is one Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, than whom nothing is more
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:012009_0304_0F894232EB7434E0"/>
excellent. ALL therefore run together as to ONE TEMPLE of God, as to one AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAR, as to one Jeſus Chriſt." Is this ſpeaking to a dioceſs, or a particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Chriſtians? If common ſenſe may be the judge, there can be no diſpute. The caſe is too plain to admit of it.</p>
               <p>HE thus beſpeaks the church in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, "It becomes you, as a church of God to chuſe a Deacon to go thither [to Antioch] on a divine embaſſy, that he
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:012009_0305_0F894233AAAAB2F0"/>
may rejoice with them, being ASSEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLED TOGETHER."—Let me aſk here, was it a dioceſs, or a ſingle congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, who, as a Chriſtian church, were to make choice of a meſſenger to go to Antioch? And was it the church of Chriſtians at Antioch, or a whole dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that this meſſenger was to rejoice with, when they had aſſembled together? No reaſonable anſwer can be given to theſe queſtions, but the right one; which is, that a ſingle congregation of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans only is addreſſed to. It follows in the next words, "Happy in Chriſt Jeſus is he who ſhall be thought worthy of ſuch a miniſtry: if ye be willing, ye may do this for the ſake of God; as the other NEIGHBOURING CHURCHES have ſent, ſome Biſhops, ſome Preſbyters, and ſome
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:012009_0306_0F89423552D3BB90"/>
Deacons." Is the mode of diction, here uſed, epiſcopalian, or congregational? Is it the practice of dioceſſes, or ſingle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of Chriſtians, to chuſe meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, and ſend them to other churches? When NEIGHBOURING churches, with each their own Biſhop, their own Preſbyters, and Deacons, are here ſpoken of, can it with propriety, or conſiſtency, be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that theſe neighbouring chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were dioceſſes? Is it not infinitely more natural and reaſonable, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by them ſingle congregations?</p>
               <p>HE gives the following exhortations in his epiſtle to Polycarp, Biſhop of the church at Smyrna, "Let not the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows be neglected, be THOU after God their guardian.—Let your aſſemblies be more frequent.—Enquire after ALL by name. Do not proudly overlook the MEN-SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VANTS, and the MAID-SERVANTS." Theſe inſtructions are highly pertinent, if Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp's church was only a congregation of Chriſtians at Smyrna; and he might, if he was faithful and diligent, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with them, to his own honor, and the ſpiritual good of the people who were his ſpecial charge. But if his church had
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:012009_0307_0F894235EB640070"/>
been of the dioceſan kind, what he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to is highly abſurd, becauſe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impoſſible to be put in practice. <note n="†" place="bottom">To evade the force of the argument here, it has been ſaid, by the author of "an original draught of the primitive church," p. 79, 80, that
<q>the advice to Polycarp was only to do what the primitive Biſhops always did, that is, to keep the names of every member of his church enrolledin, what the ancients called, the MATRICULA [liſt or regiſter] of their church. He is adviſed to "inquire out by name," that is, to get ſuch a regiſter of their names, that upon occaſion of any object of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity propoſed to him, or of any complaint, or appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, made to him about any within his cure or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, —he might, by means of this general MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRICULA, as the other Biſhops did, more directly know, how the caſe ſtood with them: and which was more than all this, the names thus enrolled in this ſacred record were perſonally entitled then to all the public interceſſions, and ſpiritual bleſſings obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the euchariſtical prayers, oblations, and ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the whole church.—And theſe were ſufficient reaſons for that apoſtolical Father [Ignatius] to mind a Biſhop of the church to be careful of keeping ſuch a neceſſary MATRICULA as this, and an effectual way for St. Polycarp to take care of the meaneſt and pooreſt members of his dioceſs. But as to the matter of one ſingle congregation being then under his care, and that he muſt "perſonally know them all by name," as one neighbour knows another, I think they no more imply it, than that Auguſtus Caeſar had but one town to command, and could know every ſubject he had, when (for many political reaſons) he cauſed them all to be enrolled, and required the ſtate of his empire to be brought in to him.</q>
Nothing more need be ſaid to all this than juſt to obſerve, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice here given to Polycarp is interpreted, not comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably to the age in which he lived, but to after ages, when Biſhops were at the head of churches known to be dioceſſes conſiſting of numerous aſſemblies of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Chriſtians. It is no wonder, if methods were now contrived for Biſhops to do thoſe duties of their office by OTHERS, which they could not perform in their own PERSONS. But it was not thus in the times of Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius. Biſhops were then "in labors more abundant," both public and private, in which they PERSONALLY exerted themſelves, and not by thoſe who were DEPU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIES under them. This did not become a cuſtom, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the love of eaſe, grandeur, and power, had got much the better of a zealous concern to promote the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the religion of Jeſus. There is therefore no ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable good reaſon to think, but that the advice here given to Polycarp was, PERSONALLY to acquaint him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his whole church, even the meaneſt members of it, that he might be able to ſuit his conduct, upon his own knowledge, to their ſpecial circumſtances. This is evidently that meaning of the words which naturally offers at firſt fight: nor can any other be put upon them, unleſs we needleſly, I may rather ſay unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, repair to times greatly diſtant from thoſe, in which Ignatius and Polycarp ſuſtained the office of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and take our idea of the advice here given, not from their times, but thoſe after-ones, when there was a viſible and ſignal difference, not only in the external circumſtances, but the known employment, of thoſe who were then Biſhops. There is no hint given, within the two firſt centuries, of the MATRICULA, this author ſpeaks of; or of a Biſhops acting in his cure, as Auguſtus Caeſar did, with reſpect to an enrollment of the people under his command. We muſt come down to thoſe ages, in which Biſhops more nearly reſembled Emperors, than they did in the days of Ignatius, before we ſhall find the leaſt reaſon to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret his advice to Polycarp, in a ſenſe different from that we have taken it in.</note> Beſides, what dioceſan Biſhop ever ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined it was his duty to inquire after ALL within his dioceſs by NAME, not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking even SERVANTS? moſt certainly no one among this kind of Biſhops ever performed, or endeavored to perform, this
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:012009_0308_0F894236AFB37CA0"/>
ſervice: whereas congregational Biſhops eſteem this their duty, and many of them are faithful in the practice of it, and their churches herefrom receive great benefit.</p>
               <p>IN theſe epiſtles, he ſpeaks of "one altar," or communion-table, of "one euchariſt;" of "breaking one loaf;" of
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:012009_0309_0F8942376D9F1F78"/>
his being "deprived of the bread of God who comes not to the "one altar." Theſe phraſes are all readily underſtood, upon the ſuppoſition, that Ignatius is writing to ſingle congregations; but otherwiſe there is no ſenſe in what he ſays, unleſs we make him ſpeak figuratively, when there is no need of it. A ſingle congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtians, ſuch an one as he is all along writing to, may come to "one altar," or communion-table; they may all "break" of the ſame ſacramental "loaf:" whereas, it is impoſſible, a Biſhop with his whole dioceſs ſhould literally do theſe things. They cannot be ſuppoſed
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:012009_0310_0F8942382C9E93B0"/>
to do them, without calling in the help of a ſtrong and bold figure. <note n="*" place="bottom">When Chriſtian churches, in proceſs of time, conſiſted of numerous aſſemblies, who had each their "altar," their "euchariſt," their ſacramental "loaf," the invention of man contrived a ſenſe, in which theſe "altars," "euchariſts," and "loaves," though NUMEROUS, might be called ONE; not indeed in the SAME, but DIFFERENT RESPECTS. But this metaphyſical dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity did not come into uſe, until long after the age of Ignatius: for which reaſon, it is deluſive, to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worſe, to apply theſe DIFFERENT RESPECTS to his "one altar," "one euchariſt," and "one loaf;" making them MANY, and yet ONE, in RESPECTS that were never ſo much as thought of in his day. I have never yet ſeen, within the two firſt centuries, nor until the art of man was evidently employed to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate corruption in the church of God, ſo much as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle inſtance of the mode of ſpeaking here applied to the truly primitive Ignatius. Let ſuch an inſtance be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, if any are able to do it. Until then, it will be to no purpoſe to tell us, that, in ancient times, there was only "one altar," and "one ſacramental loaf," in a Chriſtian church in ONE RESPECT, though in ANO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER there were ſome hundreds. It was not the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in truly primitive times, to MULTIPLY altars in ONE SENSE, and make them all but ONE in another. We may not look for this, until the church was far gone in antichriſtian corruption.</note>—But I may not enlarge. It would be an affront to the reader's underſtanding, ſhould I ſay any thing more upon a point ſo obviouſly evident.</p>
               <p>IT will perhaps be pleaded, it is a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtancial matter only, whether a
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:012009_0311_0F894238ECA90390"/>
Biſhop's church be great or ſmall. His eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential powers are the ſame, whether it conſiſts of a ſingle congregation only, or a number, more or leſs. This, as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, is a fundamental miſtake upon this head. Dioceſan, and parochial, or congregational, epiſcopacy eſſentially dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and are, in the nature of the thing, ſubverſive of each other. Scores, or hundreds, of parochial Biſhops muſt be deprived of the proper powers of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to make way for one ſuch dioceſan, as the Engliſh Biſhop is known to be. The plain truth is, dioceſan epiſcopacy is an invention of man, wholly a political conſtitution; and, I believe, eſſentially wrong: as it is impoſſible a dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſhould do the duty of the Biſhop's office, as deſcribed in the new teſtament, or even in the "epiſtles of Ignatius;" and the placing Biſhops at the head of large dioceſſes, inſtead of tending to ſerve the intereſt of Chriſt's ſpiritual kingdom, has been greatly hurtful to it, in all ages from the firſt riſe of antichriſt to this day. But however this be, which does not fall ſo directly within our preſent deſign, thus much is certain, that the IGNATIAN Biſhop was not a DIOCESAN one, and
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:012009_0312_0F894239AC43E0F0"/>
that, if his Biſhop is to be the pattern, or exemplar, there is not a Biſhop in all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland conformed to it. The Biſhops, or Paſtors, of parochial, or congregational, churches do much more nearly reſemble the Biſhop held out to view in "his epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles." —But to go on,</p>
               <p>IGNATIUS is not only ſilent about dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Biſhops, but the powers of GOVERN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT, ORDINATION, and CONFIRMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION, as appropriated to Biſhops of any kind, as an order diſtinct from Preſbyters.</p>
               <p>TO begin with GOVERNMENT. And here it ought to be obſerved, there was, in each of the churches Ignatius wrote to, a PRESBYTERY, or, in other words, a number of Preſbyters, more or leſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting a council, ſenate, college, or whatever other name any may pleaſe to give it, of which the Biſhop was the firſt, or chief, having ſome degree of ſuperiority beyond the reſt. But that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church, or of the Preſbyters of it, was SOLELY in his hands; or that his precedency was ſuch, as imported his being of another and higher ORDER than
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:012009_0313_0F89423A6CB246A8"/>
that of Preſbyters, he has no where given us to underſtand, in any of his epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles. Far from this, the general ſtrain of them all is, to lead us into the thought, that all church-affairs were to be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and governed, not by the SOLE POW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER OF THE BISHOP<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by the authority and voice of the PRESBYTERY joined to his. This is ſo obvious, that no one can eaſily read his epiſtles without perceiving it to be the truth of fact. The evidence is too glaring not to be ſeen at once.</p>
               <p>IT is acknowledged, Ignatius ſpeaks of Biſhops, in theſe epiſtles, in a high ſtrain of language, ſuch as calls for great can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to free it from, at leaſt, ſome degree of profanity. But the ſame may be ſaid, with as real truth, in regard of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which he ſpeaks of Preſbyters. Does he call Biſhops "the figure of the Father?" He goes on to call Preſbyters, "the council of God, and conjunction of the Apoſtles." Does he ſpeak of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop as "the grace of God?" He, in the ſame place, ſpeaks of the Preſbytery as "law of Chriſt." Does he repreſent the Biſhop as "preſiding in the place of God?"
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:012009_0314_0F89423B2CA565C8"/>
At the ſame time, he puts the Preſbyters "in the room of the apoſtolic ſenate."</p>
               <p>IT is acknowledged likewiſe, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently exhorts the churches to "obey their Biſhops," to be in "ſubjection to them." But he enjoins it on them, in like manner, to be "ſubject to their Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters." And the language in which he exhorts them to obedience and ſubjection to their Preſbyters, as well as Biſhops, is not only very ſtrong and preſſing, but ſo often repeated as to be really diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. "Attend to the Biſhop and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery;" follow the Biſhop, and the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters;" "obey the Biſhop, and Preſbyters;" be "ſubject to the Biſhop, and Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery," are injunctions, in theſe epiſtles, ſo frequent as to be, at once, both needleſs, and troubleſome.</p>
               <p>SHOULD it be ſaid here, he gives the church of Smyrna to underſtand, "it is not lawful without the Biſhop either to baptiſe, or make a love-feaſt;" and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly exhorts, "let none do any of thoſe things which belong to the church without the Biſhop." Should it be added,
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:012009_0315_0F89423BEB910F98"/>
he tells the church of Tralles, "it is neceſſary they ſhould act nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Biſhop." The anſwer is ready at hand; he as expreſſly tells the ſame church of Tralles, and in the ſame epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, "he that does any thing without the Biſhop, and Preſbyters, is not of a pure conſcience." And in his epiſtle to the Magneſians, the exhortation is, "Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do ye any thing without the Biſhop and Preſbyters." And again, "I exhort you to do all things in the concord of God." What is that? The explanation follows in the next words, "the Biſhop preſiding in the place of God, and the Preſbyters in the place of the apoſtolic ſenate."—"Let nothing divide you, but be united to the Biſhop, and thoſe that preſide among you." It ſhould ſeem, from theſe paſſages, and many more that might eaſily be mentioned, if there was need of it, as plainly evident as words can well make it, that the Ignatian churches were governed, not by the Biſhop only, but by a common college, company, or ſenate, of which he was the firſt in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority. If nothing was to be done without the Biſhop; neither was any
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:012009_0316_0F89423CAB6C4D70"/>
thing to be done without the Preſbyters. The voice of the Preſbytery was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as truly as the voice of the Biſhop. UNION was plainly the great thing Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius had at heart, and would promote in the management of all church-affairs, not only between the church, and the Biſhop; but between the Biſhop, and the Preſbyters; ſuch an union as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould be tranſacted without the Preſbyters, any more than without the Biſhop. His aim was, that there ſhould be the united authority and conſent of both Biſhops and Preſbyters, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of every church-affair.</p>
               <p>IT will, probably, be ſtill pleaded, Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius is ſo careful, in all his epiſtles, to diſtinguiſh Biſhops from Preſbyters, that we do not once find him calling Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Biſhops; or Biſhops, Preſbyters. Far from this, he has always appropriated theſe names to different perſons; from whence it may be fairly and juſtly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, that Biſhops were a diſtinct ſet of officers in the government of the church from Preſbyters, of an higher order
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:012009_0317_0F89423D6EE45178"/>
and veſted with ſuperior powers, ſuch as might not be exerciſed by Preſbyters.</p>
               <p>IT is granted, the names, Biſhop and Presbyter, are carefully uſed, in the Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian epiſtles, to ſpecify different perſons; but, at the ſame time, utterly denied, that this appropriation of theſe names imports ſuch a diſtinction between Biſhops and Preſbyters, as is contended for; that is, a diſtinction that ſuppoſes an higher and ſuperior order of officers in the church to that of Presbyters. That it imports ſome degree of precedency, or ſuperiority, is readily allowed; but why ſhould it be thought, unleſs to ſerve the epiſcopal cauſe, that this ſuperiority was a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority in ſuch ſpiritual powers as might not be exerciſed by Presbyters? Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, as we ſhall ſee preſently, has ſaid no ſuch thing; nor has he, in any of his epiſtles, appropriated any one of the powers proper to the miniſterial office to Biſhops, in diſtinction from Presbyters. Epiſcopalians, if any men in the world, ſhould be ſenſible of the inſufficiency of the argument, which would prove a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of ORDERS in the church, or of
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:012009_0318_0F89423E2AAA4590"/>
ESSENTIAL POWERS in its officers, from the appropriation of different names to different perſons, even though it was an appropriation that carried with it a very conſiderable degree of precedency and ſuperiority. There are, in the church of England, a great variety of officers, with appropriated names, who greatly differ in the degree of their ſuperiotity and inferiority; while yet, their eſſential pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as officers in the kingdom of Chriſt, are preciſely the ſame. The names, Arch-Biſhop and Biſhop, are appropriated ones, invariably pointing out different eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical officers, the one ſuperior in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and power to the other; and yet, Arch-Biſhops are the ſame order in the church with Biſhops, and they have no higher eſſential powers. To ſay that they have would make FOUR ORDERS in the church of Chriſt, inſtead of THREE; which would be a flat contradiction to the avowed doctrine of the church of England itſelf. Deans, Arch-Deacons, Prebends. Rectors, and Curates, are all of them officers in the Engliſh church, diſtinguiſhed from each other by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of theſe names, and ſeverally
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:012009_0319_0F89423FD3FA74C8"/>
placed above each other in certain degrees of ſuperiority; and yet, they are all veſted with exactly the ſame eſſential powers. In regard of their ORDER, they are the ſame officers in the church. In ſpecial, Rector and Curate are appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted names, and ſtand to ſignify different officers in the church, the one ſuperior in dignity and power to the other; while yet, they both ſuſtain the ſame rank, and are perfectly equal in the intrinſic inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted powers of their office. The Curate is commiſſioned to preach, baptiſe, and adminiſter the Lord's ſupper, as truly as the Rector; and may, as well as he, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any other part of duty that belongs to this order of officers in the church. But this notwithſtanding, the Rector is placed in as high a degree of ſuperiority above the Curate, as the Ignatian Biſhop is above a Preſbyter. The Rector may, in the plenitude of his own power, do any thing, within the limits of his office, in his own pariſh; the Curate can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but by his permiſſion. He can neither read prayers, preach, baptiſe, or perform any other public religious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but in conſequence of his conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:012009_0320_0F8942406B5FE5A8"/>
allowance. He is in truth the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Rector, and in perfect ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him; yea, liable, unleſs quite ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to his pleaſure, to be diſmiſſed from ſervice in this cure. Wherein, now, in what inſtance, was the Ignatian Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop more of a ſuperior to his Preſbyters? What greater power had he over them? I may rather ſay, how does it appear, that he either had, or ever exerciſed, ſo high a degree of power? The Rector may act, in his own pariſh, without the advice of his Curate; or, ſhould he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to aſk it, he may act in direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to it. It was not thus with the Ignatian-Biſhop. He, with the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of the church, made one common council, or ſenate; and it was, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own ſovereignty, but in agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the united voice of this council, that he acted. All the affairs of the church were managed in this way.—The Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor may, of his own meer arbitrary will, diſcharge the Curate from any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſervice in his pariſh. Ignatius's Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop had no ſuch power. Moſt certainly it is no where ſaid that he had, either in his "epiſtles," or elſewhere. Let me
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:012009_0321_0F8942412E189D08"/>
aſk now, why ſhould it be thought, that the Ignatian Biſhop's ſuperiority above a Preſbyter muſt import a ſuperiority of ORDER, or ESSENTIAL POWERS, any more than a Rector's ſuperiority above his Curate ſhould import the ſame thing? If a Rector's office is ESSENTIALLY the ſame with his Curate's, notwithſtanding his ſuperiority in power, why muſt it be otherwiſe in the caſe of Ignatius's Biſhop? The plain truth is, all the pre-eminence and ſuperiority that Ignatius aſcribes to his Biſhop may as eaſily, and as juſtly, be accounted for, without the ſuppoſition of his being of an ORDER diſtinct from, and ſuperior to, Preſbyters, as the Rector's ſuperiority above his Curate. If, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſubjection of his Curate to him, they are both of the ſame order in the church, and partake of the ſame eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential powers; why may not the ſame be ſaid, with equal truth and juſtice, of the Ignatian Biſhop and his Preſbyters? Eſpecially, if it be remembered, and duly conſidered, that no one miniſterial pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is mentioned by Ignatius, in any of his epiſtles, but what might be as well exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by Preſbyters as Biſhops. And this leads to</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="313" facs="unknown:012009_0322_0F894241EC355E18"/>THE next power of Biſhops, ſaid to be diſtinguiſhing, and eſſential; which is that of ORDINATION. And who could think, conſidering the vaſt labor that has been expended in ſupport of the credit of Ignatius's epiſtles, and the perpetual uſe Epiſcopalians make of them, in defence of their cauſe, but that he had expreſſed himſelf, upon this head, ſo clearly, poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and fully, as to leave no further room for diſpute, at leaſt, whether it was a FACT, in his day, that Biſhops, and they only, communicated holy orders? Eſpecially, as the validity of goſpel-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations is made to depend upon this method of communication. And yet, we are as much at a loſs for evidence in favor of this article, eſſentially connected with the very being of Chriſtianity itſelf, as if Ignatius had never wrote any one of his epiſtles. He can no more be brought as a witneſs to teſtify in behalf of EPISCOPAL-ORDINATION, either in point of FACT, or RIGHT, than any of his predeceſſors, contemporaries, or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors within the two firſt centuries. By only reading Arch-Biſhop Wake's "tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his epiſtles," one would not
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:012009_0323_0F894242ACA1D3B8"/>
ſuſpect he had ſo much as tranſiently ſaid any thing that looks like ORDINA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION; but this he may have done in his "epiſtle to the Magneſians," wherein he tells them, "It becomes you not to uſe your Biſhop too familiarly upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his youth, but to yield all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to him, according to the power of God the Father: as alſo I perceive your holy Preſbyters do; not conſidering <hi>his age, which indeed to appearance is young.</hi>"—Theſe laſt words are in the original, <hi>tên phainomenên neoterikên taxin</hi>; which ſome have tranſlated, <hi>his appearing youthful ordination.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Thus I find them tranſlated by Cotelerius, in Le 'Clerc's edition of his "apoſtolical Fathers." His words are, "apparentem puerilem ordinationem." In Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Uſher's publication of the "Ignatian epiſtles," from the latin copies he found in England, the verſion is, "apparentem juniorem ordinem;" which is thought to refer to his being "veſted with holy orders while apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a young man." I will not oppoſe this interpretation of the words, being willing Epiſcopalians ſhould make the moſt of what can be ſuppoſed to be ſaid by Ignatius.</note> If this is a verſion that gives the true meaning of Ignatius, he has once, in ſeven epiſtles, mentioned ORDINATION; but without ſaying, how it was performed, or by whom; whether by a Biſhop of ſome other church, or by
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:012009_0324_0F8942436B3B7D58"/>
the Preſbyters of this at Magneſia. The ſhort of the matter is, he is totally ſilent, in all his epiſtles, upon this moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and eſſential power of the Biſhop; never once ſaying, or ſo much as inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, that it was his PECULIAR RIGHT to confer holy orders, or that they were, in FACT, ever conferred by Biſhops, in diſtinction from Preſbyters.</p>
               <p>IT will, perhaps, be pleaded here, Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius has expreſſly ſaid, "it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful without the Biſhop to baptiſe, or make a love feaſt;" and again, "it is neceſſary nothing ſhould be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Biſhop." If ſo, then ſurely there ought to be no ordination without him. This is the obvious and evident implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his words.</p>
               <p>THE anſwer is plain and eaſy. Should this reaſoning be allowed to be juſt and valid, it will not follow from it, that the power of ordination was appropriated to Biſhops, any more than the adminiſtration of baptiſm, or making a love-feaſt. The moſt that can be made of it is, that no church-affair ſhould be managed without
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:012009_0325_0F8942442BA0C320"/>
the conſent, the preſence, or permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Biſhop; but with his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, for aught that appears to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Preſbyters might ORDAIN, as well as baptiſe, or adminiſter the Lord's ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. And it is, with me, paſt all doubt, that the affair of ORDINATION, as truly as other religious offices, were managed, not by the BISHOP ALONE, but by the PRES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BYTERY, of which he was primus inter pares. For Ignatius is as expreſs in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "nothing ought to be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the PRESBYTERS," as that "nothing ought to be done without the BISHOP."</p>
               <p>THE laſt peculiar power of Biſhops is that which relates to CONFIRMATION. But it unluckily happens, that the "Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natian epiſtles" are, if poſſible, more ſilent about this, than the foregoing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle. They neither mention the name, or the thing intended by the name. And as they appear to be utter ſtrangers to any ſuch cuſtom in the church of Chriſt, as that of confirmation, it would be in vain to look to them for evidence, that it belonged to Biſhops, to them only, to them in diſtinction from Preſbyters,
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:012009_0326_0F894244EC9F5700"/>
to perform this extraordinary piece of ſervice.</p>
               <p>UPON the whole, notwithſtanding Biſhops are ſo often mentioned by name by Ignatius; notwithſtanding the high ſtrain of language in which he ſpeaks of them; notwithſtanding all the claims he makes for them, and of obedience and ſubjection to them;—he is ſo far from being a competent witneſs to the GRAND FACTS we are upon, that he either ſays nothing relative to them, or that which is really deſtructive of them. It is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as words can well make it, that the Biſhops he ſpeaks of, in his epiſtles, were of the PAROCHIAL, not the DIOCESAN kind: from whence it follows, that the Rector, Paſtor, or Biſhop of a SINGLE CONGREGATION of Chriſtians, ſuch an one as the churches in New-England, and the Proteſtant Diſſenters at home, have at their head, is much more like to the IG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NATIAN Biſhop, than any DIOCESAN in Great Britain. From the whole tenor of what he offers upon the head of government it alſo moſt obviouſly appears, as we have ſeen, that it was, and ought to be, manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:012009_0327_0F894245AC477AD0"/>
not by the Biſhop as SOLE MONARCH in the church, but by a common ſenate, or college, of which he was nothing more than primus inter pares, being veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with no higher ESSENTIAL POWERS than the other members of the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. And as to ORDINATION, and CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIRMATION, the appropriated right of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, he ſays not a word. Could we, in conſiſtency with a due regard to truth, ſay, that the "epiſtles of Ignatius" were unſuſpectedly genuine and incorrupt, we ſhould be as ſtrenuous in ſupporting their authority, as the Epiſcopalians; and for this reaſon in ſpecial, becauſe they are, in many reſpects, a real and great ſervice to our cauſe; and, in every reſpect, much more ſerviceable to us, than to them in the diſpute betwixt us.</p>

            <p>PAPIAS, Biſhop of Hierapolis, a city in Aſia, is ſaid by Irenaeus to have been "an hearer of John, and compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Polycarp." He unqueſtionably meant by John, the writer of the goſpel, and the three epiſtles under this name. Dr. Cave places him at the year 110; but he is ſaid by others, equally learned, to have flouriſhed about the years 115 and 116. He has ſometimes been mentioned as a martyr; but, as neither Euſebius or Jerom ſay any thing of this, it may be conſidered as a fact not to be depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on. The time, as well as manner, of his death is uncertain. Irenaeus and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius both ſpeak of him as having wrote "five books" entitled "the explication of our Lord's diſcourſes;" but nothing remains of them except a few fragments
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:012009_0329_0F8942472E134DA8"/>

Valeſius, in his note here, repreſents this encomium to have been an interpolation, as it is wanting in the verſion of Ruffinus, and in three Greek manuſcripts he uſed; and becauſe it contradicts what he afterwards ſays of him. Dr. Grabe labors, in his" ſpicilegium patrum," to take off the force of this arguing of Valeſius. But ſo far as I am capable of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if this is not an interpolation, Euſebius is inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively inconſiſtent with himſelf.</note> though, in another, <note n="†" place="bottom">H.E.

And ſo far as we may judge from thoſe parts of them that have been handed down to us, this ſeems to be the truth; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that he was too apt to give heed to any pious tales that were reported to him. Euſebius writes of him, <note n="‡" place="bottom">H. E. Ibid.</note> that he has "told ſtrange things, pretending to have received them by tradition from the Elders." He ſpeaks of it alſo <note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> as a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of his, that "Chriſt ſhall corporally reign here on earth for the ſpace of a thouſand years, after the reſurrection of the dead; occaſioning divers eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal perſons, who regarded his antiquity, to fall into this error;" particularly nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing "Irenaeus."</p>

               <pb n="321" facs="unknown:012009_0330_0F894248D8D01CA0"/>DU-PIN, as I imagine, has very juſtly characteriſed Papias in the following words;—
<q>He was a good man, but very credulous, and of mean parts, who delighted much in hearing and telling ſtories and miracles.</q>
He adds,
<q>ſince he was exceedingly inquiſitive, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe any thing that was told him, it is not to be admired that he hath divulged diverſe errors, and extravagant notions, as the judgments of the Apoſtles, and hath given us fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous narratives for real hiſtories: which ſhews, that nothing is ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in matters of religion, as light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to believe, and too greedily to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, all that hath the appearance of piety, without conſidering in the firſt place how true it is.</q>
            </p>
            <p>No mention is made, in the preſerved "fragments" of Papias's writings, of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; nor any thing ſaid tending to illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the FACT we are upon, unleſs it ſhould be thought the following paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, cited by Euſebius in the 39th chapter of his 3d book, may be improved to this purpoſe.</p>

               <q>I ſhall not think it grievous to ſet down in writing, with my interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the things which I have learned of the Elders or Preſbyters, [<hi>para tôn Preſbuterôn</hi>] and remember as yet very well, being fully certified of their truth — If I met any where with one who had converſed with the Elders, [<hi>Preſbute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rois</hi>] I enquired after the ſayings of the Elders; [<hi>Preſbuterôn</hi>] what Andrew, what Peter, what Philip, what Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, or James had ſaid; what John, or Matthew, or any other diſciples of the Lord were wont to ſay; and what Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, or John the Preſbyter [<hi>o Preſbute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros</hi>] ſaid: for I am of the mind, I could not profit ſo much by reading of books, as by attending to thoſe who ſpake viva voce.</q>
            </p>
            <p>EUSEBIUS obſerves, in this ſame book and chapter, " that he mentions two Johns, the former of whom he ranks with Peter, James, Matthew, and the reſt of the Apoſtles, "evidently pointing out the Evangeliſt;" and another John, whom he does not place with the Apoſtles, but joins with Ariſton, expreſſly calling him Elder, <hi>ton Preſbuteron.</hi>"—This Papias, as
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:012009_0332_0F89424A2C5194C0"/>
Euſebius further ſpeaks, declares that "he received the ſayings of the Apoſtles from thoſe who converſed with them;" and that he was "a hearer of Ariſton, and John the Preſbyter, <hi>tou Preſbuterou.</hi>"— He adds, in the ſame writing, "he [this Papias] delivers many other narratives of the beforementioned Ariſton concerning the words of our Lord, and traditions of John the Preſbyter [<hi>Preſbuterou.</hi>] To which we ſhall ſubjoin a tradition, which he has concerning Mark, who wrote in the goſpel, in theſe words; "and this, the Preſbyter or Elder, [<hi>Preſbuteros</hi>] mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing John, ſaid.—</p>
            <p>QUADRATUS. Much is ſaid of this Father by writers greatly diſtant from the age in which he lived. He is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſpoken of, in the martyrology of the Greeks, as "a man of great learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and knowledge; and repreſented, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having grievouſly ſuffered by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of perſecutors, as one that received the crown of martyrdom." But the moſt authentic account we have of him is that which is given us by Euſebius. He ranks him among "the famous men in the reign of Trajan, who died in 117."
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:012009_0333_0F89424AEB566BE0"/>
He ſpeaks of him as having been "fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored, together with the daughters of Philip, with the gift of prophecy." He places him among thoſe, who were "in the firſt ſucceſſion of the Apoſtles." <note n="*" place="bottom">H. E. Lib. 3.

Cap. 23.</note> "he remembered Quadratus, who, after the martyrdom of Publius, was conſtituted Biſhop of Athens." It is diſputed, whether the Biſhop, here point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by this Denys was the perſon we are treating of, or another of the ſame name. The Doctors, Grabe and Cave, are fully of the opinion, that it was our Quadratus. <note n="‡" place="bottom">"Spicilegium patrum," part ii. p. 125.

            <p>HE is no where mentioned as having wrote any thing, but "an apology for the Chriſtian faith." Euſebius's account of it is this; <note n="‖" place="bottom">H E. Lib. iv, Chap. 3.</note>—"When Trajan had
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:012009_0334_0F89424BAC296B80"/>
reigned twenty years wanting ſix months, Elius Adrianus ſucceeded him in the empire, to whom Quadratus dedicated an apology which he had wrote in defence of the faith, as certain malevolent men had endeavored to vex and moleſt the Chriſtians. This book is yet extant among diverſe of the brethren, and a copy of it remaineth with us; in which there are conſpicuous marks of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and true apoſtolic doctrine of the man." This work has long ſince been loſt. Only one ſmall fragment of it is preſerved, in which there is nothing obſervable, unleſs it be that he ſpeaks of thoſe who "had been healed, and raiſed from the dead, as living not only while our Savior had his abode on earth, but a long time after his aſcention; yea, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them to his day."</p>
            <p>ARISTIDES flouriſhed about the ſame time. He is celebrated by Euſebius, <note n="*" place="bottom">H. E. Ibid.</note> as "a faithful man, and one that labored for the furtherance of religion." He adds, "he publiſhed an "apology" (as Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dratus did before) for the "Chriſtian faith,"
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:012009_0335_0F89424C6C817E60"/>
with a "dedicatory epiſtle" to Adrian the Emperor; which book of his is kept by many, even to this day." And it was in being in the days of Jerom; for he writes both of this "apology," and its author, in theſe words; "Ariſtides was an eloquent Athenian Philoſopher, who, when he changed his religion, did not alter his profeſſion. He preſented unto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Adrian, at the time when Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dratus did, a volume in the form of an "apology," wherein he produced the proofs of our religion; which, being ſtill extant, ſhews the learned how excellent a writer he was." He ſays again, "that this work was full of philoſophical notions, and that it was afterwards imitated by Juſtin." It has long been buried in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion. Dr. Grabe has not been able, in his "ſpicilegium patrum," to gratify the curious with ſo much as the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt fragment of it.</p>
            <p>AGRIPPA, ſirnamed Caſtor, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with the above Fathers. His abilities, as a learned man, and his zeal in defending the truly apoſtolic doctrine, are ſaid to have appeared in a book he wrote againſt the "hereſy of Baſilides,"
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:012009_0336_0F89424D2C973110"/>
which he fully confuted, after having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected his fraud. The beſt account of him is handed to us by Euſebius, who, ſpeaking of thoſe who had contended for the apoſtolic eccleſiaſtical doctrine, makes mention <note n="*" place="bottom">H. E. Lib. iv. Cap. 7.</note> of "Agrippa Caſtor's ſtrong and noble confutation of Baſilides, in which he diſcloſed his fraudulent and deceitful arts." This Baſilides, as he goes on to relate from Agrippa, "had written 24 books on the Goſpels, and that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſeveral Prophets, who were never in the world, to whom he attributed extraordinary names, as Barſabas and Barcoph, on purpoſe to amuſe the minds of his auditors. He affirmed alſo, that this heretic taught his followers, "that it was a thing indifferent to eat ſacrifices that were offered to idols; that it was lawful to renounce the faith in a time of perſecution; and that, in imitation of Pythagoras, he impoſed ſilence on his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples for the ſpace of five years." There are no remains of ſo much as a ſingle fragment of Agrippa's confutation of this wild and erroneous writer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="328" facs="unknown:012009_0337_0F89424DEC8D3660"/>HEGESIPPUS. He is thought to have been a convert from the Jewiſh to the Chriſtian religion. Euſebius ranks him among the firſt who lived, and flouriſhed, after the death of the Apoſtles. He ſpeaks of himſelf, <note n="*" place="bottom">Euſeb. H. E. Lib. iv. Cap. 22.</note> as having been in Rome a number of years, Du-pin ſays, from 165 to 180. He is the firſt Father that compoſed an entire body of eccleſiaſtical hiſtory. This he is ſaid to have done, dividing it into "five books," ſtiled "commentaries" by Euſebius and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom; wherein he relates the principal occurrences in the church, from the death of Chriſt to his own time. This work was penned, according to Euſebius, "in a ſimple ſtile;" and, as Jerom ſpeaks, "in imitation of the manner of thoſe whoſe lives he wrote." There are no remains of it, but ſome fragments preſerved by Euſebius in his eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, and one more by Photius from Stephen Gobar.</p>
            <p>SOME have greatly lamented the loſs of the writings of this Father; imagining, had they been preſerved, we ſhould have been fully certified of the true ſtate of
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:012009_0338_0F89424EAB3F3A60"/>
the church, in thoſe days, particularly as to its officers and government. But they might, poſſibly, have been diſappointed. His account of James, the juſt, recorded by Euſebius, <note n="*" place="bottom">H.E. Lib. ii. Cap. 24.</note> in his own words, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently carries with it the air of a fabulous romantic ſtory. And ſome of the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned circumſtances, relative both to his life and death, are far from exhibiting the real truth. If we may judge from this narrative, the world has not ſuffered much by the loſs of his works.</p>
            <p>BESIDES the five books beforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, five more are attributed to him; containing "an hiſtory of the wars of the Jews," and of the "taking the city of Jeruſalem," which have been often printed, and, among other places, at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, with the notes of Galterius. But there are few writers, who think it worth while ſo much as to mention theſe works, they are ſo evidently of the ſpurious kind. Du-pin ſays, "It is certain, they do not belong to Hegeſippus; and has given ſuch reaſons, in ſupport of this aſſertion, as muſt be allowed to be ſufficient, if not more than ſo, by all capable judges in matters of this nature.</p>

            <p>IT may be proper to remark, upon theſe paſſages, that nothing is contained in them that, either directly or implicitly, affirms the FACT contended for by Epiſcopalians. They will not pretend, that the powers of ORDINATION, CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIRMATION, or GOVERNMENT, are here appropriated to Biſhops, or ſaid to have

The diſpute is, what is their rank, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in the church? What the ſpecial powers they are veſted with? Not a word is ſaid by Hegeſippus, in the above paſſages, from whence this can be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; unleſs an argument ſhould be fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the SUCCESSION in the church of Rome, of which he here ſpeaks.

            <head>JUSTIN MARTYR.</head>
            <head type="sub">His character, writings, and teſtimonies from them, with obſervations and remarks.</head>
            <p>JUSTIN the Philoſopher, afterwards the Martyr, was born in Flavia Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, a city of Samaria in Paleſtine, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently called Sichem, and in our Savior's day Sichar. He accordingly ſpeaks of himſelf as a Samaritan, in his "diologue with Trypho." Neither, ſays he, "did I fear to offend my own countrymen, the Samaritans, when I offered my apology to Caeſar." His father, whoſe name was Priſcus, ſon of Bacchius, took early care to have him well educated; and, being of an inquiſitive ſtudious turn, he ſoon made himſelf maſter of the philoſophy of that day, in all its various inſtitutions; of which his writings give abundant
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:012009_0343_0F8942532B5CC8C8"/>
proof. He is called one of the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the more early writers of the eaſtern church.</p>
            <p>IN his younger years, probably before his converſion to Chriſtianity, he travelled abroad for his further proficiency in knowledge. He went particularly to Egypt, "the ſtaple-place," as Dr. Cave calls it, of all the myſterious and recondite parts of learning, and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly viſited by thoſe, who would make a figure in the world, as Adepths in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. He was certainly at Alexandria; for there it was, as he himſelf informs us, that he received an account of the "ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty's tranſlation" of the Hebrew-bible, and was carried to the "cells" in which it was ſaid they performed that celebrated work; which, probably, his curioſity, together with the reports he might have had of theſe matters, by being among the Jews, had induced him particularly to enquire after.</p>
            <p>HE went through his philoſophical ſtudies under ſeveral maſters. The firſt was a "Stoic;" the ſecond, a "Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetic;" the third a "Pythagorean;"
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:012009_0344_0F894253EDFF44C0"/>
and the laſt a "Platoniſt," whoſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he preferred, and indeed was ſo well pleaſed with that he ordered his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct by them, until he became a convert to the Chriſtian faith, which he ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſteemed "the only certain and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful philoſophy."</p>
            <p>THE preciſe time of his converſion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be aſcertained. Dr. Cave, and Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemont place it at the year 132 or 133. But whenever he was converted, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the lives of Chriſtians, and the firmneſs, reſolution, and undaunted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, with which they faced, and encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, death in the moſt hideous forms, had a very powerful influence in effecting this anchge of his religion: ſo we are informed by himſelf, in the account he gives of it to the Roman Emperor, in one of his apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies. Says he, <note n="*" place="bottom">Apol. I. p. 50.</note>
               <q>For my own part, being yet detained under the "Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic inſtitutions," when I heard the Chriſtians traduced and reproached, and yet ſaw them fearleſſly ruſhing upon death, and venturing upon all thoſe things that are accounted moſt
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:012009_0345_0F894254AC358140"/>
dreadful and amazing to human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I concluded with myſelf, it was impoſſible that thoſe men ſhould wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in vice, and be carried away with the love of luſt and pleaſure. For what man, that is a ſlave to pleaſure and intemperance, can chearfully bid death welcome, which he knows muſt put a period to all his pleaſures and delights; and would not rather by all means endeavor to prolong his life as much as is poſſible, and to delude his adverſaries, and conceal himſelf from the notice of the Magiſtrate, rather than voluntarily betray and offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to preſent execution?</q>
—His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning here is certainly juſt: nor is it ſtrange, that ſuch extraordinary ſtrength of mind in Chriſtians to bear up under the greateſt dangers, and undergo the moſt cruel ſufferings and deaths, ſhould give him favorable thoughts of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they profeſſed, and the truth of which they ſo chearfully ſealed with their blood. Marvellous effects have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the hearts of thoſe, who have been ſpectators of the horrid cruelties which have been exerciſed towards the diſciples of Chriſt, and the amazing
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:012009_0346_0F8942556C839588"/>
patience, meekneſs, fortitude, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, with which they endured them.</p>
            <p>HAVING profeſſed himſelf a Chriſtian, he is ſaid to have led an eminently vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and holy life. It is certain, he ſtood up nobly in the Chriſtian cauſe; and it ought always to be remembered to his honor, that, in a time of hot perſecution, when a man's only owning himſelf to be a Chriſtian was ſufficient to expoſe him to death, he ſhould be able to put on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution enough to become an advocate for Chriſtians, a public pleader of their cauſe; as he appears to have been by his two "apologies" in their behalf.</p>
            <p>HE was at Rome, in the reign of "Antonine the pious," when the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution began to break forth; and he then wrote an excellent "apology" in their defence, and preferred it (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the inſcription) to "Antoninus Pius the Emperor, and to his two ſons Verus and Lucius, to the ſenate, and by them to the whole people of Rome." This he did about the year 150, ſays Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin. Tillemont and Dr. Grabe think it was not preſented before this year.
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:012009_0347_0F8942562B37C820"/>
Dr. Cave fixes the time at 140. Pagi and Baſnage at 139; whoſe opinion, ſays Dr. Lardener, "appears to me the trueſt, for the reaſons alledged by thoſe learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men."</p>
            <p>THIS
<q>apology (ſays Du-pin) is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the <hi>ſecond,</hi> but is really the <hi>firſt</hi>; whereas the other common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called is actually the <hi>ſecond</hi>; nay, if we may give credit to the teſtimony of Euſebius, was not preſented to the Emperor, and ſenate, until the time of Marcus Antoninus the Philoſopher, and ſucceſſor of Antoninus Pius.</q>
In this the moſt learned writers are now generally agreed.</p>
            <p>WHAT Juſtin had principally in view, in this "apology" was,
<q>to repreſent the injuſtice of the proceedings againſt the Chriſtians; for that, without any enquiry into the true merits of their caſe, they were adjudged to death as the moſt impious, and flagitious of all men; only their being called by the name of Chriſtians, being accounted ſufficient for their condemnation.—He juſtifies them againſt the calumnies

that had been wickedly caſt upon them; offering what was abundantly ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to clear up their innocency. He particularly ſhews, that they were not <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> as they had been characteriſed; becauſe, though they worſhipped not the gods of the heathen, yet they knew the true God, and performed that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which was agreable to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alſo, that they looked not for an earthly kingdom (as was ſuſpected of them, and for which cauſe the Romans were fearful of their rebellion), but one that was divine and heavenly, on which account they were willing to run the hazard, and ſuffer the loſs, of this preſent life, which they never could do, were they poſſeſſed with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of reigning in this world. He likewiſe wipes off thoſe blaſphemies wherewith the Chriſtians were load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their worſhipping a "crucified man," by ſuch as were altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the myſtery of the croſs of Chriſt; ſhewing that the religion of ſuch as worſhipped the gods was but a vain and ſordid ſuperſtition. He, moreover, largely diſcourſes of Chriſt, unfolds many things relative to his
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:012009_0349_0F894257AC8AA238"/>
ſuffering on the croſs, and by convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arguments proves the truth of the Chriſtian faith; not forgetting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the harmleſs lives of Chriſtians, their exact obſervance of chaſtity, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, peaceableneſs, gentleneſs, and love, even to their very enemies. In fine, he lays before them the manner of Chriſtians in their celebration of the ſacred rites of baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper, and their other obſervances; which he choſe to do, becauſe of the baſe ſlanders that had been raiſed, and ſcattered abroad, concerning them; as if horrible and abominable things were practiſed by them in their ſecret meetings upon ſuch occaſions.</q>
The "apology" is wrote with a freedom and boldneſs, becoming a ſerious, zealous, and powerful advocate in pleading the cauſe of truth and righteouſneſs. And it had its deſired ſucceſs. For the Emperor, moved by this apology, as well as by other notices he had received, gave order that the Chriſtians henceforward ſhould be treated in a regular and more gentle way; as appears from his "epiſtle to the commonality of Aſia," preſerved by Euſebius, in the ivth book, and 13th
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:012009_0350_0F8942586C927A08"/>
chapter of his eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, by Juſtin himſelf in his ſecond apology, and from them, by other writers. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh reader may meet with it, in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage he underſtands, in Dr. Cave's lives of the Fathers.</p>
            <p>THE "ſecond apology," ſome few ſentences of which are loſt, does not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſuch variety of matter: it is a complaint or remonſtrance directed to the Emperor, repreſenting the injuries that were unjuſtly offered to the Chriſtians; and making anſwer to the things object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt them. In this "apology," he deſcribes the ſnares that were laid for him by a certain Cynic Philoſopher, named "Creſcens," through whoſe procurement he expected to ſuffer death. "I expect, (ſays he) by ſome of thoſe who falſely call themſelves Philoſophers, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, or brought to the ſtake or tree; it may be by this Creſcens, a lover of popular applauſe, and of inſolent arrogance; a man unworthy to be called a Philoſopher, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he publicly witneſſes the things which he knoweth not, as if the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians were atheiſtical and impious; and all to be in favor with, and pleaſe, the multitudes whom he hath deceived."</p>

               <pb n="342" facs="unknown:012009_0351_0F8942592C8362C0"/>IT was not long before it happened according to what he had ſuggeſted. For we are told, by Tatian, a diſciple of Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, that this ſame "Creſcens" procured his death, which he ſuffered, ſays Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin, in the ſixth year of the reign of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Antoninus, the Philoſopher; that is, in the year of Chriſt 160. Dr. Cave ſays, in 164. Tillemont, in 167 or 168. Fabricus ſuppoſes he was born in 89, and ſuffered martyrdom in the 74th year of his age, A. D. 163. Dr. Grabe is of the ſame opinion as to the time, both of his birth, and death.</p>
            <p>HIS name is often mentioned with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor by the ancient Chriſtian writers. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian calls him "an admirable man." Methodius ſays, "he was not far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the Apoſtles in time, or virtue". Euſebius mentions him as one that was "famous, not long after the Apoſtles, an embracer of the true philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, and well ſtudied and exerciſed in the doctrine of the Gentiles." Photius ſays, "he was well acquainted with the Chriſtian philoſophy, and eſpecially with the heathen; rich in the knowledge of hiſtory, and other parts of learning.
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:012009_0352_0F894259EACD9C70"/>
But he took little care to ſet off the native beauty of philoſophy with the ornaments of rhetoric. For which reaſon, his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, though weighty and learned, want thoſe allurements which are apt to attract the vulgar." He adds, "He ſhewed himſelf a Philoſopher not only in words, but in his actions, and his <hi>habit.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Says Dr. Cave, "Though he laid aſide his former profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he ſtill retained his ancient garb, preaching and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending (as Euſebius, and Jerom report) the Chriſtian religion under his old "philoſophic" habit, which was the "pallium," or "cloak," the uſual badge of the Greek Philoſophers, and which thoſe Chriſtians ſtill kept to, who, before their converſion, had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Philoſophers. So Jerom tells us of Ariſtides, the Athenian Philoſopher, that, under his former habit, he became Chriſt's diſciple; and Origen of Her<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

This long continued a cuſtom; and might perhaps give riſe to that diſtinction of habit, that has prevailed, through ſo many ages, among the ſeveral orders in the Roman church.</note>

                  <p>I SHALL only add concerning this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that, though he appears to have been a man of conſiderable learning, and very converſant with the ſacred writings, yet his reaſoning ſometimes will not bear being cloſely examined; nor are his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of the ſcripture always ſuch, as would be admired in this age of the world. He does not ſeem to have been ſtudious of art in ſetting off his diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. His manner is more like a rigid Philoſopher, than an eloquent orator. He is often dry, and ſometimes obſcure. Nor would it do him wrong, ſhould it be ſaid, that he was not without defect as to his religious ſentiments. His notion of the "millenium" was too groſs and carnal. His conceit, "that ſome of the ſinning angels had too free communication with women; begetting Daemons, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing by this means, all kind of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs among men," is quite extravagant. He may be thought to have leſſened the

glorious efficacy of the croſs of Chriſt by declaring, "that they that lived accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the principles of natural reaſon, as Socrates, Heraclitus, and others, might be called Chriſtians." He ſeems indeed to ſuppoſe, they were "ſaved by having lived up to the law of nature." This no meer man ever yet did; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whoever are ſaved, muſt be ſaved upon the foot of grace through Chriſt: and in this way, why ſhould it be thought incredible, that ſome among the heathen may have been ſaved; though they knew not the plan upon which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy?</p>

               <p>APOL. I. p. 95.—"We bring him that is perſuaded, and agrees with us in his ſentiments, to THE PLACE where the brethren, ſo called, ARE ASSEMBLED for common prayers both for themſelves, the baptiſed [illuminated, <hi>tôu photisthentos</hi>] perſon, and all others every where; which prayers we perform with an intenſe mind, that we may be counted worthy, and may be ſaved with an everlaſting ſalvation. Prayers being ended, we mutually ſalute one another with a kiſs. Bread, and a cup of water and wine, are then brought to the PRESIDENT OF THE BRETHREN [<hi>tô proeſtôti tôn adelphôn:</hi>] and he, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, offers [ſends up] praiſe and glory to the Father of all things, through the name of the Son, and the holy Spirit: and he is long in giving thanks, for that we are thought worthy of theſe bleſſings. When he has ended prayer, and giving of thanks, the whole people preſent ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify their approbation, by ſaying, amen. Amen, in the Hebrew language means, "let the thing be, or come to paſs."

               <p>APOL. ib. p. 97. "And upon Sunday, all thoſe who live in cities and country-towns or villages belonging to them, meet together, <note n="*" place="bottom">The author of "an original draught of the primitive church," in anſwer to the author of the "enquiry into its conſtitution," takes notice of this paſſage as quoted ONLY in p. 17 of the "enquiry;" where the words are, "on Sunday all aſſemble together in the ſame place," leaving out, "throughout cities and countries:" upon which, the writer of the "draught" triumphantly ſays, p. 44, "Why do we think he left out theſe words, which were in the middle of the ſentence? Why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe words of the holy Martyr would undeniably ſhew it to be a general account of Chriſtian practice, in all places of the Chriſtian world; whereas our enquirer's buſineſs was to make it a particular inſtance of a ſingle Biſhop's dioceſs, and that all the members of it, both "in city and country," met in one and the ſame place toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at once; and if it were ſo, then "cities and countries," in the plural number, would be too much for him: for if they proved any thing in that ſenſe, they would prove that "cities and countries," indefinitely taken, wherever there were any Chriſtians in them, met all together every Sunday, and made but one congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." But if this remarker had turned his readers, as he would have done, had he acted a fair part, to p. 42 of the "enquiry," he would at once have made it glaringly evident, that the anſwer he has here given was nothing to the purpoſe. For the paſſage in Juſtin is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted to the full, both in the original Greek, and an Engliſh tranſlation. The words, as quoted in Greek, are theſe, "TEE TOU EELIOULEGOMINEE EE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MERA, PANTÔN KATA POLEIS EE AGROUS ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NONTÔN EPI TO AUTO SUNELEUSIS GINETAI;" the very words quoted, by our remarker, in correction of p. 17 of the "enquiry." And the Engliſh tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe words, in this 42d p. of the "enquiry," is the ſame with that the remarker himſelf has given of them, only inſtead of "cities and countries," the "en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry" has it, "in city and country." But who does not at once ſee, that, conformably to the ſentiment of Juſtin, it is perfectly indifferent, whether his words are tranſlated "cities and countries," or "city and country?" The word AGROS may properly be taken to ſignify that part of a COUNTRY which is adjacent to ſome CITY, whoſe towns or villages belong to it. The "enquiry" might underſtand the word in this ſenſe; ſuppoſing that Juſtin's meaning was, that all the Chriſtians, whether they lived in a city, or ſome village in the country near to it, and a territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it, aſſembled together every Sunday. And in this ſenſe of the word, AGROS, it is preciſely the ſame thing, whether the tranſlation be, "in cities and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries," or "in the city and country." And the ſame may be ſaid, ſhould we ſuppoſe, with our remarker, that the thought Juſtin intended to communicate, was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that all the Chriſtians in the Roman empire, or elſewhere, throughout the world, "in cities or countries, aſſembled together on Sunday; for he muſt mean, not in ONE BODY, but in DISTINCT CONGREGATIONS. And if they thus aſſembled, it muſt be EPI TO AUTO, "in the ſame place," that is, not the whole complex body, but each part of which that body did conſiſt. This, without doubt, was the meaning of Juſtin, and of the author of the "enquiry," in the words he has quoted from him. And, in this view of them, they are a clear and ſtrong proof of what they were introduced to make evident; which was, that, in Juſtin's day, according to his account, the Biſhop's charge was a ſingle congregation of Chriſtians, who uſually aſſembled together on Sunday, or met in the ſame place, for the performance of thoſe religious ſervices he particularly relates. And they are as expreſs and full to the purpoſe, as could be deſired; eſpecially if it be remembered, that theſe religious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies are directly ſpoken of by Juſtin, as having each of them their Praeſes, Biſhop, Paſtor, Prime-Preſbyter, or whatever other name any may pleaſe to give him; who, when the Chriſtians were thus together in their ſeveral places of worſhip, preached to them, adminiſtered the ſacraments, and did whatever elſe was proper to his office, at ſuch times. This is certainly Juſtin's repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the matter, unleſs "ALL the Chriſtians, throughout cities and countries," met together EVERY SUNDAY, in ONE GENERAL BODY; which our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker juſtly ſays is "too much" to be his meaning: nor could it poſſibly be the truth of fact. And it is moſt obviouſly remarkable, not a word is ſaid, or diſtantly hinted, as if there was any officer in the Chriſtian church ſuperior to theſe Preſidents, or that any of them acted under him, as placed at their head; which muſt be deemed an unpardonable omiſſion in Juſtin, if there had been, in his day, ſuch an eccleſiaſtical officer: eſpecially if it be conſidered, that he was now writing to the "Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, the ſenate, and the whole body of the Roman peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple," on purpoſe to give them a fair and impartial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the nature, deſign, and tendency of the meeting together of Chriſtians, with thoſe who had the ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency of their religious affairs.</note> and the writings of the
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:012009_0359_0F89425FEADDB1A0"/>
Apoſtles and Prophets are read, as the time will allow. And the Lector being ſilent, the PRESIDENT [<hi>o Proeſtôs</hi>] ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhes, and exhorts to an imitation of thoſe things that are comely. We then all in common riſe up, and pour out prayers. And, as we have related, prayers being ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the PRESIDENT [<hi>o Proeſtôs,</hi>] as above, gives thanks ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ability; and the people

               <p>
                  <pb n="354" facs="unknown:012009_0363_0F894262F211A850"/>IT will obviouſly be perceived, by a curſory reading only, that no evidence can be collected, from theſe teſtimonies, in favor of the FACT pleaded for by Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians. Not ſo much as the word, Biſhop, is to be found in them.—Not a ſyllable is liſped, importing a threefold order of officers in the church, Biſhops, Preſbyters, and Deacons.—No inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is given, not ſo much as indirectly or implicitly, that Biſhops were officers ſuperior in their order to Preſbyters.— In ſhort, ſo far is ORDINATION, or CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIRMATION, from being appropriated to Biſhops as their excluſive right, that not the leaſt hint is ſuggeſted about the one, or the other. And this is the more worthy of notice, as a very particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is exhibited of the obſervation of the Lord's day, of the adminiſtration of baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper, and of their being adminiſtered by the PRESI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENTS OF THE BRETHREN. Surely, Juſtin would not have omitted to ſpeak of ſo important a matter as the office and diſtinguiſhing powers of Biſhops, if he had thought of them as ſome Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians do at this day. He had as fair an opportunity to mention theſe things, as
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:012009_0364_0F894263AF476C90"/>
the other; yea, if Biſhops, in his day, had been thoſe eſſentially neceſſary offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the church, that they are made to be in this, he might with as much, nay, with much more, reaſon have brought them into view. He certainly did not know of ſuch Biſhops as are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for. Had there been any of this kind, in his day, it was altogether inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable in him, while pleading the cauſe of Chriſtians, to let it ſuffer, by ſaying nothing of that, which is now thought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the very being of Chriſtianity itſelf.</p>
               <p>IT may be pertinently added to what has been ſaid, that the PRAESES, PRAE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POSITUS, or, in Engliſh, PRESIDENT of the brethren, was nothing more than the Paſtor of a SINGLE flock, or congregation. For he is deſcribed as "leading in the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of a whole church, preaching to them, adminiſtring the Lord's ſupper, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſecrated elements to thoſe who could not be preſent at the time of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration." And it is remarkable, not a word is ſaid of his being placed over Preſbyters as their ruler and Governor. Inſtead of this, he is called the PRESI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENT OF THE BRETHREN. And Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and Deacons are the TWO ORDERS
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:012009_0365_0F8942655752A078"/>
in the church he particularly ſpecifies; meaning by Preſidents, thoſe officers that were, in this age, promiſcuouſly called either Biſhops, or Preſbyters: or, at moſt he could intend nothing more than <hi>Prime-Preſbyters,</hi> diſtinguiſhing them as ſuch by the application of this name to them. Moſt certainly, he could not mean Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in the impleaded ſenſe; for then there would be only Biſhops and Deacons in the church: neither could he mean Preſbyters in diſtinction from Biſhops; for, in this view, there would be no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. The plain truth is, Juſtin knew of but TWO INSTITUTED ORDERS of church-officers, the firſt of which he calls PRESIDENTS, meaning hereby thoſe officers that were then called both Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Preſbyters; the other, DEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CONS. And herein he agrees, not only with the apoſtolical writers, but with all his predeceſſors to the day in which he lived, who mention only TWO ORDERS of officers in the church; the firſt of which they promiſcuouſly call either Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops or Preſbyters, ſometimes the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and ſometimes the latter.</p>

            <p>THE above named Fathers were all writers. I have, with Du-pin, placed them after Juſtin, and before Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, and in the ſame order; which, perhaps, is as exact as any they could be put in. There was no real need of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe writers to view; as the works of moſt of them are loſt, and thoſe of the other have nothing that falls in with our preſent deſign: but it was thought beſt not to paſs them over, without ſaying what might be proper to give the reader a juſt idea both of them, and of their writings.</p>

               <pb n="358" facs="unknown:012009_0367_0F894266AB42F380"/>MELITO. He was Biſhop of Sardis, in Aſia, and ſome ſuppoſe him to have been the "Angel of the church" there, to whom one of the epiſtles in the "apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypſe" is directed; but without the leaſt probability of truth. He flouriſhed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Dr. Cave, about the year 170. Du-pin brings him down a few years lower. Euſebius introduces Polycrates ſpeaking of him in that ſtile, "Melito the Eunuch." It is generally ſaid, he is thus ſpoken of on account of his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary chaſte and ſelf-denying life in celibacy, for religion's ſake. But no good reaſon has yet been given, ſo far as I have ſeen, why the literal meaning of the word ſhould be departed from. Jerom tells us, from one of Terrullian's works, "that he was eſteemed a Prophet by many of the people," that is, a man inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt. He alſo informs us, from the ſame writer, that his "genius was eloquent and oratorical." He himſelf, as Euſebius writes in a quotation from him, tells us, "that he had travelled into the eaſt, and had compiled in order the books of the old teſtament, as they were then and there received:" upon which, he <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> "we have wrote ſix books of
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:012009_0368_0F8942676B136F70"/>
commentaries." The catalogue he has here exhibited contains the ſame books, with thoſe we now acknowledge as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical; only Eſther and Nehemiah are not inſerted, for what reaſon I know not, unleſs they were not eſteemed, in that day, as equal in authority with the other books. Dr. Lardner ſays, "This is the firſt catalogue of the books of the old teſtament, recorded by any Chriſtian writer."</p>
            <p>THIS Father is exceeded by few, if any, in his day, as to the number of books which he wrote. Euſebius has given us the following catalogue of them." <note n="*" place="bottom">H. E. Lib. vi, cap. xxvi.</note> "Two books concerning eaſter." One concerning "the rule of right living, and of the Prophets." Another "of the church." Another "of the Lord's day." Alſo one book "concerning the nature of man." Another of "his formation." Another "of the obedience of the ſenſes to faith." Moreover, a book "of the ſoul, and body, and mind." Another "of baptiſm." Another "of the truth, faith, and the generation of Jeſus Chriſt." One
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:012009_0369_0F8942682C748228"/>
alſo "concerning propheſy." Another "of hoſpitality." A book entitled, "of the key." Another, "of the devil." Another "of the revelation of John." Another "of the incorporeal God," or, as others tranſlate the original words, "of God incarnate." <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Lardner has not tranſlated the title of this book, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſays he, "the meaning of it is doubtful." Says Du-pin, "It is expreſſed in Greek, PERI ENSÔMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOU THEOU, "of God incarnate," or "inveſted with a body." Others expound this paſſage after another manner, ſuppoſing, that he maintained that God was "corporeal." This laſt is not the proper ſignification of the Greek word. However, Origen, cited by Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret, in queſ. 20, in Exod. ſays, "That Melito wrote a book concerning God, that he was corporeal." Eccleſ. hiſt. p. 55. note c.</note> Finally, his "little book to Antoninus;" undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meaning the "apology" he addreſſed to him, in behalf of the ſuffering Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. The date of this apology, in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius's "chronicle," with which the "Alexandrian" agrees, is 170. But Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemont places it in 175; Baſnage in 177, which latter date Dr. Lardner thinks comes neareſt the truth.</p>
            <p>How long this celebrated Father lived, and in what manner he died, cannot be ſaid at this day. Thus much only we
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:012009_0370_0F894268EC478688"/>
find, that Polycrates, in his "epiſtle to the church of Rome," ſpeaks of him, as "buried in Sardis, waiting for a viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Heaven, when our Lord ſhall raiſe him from the dead." <note n="*" place="bottom">Euſeb. H. E. Lib. v. cap. 24.</note>

            <p>TATIAN. He was born in Aſſyria, where he was inſtructed in the theology of the Grecians. The time of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to the Chriſtian faith is uncertain; but it was effected, at leaſt in part, by reading the ſacred books, and by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the corruptions and abſurdities of Paganiſm. Of theſe things, he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us himſelf in his "diſcourſe againſt the Gentiles," the only one, among the many he wrote, <note n="†" place="bottom">Euſebius ſays, "He left to poſterity in writing a great number of commentaries." Jerom, in his book of il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious men, expreſſes it thus, "He left an infinite number of books."</note> that is ſtill remaining. He is ſuppoſed to have publiſhed it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he left the catholic opinions; Dr. Lardner thinks, between 165 and 173. He appears, from this performance, to have been a diligent ſtudent in prophane learning. It is indeed filled with it; though the matters he treats of are not
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:012009_0371_0F894269ABF40788"/>
methodiſed in the niceſt manner. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius calls this work "an elaborate one;" and ſays, "it is the moſt elegant and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of all his writings." He was Juſtin's diſciple, and lived in communion with the church during his life; but afterwards he embraced a variety of very abſurd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and became the founder of a new ſect, called "Encratites," or "Continents." He condemned the uſe of wine, and diverſe ſorts of fleſh, denied the lawfulneſs of marriage, the ſalvation of Adam, and, what is much worſe, the reality of Chriſt's ſufferings: beſides all which, he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the doctrine of Valentinus's "in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible aeons," and aſſerted, with Marcion, that there are "two Gods." Euſebius ſpeaks <note n="*" place="bottom">H. E. Lib. iv. cap. 29.</note> of his having "patched toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a kind of harmony and collection of the goſpels, which he called "dia teſſaron, of the four;" which, ſays he, "is ſtill in the hands of ſome." Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret, a writer in the fifth century, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this ſame book, ſays, as I find him quoted by Dr. Lardner, he, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tatian,
<q>compoſed a goſpel, which is called "dia teſſaron, of the four,"
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:012009_0372_0F89426A6C6DAC28"/>
leaving out the genealogies, and every thing that ſhews the Lord to have been the ſeed of David according to the fleſh; which has been uſed, not only by thoſe of his ſect, but alſo by them who followed the apoſtolical doctrine, not perceiving the fraud of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but ſimply uſing it as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious book. I have met with more then two hundred of theſe books, which were in eſteem in our churches; all which I took away and laid aſide in a parcel, and placed in their room the goſpels of the four Evangeliſts.</q>
It was a report, in Euſebius's day, that this Tatian had the "aſſurance to alter the words of the Apoſtle [meaning without doubt the Apoſtle Paul,] pretending to mend the compoſition, or order of his ſtile." Dr. Mills ſeems to think, this "altering the words of the Apoſtle" was nothing more than ſome interlineary or marginal explanations; and that the "correcting the Apoſtle's ſtile" was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſing his words, in the margin, in a more natural order, without doing, or intending to do, any prejudice to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal text. This is as candid an account as can be given of this matter; but it
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:012009_0373_0F89426B2C6CF490"/>
does not well agree with the character of Tatian, whoſe defection Euſebius <note n="*" place="bottom">H. E. Lib. iv. cap. 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> aſcribes to his being "ſo puffed up with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſelf-eſtimation, as to imagine he ſurpaſſed all others." Beſides, having mentioned Severus, and his followers, called Severiani, and ſaid, "they revile the Apoſtle Paul, reject his epiſtles, deny the acts of the Apoſtles;" he adds, "their firſt author was Tatianus." How he died, is not known. Du-pin ſays, it was about the time that Irenaeus wrote his volume againſt hereſies; which, perhaps, is not far diſtant from the exact truth. Nothing is to be met with in this writer relative to the ſubject we are upon: or if there was, its credit would be much wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, as, inſtead of "holding faſt the truth," he had "turned aſide to fables."</p>
            <p>ATHENAGORAS. Two pieces of his are extant, "an apology for the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans," and a "diſcourſe on the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on." In the former of theſe, he ſpeaks of himſelf as an "Athenian," and a "Philoſopher." And this is the moſt we certainly know of him, except what
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:012009_0374_0F89426BEC51CB70"/>
may be collected from his writings. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius and Jerom ſay nothing of him, or of any work of his; nor is he mentioned by any of the ancients, until we have got down to Epiphanius, who has quoted a paſſage from him. There is indeed ſome account of him by Philip Sidetes (a writer in the fifth century) in a fragment of his "Chriſtian hiſtory," publiſhed by Dodwel. But the learned in theſe matters do not give much credit to it. Says Dr. Lardner, "this hiſtory of Philip has no great character given it by Socrates, or Photius, who had read it."</p>
            <p>THE "apology" is inſcribed to "Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Aurelius Antoninus, and Lucius Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius Commodus." Critical writers differ in their judgments as to one of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to whom this apology is addreſſed, and accordingly put a different date to it. Some think it was addreſſed to Marcus Antoninus, and his adopted brother and colleague in the empire, Lucius Verus, who died in 169, before which time this apology muſt have been wrote. Others think it was inſcribed to Marcus Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus, and his ſon Commodus. Thoſe of this latter opinion place it about the
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:012009_0375_0F89426CAE2AE0D0"/>
year 177 or 178. In this apology he wipes off the aſperſions that had been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly thrown on Chriſtians; affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and deſcribing, their holineſs in all manner of converſation.—He aſſerts that the devils were ruined through love to women.—He admits free-will in its utmoſt latitude.—He commends virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but condemns ſecond marriages, calling them "honeſt adultery."—He treats of the reſurrection, and the laſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>HIS diſcourſe of the "reſurrection" was probably wrote after the apology; and what ſtrengthens the probability is, that, having towards the concluſion of the apology fallen upon the affair of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, he poſtpones a more full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon it to ſome other time. He endeavors to prove, in this work, that a reſurrection from the dead, far from being impoſſible, is extremely credible. His ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are taken rather from reaſon than the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>THE genuineneſs of neither of theſe pieces are called in queſtion, though the author of them had ſo little notice taken
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:012009_0376_0F89426D6A555B48"/>
of him in primitive antiquity. Dr. Lard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſays, "He is a polite writer, and wrote in attic Greek; but he has rendered his ſtile leſs agreeable by frequent parentheſes."</p>
            <p>HERMIAS. He is called "a Chriſtian Philoſopher," and wrote a piece, entitled, "Irriſio," an imperfect copy of which is ſtill remaining. It contains a ſeries of ſatyrical reflections on the wild opinions, and extravagant notions, of the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophycal Gentiles. Neither this work, or its author, are mentioned by any of the primitive Fathers; nor can it be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined when he wrote it. However, ſays Du-pin "It is not to be doubted but that he is ancient, and that he lived before the pagan religion was extirpated." He adds, "This little book was printed by itſelf, in Greek and Latin, at Baſil, anno domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, 1553."</p>
            <p>THEOPHILUS. He was born of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then parents, and was himſelf an heathen in religion, until his converſion to Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. When this was effected, or by what ſpecial means, we know not; but, having profeſſed himſelf a Chriſtian, he ſo adorned his character, in this view of
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:012009_0377_0F89426F0FE09340"/>
it, as to be thought worthy of the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate at Antioch, in which he ſucceeded Eros, in the 8th of Marcus Antoninus, or 168th of our Lord.</p>
            <p>HE did not confine himſelf to the work of preaching to the people of his particular charge, but endeavored by writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo to ſerve the common cauſe of Chriſtianity. He wrote, as the account is in Euſebius, <note n="*" place="bottom">H. E. Lib. iv. cap. 24.</note> "three books to Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycus, containing the elements of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;" another "againſt the hereſy of Hermogenes;" another "againſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion." There are alſo, ſays he, "other books of his concerning the rudiments of religion." Jerom, in his book of illuſtrious men, beſides mentioning the above writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſays, "I have read ſome commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries upon the goſpel, and proverbs of Solomon, which go under his name; but they do not appear to me to anſwer the ſtile and elegance of the beforementioned writings." There are ſtill extant, "ſhort commentaries or allegories upon the four goſpels, in four books," with the name of Theophilus to them. Some have thought they were his; but without good reaſon.
<pb n="369" facs="unknown:012009_0378_0F89426FAB0B3210"/>
It is generally conceded, that they are the work of a much later writer. If theſe were the "commentaries" Jerom ſaw, he obſerved their difference in ſtile and elogance from the other works of Theophilus; for which reaſon, it may be ſuppoſed, he was not the author of them; eſpecially, as they were unknown to Euſebius. The only writings of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus ſtill remaining, and accounted ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, are his "three books to Antoly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus." They are ſuppoſed, by learned men, to have been wrote not long before his death, that is, in the beginning of the reign of Commodus, about 181.</p>
            <p>THE firſt of theſe books may not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly be called a diſcourſe between him and Autolycus, in anſwer to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of that heathen Philoſopher, in which he treats of the nature of God, and what we call his attributes or perfections. The ſecond book is wrote with a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate deſign to convince Autolycus of the falſhood of heatheniſm, and the truth of Chriſtianity. And here he mentions the opinions of the heathen concerning their gods, repreſenting their abſurdity, and pointing out the contradictions there were among their Philoſophers and Poets
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:012009_0379_0F8942706B386078"/>
upon this head. He enlarges upon the creation of the world; the hiſtory of Moſes, which he ſhews to be the oldeſt and trueſt of any in the world, and that they had extracted many things from the holy ſcriptures. In the third book, after having proved the writings of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to be contrary to good ſenſe, and good manners, he vindicates the Chriſtians, by ſetting their character in a fair and amiable light. At the end of theſe books, he has added an hiſtorical chronology from the beginning of the world. Du-pin ſays, <note n="*" place="bottom">Eccleſ. hiſt. 2d cent. p. 67.</note>
               <q>It is apparent from this little epitome, how well this author was acquainted with prophane hiſtory. Theſe books are filled with a great variety of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſquiſitions relative to the Poets and Philoſophers; though there are but few things that relate immediately to the doctrines of the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: not that he was ignorant of them, for it appears, from ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, that he was very ſkilful in theſe matters; but, as he compoſed theſe books chiefly to convince a pagan, he inſiſts, in proof of our religion, rather upon arguments from without, than
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:012009_0380_0F8942712AFFD3E8"/>
by expounding its doctrines.</q>
He adds, "The ſtile of theſe books is elegant, and the turn of thought agreeable. Whoever reads them, cannot doubt but that the author was a very elegant man."</p>
            <p>APOLLINARIUS or APOLLINARIS.</p>
            <p>HE is ſaid to have been Biſhop of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapolis, a city in Phrygia. He flouriſhed in the reign of Marcus Antoninus, and wrote ſeveral books, the titles only of which remain at this day. Euſebius's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of him is this." <note n="*" place="bottom">H. E. Lib. iv. cap. 27.</note> "Though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny volumes were wrote by Apollina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius; yet theſe only came to our hands. "An oration to the beforenamed Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror" [Marcus Antoninus]. "Five books againſt the Gentiles." "Two books of the truth." "Two books againſt the Jews." And ſuch books as he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards wrote againſt the "Phrygian he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy." Jerom, in "catalogo," omits the books againſt the Jews. Neither are they found, ſays Du-pin, in the "verſion of Ruffinus, nor even in ſome Greek manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of Euſebius." Photius, having read his "books againſt the Gentiles," as alſo thoſe "concerning piety and truth,"
<pb n="372" facs="unknown:012009_0381_0F894271EC60FA28"/>
which were extant in his day, ſays of him, <note n="*" place="bottom">Cod. 14.</note> "that he was much to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both for his doctrine and ſtile."</p>
            <p>DIONYSIUS of Corinth. He was Biſhop of the church in this city, and flouriſhed, according to Dr. Cave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about the year 170: herewith agrees Euſebius, who ſays, in his "cronicon," the 11th of Marcus Antoninus, which is 171 of Chriſt. The laſt mentioned author, ſpeaking of him in his "eccleſiaſtical hiſtory," ſays, <note n="†" place="bottom">Lib. iv. cap. 23.</note> "he not only made the people of his own charge partakers of his divine labors, but the Chriſtians in other countries alſo, by the "catholic epiſtles" which he wrote and ſent to many churches." He then particularly mentions theſe epiſtles, and in the following order. The firſt, to the "Lacedemonians;" containing an inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the right faith, and an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to peace and unity. The ſecond, to the "Athenians;" tending to excite their faith, and ſtir them up to a life of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the rule of the goſpel. The third, to the "Nicomedians;" wherein he oppoſes the hereſy of Marcion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with the ſtandard of faith. The fourth, to "the church of Gortyna, and
<pb n="373" facs="unknown:012009_0382_0F894272AB12F270"/>
all thoſe of Crete;" in which he great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commends Philip their Biſhop, for that the church, committed to his charge, was ſo beautified with virtue and generoſity. The fifth, to the "church at Amaſtris, with the churches throughout Pontus;" in which he explains diverſe paſſages of ſcripture, laying down ſeveral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts concerning marriage and virginity. The ſixth, to the "Gnoſſians:" in which he adviſeth Pinytus their Biſhop, not to impoſe on the Chriſtians the grievous burden of vowed chaſtity as a matter of neceſſity. The ſeventh, to the "Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans," directed to Soter their Biſhop; in which they are commended for their Chriſtian love and charity. An "eighth epiſtle" is here mentioned as extant in that day, which was wrote, and ſent, to "Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophora, a moſt faithful ſiſter." Of theſe epiſtles there are now no remains, except a few fragments in Euſebius. Jerom, in his book of illuſtrious men, after an enumeration of theſe epiſtles, ſays, the author of them was "a man of great eloquence, and induſtry; and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed under Marcus Antoninus and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus." When, and how, he died is uncertain. He has been numbered among
<pb n="374" facs="unknown:012009_0383_0F8942736BC68330"/>
the Martyrs; but without authority from the records of the more ancient Fathers.</p>
            <p>Dr. GRABE has been able to gather only two ſmall fragments, from all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, of the writings of this Dionyſius; in one of which, ſpeaking to the church of Rome, he calls "Soter their bleſſed Biſhop." This I mention, not as though I thought it of any importance in the preſent diſpute; but becauſe I was not willing to omit noticing ſo much as the name, Biſhop, in any writing, or frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a writing.</p>
            <p>PINYTUS. We are informed by Dionyſius of Corinth, <note n="*" place="bottom">Euſeb. H. E.

            <p>BARDESANES. He lived about the ſame time with the beforenamed Fathers, was a Meſopotamian by birth, a very eloquent man, and ſkilful in logic. He publiſhed, in the Syrian tongue, "dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,

together with other books againſt Marcion, and other grand heretics." Theſe were tranſlated by certain learned men (a great number of which were his diſciples) into the Greek language. His "dialogue," in ſpecial, entitled, "of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny,' was tranſlated, and dedicated to Antoninus the Emperor. Euſebius ſays, <note n="*" place="bottom">H. E. Lib. iv. cap. 30.</note> "it was of great force." He adds, "He wrote many other books, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the perſecution raiſed in thoſe times.

            <p>The EPISTLE of the churches of VI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENNE and LYONS. Nothing is to be met with in this epiſtle, upon the ſubject of theſe papers, unleſs it be that Pothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus is ſpoken of as "Biſhop of Lyons;" for which reaſon I ſhould have paſſed it over in ſilence, but that it is ſo valuable a piece of antiquity. It contains a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of the grievous ſufferings, and cruel deaths, of a great number of Chriſtians, particularly in the cities of
<pb n="377" facs="unknown:012009_0386_0F894275ABF83DA8"/>
Vienne and Lyons. The facts are here related, not in a romantic ſtrain, but with ſuch ſimplicity of language as to render them at once credible, and greatly affecting. Dr. Lardner ſays of this epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, "It is the fineſt thing of the kind in all antiquity." It is wrote in the ſpirit, and after the manner, of the apoſtolic age. The time of the perſecution, which occaſioned this letter, is diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But Euſebius <note n="*" place="bottom">H. E. Lib. v. proaem.</note> has with great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion placed it in the ſeventeenth year of Marcus Antoninus, the 177th of our Lord. And in this date the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed do acquieſce.</p>
            <p>IT appears from this epiſtle, a very great part of which is preſerved in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius's "eccleſiaſtical hiſtory," that vaſt numbers of Chriſtians were called, in this perſecution, to ſuffer the loſs of all, yea, even their very lives, and in the moſt formidable ſhapes, for the ſake of their religion. It is aſtoniſhing, that any of the human race ſhould ſo far put off hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, as to be able to inflict thoſe torments which the poor Martyrs now endured;—baniſhed from their houſes-forbid

to ſhew ſo much as their heads— vilified, mocked, and inſulted—beaten with ſtripes—hurried from place to place—plundered, ſtoned, impriſoned, there treated with outrage and fury, and then carried forth to execution in all the cruciating ways that malice could invent: nor was this all: for, as the words are in this epiſtle,
<q>After the bodies of the bleſſed ſaints had been, in every way, ſpitefully and ſcornfully treated, and ſuffered to be ſix days unburied, they were burned to aſhes; and the aſhes they gathered, and ſcattered in the river Rhodanus, ſo that not a jot of them ſhould any longer remain on the earth. This they did, that they might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come God, and hinder the reviving of the ſaints; leſt, as they ſaid, there ſhould be any further hope of the reſurrection, whereof (ſay they) the Chriſtians being fully perſuaded, bring among us a new and ſtrange religion; contemning pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and haſtening themſelves cheerfully to death. Now, ſay they, let us ſee, whether they can ariſe, and whether their God can deliver them out of our hands.</q>

            <p>THE perſons from whom Irenaeus deſcended are now unknown; and ſo is the particular place where he was born. He might probably be a Greek, and of the country of Aſia. It is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture of ſome, that he was a native of Smyrna, or of ſome not far diſtant town, from his early acquaintance with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Polycarp. He was certainly, in his younger years, an attendant on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of this apoſtolical Father, whoſe doctrine was ſo deeply impreſſed on his mind, that he firmly retained, even to old age, the remembrance of it. Thus much he has told us himſelf, in his
<pb n="380" facs="unknown:012009_0389_0F894277EAF7ADF8"/>
epiſtle to Florinus, quoted by Euſebius. <note n="*" place="bottom">H. E. Lib. v. cap. 20.</note>
Says he,
<q>I well remember the place where Polycarp ſet when he taught; his going out, and coming in; his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and courſe of life; the figure and proportion of his body; the ſermons which he preached to the multitude; the relations he gave of his converſe with the Apoſtle John, and others who ſaw the Lord: how he remembered their ſayings, and what he heard from their mouths, touching the Lord, of his power and doctrine; reciting precepts, and all things conſonant to holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, out of their mouths (I ſay) who had ſeen with their eyes the word of life in the fleſh. Theſe things, at that time, I diligently marked, and painted, not in paper, but in my heart; which continually, through the grace of God, I ponder and meditate.</q>
—This mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts his antiquity; which further appears from that frequent mode of diction, in his book againſt hereſies, "as I heard from a certain Preſbyter, who heard from thoſe who ſaw the Apoſtles." Euſebius takes particular notice of this. Says he, <note n="†" place="bottom">H. E. Lib. v. cap. 8.</note> "Irenaeus has mentioned the ſayings of
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:012009_0390_0F8942798F7A3FF0"/>
a certain apoſtolical Preſbyter without telling his name, and puts down his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the ſcriptures." Who this Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter was cannot be aſcertained. It might be Papias, whom he had ſeen, and heard, and has ſometimes pointed out by name. It might be Pothinus, his predeceſſor, or ſome other ancient Father. He may from hence be juſtly ſtiled a man, if not of apoſtolical times, yet near to them; as having converſed with thoſe who had ſeen the Apoſtles, and were ſucceſſors to them. When he took upon him the profeſſion of Chriſtianity is not known; though it is probable, he way indoctrinated in its principles from his earlieſt days, and not made a convert to them from the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries and ſuperſtitions of Paganiſm.</p>
            <p>THE time of his going to France can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exactly be fixed; nor is the ſpecial oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion that led them there now known. But he ſoon became famous in that part of the world, and did much ſervice for the intereſt of Chriſt, particularly in the church at Lyons. Pothinus, the Biſhop, or Praeſes of this church, in the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under Antoninus Verus, which now greatly raged in France, was brought
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:012009_0391_0F89427A2B00CDE8"/>
before the civil tribunal for his adherence to the cauſe of Chriſt, and, after a moſt barbarous beating, was thrown into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon almoſt breathleſs, and in about two days died there in the 90th year of his age. Irenaeus was thought the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per perſon to ſucceed the aged Martyr, and was accordingly choſen by the church of Lyons their Biſhop in his room, or, in other words, their Prime-Preſbyter.</p>
            <p>THE ſtate of their religious affairs was now unhappily difficult, not only on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that heavy perſecution which was ſcarcely blown over, but alſo through the buſy endeavors of ſome cunning deceivers to corrupt the pure doctrine of Chriſt embraced among them. The Valentinian heretics had by this time ſpread themſelves as far as France, and bewitched, among others, a number of eminent women, with their wild and extravagant opinions. One Marcus was particularly a deceiver and abuſer of the weaker ſex. Upon this occaſion, Irenaeus, as became a pious faithful Miniſter of Chriſt, diligently labored to put a ſtop to the further ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this contagion, and to recover thoſe who had been infected. And having,
<pb n="383" facs="unknown:012009_0392_0F89427AEB46ACA0"/>
under the favor of Heaven, ſecured his own charge, he was greatly ſerviceable to other churches, as occaſions therefor were offered in Providence. The church at Rome, being in danger of being led aſide by two of her Preſbyters, Florinus and Blaſtus, he wrote to both theſe perverters of the truth, with great propriety and ſtrength; as we have the account from Euſebius. <note n="*" place="bottom">H. E. Lib. v. cap. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE Aſian churches likewiſe were much troubled with the prophecies and deluſians of Montanus, Alcibiades, and Theodotus: upon which the Gallican churches, either of their own accord, from chriſtian love and ſympathy, or at the requeſt of their Aſian brethren, ſent Irenaeus to them with their letters, that he might comfort them under their trial, confirm them in the truth, and aſſiſt them in the confutation of theſe heretics, who had roſe up among them.</p>
            <p>IN his time alſo, the controverſy about the circumſtances of keeping eaſter was unhappily revived by Victor, Biſhop of
<pb n="384" facs="unknown:012009_0393_0F89427BAC4E73F8"/>
Rome, a furious hot headed bigot, and increaſed to an heighth that was like to bring confuſion to the churches. Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, not unaffected with the unchriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian heats and animoſities that were now too prevalent, thought it his duty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to promote love and peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the contending parties, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their difference in ſentiment upon this point. He accordingly wrote, in the name of the brethren in France, with great pertinence, to Victor of Rome. A large fragment of this letter Euſebius has preſerved, <note n="*" place="bottom">H. E. Lib. v. cap. 23.</note> in which Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus ſays,
<q>Though he himſelf ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the feaſt of eaſter on the Lord's day, according to his [Victor's] manner, yet he could not approve of the bitter zeal he diſcovered againſt others for the obſervation of a cuſtom after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they had received from their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors.</q>
He tells him,
<q>that differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cuſtoms had been uſed in churches, not only in the celebration of the feaſt of eaſter, but alſo of faſts, and in diverſe other matters of practice.</q>
And, in fine, he reminds him,
<q>That his predeceſſors did not contend with the
<pb n="385" facs="unknown:012009_0394_0F89427C6C42F690"/>
Aſiatics in this matter; and that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp, being at Rome, and having conferred with Anicetus, upon this affair, they determined that mutual communion ought not to be broken for a matter of ſo ſmall importance; and that they communicated with each other.</q>
He wrote, as Euſebius aſſures us, many reconciling letters to other Biſhops, upon this ſame head. And, it is probable, they were followed with ſome good effect. For though the Aſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics did not lay aſide their cuſtom, it does not appear that the union betwixt them and the Romaniſts was broken; but a more calm and tranquil ſtate of things took place. Thus this good man, in agreement with the purport of his name, diſcovered himſelf to be of a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and peace-making temper. And he has, from that time to this, been cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſed as one happily diſpoſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote candor, love, and peace among brethren; though he could clothe himſelf with zeal, and appear ſtrenuous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, when the purity of goſpel truth was in danger of being corrupted by the cunning arts of thoſe, who lay in wait to deceive.</p>

Theodoret ſays, he was "an apoſtolical man, admirable, and the light of the weſtern church." Epiphanius alſo is high in his encomium of him. His words are, "Old Irenaeus, every way

               <p n="5">(5.) An epiſtle to Florinus "concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monarchy," or that "God is not the author of evil;" in which he addreſſes to him in words we ſhall have occaſion by and by to conſider.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) A book entitled, "ogdoas," becauſe it was wrote, ſays Du-pin, againſt the "Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonary of the "aeons of the Valentinians." It was dedicated to Florinus, who, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to his former error of making God "the author of evil," now embraced thoſe of Valentinus. Jerom calls it, "com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarium egregium," that is, "an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent commentary." In the cloſe of it, we have a moſt ſolemn obteſtation, which both Euſebius and Jerom thought worthy of ſpecial notice. It is in theſe words, <note n="*" place="bottom">Euſeb. H. E.

that thou compare what thou haſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and correct it carefully by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar from whence it is tranſcribed: and alſo that thou writeſt out this adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and inſert it in the copy ſo taken." Dr. Cave very juſtly remarks upon this, in the following words, "Well had it been with the ancient writers of the church, had their books been treated with this care and reverence: more of them had been conveyed down to us; at leaſt, thoſe few that are, had arrived more ſound and unpolluted."</p>
               <p n="7">(7) Diverſe "epiſtles to Victor," and many other "Paſtors of churches", about the controverſy relative to the keeping eaſter.</p>
               <p>VOLATERAN ſpeaks of an "eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal hiſtory" which he compoſed, and that Euſebius had borrowed from it. And Sixtus Senenſis ſays, he wrote "a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon the apocalypſe." But theſe two laſt are ſcarce worth mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as neither Euſebius, in his hiſtory; nor Jerom, in his "catalogues;" nor Honorius Auguſtudonenſis, in his "lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries of the church"; nor Trithemius,
<pb n="390" facs="unknown:012009_0399_0F89403EAFB9B278"/>
in his book of "writers," make any mention of them.</p>
               <p>THE only work of Irenaeus, that has been handed down to us, is his volume, containing "five books" againſt the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies of the Gnoſtics and Valentineans, entitled, "a refutation and ſubverſion of ſcience falſely ſo called." This too, it ſhould ſeem, was almoſt loſt, at leaſt to the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern churches. For Eraſmus, who pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it in 1516, ſays <note n="*" place="bottom">Praef. in Iren.</note> "He might well call it HIS, having brought it to light, after it had been covered with duſt, and was mouldy and moth-eaten."</p>
               <p>IT has been a queſtion, whether he wrote theſe books in Greek or Latin. Eraſmus was inclined rather to think, they they were originally wrote in Latin. But moſt learned men are of another opinion. According to Baronius, <note n="†" place="bottom">Ad. an. 130.</note> "all conſent in this, that he wrote in Greek." Says Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius, <note n="‡" place="bottom">In praef. ad.

Epiphanius: ſo that it is ſtrange, Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, who was of a piercing judgment in matters of this nature, ſhould think Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus wrote in latin." To the like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſpeaks the great Scaliger,<note n="*" place="bottom">In epiſ. ad Thomſonum, num. 239.</note> "I admire, ſays he, that, from ſuch a feveriſh La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin interpreter, as he is whom we now have, Eraſmus ſhould imagine, that it is the true Irenaeus, and that he imitates the Greeks. That latin interpreter was weak, and either omitted, or depraved, many things which he underſtood not. The fragments that are extant in Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius, as alſo in Euſebius, do ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prove, both that the man was a Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, and that he wrote in Greek: nor is it to be doubted of."—Du-pin, Dr. Cave, Dr. Lardner, and in ſhort, the whole body of modern writers ſpeak of it, as beyond all doubt that Irenaeus wrote in Greek; and their unanimous opinion alſo is, that the copy we now have is a rude, barbarous, faulty, and ill-favored tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is not therefore eaſy to ſay, what his diſtinguiſhing ſtile and manner was in theſe books. Probably it was, as Dr. Cave ſays, "ſimple, unaffected, vulgar, and ordinary, emboſſed, it is like, and

               <p>THE contents of this volume are briefly and ſummarily contained in the following abſtract.</p>
               <p>IN the firſt book, having largely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the heretical tenets of the Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinians, he oppoſes to them the faith of all the churches in the world, which he comprehends, in a creed, truly catholic and excellent. <note n="†" place="bottom">This creed being ſo unlike thoſe we met with in after ages, containing, not metaphyſical niceties, but ſuch goſpel doctrines only, as are nearly and cloſely connected with ſalvation, I ſhall think it worth while to inſert it here. "It is, (as Irenaeus's words are) to believe in one omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent God, who made heaven, and the earth, and the ſeas, and all things that are in them; and in one Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God, incarnate for our ſalvation; and in the Holy Ghoſt, who by the Prophets, preached the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the diſpenſation and coming of Chriſt, his birth of a virgin, his paſſion, reſurrection from the dead, aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his fleſh into heaven, and his coming from heaven in the glory of the Father to reſtore [recapitulate, or gather into one] all things, and to raiſe the fleſh [the bodies] of all mankind, that unto Jeſus our Lord, and God, and Savior, and King, according to the good pleaſure of the Father, every knee ſhould bow, both of things in heaven, and in the earth, and under the earth, and that every tongue ſhould confeſs to him, and that he ſhould paſs a righteous ſentence upon all, and ſend ſpiritual wickedneſſes, the angels that fell and become apoſtate, and alſo ungodly, unrighteous, lawleſs, and blaſphemous men into eternal fire; but that, for the righteous and holy, and ſuch as did keep his commandments, and abode in his love, ſome from the beginning, and ſome by repentance, he might, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying them with life, beſtow on them incorruptibility, and eternal glory."</note> He then goes on to
<pb n="393" facs="unknown:012009_0402_0F894040EFCF0F38"/>
ſhew, that all chriſtians agree in this faith; and that the moſt learned can add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it, or make any changes in it, nor the moſt ſimple and ignorant dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh any part of it. He then largely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the abſurd notions of Valentinus and his diſciples; and, returning to the original of the heretics, and beginning with Simon Magus, he gives an account ſucceſſively of all the hereſies that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſince the time of that ſorcerer, to the time wherein he wrote. This firſt book is extremely dry, tedious, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; preſenting us with ſcarce any thing but the wild conceits, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagantly abſurd notions of the primitive heretics. In the ſecond book, he makes uſe of the principles of theſe heretics to oppoſe their errors; ſhewing that they contradict
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:012009_0403_0F894041AE016B88"/>
themſelves, and that their notions were idle, ridiculous whimſies. In the third book, he confutes them by the authority of the ſacred writings, and tradition from thoſe who had ſeen and converſed with the Apoſtles. In the fourth book, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to prove, that there is but one God; particularly, he ſhews againſt Marcion, that the ſame God is exhibited in the old and new teſtament. He anſwers the objections of the heretics, eſpecially thoſe they fetch from ſcripture. He then gives the reaſons why a ſpiritual man, that is to ſay, a Chriſtian condemns Pagans, Jews, heretics and ſciſmatics; and, finally, rejects the opinion of thoſe who affirmed, that men were naturally good or evil, and proves the liberty of mankind. In the laſt book, he treats of the fall of man, of the redemption by Jeſus Chriſt, of the reſurrection of the dead, of the laſt judgment, of anti-chriſt, and of the ſtate of ſouls after death.— Theſe, in general, are the ſubjects en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged on in theſe books.</p>
               <p>POSSIBLY, there may have been an exceſs in the commendations of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, on account of this work of his. Dr.

Cave ſays, there are evidently to be ſeen here the marks of "natural acumen and ſubtilty of parts," as well as "maſtery of philoſophy and human literature.<note n="*" place="bottom">Lives of the Fathers, vol. i. p. 119.</note> Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer repreſents him to have had "a clear head," and to have made uſe of "weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty arguments;" which, being "ſharpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with holy zeal," are fitted "to pierce deeply into the very hearts of the enemies of the truth, to their ſhameful proſtration, and utter overthrow." <note n="†" place="bottom">View of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, p. 62.</note> Du-pin ſpeaks of him as a "profound ſcholar in all ſorts of knowledge, ſacred and prophane"; eſpecially, as having an "exquiſite know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the holy ſcriptures." <note n="‡" place="bottom">Eccleſ. hiſt. p, 60.</note> It is readily acknowledged, as Eraſmus and the centuriators obſerve, that he had read the books of the ancient philoſophers, Thales, Aniximander, Anaxagoras, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus, Empedocles, Plato, Ariſtotle, &amp;c. as alſo of the poets, tragic, comic, and lyric: for he endeavors to make it evident, that the hereſies which he oppoſes were taken from theſe prophane authors, the names only being changed. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true likewiſe, that he had been much converſant with the ſacred writings.
<pb n="396" facs="unknown:012009_0405_0F894044178414A0"/>
But it may be juſtly queſtioned, whether his judgment was equal to his reading. The learned Photius ſays of him, <note n="*" place="bottom">Cod. 120.</note> "That he had in ſome of his books, "ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the truth of eccleſiaſtical doctrines by ſpurious reaſonings." This is a real fact, and known to be ſo, by all who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his writings. His manner of arguing is ſometimes weak, not to ſay trifling. I am ſure, it would be thought to be ſo in any one, who, at this day, ſhould reaſon as he has done. However, he appears, after all, to have been a pious, learned, valuable man, whoſe memory ought to be-bleſſed for his laborious ſervices in the cauſe of truth. Many things are to be met with in his writings well worth our ſpecial notice; though he ſometimes makes it appear, that he had his fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and imperfections. Candor itſelf will not pretend, that he has not, in ſome inſtances, deviated from that unerring rule, the word of truth. He, with other writers, both before and after him, have built ſome hay and ſtubble upon the foundation they held, which will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the trial of the fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="397" facs="unknown:012009_0406_0F894044AE4BDE20"/>THE learned are not agreed as to the exact time, when Irenaeus wrote his "five books againſt hereſies." Dodwel ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it to have been in 176 or 177. Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuet in 172. Tillemont, later ſtill, towards the end of the pontificate of Eleutherius. Dr. Lardner ſays, "As to the time of his writing theſe "five books," it is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of diverſe learned men, that they were not wrote, and publiſhed all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but rather at ſome diſtance of time." And, though he does not attempt to ſettle preciſely the year, in which this work was compleated, he places Irenaeus in the year 178; though he is inclined to think, his "books againſt hereſies" were not publiſhed quite ſo ſoon.</p>
               <p>"HIS death, ſays Du-pin, was no leſs glorious than his life. For, after having governed the flock, which Jeſus Chriſt had committed to his charge for 24 years, he fell a Martyr at Lyons, in the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Emperor Severus, which was more cruel in France than in any other part of the world, anno Chriſti 202, or 203." He has often been ſpoken of as a Martyr by other learned men. But, from the ſilence of Tertullian, Euſebius,
<pb n="398" facs="unknown:012009_0407_0F894045709F6728"/>
and other ancient Fathers concerning this matter, it is very juſtly argued by Dr. Cave, Baſnage, Dr. Lardner, and others, that there is no good reaſon to ſay he died a Martyr. The moſt critical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers into matters of this nature place his death, ſome in 190, and others in 191, or 192. Baronius <note n="*" place="bottom">Ad. An. 205.</note> extends the time to the 11th of Severus, or 205th of Chriſt.</p>

And having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Polycarp, and ſaid ſome things of him, he goes on, "I am able to teſtify before God, that if that holy and apoſtical

               <p>THE ſecond, which is eminently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the point in debate, is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his "epiſtle to Victor" of Rome, which was extant in the days of Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, though it has long ſince been loſt.

               <head>OBSERVATIONS and REMARKS upon the teſtimonies from IRENAEUS.</head>
               <p>NOTHING is more obviouſly evident, ſo far as we regard the above paſſages, than that Irenaeus cannot be called in as a WITNESS, either to the CLAIM or EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERCISE of thoſe powers, which Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians pretend are eſſential to the office of Biſhops. For he no where ſays, that it is the RIGHT of Biſhops, in diſtinction from Preſbyters, to CONFER HOLY ORDERS; or that they were the perſons, who did in FACT confer them, either in the age in which he lived, or any other: neither does
<pb n="410" facs="unknown:012009_0419_0F89404F2EAF9578"/>
he affirm, directly or indirectly, that it was any part of the work of Biſhops, much leſs their appropriate diſcriminate work, to GOVERN PRESBYTERS, or that they ever did ſo. And, inſtead of declaring, that Biſhops are officers in the church DISTINCT from, and SUPERIOR to, Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, he ſpeaks of them, as clearly and fully as he could have done, in language neceſſarily leading us to look upon them as ſuſtaining the SAME OFFICE only in the church. No writer, ſince the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic times, has more exactly, or frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, copied after the inſpired penmen, in the promiſcuous uſe of the words Biſhops and Preſbyters. He uſes theſe words indifferently, and frequently, to point out the ſame officers in the church. And unleſs when he uſes the word, Biſhops, he means the ſame church officers, as when he uſes the word, Preſbyters, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coherence, conſiſtency, or the leaſt force of argument, in moſt of the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in which theſe words are mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As this is an important point in the preſent debate, I ſhall enlarge in its illuſtration, and take occaſion for it by anſwering what is pleaded, from Irenaeus, in favor of Epiſcopacy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="411" facs="unknown:012009_0420_0F89404FEF99FD48"/>THE grand plea is, that he is pirticular in giving us the line of ſucceſſion; that he does it in ſingle perſons; and that theſe perſons are frequently and expreſſly called Biſhops: evidently importing a diſtinction of place, order, or office, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and Preſbyters.</p>
               <p>THE anſwer is eaſy, and, as I imagine, ſtrongly concluſive. It is allowed, reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning the ſucceſſion by ſingle perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates ſome difference betwixt the nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons, and others of the ſame church, as the ground, or reaſon, of their being ſingled out.But what conceivable need is there, unleſs to ſerve a turn, to ſuppoſe, that the difference muſt be ſo great as to import an imparity of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or office? Are there no inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in which it is certain, particular perſons have been diſtinguiſhed from their brethren of the ſame order, to anſwer the like end? Biſhop Stillingfleet has told us of ſome admirably well adapted to the purpoſe. Says he, <note n="*" place="bottom">Iren. p. 300.</note>
                  <q>At Athens, after they grew weary of their ten years <hi>Archontes,</hi> the people choſe nine every
<pb n="412" facs="unknown:012009_0421_0F894050AE3A55D8"/>
year to govern the affairs of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. Theſe nine enjoyed a parity of power among themſelves, and therefore had a place where they conſulted together about the matters of ſtate, which was called <hi>Statêgion,</hi> as Demoſthenes, Plutarch, and others tell us: now although they enjoyed this equality of power, yet one of them had greater dignity than the reſt, and therefore was called <hi>Archôn</hi> by way of excellency, and his name only was ſet in the public records of that year, and therefore was called <hi>Archôn epônu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi>; and the year was reckoned from him, as Pauſanias and Julius Pollux inform us. Here we ſee now the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion clear in one ſingle perſon, and yet no ſuperiority of power in him over his colleagues. The like may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of the <hi>Ephori</hi> and <hi>bidiaei</hi> at Sparta. The number of the <hi>ephori</hi> was always five from their firſt inſtitution by Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus, and not nine, as the Greek etymologiſt imagines. Theſe likewiſe enjoyed a parity of power; but among theſe, to give name to the year, they made choice of one who was called <hi>Epônumos</hi> here too, as the <hi>Archôn</hi> at
<pb n="413" facs="unknown:012009_0422_0F8940516FB31710"/>
Athens; and him they called <hi>Preſtôta tôn ephorôn,</hi> as Plutarch tells: where we have the very name <hi>Proeſtôs</hi> attributed to him that had only this primacy of order, without any ſuperiority of power, which is uſed by Juſtin Martyr of the <hi>Preſident</hi> of aſſemblies among Chriſtians. Now from hence we may evidently ſee, that meer ſucceſſion of ſome ſingle perſons named above the reſt, in the ſucceſſions of apoſtolical churches, cannot enforce any ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of power in the perſons ſo named, above others ſuppoſed to be joint go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the churches with them.</q>
There was, we ſee, among the <hi>Archon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> at Athens, and the <hi>Ephori</hi> at Sparta, a ſenior in office, a chair-man, or preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and he was, for this reaſon, ſingled out, from his brethren of the ſame office-power, to give denomination to the year. The like may be ſaid in the caſe before us. Among the Preſbyters in each church, who all ſuſtained the ſame office, and were veſted with the ſame eſſential pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, there might be a praeſes, Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or prime-Preſbyter; <note n="*" place="bottom">It may be worthy of ſpecial notice here, Irenaeus himſelf very plainly intimates, that, among PRESBYTERS, or thoſe who were of that ORDER which conſtituted the PRESBYTERATE, there were ſome, in his day, who, "not having the fear of God in their hearts," but being "elated with the dignity of the FIRST or PRINCIPAL SESSION, contumeliouſly treated the other Preſbyters." Vid. lib. iv. cap. 44. This FIRST SESSION was not, in the view of Irenaeus, the ſeſſion of BISHOPS, as officers in the church of a ſuperior ORD<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> to that of Preſbyters; for he here conſiders them all as ſuſtaining the SAME ORDER; though in this ſame order there was a difference in DEGREE. He here ſpeaks of a PRINCIPAL SES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SION<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, one that belonged to the PRIME-PRES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BYTER, the HEAD or PRAESES of the PRESBYTERY.</note> and he might,
<pb n="414" facs="unknown:012009_0423_0F8940522F98C8B0"/>
on this account, be ſelected to have his name mentioned in the ſucceſſion: or his name might be inſerted, merely as being the ſenior-Preſbyter, or becauſe he was beſt known, and moſt celebrated for his learning, piety, and ſtrict attachment to the apoſtolic doctrine. This difference of character, without the ſuppoſition of any difference in point of office, or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, will fully account for a ſucceſſion as reckoned in a line of ſingle perſons; and it is ſufficient, could nothing elſe be ſaid, to render their arguing invalid, who, merely from hence, would conclude, that theſe particularly diſtinguiſhed and named perſons were of a ſuperior, and diſtinct order, in the churches, from the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters belonging to them.</p>
               <p>BUT, to give ſtrength to this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is further ſaid, ſingle perſons are
<pb n="415" facs="unknown:012009_0424_0F894052F37508E0"/>
not only named in the ſucceſſion, but they are frequently and expreſſly called Biſhops. Very true; but then it is as true, that Irenaeas has taken all proper care, as though he had it in deſign, to guard againſt any ones miſtaking his "ſucceſſion of Biſhops," for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of a "ſuperior order" in the church to that of Preſbyters. This is particularly worthy of notice. I ſhall accordingly endeavor to ſet it in the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and ſtrongeſt point of light. And I know of no way in which I can better do this, than by placing a few of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſages, upon the head of ſucceſſion, in two oppoſite columns. It will then appear, at firſt ſight, to every intelligent unprejudiced reader, that Irenaeus means, and, unleſs he is made to ſpeak nonſenſe, muſt mean by the "ſucceſſion of Biſhops," one and the ſame thing with the "ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Preſbyters," and vice-verſa.</p>

Does he, in one place, when ſpeaking of the ſucceſſion in the church of Rome, particularly name Linus, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletus, Clemens, &amp;c. as being Biſhops, as having obtained the Epiſcopate there? In another, while ſpeaking of the ſame ſucceſſion, and in the ſame ſingle perſons, he as expreſſly calls them Preſbyters; yea, he gives no higher a ſtile to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors of Victor, the then Biſhop of Rome, than that of Preſbyters; and he applies the ſame name to thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Eleutherius, another Biſhop of this ſame church. Does he affirm, "that the apoſtolic doctrine was handed down through the ſucceſſion of Biſhops?" He as peremptorily declares, "that it was preſerved in the church, through the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Preſbyters." Does he make
<pb n="420" facs="unknown:012009_0429_0F8940576E808A80"/>
mention of Biſhops "as conſtituted in the churches by the Apoſtles?" He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the ſame ſentiment, when he ſays, "the Preſbyters in the church have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from the Apoſtles:" nor can we miſtake his meaning, if we only conſider, that, in the immediately following words, he calls this very ſucceſſion, "the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Epiſcopate;" and, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, makes the remark, "ſuch Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters the church nouriſheth;" and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the Prophet ſaying, "I will give you Princes in peace, and Biſhops in righteouſneſs." In vain muſt it be to look for a ſucceſſion of Biſhops, in Irenaeus's writings, diſtinct from Preſbyters, and veſted with ſuperior powers, when he attributes not only "the ſucceſſion," but "the ſucceſſion in Epiſcopacy," to Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters; indifferently calling the ſingle perſons he reckons in the ſucceſſion, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Preſbyters. It would ſpoil his reaſoning, render it inconſiſtent, weak, confuſed, and fallacious, to ſuppoſe he ſhould mean by Biſhops a different order of officers in the church from Preſbyters, when he ſo often uſes theſe names pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly, and indifferently derives the ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles in a line of Biſhops, or Preſbyters, meaning, by both words, the ſame officers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="421" facs="unknown:012009_0430_0F894058304A51E8"/>IT may be pertinently obſerved yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſucceſſion Irenaeus has in view, is not a ſucceſſion of POWER, but of DOC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRINE. This will be obvious, at firſt ſight, by looking over the foregoing quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from him. His diſpute is with the heretics of that day; and the uſe he makes of the argument from ſucceſſion is, to prove that they had departed from that DOCTRINE, which had been handed down, in the churches, even from the Apoſtles to that time. This is his grand point, and he keeps to it; never menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning the ſucceſſion, but in order to ſhew, how, and from what original ſource, the DOCTRINE of Chriſt had come down, and been preſerved in its purity to his day. To ſeek therefore for a ſucceſſion of POWER, in Irenaeus, is to ſeek for the living among the dead. He no where reaſons from the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the churches, in favor of any peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity of power in Biſhops beyond Preſbyters, but confines his argument SOLELY to the head of DOCTRINE. So that, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to make any valid uſe of what he has ſaid upon ſucceſſion, to prove a ſucceſſion of power; much leſs a ſuperioriry of power, appropriated to Biſhops in diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Preſbyters. It muſt be previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="422" facs="unknown:012009_0431_0F894058EF9AF748"/>
laid down as a poſtulatum, or elſe ſufficiently made evident, that the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic doctrine could not have been hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down pure and incorrupt, but in a line of ſuch Biſhops as were of an order in the church ſuperior to Preſbyters; or any argument from Irenaeus's ſucceſſion will be eſſentially lame and defective. It will not be allowed, before it has been va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly proved, that Biſhops, in the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated ſenſe, could be the only convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of apoſtolic truth. It is poſſible, at leaſt we may be permitted to think it is ſo, until we are convinced of the contrary, that this truth might as well be handed down by Biſhops that are of one and the ſame order with Preſbyters.</p>
               <p>IT may add weight to what has been ſaid upon theſe teſtimonies, if it be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, that the Gallican churches, who ſent Irenaeus to Rome with an epiſtle to Eleutherius, Biſhop of the church there, had no idea of that ſuperiority of Biſhops to Preſbyters, which is now ſo much talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of. For, in this letter, while ſpeaking in commendation of him, they give him no higher a title than that of PRESBY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER.

They would not, in this caſe, have ſpoken of him, and in the recommendatory part of their letter, as their Preſbyter. This would have been rather a debaſement, than recommendation of him.

                  <q>Irenaeus is ſent by the church of Lyons on a meſſage to the Biſhop of Rome, when, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his being Biſhop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they call him Preſbyter of that church.

power of juriſdiction over, his fellow Preſbyters?</q>
And this reaſoning will "appear ſtill more forcible, if it be added, that, in this very letter, he is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the other Preſbyters, as their "bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and colleague." So the words are in Euſebius, who has quoted them. <note n="*" place="bottom">H. E.

               <p>ONLY one plea more, that I know of, is fetched from Irenaeus in favor of the epiſcopal cauſe. It is his uſing that mode of ſpeech, "Biſhops and Preſbyters;" which; ſay the prelatiſts, evidently imports a diſtinction of officers, and gives the ſuperiority to Biſhops.</p>
               <p>IT is acknowledged, this mode of dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is once uſed by Irenaeus. But how

does he uſe it? Not as his own, but the language rather of the Apoſtle Paul. The paſſage, in which the words are to be found, runs thus: "He [Paul] applied himſelf to the Biſhops and Preſbyters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened at Miletus, who were of Epheſus, and the neighbouring towns, becauſe he was going to Jeruſalem."—Theſe words, "Biſhops and Preſbyters," which Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus has alluded to, or rather quoted from Acts xx, are uſed ſynonimouſly by the Apoſtle Paul. And of this there is no room for diſpute. For, it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, that, from Miletus, he ſent to Epheſus, and called the Elders [<hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buterous</hi>] of the church. And in v. 28, in his exhortation to theſe very Elders, he as expreſſly calls them [<hi>Epiſcopous</hi>] Biſhops. I would now aſk, is it not quite eaſy and natural to ſuppoſe, that Irenaeus uſes the phraſe, "Biſhops and Preſbyters," in alluſion to the 17th and 28th verſe of the juſt mentioned xxth of Acts, in the former of which Paul uſes the word, "Preſbyters;" and in the latter, the word, "Biſhops?" And as Paul moſt certainly uſed them ſynonimically; is it not reaſonable to think, that Irenaeus uſed them in the like ſenſe? Eſpecially,
<pb n="426" facs="unknown:012009_0435_0F89405BEF5DC350"/>
as, in every other paſſage through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his writings, inſtead of connecting Biſhops and Preſbyters, ſo as that it might ſeem as if he intended to make a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between them, he has uſed the words invariably in the ſynonimous ſenſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently and promiſcuouſly meaning by Biſhops, Preſbyters; and by Preſbyters, Biſhops. This is ſo plain a caſe, that it might be thought impertinent to ſay any thing more upon it.</p>
               <p>IT may, upon the whole, be ſaid with real truth, not only that Irenaeus is a full and poſitive witneſs againſt the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal cauſe, but a poſitive and full one in favor of our's. He ſays not a word in evidence of thoſe POWERS that are made ESSENTIAL to the EPISCOPATE; but as much as we could deſire, in proof of the SAMENESS of the ORDER, or OF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FICE, of Biſhops and Preſbyters.</p>

            <p>I HAVE followed Du-pin in placing theſe writers between Irenaeus, and Clement of Alexandria.

A few fragments of ſome of their works have been preſerved; but, for the greater part, they are totally loſt. Victor wrote ſome pieces about the "time of keeping eaſter." Theophilus of Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaria, with ſome other Biſhops, joined in writing "an epiſtle," as a council, with orders to have it publiſhed, with reference to the "day on which eaſter ſhould be

obſerved." Bachyllus of Corinth wrote an "epiſtle," in the name of the Biſhop of Achaia, upon the ſame ſubject. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus wrote "commentaries upon the Apoſtle Paul;" Maximus, on "the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of evil," and on "the creation of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;" Appion, and Candidus, "commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries on the hexameron;" Sextus, a "diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on the reſurrection;" Judas, a treatiſe on "Daniel's weeks;" Pantaenus, maſter of the ſchool at Alexandria, and a famous preacher of the goſpel," com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries on the bible;" but theſe are all buried in the ruins of time. Of the works of Arabianus, and ſeveral other writers, about this time, whoſe names are not mentioned by Euſebius, there were no ſigns, or traces, even ſo far back as his day. Rhodon, once a diſciple of Tatian, wrote many books.

He has given us a quotation, of ſome length, from the firſt of theſe books; but there is nothing in it relative to the point we are upon.</p>

<q>It is very probable, (ſays Euſebius,) <note n="*" place="bottom">H. E.

            <head>CLEMENT of Alexandria.</head>
            <head type="sub">His character, writings, teſtimonies from them, with obſervations and remarks.</head>
            <p>TITUS FLAVIUS CLEMENS, or CLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT of ALEXANDRIA, the name by which he is more commonly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, was probably of heatheniſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract; and ſome ſay, a native of Athens. Epiphanius tells us, "he was called by ſome Clement of Alexandria; by others Clement of Athens;" and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes from hence, "that Athens was the place of his birth; Alexandria, of his after reſidence, and conſtant employment." It is altogether uncertain, when he firſt profeſſed himſelf a Chriſtian, and by what means he was induced to do ſo. He flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, ſays Dr. Lardener, in the reign of Severus, and his ſon Antoninus Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cella, that is, between 192 and 217. Du-pin
<pb n="434" facs="unknown:012009_0443_0F8940636E33ED38"/>
ſays, he reached the time of Helioga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus, and did not die before the year 220.</p>
            <p>HE had early a ſtrong thirſt after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and by diligent ſtudy, under the advantage of valuable natural endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, eſpecially a moſt tenacious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and the beſt means of indoctrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the world was favoured with in that day, he acquired the reputation of having attained to an extraordinary height in all ſorts of learning. He was a ſtudent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeveral maſters. As he himſelf tells us, in his firſt book of ſtromes, he had "two in Greece, the one a Caelo-Syrian, the other an Egyptian; two more in the eaſt, one an Aſſyrian, the other of Paleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine: and that at laſt he found one in Egypt, who was far more excellent than all the reſt." This was Pantaenus, of whom he ſpeaks with great reſpect, and in his inſtitutions expreſsly calls "his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter." The names of the firſt four are not mentioned. Baronius thinks the Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian was Bardeſanes, and he of Paleſtine Theophilus of Caeſaria. Valeſius, with greater probability, ſuppoſes Tatian to have been the Aſſyrian, and Theodotus the Hebrew, under whoſe name there is a "fragment" of the "inſtitutions" at the end of the works of Clement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="435" facs="unknown:012009_0444_0F8940642F869C58"/>BUT though he ſtudied under theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral maſters, he did not implicitly ſwallow their dictates, but choſe, as it was fit he ſhould do, to judge for himſelf. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſays, in the firſt book of his ſtromata, "I eſpouſed not this, or that philoſophy, neither the ſtoic, nor the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonic, nor the epicurean, nor that of Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totle; but whatever any of theſe ſects had ſaid that was right and juſt, all that, being ſelected, I call philoſophy." This not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, as Dr. Cave obſerves, "he came neareſt to the ſtoics, as appears from his diſcourſing by way of paradoxes, and his affected novelty of words, two things peculiar to the men of that way. And I doubt not but he was peculiarly diſpoſed towards this ſect by the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his maſter Pantaenus, ſo great and profeſſed an admirer of the ſtoical philoſophy." This Pantaenus was maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſchool or academy at Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, for the inſtruction of <hi>catechumens,</hi> that is, new converts from heatheniſm, or the children of believers grown up to a capacity of indoctrination, eſpecially ſuch of them as were intended for the ſervice of the church of Chriſt. The language and liberal arts, it is ſaid, were taught here, as well as the grounds and
<pb n="436" facs="unknown:012009_0445_0F894064EE7EE888"/>
principles of the Chriſtian religion. Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſays, "Pantaenus read in Alexandria divinity and philoſophy, from whence it is thought the orders of inſtituting uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities firſt began in Chriſtendom." Clement, it is probable, taught in this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techetical ſchool with Pantaenus, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his place while gone to preach the goſpel in India. It is certain, he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him upon his death, in this office; and he continued in it a long time, to the end of his life; ever conducting with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to himſelf, and great advantage to thoſe who attended on his inſtructions. Some of the moſt eminent men, in that age, were educated under his care; ſuch as Origen, Alexander, afterwards Biſhop of Jeruſalem, and many others. Not a great way from the beginning of Severus's reign, he ſuſtained the office of a Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the church of Alexandria, beſides this of a catechiſt there; for in this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter Euſebius ſpeaks of him in the year 195. And being a man of great piety, as well as learning, and eminently zealous to promote the honor of God, and the advancement of religion, he did much ſervice by his preaching, not only in Alexandria, but in Jeruſalem, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, to which places he occaſionally
<pb n="437" facs="unknown:012009_0446_0F894065AF736E30"/>
went, confirming many in the faith, and recovering others who had been ſeduced by falſe teachers. Euſebius <note n="*" place="bottom">H. E. lib. vi. cap. 11.</note> brings in Alexander, at that time Biſhop of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, thus ſpeaking of him, in his epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the church at Antioch, "This let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I ſend you by Clement, the bleſſed Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, a man virtuous and approved, whom ye both know, and ſhall more fully know; who, coming hither by the good providence of God, hath eſtabliſhed, and increaſed, the church of the Lord."</p>
            <p>HE was greatly uſeful by his pen, as well as catechetical inſtructions, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic preaching. His writings are nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; though moſt of them are loſt. A few only have reached the preſent day.</p>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all theſe, Euſebius often mentions, and ſometimes quotes, a volume, called "hypotypoſes," or "eight books of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions." In this work, according to Photius, "he goes over the main body of the ſcriptures in a brief commentary, or expoſition; not omitting ſome books that were generally rejected as apocryphal." This learned critic obſerves further, in common with others, that, in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, there are "ſome things very er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious and fabulous. Du-pin ſuppoſes this work muſt needs have been compoſed by St. Clement before he was thoroughly inſtructed in the Chriſtian religion, and had quitted the opinions of Plato; or
<pb n="439" facs="unknown:012009_0448_0F8940672E7EA620"/>
while he was half a Platoniſt, and half a Chriſtian. Dr. Cave rather falls in with the opinion of Photius, which was,
<q>that probably theſe things were inſerted by another hand; as Ruffinus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly aſſures us, that hereſies had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Clement his writings. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſays he, had theſe books been infected with theſe prophane and poiſonous dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata in Euſebius's time, he would have given us, at leaſt, ſome obſcure intimations of it. And conſiderable it is, that theſe things are not countenanced by his other books; nay, many of them are plainly contradicted by them.</q>

               <p>THE remaining, and commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, works of Clement, beſides a ſmall tract, more lately publiſhed, entitled,
<pb n="440" facs="unknown:012009_0449_0F894067EE4805C0"/>
"what rich man ſhall be ſaved?" are theſe three. His "exhortation to the Gentiles," in one book. His "paeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue," or ſchool-maſter, in three books. His "ſtromes," in eight books; ſo called, becauſe they contain a collection of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo put together as to make a variety not unlike that in Turkey-worked-carpets. The word, ſtrômaties, ſays Eraſmus, is taken from pictured carpets, or tapeſtry." It is uſed here, ſays Du-pin, "for that mixture we ſee in tapeſtry, and imports as much as miſcellaneous commentaries, or diſcourſes." Clement himſelf gives us this idea of his work of ſtromes. "Theſe books, ſays he, are ſtored with varieties, as their name imports. We paſs on continually from one thing to another." He alſo calls them, "a variegated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of diſcourſes;" which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares "to a meadow, a tract of land, or a garden, wherein one may find all ſorts of herbs, flowers, and fruits, of which we may gather as we pleaſe." And ſuch, in truth, are theſe books called, ſtromata. They are as a mixed compoſition, and contain as great a variety of all ſorts of learning as could well be put together.</p>
               <p>IN his "exhortation to the Gentiles," he ſtrongly repreſents, and largely expoſes,
<pb n="441" facs="unknown:012009_0450_0F894068B56A9368"/>
the folly, and impiety, of the Pagan-idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and then, with great cogency, urges to the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and the worſhip of the one only living and true God.</p>
               <p>IN his "paedagogue," he tutors and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs the newly initiated converts to Chriſtianity; preſcribing many wiſely adapted rules to promote their increaſe in grace, until they attain to the "fullneſs of the ſtature of men in Chriſt."</p>
               <p>IN his "ſtromata," he adminiſters "ſtrong meat" to them who are of "full age," and have "their ſenſes exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed to diſcern both good and evil;" en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to lead this kind of perſons into a more cloſe and intimate acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the myſteries of religion. He tells us himſelf, that he purpoſely wrote theſe books, ſo as that theſe myſteries might not be clearly diſcovered to thoſe who were not as yet initiated; while others, who were, might underſtand them to their advantage. "Our deſign, (ſays he) was, (as Du-pin tranſlates him) to conceal, and, if I may ſo ſay, to embroil things, that ſo none but the intelligent, and thoſe who will take pains to inform themſelves, may be able to comprehend
<pb n="442" facs="unknown:012009_0451_0F8940696D4829C0"/>
them." In agreement with this account, it is the truth of fact, that he often writes in a manner ſo obſcure, as not to be eaſily underſtood. He obſerves frequently no order in theſe books. They are rather a collection of incoherent varieties, than an exact methodical compoſure.</p>
               <p>PERHAPS, no one of the Fathers has been more highly celebrated than this Clement, either by ancient, or more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern writers. Alexander, Biſhop of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and contemporary with him, in his "epiſtle to Origen," calls him the "ſacred Clement;" and ſays, "he was "his maſter, and had been profitable to him." Euſebius, in his cronicle, makes mention of him as "an excellent maſter of the Chriſtian philoſophy," and one "eminent for his writings." He elſewhere more than once calls him "the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Clement." Jerom, in his catalogue of illuſtrious men, ſays of his works, "they are full of erudition, borrowed from the treaſures of the divine ſcripture, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar literature:" and, in his epiſtle to Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, declares it as his opinion, that "Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was the moſt learned of all men." And, having mentioned the chief of his works, adds, "what is there in them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned?

What, not taken out of the very depths of philoſophy?" He is honored, by more modern writers, with the titles of a "moſt excellent, moſt learned, moſt eloquent man;" one who "exceeded all others in incredible knowledge." The learned Daille ſays of him,
<q>What can you name more mixed, and fuller of variety than his ſtromata, as he calls them, and his other works? which are throughout interlaced with hiſtorical alluſions, opinions, ſentences, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs, out of all ſorts of writers, both ſacred and prophane; heightened here with rich lightſome colors, then ſhaded with darkneſs, in ſuch ſort as that it is a vain thing for an ignorant perſon to hope ever to reach his meaning.</q>
The greateſt encomium of him we meet with in Gentianus Heroetius, <note n="*" place="bottom">In epiſ. ante oper. Clem.</note> who, among others, tranſlated his works into Latin; but this is too long to be inſerted here.</p>
               <p>THE higheſt ſtrains in which Clement has been commended, are not, as I imagine, too great, as they reſpect his learning. This, as Dr. Lardner's expreſſion is, was "prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious." And it is really wonderful, as the invention of the art of printing is much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

his day, and it was therefore in his power to read only manuſcript copies of the works of others, how he could find ways to come at the ſight of ſuch a multitude of them, as he ſeems to have been perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with. There was ſcarce a pagan philoſopher, poet, or hiſtorian, however near or diſtant from the age in which he lived, but he made himſelf maſter of their works. And the ſame may be ſaid of all Chriſtian writers, whether they were orthodox or heretical; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they flouriſhed in the apoſtolic, or ſucceeding age, or about the time in which he lived. Conſidering his conſtant employment as a catechetical inſtructor, and his attending together herewith, for ſome years, the work of a Preſbyter of the church at Alexandria, it is amazing to think, after he had procured ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe variety of manuſcripts, how he could find time to read them; much more, how he could write ſuch a number of books, in which he could make ſo eaſy and ready a uſe of them! He muſt have been a miracle of diligence, not looſing one inch of his time. But though I am aſtoniſhed at his learning, I cannot think he was eminently great in regard of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It will not be diſowned, by any
<pb n="445" facs="unknown:012009_0454_0F89406C6DD34320"/>
who have read his works, that his reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too often will not bear examination; which cannot eaſily be accounted for, if he had been as judicious as he was learned. And if I ſhould add, that his religious ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, in ſome points, were not agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to truth, it would not be diſputed.— But his abundant labors, in the cauſe of God, while living, and the uſefulneſs of his writings, in many reſpects, ſince his death, are more than enough to weigh down the miſtakes that may have dropped from his pen.</p>

Having mentioned a variety of ſcripture precepts, well adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſcountenance iniquity, he goes on, and ſays, "Very many other commands, appertaining to ſelect perſons, are written in the ſacred books, ſome to Preſbyters [<hi>Preſbuterois</hi>;] ſome to Biſhops [<hi>Epiſkopois</hi>;] ſome to Deacons [<hi>Diakonois</hi>;] and ſome to widows."</p>
               <p>STROM. lib, iii. p. 546. In diſcourſing upon the doctrine of continence and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, he occaſionally brings in theſe words, "Again, ſays he, [the Apoſtle Paul] thoſe are to be appointed Biſhops [<hi>Epiſkopous dei kathiſtaſthai,</hi>] who, from ruling their own houſe, are exerciſed to the knowledge of ruling the whole church."</p>

Euſebius, it is true, has given the whole of it a place in his "eccleſiaſtical hiſtory;" and inſerts it as a true report. But this is no infallible argument that it is ſo.

               <p>IT is obvious, upon the ſlighteſt view of the above offered teſtimonies, that Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no more than the writers before him, can, with the leaſt ſhadow of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, be produced as witneſſing to the FACTS that are the grand ſubject under conſideration. He ſays not a word, from whence it can be ſo much as collected by remote conſequence, that he thought Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops had an EXCLUSIVE RIGHT to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="453" facs="unknown:012009_0462_0F8940726E78D1F0"/>
HOLY ORDERS; nor has he any where hinted, that it was ever the PRAC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICE, in his day, or at any other time, for Biſhops, as a DISTINCT ORDER of goſpel officers, to perform the work of ORDINA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION. The ſame may be ſaid of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive right to GOVERN THE CHURCH. It is obſervable, in paedag. p. 120, though a PRESBYTER of the church of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, he includes himſelf in the number of thoſe <hi>proêgoumenoi,</hi> or chief leaders, who are eſteemed Shepherds. "We, ſays he, who have rule in the churches, <hi>tôn ekkle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiôn proêgoumenoi.</hi>" And as to CONFIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MATION, he no where mentions it, unleſs "the impoſition of the hand," paedog. p. 291, may be ſuppoſed to refer to this cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. If this ſhould be the truth, it is the firſt hint we have, in all primititive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, of ſuch a practice in the church. But then, it deſerves particular notice, this teſtimony can be of no ſervice to the epiſcopal claim; for, not the Biſhop, but the PRESBYTER, is repreſented as "lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his hand." It could not therefore be, according to Clement, the appropriate work of a Biſhop, a peculium of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice as ſuch.</p>
               <p>IT is acknowledged, Clement once uſes that mode of diction, "Biſhops, Preſbyters,
<pb n="454" facs="unknown:012009_0463_0F89407332968408"/>
Deacons;" and once more thus varied, "Preſbyters, Biſhops, Deacons:" and he is the firſt writer, Ignatius only excepted, if he is ſuppoſed to be the writer of the epiſtles aſcribed to him, that ever uſed this manner of ſpeaking. But his thus writing is an inſufficient ground on which to repreſent him as a witneſs, that Biſhops were, in his day, an order of officers in the church diſtinct from, and ſuperior to, that of Preſbyters. The term, Biſhop, may properly be uſed as a diſtinguiſhing name, though it ſhould import no eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſuperiority of office between him and a Preſbyter. Arch-Biſhop is an appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that diſtinguiſhes the perſon to whom it is applied from one that is a Biſhop only, and is ever uſed to this purpoſe; and yet, Arch-Biſhop and Biſhop are one and the ſame order of officers in the church, Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians themſelves being judges. So the name, Rector, points out a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the perſons called by this name, and thoſe that are called Curates; and yet, they both partake of the ſame eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial powers of preaching, baptiſing, and adminiſtring the Lord's ſupper. It might, about this time, begin to be a cuſtom, not to have a Praeſes, or Head-Preſbyter in the church, but to diſtinguiſh him by
<pb n="455" facs="unknown:012009_0464_0F894073ED3C6220"/>
                  <hi>appropriating</hi> to him the name of Biſhop. And this might be the only reaſon of Clement's ſpeaking in that mode, "Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Preſbyters, Deacons." Moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, it could not be, becauſe he thought there were three diſtinct orders in the church, and that Biſhops were, as Chriſt's officers, veſted with eſſential powers ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to Preſbyters, as Preſbyters are with powers eſſentially ſuperior to Deacons; and for the following conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">I. IN paedag. lib. iii. p. 309, his enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration runs thus, "Preſbyters, Biſhops, Deacons;" which cannot eaſily be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, if he had ſuppoſed Biſhops to have been an order in the church ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to that of Preſbyters, as Preſbyters are to that of Deacons. He no where, in ſpeaking of Preſbyters and Deacons, places Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons before Preſbyters; but, as Preſbyters are a ſuperior order of officers, he always mentions them firſt. And there is no imaginable reaſon to think, but he would have done the ſame by Biſhops, if, in his apprehenſion, they had been officers in the church ſuperior in their order to Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. It is worthy of obſervation, Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us does not give us the enumeration in this form; but places Biſhops before Preſbyters.
<pb n="456" facs="unknown:012009_0465_0F894075957D28E0"/>
And it is queſtionable, whether an inſtance can be produced, after Biſhops were look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as officers in the church of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior order to Preſbyters, from any wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who favored this opinion, wherein he places Preſbyters before Biſhops in an enumeration of church officers. But this I barely mention as not unworthy of notice.</p>
               <p n="2">II. IT is a conſideration of more weight that in his book "quis dives ſalvandus ſit?" the church officer he ſpeaks of under the name of BISHOP, he likewiſe calls PRES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BYTER. His words are, "He [the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle John] looked upon the BISHOP, who had been ſet over the whole church, and ſaid, I commit this young man to thy care." It follows a few lines after, "and the PRESBYTER, [<hi>o Preſbyter</hi>] taking the young Man, brought him home."— It is not in any degree probable, if, by the word, Biſhop, Clement meant an officer in the church of a ſuperior order to that of Preſbyters, he would have indifferently uſed the terms, Biſhop and Preſbyter, to point him out. Had the word, Biſhop, been with him the known certainly AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PROPRIATED term to diſtinguiſh the firſt or higheſt of three orders of officers in the
<pb n="457" facs="unknown:012009_0466_0F894076571F0588"/>
church, there would be an impropriety, not to ſay abſurdity, in his calling that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer a PRESBYTER, who was a Biſhop: nor ought it to be ſuppoſed, that he would have been guilty of ſo groſs a reflection on the Biſhop of a church.</p>
               <p>IT is ſaid, in anſwer, this Biſhop, who is pointed out by the term Preſbyter [<hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteros,</hi>] in the above cited place, is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in this very ſtory, ſpoken of in that ſtile, <hi>o Preſbytês,</hi> "the old man." Upon which the plea is, that he might be called <hi>Preſbyteros,</hi> not on account of his being a Preſbyter, but an elderly perſon. It is confeſſed the word, <hi>Preſbyteros,</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be underſtood as meaning nothing more than an aged man; but this mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can be given to it, only when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of the diſcourſe, where it is uſed, makes it neceſſary: otherwiſe, it is, with all the Fathers, an appropriated term, and not uſed by any of them, either before, or after, Clement, but to denote an officer in the church of Chriſt. And, what may be worthy of ſpecial notice, it is never uſed by Clement, relative to an officer of the church, to ſignify <hi>meerly,</hi> or <hi>only,</hi> his being "a man in years." Why then ſhould he be thought to uſe it in this ſenſe, in the
<pb n="458" facs="unknown:012009_0467_0F894076EEB8E060"/>
paſſage under conſideration? And, had he intended to convey the idea of nothing more than "an old man," why did he not uſe the word <hi>Preſbytês</hi>? He might, with equal eaſe, and more propriety, have uſed this word, in both paſſages that have been brought to view; and his not doing it, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indicates, that he intended, in the firſt of them, to lead us into the thought, that, by <hi>Preſbyteros,</hi> he meant the ſame officer in the church, he had juſt before called Biſhop, <hi>Epiſkopos</hi>; and in the ſecond, to ſignify that he was an "elderly perſon." And there might be a ſpecial propriety in his ſpeaking of him, in this ſecond paſſage, as an "elderly perſon;" as this would aggravate his fault in not taking better care of "the young man that had been depoſited with him as his charge."</p>
               <p>IT will add weight to what has been offered, in defence of Clement's promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly uſing the words, Biſhop and Preſbyter, in that part of his ſtory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Apoſtle John, we have been conſidering, if we compare his uſe of the words here, with the uſe of them in ſtrom. lib, iii. p. 556, and ſtrom. ib. p. 552. In the former of theſe pages he ſays, "thoſe ought to be appointed BISHOPS, who, from
<pb n="459" facs="unknown:012009_0468_0F894077ADEE7410"/>
ruling their own houſe, have been exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed to rule the whole church." In the latter of them, his words are theſe, "He muſt be the huſband of one wife only, whether he be a PRESBYTER, or Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, or Laic, if he would uſe marriage without blame." Let it now be obſerved, theſe directions, reſpecting a "BISHOP'S ruling his own houſe," and a "PRESBY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER'S having but one wife," are both ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or rather cited, from the Apoſtle Paul's firſt epiſtle to Timothy, iiid ch. 2d and 4th v. where the words are theſe, "A Biſhop muſt be the huſband of one wife,"'- and "one that ruleth well his own houſe." Now, that very officer in the church, which the Apoſtle Paul calls a BISHOP, is called by Clement, in one of the above paſſages, a BISHOP; and, in the other, a PRES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BYTER. He muſt certainly mean, by PRESBYTER, preciſely the ſame officer, both he himſelf, and the Apoſtle Paul, meant by BISHOP: or there would be no pertinency in his application of theſe texts. This, I ſhould think, muſt be ſufficient to put it beyond all reaſonable diſpute, that the word, <hi>Preſbyteros,</hi> in Clement's ſtory of the Apoſtle John, is uſed in its APPROPRIATED ſenſe, to ſignify an officer in the church; and, as this officer, who
<pb n="460" facs="unknown:012009_0469_0F89407874615128"/>
is called a PRESBYTER, is alſo called a BISHOP, tho words muſt be conſidered as promiſcuouſly uſed to mean one and the ſame eccleſiaſtical officer: ſo the words are uſed, in the places we have compared with this; and no better reaſon can be given for their not being ſo uſed here, than that of ſerving an hypotheſis.</p>

IT is of ſtill more important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that Clement, in ſtrom. vii. p. 830, evidently appears to have had no knowledge of more than TWO ORDERS of officers in the Chriſtian church, that of <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> and that of <hi>Deacons.</hi> For, when he is purpoſely ſpeaking of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred eccleſiaſtical functions, he particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly mentions theſe TWO, and NO MORE. One, he conſiders as ſuperior, calling it <hi>beltiôtikê,</hi> becauſe intended and adapted to "make men better:" the other he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents as inferior, calling it <hi>upêretikê,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe deſigned for a lower kind of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. The ſuperior office he appropriates to PRESBYTERS; the inferior one to DEACONS: not giving the leaſt hint of any other, or higher office in the chriſtian church. Can this be accounted for, if he knew of any ORDER in the church higher than that, in which Preſbyters are
<pb n="461" facs="unknown:012009_0470_0F8940792FA7E3E0"/>
placed? Surely, if Biſhops were officers in the church of a ſuperior and higher order than Preſbyters, he would not have paſſed over this order of men in total ſilence, while he is particular in taking notice of the TWO LOWER ORDERS, that of Preſbyters, and that of Deacons. It is obſervable, he thought it proper, even in the very paſſage we are upon, to aſcend to heaven in comtemplation, that he might bring in the Angels of God as employed in the TWO KINDS of miniſtry he had been treating of; and yet, though Biſhops were, in his opinion, (as Epiſcopalians would have us believe) the moſt exalted order of church-officers Chriſt had upon earth, he ſays not a word about them, or any ſervice they had to do; while, at the ſame time, he takes particular notice both of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and Deacons, ſo much below Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops as not (comparatively) to deſerve being mentioned at all. This is truly aſtoniſhing! And Clement muſt be voted inexcuſable, unleſs we ſuppoſe, (what I take to be the certain truth) that with him, Biſhops and Preſbyters were one and the ſame order of men in the church, and might properly be ſpoken of under the name, either of Biſhop, or Preſbyter. And in this view of the matter, there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency,
<pb n="462" facs="unknown:012009_0471_0F894079EF7B3A48"/>
propriety, and cogency, in this diſcourſe of Clement: otherwiſe, it is, to ſay the leaſt, ſtrange and altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. IN the laſt place, it is further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, from what Clement has ſaid, in ſtrom. vi. p. 793, that he had no notion of more than TWO ORDERS of officers in the church of Chriſt; or, in other words, of Biſhops as the firſt and moſt ſuperior of THREE ORDERS. I have purpoſely given the reader the whole 13th ſection of this 6th book, that he might be able to take a complete view of what he has offered upon this head. And if he is pleaſed to attend to what is contained in this ſection, he will find, that neither Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, Preſbyters Deacons, or Laymen, are eſteemed, by Clement, excellent here, or intereſted in felicity hereafter, but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their chriſtian knowledge, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and goodneſs; that is, their being more or leſs perfect gnoſtics. In illuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this, he ſays,
<q>he is in reality a PRESBYTER in the church, and he is a true DEACON, who does, and teaches, the things of the Lord:—not account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a righteous man, becauſe a Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but becauſe a righteous man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="463" facs="unknown:012009_0472_0F89407AAE82F798"/>
choſen into the Preſbytery: and though he be not honored with the FIRST SEAT <note n="*" place="bottom">A friend of mine, well ſkilled in the Greek, and who has particularly acquainted himſelf with the writings of this Clement, is clearly of the mind, that the PRÔTOKA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THEDRIA, he here ſpeaks of, does not mean the FIRST CHAIR, SEAT, or PLACE in the PRESBYTERY, but the FIRST SESSION in the church here on earth, as well as in heaven. He had been ſaying, in the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preceeding words, a man's being "truly righteous" was the reaſon, in God's account, why he was "choſen into the Preſbytery"; and though he ſhould not be honored, here on earth, with the PRÔTOKATHEDRIA, the FIRST SESSION, he ſhould hereafter ſet down on the twenty-four thrones," the HIGHEST AD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VANCEMENT of the Saints in glory. He is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more explicit, upon this head, a little onwards, in this ſame ſection; where, ſpeaking of the "PROGRESSIONS of thoſe who have lived, according to the goſpel, in the perfection of righteouſneſs, he ſays, "theſe men, being taken up into the clouds, ſhall FIRST miniſter as DEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CONS, THEN be admitted to a RANK IN THE PRES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BYTERY; which means the ſame thing with what he had, a little before, ſpoken of as "being honored with the PRÔTOKATHEDRIA, the FIRST or HIGHEST SES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SION in the church, in the future ſtate of glory." I ſee not but this criticiſm of my friend is juſt: it certainly falls in with the method of reaſoning, Clement has gone into, throughout this whole paragraph. However, I was not willing to depart from that ſenſe of the word, in which it is univerſally taken (ſo far as my knowledge extends) by epiſcopal writers. In this ſenſe I have conſidered it; and offered that upon it which is, as I imagine, too force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be ſet aſide. The argument is much ſtronger upon the interpretation of my friend. If this exhibits the truth, it is put beyond all poſſible diſpute, that Clement knew of no HIGHER ORDER in the church than that of PRESBY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERS.</note> on earth, yet ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſit down on the twenty-four thrones, judging the people.</q>
It is at firſt ſight obvious, that Clement here makes mention of TWO ORDERS only in the church, that of PRESBYTERS, and that of DEACONS. And it is equally evident, that the firſt ſeat, he ſpeaks of, relates to the PRESBYTERY, and is the place of one, who is a conſtituent member, in common with the other Preſbyters, of this ſenate, or eccleſiaſtical body. But, what does he mean by this <hi>firſt ſeat</hi>? One, not biaſſed in his mind, would eaſily and naturally
<pb n="464" facs="unknown:012009_0473_0F89407B6F566880"/>
be led to underſtand, by it, the ſeat of the Head-Preſbyter, or Praeſes of the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. It cannot reaſonably be thought, that Clement meant by it a ſeat that was proper, not to a conſtituent member of the Preſbyterate, but to an officer in the church of another order, diſtinct from, and ſuperior to, that of Preſbyters. This would be to make him ſpeak very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly. For the <hi>firſt ſeat</hi> in a Preſbytery obviouſly and certainly imports a parity of <hi>eſſential</hi> powers in the perſons that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute this body; though one of them may, in ſome reſpects, for prudential<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, have the precedency, or ſuperiority, ſo as to be ſeated in the <hi>firſt chair.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="465" facs="unknown:012009_0474_0F89407C2F792320"/>THIS will appear in a yet fuller light, if we examine what Clement has offered, in this ſame ſection, upon the progreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the church here, and in glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. "Says he,
<q>Theſe progreſſions in the church here, of Biſhops, Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, Deacons, I take to be imitations of the angelical glory, and of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, which the ſcriptures tell us, they look for, who, following the ſteps of the Apoſtles, have lived, according to the goſpel, in the perfection of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: theſe men, being taken up into the clouds, ſhall firſt miniſter as Deacons, then be admitted to a rank in the Preſbytery according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of glory, (for one glory differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from another) until they grow up to a perfect man.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS paſſage, I am ſenſible, Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians bring as the ſtrongeſt teſtimony, from Clement, in favor of a threefold order in the church, under the ſpecified names of Biſhops, Preſbyters, and Deacons. But ſuch a conſtruction of the words will not at all conſiſt, either with the paſſage it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or what he has elſewhere ſaid upon this ſame ſubject. For, let it be obſerved,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="466" facs="unknown:012009_0475_0F89407CF06DB868"/>HE ſpeaks of theſe "progreſſions, as "imitations of the angelic glory." Upon which Sir Peter King, in his "enquiry into the conſtitution of the primitive church," p. 100, makes the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, in ſupport of the opinion, that only two eccleſiaſtical orders, viz. Biſhops and Deacons, or Preſbyters and Deacons, are noticed by Clement, namely, that "theſe orders are here reſembled by the angelic orders. Now, the ſcripture mentions but two orders, viz. Arch-Angels and Angels; the Arch-Angels preſiding over the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the Angels obeying, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Arch-Angels. According to this reſemblance, therefore, there muſt be but two eccleſiaſtical orders in the church, which are Biſhops or Preſbyters preſiding and governing, with the Deacons attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obeying." This paſſage has often been quoted from Sir Peter, as carrying conviction with it. But it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me, that Clement here intended to ſuggeſt, that there were no more than two orders of Angels, or that he at all made this thought the ground of the "imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the angelical glory," he ſpeaks of. You will then aſk, what does he ground it upon? This may be readily known by comparing his words here, with what he
<pb n="467" facs="unknown:012009_0476_0F89407DAD4B9C90"/>
ſays in ſtrom. vii. p. 830: where, having treated of the ſacred functions in TWO ORDERS only; the one ſuperior, which he appropriates to Preſbyters; the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, which he makes proper to Deacons, he then adds, that by BOTH THESE MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISTRIES the ANGELS ſerve God in the diſpenſation of the affairs of this earth." Having, in this place, ſpoken of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as employed in TWO KINDS of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, the one analogous to that of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, the other to that of Deacons, it ſhould ſeem obvious and natural, when he ſpeaks, in the paſſage under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the "progreſſions in the church, as imitations of the angelical glory," to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by theſe progreſſions, the paſſing from the lower miniſtry in the church, that of Deacons, to the higheſt which is a rank among Preſbyters. And let it be remembered here, it is the glory of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven to ſerve God in miniſtring to our earth; and their progreſſion in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo far as it reſpects their miniſtry in the TWO KINDS particularly mentioned by Clement, will be higher or lower accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the higher or lower nature of the TWO MINISTRIES in which they ſerve God in the diſpenſation of the things of this earth. And, in this view, the "pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions
<pb n="468" facs="unknown:012009_0477_0F89407E6EB6D108"/>
in the church" are "imitations of the evangelical glory." And thus it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained even by Clement himſelf. For, ſays he, thoſe, who
<q>treading in the ſteps of the Apoſtles, have lived in evangelical perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of righteouſneſs, being taken up into the clouds, ſhall <hi>firſt miniſter as</hi> DEACONS, <hi>then be admitted to a rank in the</hi> PRESBY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERY, according to the proceſſion in glory.</q>
Obſerve, their <hi>firſt</hi> advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is their <hi>miniſtring as</hi> DEACONS; their <hi>next</hi> and <hi>higheſt</hi> proceſſion is their being <hi>admitted into the</hi> PRESBYTERATE: though it ſhould be noticed here, there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion in <hi>degree</hi> even in the Preſbyterate. For Clement, in this very ſection, has told us of a FIRST SEAT in the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; which, if filled with a Praeſes, or Head-Preſbyter, under the name of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, will exactly anſwer the progreſſions of Biſhops, Preſbyters, Deacons here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of: nor can they be anſwered any other way, in conſiſtency with Clement's diſcourſe upon this ſubject, wherever he treats upon it. He ſpeaks in this ſection, and very particularly in ſtrom. vii. p. 830, of the two different orders of church-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, that of Preſbyters, and that of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, and mentions no more. Biſhops therefore, with him, could not be officers
<pb n="469" facs="unknown:012009_0478_0F89408018AB8958"/>
in the church of an order ſuperior to that of Preſbyters; though they might be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers having a precedency, a ſuperiority, in degree: as the Praeſes of a Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, though of the ſame order, is yet in degree above the reſt. And Clement has moſt obviouſly led us to conceive of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in this light, that is, as nothing more than the firſt, the chief, the higheſt, in degree among the members that conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute what he calls the Preſbytery. And, as he no where mentions any higher eccleſiaſtical ſenate, or body of men, or any higher order of officers in the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church, we are unavoidably conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to underſtand, by his Biſhop, the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Chairman, or he that occupies the firſt ſeat in the Preſbytery.</p>
               <p>I SHALL only add, the works of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we have extracted from are the laſt extant, within the ſecond century: nor did he write theſe, until nearly the end of it. Dodwell ſays, between the beginning of the year 193, and the end of the year 195. Du-pin places this Clement the firſt among the Fathers of the third cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. And yet, he cannot be brought as a WITNESS, in favor of the GRAND FACTS pleaded for by Epiſcopalians. Yea, in
<pb n="470" facs="unknown:012009_0479_0F894080ADCF0530"/>
the times after him, when there was a diſtinction in fact between Biſhops and Preſbyters, it is no eaſy matter to point out preciſely wherein it conſiſted. It is with me, paſt all doubt, that the idea of a Biſhop, as diſtinguiſhed from a Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, continually varied as corruption in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, until, by degrees, there was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced over the church an UNIVERSAL BI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHOP, under the name of THE POPE OF ROME.—But I muſt not go beyond the times to which this work is confined.</p>

            <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>I HAVE now, at the expence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time and pains, brought to view, and conſidered, according to the plan laid down at firſt, all that is ſaid, by all the genuine writers, until towards the going out of the ſecond century, (ſo far as their writings, either in whole, or in part, have reached us) relative to Epiſcopacy. And, upon a review of what has been offered, I cannot but expreſs my ſurpriſe at the aſſurance, with which ſome prelatical authors affirm it to be a FACT, UNIVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SALLY witneſſed to, even from the EAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIEST AGES, that Biſhops were officers in the church of an ORDER diſtinct from,
<pb n="471" facs="unknown:012009_0480_0F8940816F95CB10"/>
and ſuperior to, Preſbyters, in whom were lodged the excluſive powers of GOVERN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT, and ORDINATION. Says one of theſe writers, <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Scot's Chriſtian Life, vol. ii, p. 406.</note> "The Chriſtian church, in the ages next ſucceeding the Apoſtles, aſſerts with <hi>one univerſal conſent,</hi> the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal derivation of a ſuperior order of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtic officers from the Apoſtles to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide over the church." And again, <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 421.</note> "If any credit may be given, either to thoſe writers that lived in the apoſtolic age, or thoſe who immediately ſucceeded them, it is evident, that Epiſcopacy is nothing elſe but only the apoſtolical ſuperiority derived from the hands of the Apoſtles, in a continued ſucceſſion from generation to generation." Says another of theſe writers, <note n="‡" place="bottom">The invalidity of the diſſenting Miniſtry," in anſwer to a ſermon of Mr. Pierce's, p. 23.</note> "The ſtanding maxim of the epiſcopal ſcheme [namely, that ordaining power is appropriated to Biſhops, as an order in the church ſuperior to Preſbyters] has the earlieſt records of the church to ſupport it; and there was ſcarce any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of faith more firmly believed." And again, <note n="§" place="bottom">P. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>3.</note> "We have the ſame evidence, that Epiſcopacy (that is, Biſhops as
<pb n="472" facs="unknown:012009_0481_0F89408234528030"/>
diſtinct from, and ſuperior to, Preſbyters) was the government of the primitive church, in the pureſt ages of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, that we have for the CANON OF SCRIPTURE." Another author ſtill has theſe words, <note n="*" place="bottom">"Brief defence of epiſcopal ordination," p. 9.</note> "The Apoſtles leaving the power of ORDAINING PRESBYTERS in the hands of FIXED BISHOPS, being a matter of fact paſſed many years ago, the only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod by which we can come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it is, the teſtimony of writers, who lived in the apoſtolical and following ages." And this teſtimony he puts upon the fame foot with that we have for the ſacred ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>CAN it be ſuppoſed, that theſe writers had acquainted themſelves with the records of the ages that next ſucceeded the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles? Had this been the caſe, it ſhould ſeem impoſſible, however biaſſed in their minds, that they could have delivered their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents in language ſo replete with poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive aſſurance. Surely, they would not have put the teſtimonies in favor of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, upon a par with the teſtimonies in proof of the authority of the ſacred books of ſcripture. This muſt have been the effect, not only of deeply root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prejudice, but of an hearſay-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="473" facs="unknown:012009_0482_0F894082EDD66000"/>
only of the moſt ancient and truly primitive writings. It cannot eaſily be accounted for in any other way.</p>
            <p>AS the reader has had laid before him a full view of what is ſaid, upon the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Epiſcopacy, from the firſt hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ninety years, ſo far as it can be collected from the extant writings of the Fathers within this period, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining fragments of their writings, he may, from ocular inſpection, make a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory judgment in relation to this Epiſcopacy. Only, he ſhould keep in mind the GRAND POINT in queſtion, which is, what is the truth of FACT, in the records of the ages next to the Apoſtles, with reſpect to the ORDER, and OFFICE-POWER, of Biſhops? For the diſpute is not about the NAME of Epiſcopacy, but the THING intended by it. Prelatiſts ſay, the FACT univerſally handed down is, that Biſhops are an ORDER of officers in the church diſtinct from, and ſuperior to, Preſbyters; and that the powers of GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERNMENT, ORDINATION, and CONFIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MATION, are appropriated to them: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that Preſbyters no more exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed theſe powers, than Deacons baptiſed, or adminiſtred the Lord's ſupper. Let the reader have this conſtantly in his view, as it may reaſonably be expected he ſhould,
<pb n="474" facs="unknown:012009_0483_0F894083AF1FDBA8"/>
while he conſiders the teſtimonies that have been produced; and I may venture to ſay, with the higheſt aſſurance, that he will be in no danger of calling in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the authority of the new-teſtament-books, for want of teſtimonies in their behalf, though he ſhould utterly reject EPISCOPACY, in the impleaded ſenſe, as having no ſupport, either in point of RIGHT, or PRACTICE, from any thing he may have met with in the writers within the two firſt ages of the Chriſtian church. He is accordingly appealed to, and let him be judge; taking care to act his part, in this character, upon a fair, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, and thorough examination of the evidence that has been held out to his view.</p>
