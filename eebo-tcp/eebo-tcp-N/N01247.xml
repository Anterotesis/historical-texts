            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>PSALM LXXXII. 6, 7.</bibl>
               <q>I have ſaid, Ye are <hi>Gods:</hi> and all of you are Children of the moſt High: But ye ſhall <hi>Die</hi> like <hi>Men,</hi>—</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is a divine as well as wiſe &amp; juſt Remark, made by<note n="*" place="bottom">Monſieur Paſchal.</note> One of the greateſt <hi>Maſters</hi> of <hi>Thought</hi> in the Laſt Age, that Perſons of <hi>Quality</hi> and <hi>Character</hi> ought to have two <hi>Sets</hi> of thoughts, by which to regulate their Conduct: by the <hi>One</hi> they are to view themſelves in their State of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing <hi>Elevation,</hi> which is not from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> but Arbitrary <hi>Eſtabliſhment;</hi> by the <hi>Other</hi> they are to take a proſpect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001484_0004_0FB3545B332185F8"/>
in their Natural Condition of <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> and <hi>Equality</hi> with the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The bright Idea of their Dignity &amp; Power muſt be temper'd with the more cloudy Idea of their Frailty: A Seperation of theſe will lead into groſs Illuſions, and betray into Errors fatal to themſelves, and their Dependents: But an happy Union of theſe will afford light to direct them in the bright tracts of Subſtantial Glory; and forcible arguments to engage them to ſuch a management, as ſhall be glorious to themſelves, and happy to the World. The former proſpect will take them off from the falſe ſcent of honour, and inſpire them with inflaming Incentives to the moſt noble Actions, which will adorn their <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter;</hi> without the latter view they will be in the neareſt danger of being dazled with the Glare of Grandeur, and growing giddy by looking down from their State of Eminence upon thoſe beneath them: If the <hi>Great</hi> forget their <hi>Dignity</hi> they will under-act the vertues becoming their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; if they reflect not ſteadily on their <hi>Infirmity,</hi> they will over-act the powers of their <hi>Elevation.—Know thy ſelf</hi> is the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001484_0005_0FB3546650E19FF0"/>
firſt Leſſon in the School of Wiſdom, which becomes the <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Honourable,</hi> as well as others, to learn: and theſe juſt Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons both on their <hi>Excellency,</hi> and <hi>Frailty,</hi> will be found the <hi>firſt Elements</hi> of this Prudence. Theſe will prompt them ſo to act the part aſſigned them on the Stage of Life, that their External Condition may be found in Conjunction with the more valuable inherent Dignity of a vertuous Mind; that when Death ſhall ſhut up the preſent ſcene, a brighter ſcene of Glory may open upon them; and they appear with Superiour Characters on the Stage of true Glory and Immortality.</p>
            <p>And <hi>theſe thoughts</hi> are not only proper for <hi>Men of Name &amp; Power</hi> themſelves; but are inſtructive to ſuch as are under their Government: Theſe muſt view their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors in the Excellency of their Station, that they may pay them thoſe Regards due to the Impreſſions of <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> which they bear; yet they muſt behold them but as <hi>Gods,</hi> whoſe <hi>Dwelling is in fleſh,</hi> whoſe breath is in their Noſtrils, and may be ſoon Stopt; which will give check to a Spirit of flattery, regulate their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001484_0006_0FB3546B81DF2FE0"/>
from them, and make them diſclaim all undue confidences in the moſt dignify'd Wiſdom and Power on Earth.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>theſe two Set of Thoughts</hi> are in the moſt lively colours repreſented in the Words of our Text. <hi>I have ſaid ye are</hi> Gods, <hi>&amp;c. but ye ſhall dy like men.</hi> Which, if I miſtake not, will afford us Reflections proper to the work of this Day; and in which every part of this Audience may have their Portion.</p>
            <p>I hope there are none ſo vain as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that I appear this Day in this <hi>Awful Deſk,</hi> only to beat the Air, &amp; play the <hi>Orator</hi> in an Artful Addreſs to our <hi>Rulers,</hi> either by way of Unmannerly Satyr, or fulſome Panegyrick; This would not well become the <hi>Solemnity</hi> of this Place, nor the <hi>Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of my Audience; and much leſs would it Suit my <hi>own Character;</hi> Nor may it be ſuppoſed that I am called forth to read a Lecture in Politicks before our <hi>Venerable Senators;</hi> for thus I ſhould go beyond my <hi>own Line,</hi> and <hi>boaſt of a falſe Gift.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to keep in Mind what <hi>Place</hi> I ſtand in, In whoſe <hi>Name</hi> I Speak, what <hi>Critical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection</hi> I am under, and what an <hi>Awful
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001484_0007_0FB3546D5854BAB0"/>
Account</hi> I muſt give in of my preſent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance to our COMMON LORD and JUDGE; and under the commanding <hi>Awe</hi> of theſe thoughts, I ſhall endeavour to Speak; and muſt intreat my AU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIENCE, under the ſame <hi>Awe,</hi> to hear.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Pſalm,</hi> of which our Text is part, is ſtiled a <hi>Pſalm</hi> of <hi>Aſaph:</hi> Not becauſe it was directed to Aſaph the <hi>Levite</hi> and <hi>Singer,</hi> which lived in the dayes of David, but as I apprehend becauſe it was penn'd by <hi>Aſaph,</hi> the <hi>Seer,</hi> who lived about the dayes of Hezekiah: The Rulers of which Day are Stigmatized by the Prophet Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſaiah 1, 10.</note> as <hi>Rulers of Sodom.</hi> And this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture is ſtrengthen'd by the judgment of<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

The Pſalm is a warm Addreſs to thoſe that filled the Seats of Judgment; and is a loud Cry for Publick Juſtice; that truth and unbribed Judgment might Eſtabliſh their Tribunals: Here are adminiſtred the moſt pungent Rebukes for their Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Male-Adminiſtrations, and Criminal Diſorders, whereby the foundations of the State were put out of courſe; and the

main Pillars of Government ſapt; and Rulers are faithfully admoniſhed of the Duties of their Poſt, which God &amp; Men expect of them. To render this addreſs the more forcible it is introduced with the Solemn thoughts of the <hi>Preſence, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidency,</hi> and Inſpection of the Great God over ſuch, as are Exalted to Place of Rule over men. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>God ſtandeth in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Mighty; He Judgeth among the Gods:</hi> And that the Impreſſion of their Duty might be deep and durable, the bleſſed God who is the <hi>Only,</hi> and <hi>Supream Potentate</hi> of Heaven and Earth, is brought in as repreſenting to them, the beauty, luſtre and glory of their Character; ſo, giving them a dark Proſpect of the <hi>Land of Darkneſs</hi> to which they are haſtning, in a <hi>Solemn Memento</hi> of their Mortality, and that State Conſequent hereon, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Expects them. <hi>I ſaid ye are Gods,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but ye ſhall dye like Men.</hi> In which we have a <hi>Conceſſion,</hi> and a ſerious <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> or juſt Qualification of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>

               <hi>Power. I have ſaid ye are Gods; and all of you are Children of the Moſt High.</hi> In which we have two things obſervable.</p>

Tho' all men have the ſame Original, are of the ſame Make, and in many Articles ſtand upon the ſame level; yet I have appointed that there ſhall be ſome of a Superiour Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, advanced to Place, Power, and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity above others; I have made them <hi>Gods,</hi> and by my <hi>Inſtitution</hi> they muſt be treated <hi>as ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We have in this <hi>Conceſſion</hi> the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Character</hi> that God Himſelf has put upon <hi>Civil Rulers:</hi> and their Character carries in it the moſt Sublime Ideas of State and Magnificence, Power and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: They are Gods] Not by <hi>Nature</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Of theſe in their Order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> The <hi>Original</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> is <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</hi> It is from GOD, by his Soveraign Conſtitution and Appointment. <hi>I ſaid, Ye are Gods.</hi> It is not barely a <hi>Permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Divine Providence, but a <hi>Divine Inſtitution</hi> that there be Government in the World. It is no difficulty to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between particular <hi>Forms</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and Government it ſelf; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Perſons</hi> Exalted to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ſeveral Orders and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſuch in a State, and that Power which is devolved on them: The former are of <hi>Humane Determination,</hi> and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poinment; the latter of <hi>Divine Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Species</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the World is Various: There is a Democracy, Ariſtocracy, Monarchy,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001484_0014_0FB3547F2D4D8CA8"/>
and there is a mixture of theſe; where the Powers of Each are Limited, and brought to an happy Poiſe; where <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Privilege</hi> are ſo twiſted together, and inlay'd in the Foundation of the Conſtitution, as not to bear a ſeperation without a mutual Deſtruction; Power cant be Exerciſed, but the Privileges of the Ruled muſt be Maintained; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Privilege be Enjoyed, unleſs the Power of Rulers be Aſſerted and Supported. Now it cannot be ſay'd that This or the Other particular Species of Government is Inſtituted by GOD for this or that People. Nor is it ſuppoſeable that there is, or ever was, any State or Nation, that did inviolably, without ſome <hi>Alteration Eſſential,</hi> maintain the ſame Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. To be ſure <hi>Iſrael,</hi> GOD's Favourite People, had not always the ſame Model of Government; nor did GOD, who was, in a diſtinguiſhing Style <hi>their King,</hi> Ever preſcribe them ſuch a <hi>Scheme</hi> of <hi>Rule,</hi> which they might on no terms Vary from. <hi>Athens, Sparta,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> which in their Day appeared fixed in the full Centre of Light and Glory, ſuffer'd
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001484_0015_0FB3548157C16BC0"/>
ſeveral Revolutions and Changes in the main Frame of their Adminiſtrations: Nor has the Form of Government in our Nation, been juſt the ſame from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; which all muſt own that are not Strangers to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Story. The Determination of what Particular Form ſhould take place in this or that Nation, has been left to the Wiſdom of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; as long as the General deſign of Rule is provided for, and not Subverted. That Form which is moſt adapted for one People, may not be for another; Conſidering the various Cuſtoms, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Policies, Intereſts of Nations of Differing Climates.</p>
            <p>But this notwithſtanding, that there muſt be <hi>Government</hi> is not from the bare Will of men, but from the Moſt High, who <hi>Ruleth</hi> in the <hi>Kingdoms of Men,</hi> and giveth it to whom ſo ever he will: He has put his Soveraign Sanction upon it; and made it a fixed Ordinance of Heaven, that there be a Rule over Men; The <hi>God of Iſrael</hi> has ſay'd it, and the <hi>Rock of Iſrael</hi> has ſpoken it.</p>
            <p>There are Various <hi>Degrees</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:001484_0016_0FB354892793B6C0"/>
of men Engaged in the Adminiſtrations of Rule; who have differing Styles and Powers under Various Limitations, and Each Degree have their proper Sphere to move and act in: And the wayes of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting men to the Seat of Government, whether <hi>Supream</hi> or <hi>Subordinate,</hi> have been differing: and none of theſe have a ſpecial immediate <hi>Stamp of Divinity</hi> upon them. However it is the Soveraign Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Heaven that there ſhould be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Superiority and Rule in Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety's; and all Rulers of what Degree ſoever are <hi>Ordain'd of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This truth ſtands in the ſtrongeſt Point of Light in the Word of GOD; and will be Legible after all the attempts of any to Obſcure it. The unerring Oracles of Heaven has lay'd the Foundation of Civil Government firm in <hi>Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</hi> What ſhort of this can be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in many places? <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 6. The <hi>Powers that be,</hi> are <hi>Ordain'd of God. And there is no Power but of God.</hi> Has not God ſay'd, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15. By me Kings Reign, and Princes Decree Juſtice? Why are Rulers called <hi>God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s Miniſters? Rom.</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:001484_0017_0FB3549076B68010"/>
13. 4. Is it not a Command of Heaven? <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 18. <hi>Judges and Officers ſhalt thou make thee in all thy Gates?</hi> Nothing ſurely ſhort of Divine Ordination could juſtify thoſe Apoſtolick Enforcements of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Rulers, not only <hi>for Wrath,</hi> but <hi>for Conſcience ſake;</hi> not barely for <hi>Man'</hi>s, but for <hi>the Lord's ſake, Rom.</hi> 13. 5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. Were not the Original of Power from GOD, it could never be ſay'd, that he that reſiſteth the <hi>Power,</hi> reſiſteth the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance</hi> of GOD, as, <hi>Rom</hi> 13. 2.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of Government, is founded on Reaſon; and GOD has done it in Infinite Wiſdom, and in Kindneſs to men. There would doubtleſs have been Order and Civil Subordination among men, had they ſtill walked in the bliſsful Shades of Paradiſe in their Native Light, Purity, and Glory. Sure we may be ſince the Apoſtaſy, there is Abſolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Superiority, and Power in ſome, and Inferiority and Submiſſion as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. He well underſtood the Nature of men, and of Humane Societies, that ſay'd, <hi>Nihil AEqualitate ipſa inequalius.</hi> That nothing is more unequal than E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001484_0018_0FB3549C588A8820"/>
Were there no Government, all Mankind would be Engaged in an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural State of <hi>War.</hi> There could be nothing of Beauty, Proportion, Strength, Unity, Order in Societies: <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> would be Expoſed to fatal Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The Flood-gates of Luſts would be open, and a Deluge of Sin and Woe would Sweep away all that is pleaſant &amp; deſireable in the World. Men would be like <hi>Fiſhes</hi> in the Sea, and as <hi>Beaſts</hi> in the Wilderneſs, the greater devour the leſs. Was it not a Terrible Day with Iſrael, when that Complaint was moaned out? <hi>There was no King in Iſrael, but every one did that which was right in his own Eyes.</hi> GOD by appointing Government has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the good of the World. <hi>Leveliſm,</hi> is therefore an open Defiance to GOD, his Wiſdom and Will, as well as the Reaſon of Mankind. Thus we have ſeen the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Original</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> aſſerted: and this is no undue Complement to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for <hi>GOD Himſelf</hi> has ſaid it: <hi>I ſaid ye are Gods.</hi> And ſo we come to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Article to be conſider'd, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>

               <hi>II.</hi> We are to conſider the <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> put upon Rulers. They are <hi>Gods</hi> &amp; <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Moſt High:</hi> And it is not an Empty Name, but full both of <hi>Dignity</hi> &amp; <hi>Duty.</hi> This Character aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and adorned by the vertues it leads to, will give us the moſt beautiful view of the Glory of Rulers; which they may purſue with the greateſt Stretch of all their Powers.</p>
            <p>And if we would take a <hi>view</hi> of what of Glory and Duty is included in this Divine Character and Name, that GOD has put upon them; Let us Conſider three things, which ſeem Evidently intended, and poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at in this Title, and under which the Glory of their Character is comprehended.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Character intends that Rulers are Gods, as they are <hi>Gods Vice-gerents,</hi> and <hi>Deputies,</hi> and as they bear his viſible <hi>Image.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It Suggeſts that the <hi>Deſign</hi> of the Inſtitution of Civil Government is, That <hi>Rulers</hi> may be <hi>Gods</hi> to a People, <hi>i. e. Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> and great <hi>Bleſſings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It Suggeſts that Rulers can only <hi>Aſſert</hi> the <hi>Dignity</hi> of their Character;
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001484_0020_0FB354A6557DC138"/>
and anſwer the <hi>End</hi> of their Inſtitution by Imitating the Bleſſed GOD, and making his Government, their <hi>Pattern,</hi> and <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard.</hi> Nothing leſs I think can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this Title; and hardly any thing beyond, but what may be reduced under one or other of theſe Heads. Which we are now to Conſider.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>Rulers are Gods,</hi> as they are GOD's <hi>Vicegerents,</hi> and bear his <hi>Viſible Image.</hi> Theſe ſtand in GOD's Place, repreſent his Perſon, and act by his Authority, and Commiſſion. The Power of the greateſt Potentate on Earth is not <hi>Inherent</hi> in him, but is a <hi>Derivative;</hi> and but a faint Beam of that Power which is in GOD in it's <hi>full force</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> Eſſentially and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently: For GOD is the Source and <hi>Original</hi> of all Power; there is no Power but what is derived from him, depends on him, is limited by him, and is ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to him, and accountable. GOD is the Supream Governour among the Nations; It is his Prerogative to Rule in the Kingdoms of Men; and has Right, as well as Might, to give them to whom he Pleaſes, to Set up, and Spurn down
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001484_0021_0FB354A9B9E57CC8"/>
Rulers at Pleaſure; and when he pours Contempt upon Princes, cuts aſunder their Spirits, and is terrible to the Kings of the Earth, none can ſay to him what doſt thou? He has both <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Ability</hi> to Govern All by himſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Mediation of any Second Being; but he has choſen in wiſe Condeſcention to ſet up Men of the ſame Make and Infirmities with our ſelves, whoſe Terrors might not over-power us, to Act in his Name and Stead: All Government be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs Originally to GOD himſelf, but he has deputed &amp; delegated Magiſtrates to act for him, and in Subordination to him; and to theſe his Subſtitutes he has Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated Power and Judgment: By GOD<note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. 8 16.</note> 
               <hi>Princes Rule, Nobles,</hi> and <hi>all the Judges</hi> of the Earth. The Throne they are Seated on is GOD's. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 23. <hi>Solomon Sat upon the Throne of the</hi> LORD, <hi>as King.</hi> It is his Sword of Juſtice that they are Arm'd with, and muſt be Weilded for him, and in his Service. <hi>The Judgment is the</hi> LORD's. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
            <p>It is vain indeed to pretend that this
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001484_0022_0FB354AE4CED6708"/>
Power is derived immediately from GOD; but mediately in various ways according to the diverſe Conſtitutions of Kingdoms, and States: It may not be aſſerted that the particular Perſons on whom the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Government is devolved, are of GOD's ſpecial <hi>Deſignation</hi> and <hi>Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> yet they hold under GOD, they are Gods ſubordinate to him whoſe Name is JEHOVAH; His Authority they are veſted with, and his Power they Exert in the diſcharge of the Duties of their Station. Theſe are the <hi>Shields</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and as ſuch belong to GOD. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47 <hi>ult.</hi> Their Power and Work is GOD's. Hence <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> from this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made his Charge to his Judges the more Solemn. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 6. <hi>He ſay'd to the Judges; take heed what ye do: for ye Judge not for Man, but for the</hi> LORD, <hi>who is with you in the Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> Rulers as they are delegated by GOD, ſo they bear his <hi>Image,</hi> and the viſible Impreſs of his Glory and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. There is not only an Inviſible and Spiritual Image of GOD, which conſiſts in Righteouſneſs and all the Graces of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001484_0023_0FB354B24C03A348"/>
Holineſs: But there is an External and Viſible Image of GOD, which conſiſts in the External Characters of Glory, Power and Majeſty; which are impreſſed on ſuch, as are Exalted to <hi>Rule</hi> over men. Agreeably, Rulers are <hi>Living Images</hi> of the Great LORD of the World, whoſe Subſtitutes they are. A viſible Divine Glory is ſhed upon them; the bright Rays of Divine Greatneſs, and Power do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle them: which Challenge Awe and Reverence from all about them; and the due apprehenſion hereof is enough to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire Rulers with the moſt Noble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to act in a becoming ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to, and as may make an agreeable Repreſentation of GOD, with whom is Dominion and Fear.</p>
            <p>By their <hi>Office, Authority</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> they Participate in a Degree of that Power, which all the Armies of Heaven ſtoop before; and hereby make diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing approaches to GOD, and bear ſome faint Reſemblance of him, who ſits on the Throne of Majeſty; tho' after all <hi>Infinite</hi> and <hi>Awful</hi> is <hi>the Diſtance.</hi> In this reſpect Rulers are Gods. And when
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001484_0024_0FB354B3BA6D2F10"/>
theſe External Characters of Power and Greatneſs are found in Conjunction with the more Noble Characters of Inward Greatneſs, their Title will appear with a Diviner Luſtre, and their Authority more Awful and Influential. This is the firſt thing included in the Title given them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Title Suggeſts, the great. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> of the Inſtitution of Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, is that Rulers may be <hi>Gods</hi> to a People, <hi>i. e.</hi> Diffuſive Bleſſings to the Publick: When the Great LORD of the World is pleaſed to ſtyle himſelf the GOD of a Perſon or People, it certainly intends that He will Bleſs them, and Promote their Happineſs; Employ his Wiſdom, Power, Juſtice and Goodneſs with his other Perfections, for their Peace and Proſperity, Security, Protection and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In conformity to this, Rulers are <hi>Gods,</hi> when they Employ their Authority, and Influence, act the Vertues and Powers of Government they are Endow'd with, for the Good and Happineſs of the People under their Conduct. To be great <hi>Bleſſings</hi> to Men is to be <hi>Gods</hi> to them. And ſuch have moſt of <hi>Divinity,</hi> true Majeſty and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001484_0025_0FB354B506A6F508"/>
Glory, as diſpenſe the moſt benign and cheriſhing Influences upon all about them; and are moſt uſeful and ſerviceable to the true Intereſt of the State they ſtand related to. Power and Knowledge will not alone conſtitute a Divine Greatneſs; Theſe are found to a great degree in the moſt <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Beings,</hi> who are nothing but Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Nature, and Government of GOD. It is not a true <hi>Divine Greatneſs</hi> and Superiority to have more Power, Riches and Knowledge than others; but to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all theſe Advantages to do more <hi>Good</hi> to the World; and be greater bleſſings to thoſe under their Inſpection. Now Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs appears with Advantage; ſuch are like the Great Light of Heaven which diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes its Influences far and wide; they are as a Publick Fountain, whoſe waters flow down to all; and the whole People drink of them, and are refreſhed thereby; and every one will be ready to own the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter they bear, ſtile them <hi>Gods, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Higheſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus <hi>this Splended Title,</hi> given to Rulers, leads us to the <hi>Original deſign</hi> of their <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> which is the <hi>Publick Good.</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:001484_0026_0FB354B6821A6BF0"/>
It tells us what the Governing deſign of Government ought to be in all acts of Power whether <hi>Legiſlative</hi> or <hi>Executive:</hi> What Bleſſings all Rulers ought to be, and <hi>Good Ones</hi> will be to a People. Their Power is deſigned but as<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 13. 4.</note> a <hi>Miniſtry</hi> under GOD, for the good of Men: That under their ſhadow they may have ſweet Repoſe, Lead Quiet and Peaceable Lives in all Godlineſs and Honeſty: They are to be the <hi>Guardians</hi> of their Religion and Property, their Liberties, Civil &amp; Sacred: That in their Watchfulneſs, Care, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fatigues, their People may ſecurely ſit under their own Vines and Figtrees, take their Reſt, and enjoy their Lives, Eſtates, Friends, and innocent Pleaſures without Annoyance. That Rulers are to be the <hi>Guardian Angels</hi> of the State to Watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and Miniſter to it: As the <hi>Lights</hi> of the World to direct, warm and cheriſh all under their Influence; to be as the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,</hi> and <hi>Pillars</hi> of a building; who are to preſerve the State from a <hi>Diſſolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The very Nature of things, and the Primary Intention of GOD in the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001484_0027_0FB354B9DDB51A40"/>
of Civil Government, certainly points us to the general Happineſs &amp; Proſperity, which Rulers ought to have <hi>in view.</hi> The true meaſure of Government we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably laid down by the Spirit of GOD, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 3. As <hi>a Rule over Men,</hi> which is thus deſcanted on by<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Barnet.</note> a <hi>Maſterly hand.</hi> 
               <q>It is a <hi>Rule,</hi> and not an <hi>Abſolute Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or an Arbitrary Power, without Lawes and Meaſures; It is a <hi>Rule</hi> over <hi>Men,</hi> and not a Power like that, which we have over <hi>Beaſts,</hi> Rule ſuited to the Principles of Reaſon, to the Nature of Man, and the Ends of Civil Society; it is a Conduct over free and reaſonable Beings, who need indeed to be <hi>Governed,</hi> but ought not to be <hi>Broken</hi> by the force, and weight of Power.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It was never deſigned either by GOD or Men; that ſome ſhould be advanced to Power and Dignity, to raiſe their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Glory, either in Oppoſition to, or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration from the happineſs of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.

<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001484_0028_0FB354BAF419FB70"/>
Rules of Government, and the particular Lawes Stated in a Land. Government was never ordained that Some men might have Advantage to be <hi>Beaſts of Prey,</hi> to the feebler part of Mankind; nor that Others ſhould be under a neceſſity of becoming <hi>Beaſts of Burden;</hi> for this would be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of the very End of all Rule. Men enjoy the Name and Power of GOD, not to make themſelves Great and Terrible; to make any tremble but the <hi>Evil doer;</hi> not that they may have the Opportunity to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the Ravenous Luſts of Dominion, Pride and Covetouſneſs: for thus they would bear the Character and Image, not of GOD, but of the <hi>Grand Enemy</hi> and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer of Mankind. But the deſign of all the Power, Greatneſs, and Superiority communicated to them from GOD, is that they may approve themſelves <hi>Gods</hi> to the World, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Greateſt Benefactors.</hi> When Rulers anſwer therefore this Character, they will have no greater joy than to ſee their People flouriſh in Wealth, Strength and Peace; famous for all thoſe Vertues of Righteouſneſs, that Exalt a Nation: They will make the true Glory and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity

We now come to the Third &amp; Laſt thing included in this Title.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It ſuggeſts that Rulers can only <hi>Aſſert</hi> the <hi>Dignity</hi> of their Character, and <hi>Anſwer</hi> the <hi>End</hi> of their Inſtitution, by <hi>Imitating</hi> the bleſſed GOD, and making his <hi>Government</hi> their <hi>Pattern</hi> and <hi>Standard.</hi> They muſt be <hi>God-like,</hi> in their Perſonal Endowments and Publick Managements. They muſt be <hi>Gods</hi> by reſembling the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed GOD in the Perſonal Excellencies of their Minds, in thoſe Vertues &amp; Graces, which are the Image of GOD on the Soul. <hi>External Dignity</hi> challenges <hi>Inherent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency:</hi> The greateſt Glory, Perfection, Beauty and Nobility, muſt conſiſt in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001484_0030_0FB354C14417ED88"/>
to the Communicable Perfections, and Beauties of the Divine Nature; and the Participations of theſe Vertues, and Divine Characters, which are Propounded for the Reaſonable Creatures Imitation in his <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Meaſure.</hi> Without this Reſemblance they will foully ſlurr their Character, reproach Government, and render it Ridiculous: <hi>Folly</hi> ſet in great <hi>Dignity</hi> will make but an odd Figure; and afford a ſpectacle which will be rather hooted at, than reverenced and obey'd.</p>
            <p>And <hi>as</hi> they are to <hi>Imitate GOD</hi> in the Sublime qualities of the <hi>Mind;</hi> ſo in their <hi>Adminiſtrations.</hi> Rulers muſt ſet GODS Government before them, and endeavour to Form themſelves in their whole Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement by this perfect Model. Their <hi>Rule</hi> muſt be a <hi>Lively Emblem</hi> of the Beauty and Excellency, Perfection and Advantage of <hi>GODS Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here it is neceſſary to obſerve, that GOD, tho' He be <hi>Lord Paramount</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth; and his Sovereignty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable, being Infinite, Abſolute and Independent; yet He alwayes Exerciſes his Supream Authority according to the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001484_0031_0FB354C61D8E3538"/>
               <hi>Rules</hi> of the moſt Conſummate Wiſdom, Spotleſs Righteouſneſs, Unblemiſh'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and Diffuſive Goodneſs. He governs not by unaccountable Will, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant humour, which are imperfections his Nature can't ſuffer, but by <hi>Stable Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> as may beſt ſuit the Nature and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his Subjects, and the Noble End of his Government.</p>
            <p>Hence Rulers, of all Orders, ought to conform to and regulate themſelves in all their Adminiſtrations, by this Divine Standard. Their Government ſhould be a <hi>Tranſcript,</hi> and <hi>Viſible Image</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Rule.</hi> And the more Exactly they conform to this Meaſure; the nearer they approach in their Rule over Men to the Divine Pattern; the brighter will be the Characters of Divine Glory reflected on them; This Imitation of GOD is neceſſary to Maintain the juſt honours of their Station, to anſwer the End of their Elevation, and the deſign of Government it ſelf. And here I ſhall mention a few Capital Articles, in which Rulers <hi>as Gods,</hi> are to <hi>Imitate</hi> the <hi>Glorious GOD:</hi> All which will be found Eſſential to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Gods,</hi> imprinted on them.

I. As <hi>Gods</hi> they muſt be <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi> The Supream Governour of the World is the <hi>Only Wiſe GOD:</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. He is Wiſdom in the Abſtract: <hi>Prov</hi> 8. 14. <hi>Counſel is Mine, and Sound Wiſdom: I am Underſtanding.</hi> This Attribute appears with Surprizing brightneſs in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World. When the Methods of Providence are moſt Unſearchable, there is then Reaſon to cry out; <hi>Oh the depth! both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of GOD!</hi> He fully underſtands the Nature, and Powers of all Creatures; all things in their ſeveral Relations and Dependencies, the fitneſs of Means to propounded Ends; and hence acts all things according to the Rules of the moſt Conſummate Wiſdom; and has in all Ages ſo turned the Wheels of Providence, as might ſuit the End of Government: &amp; as became the infallible Conduct of Him, who is <hi>Great in Counſel,</hi> That is placed <hi>above</hi> on the THRONE.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In proprotion,</hi> Rulers on Earth are <hi>Gods,</hi> becauſe they are herein to reſemble the Eternal KING, the only Wiſe GOD; and muſt partake of his Wiſdom. This qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification <hi>Moſes</hi> gives of Rulers: <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 13.

               <hi>Take ye Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding Men.</hi> The want of Skill &amp; Prudence in Rulers, will bring Government into Contempt: The <hi>End</hi> of Rule can't be attained, nor the <hi>Dignity</hi> of their Station ſupported. Blind Guides, unskilful Pilots are a Soleciſm in terms; &amp; threaten no common miſchief to thoſe that are under their Conduct. It is condemned by the wife <hi>Socrates,</hi> as an Error too common in the World, yet moſt fatal to the good of it; that while ſeveral years are thought little enough to be ſpent in acquiring the ſkill of any Trade, how Mean and Mechanical ſo ever it may be; yet, in caſe of Publick Adminiſtrations of Government, which of all Profeſſions has moſt of Difficulty and Intricacy, every one is ready to think himſelf abundantly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifyed; and ſuch, as are of very Indifferent improvements in Knowledge, are too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Exalted, and ſet in Places of Dignity. It is a judgment, bigg with many Woes, when<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſaiah 3 3. 4.</note> God takes away the <hi>Prudent</hi> from a People, and gives them <hi>Children</hi> to be their Princes, and <hi>Babes</hi> to Rule over them. The wiſe Man Pronounces a Woe upon
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001484_0034_0FB354CF3788A8D8"/>
ſuch a People: <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>Woe unto thee, O Land, when thy King is a Child.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the contrary, it is an happy Omen upon a Land, when Rulers are like the Heads of Iſſachar:<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Chron. 12. 32</note> Men that had <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Times,</hi> to <hi>Know what Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el ought to do.</hi>

               </note> That City, ſays a Wiſe Heathen, is happy, whoſe Governour is a Philoſopher, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Man of Wiſdom. And a greater Philoſopher has aſſured us, that by a <hi>Man of Underſtanding the State of a Land is prolonged,</hi> Prov. 28. 2.

<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001484_0035_0FB354D26C8F8050"/>
for Government, will be but of little, and uncertain uſe without Prudence. <hi>Zeal</hi> &amp; <hi>Courage</hi> without ſkill to direct their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and temper their heat, will many times do more harm than good; they will either miſtake their object, or exceed in degree; which too often cauſes no ſmall confuſions. <hi>Integrity,</hi> and good <hi>Intention</hi> are not ſufficient to ſecure Government from contempt, nor the State from Ruine, without a Spirit of Judgment to direct the choice of proper Means for the Publick ſafety: This Skill and Prudence gives a luſtre to other Excellences that qualify Men for Government, and render them influential to the happineſs of a Common Wealth. It was <hi>Davids</hi> Glory, and <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſafety; that he was <hi>Wiſe as an Angel of GOD;</hi> and guided them by the <hi>Skilfulneſs</hi> of his hands, as well as according to the <hi>Integrity</hi> of his heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 72.</p>
            <p>It muſt be acknowledged, that the ſame degree of Wiſdom, nay the ſame kind of Knowledge, is not equally neceſſary to every Ruler: As there are different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and Stations in Government; ſo Wiſdom has its ſeveral gradations; and is,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001484_0036_0FB354D3CE4EEB08"/>
as to <hi>Sort,</hi> and <hi>Degree,</hi> to be proportioned to the ſeveral Characters, and Offices that are ſuſtained: That Knowledge that may qualify for the <hi>Counſel Board,</hi> may not for the <hi>Tribunal of Juſtice:</hi> Superior Wiſdom is requiſite for a Superior Station in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: Yet every Order of Rulers muſt have a due proportion of it.</p>
            <p>Again, The State and Circumſtance of a People may be more perplexed, difficult, and intricate at one Day than an other; either by reaſon of the darkneſs and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Divine Providence, or the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of evil humours among a People themſelves: and ſuch a day requires great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er force and light of Underſtanding in Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: A Storm requires greater ſkill than a calm.</p>
            <p>Thus the ſtile of <hi>Gods</hi> requires that Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers reſemble GOD in this Divine Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, that they may maintain their Glory, and anſwer the End of their Creation. There muſt be Wiſdom to judge what Laws are proper to be made, and what Sanctions are proper to enforce them; there muſt be Wiſdom to underſtand the Publick Powers, and Private Rights and
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001484_0037_0FB354D607197D58"/>
Privileges to be preſerved, and the Laws which are to be Executed: There is an happy <hi>Dexterity</hi> and <hi>Skill</hi> in governing, and adminiſtring the affairs of the Publick to the beſt advantage; which is a rare Talent, which Rulers are allow'd to Covet. This comprehends in it a ſuitable Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the complexion and humours of the People committed to their truſt; what Diſtempers they are moſt lyable to, and what Remedies moſt proper for them, and what the right Seaſons to make the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications whether for Prevention, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Remedy: There muſt be ſkill in the general Maxims of Government, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a pertinent Application of theſe to Emergent caſes, that by an orderly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the great affairs &amp; deſigns of a State, be carry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d on to an happy Concluſion: There is to this requiſite a Penetrating <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity</hi> to foreſee Publick dangers, &amp; a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable <hi>Precaution</hi> to guard againſt them: And for this End Rulers ſhould be men of deep Thought, good Experience, and of great Preſence of Mind; that they may not be ſhoved beyond their reaſon by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unexpected Emergencies; but that
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001484_0038_0FB354D7729F6960"/>
they may maintain their temper unſhockt, and well lay'd deſigns unbroken, what ever may aſſault them.</p>
            <p>Thus, they that are <hi>Gods</hi> among Men muſt labour to partake of Divine Wiſdom, and reſemble GOD, who is wonderful in Counſel, and excellent in Working. Thus God-like was <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Daniel;</hi> an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Spirit, the Spirit of Wiſdom, like to GOD, was found in them; On the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of which they were raiſed to the firſt Seat of Government; <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Court of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Perſia.</hi> And when Rulers are deſtitute of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, their Dignity will be degraded, their Duty neglected, and will too well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Character given of <hi>Coniah, not Gods,</hi> but deſpiſed broken <hi>Idols; Veſſels,</hi> wherein is <hi>no pleaſure,</hi> Jer. 22. 28.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Rulers, <hi>as Gods,</hi> muſt be <hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>Juſt</hi> in all their Adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p>The Sceptre of GODS Throne is a <hi>Scepter of Righteouſneſs:</hi> Clouds &amp; Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs many times incircle the Throne of Heaven, yet RIGHTEOUSNESS and <hi>Judgment</hi> are always the <hi>Habitation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:</hi> For he is the <hi>Juſt GOD,</hi> and can do no

wrong. And nothing can be more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the Divine Government, than when Iniquity ſitteth in the Seat of Juſtice; and Oppreſſion is found in the Place of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Jehoſophat</hi> enforces his charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Judges with the Conſideration of the Divine Righteouſneſs, &amp; Impartiality. 2 Chron. 19. 6, 7. <hi>Take heed what you do, for ye judge not for Man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment: Wherefore let the fear of the Lord be upon you: for there is no iniquity with the Lord God, nor Reſpect of Perſons, nor taking of Gifts.</hi>

Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is the Glory of GOD; and an Imitation of Him herein will be the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Rulers, and the happineſs of the Ruled.

That Rulers are to be Living Fountains of Juſtice among men, and Righteouſneſs muſt flow from them in their Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as naturally, fully, and freely as Streams from a <hi>Living Fountain,</hi> with Eaſe and Plenty, and for Univerſal uſe; where all may come and drink, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed; <hi>Streams</hi> that will Water and Cheriſh all; guard and ſecure what ever is good among a People, and make it with their moiſture to thrive and flouriſh; and <hi>Righteouſneſs as a mighty Stream: as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſible River.</hi> So the <hi>Seventy</hi> read it, <hi>i. e.</hi> Let the Streams of Juſtice be ſo deep and wide that the biggeſt, boldeſt and moſt ſubtle Tranſgreſſors may deſpair to leap over, or ford them: But be ſtopt in their Career, and brought to a ſtand by them.

This would give a State the Reputation of a <hi>City</hi> of

               <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and a <hi>Faithful City.</hi> Hence, this Character of Rulers requires that <hi>Righteouſneſs be the Girdle of their Loins:</hi> That they take care that Righteous Laws be Enacted, none but ſuch, and all ſuch, as are neceſſary for the Safety of the Religion &amp; Liberties of a People: Juſtice muſt be Exerciſed in guarding the Laws with Righteous Penalties, from the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages and Inſults of the Sons of <hi>Belial:</hi> There muſt be Righteouſneſs in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the Laws, both in matters of Civil Juſtice, and Criminal: Rulers muſt be Juſt to GOD in maintaining His Right; to their own Characters, and to their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Juſt to the Laws, and the Eſtabliſhed Conſtitution they are under; and Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Rulers muſt be Juſt to their Prince, as well as to the whole Community, and every Member of it: They muſt take care that they do not Pervert Juſtice them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor ſuffer others under them to Pervert it, and turn Judgment into Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood; that GOD may not complain that <hi>He looked for Judgment,</hi> but behold <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion;</hi> for <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> but behold <hi>a Cry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence their Adminiſtrations of juſtice
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001484_0043_0FB354E1F23E3E60"/>
muſt be with <hi>Impartiality;</hi> for this is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. This Charge <hi>Moſes</hi> gave to Rulers, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 17. Ye ſhall not <hi>reſpect Perſons in Judgment;</hi> but you ſhall hear the <hi>Small</hi> as <hi>well as the Great;</hi> You ſhall not be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the face of Man,</hi> for the Judgment is GOD's. A Criminal Partiality in Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers portends Ruine to a State. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Rulers as <hi>Gods</hi> not to be ſwayed by Perſonal Favour or Prejudice, by Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Advantages, and Views. Friendſhip muſt not byaſs Rulers; but they muſt be like <hi>Levi</hi> know neither Father nor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Brother nor Siſter in the cauſe of Juſtice. There is good Inſtruction in the Carriage of that Heathen, who upon his Advancement into Government, took a ſolemn Farewel of his Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; intimating thereby that they muſt not expect from him any Regards in the Diſcharge of his Office, but what others ſhould have an equal Claim to. And it was a juſt Rebuke, that <hi>Rutilius</hi> a Noble <hi>Roman,</hi> gave to a particular Friend, who Reproach'd him for Breach of Friendſhip, in denying his Unjuſt Petition; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that he could with Eaſe bear the loſs of ſuch

a Friend, whoſe Friendſhip was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved on ſuch hard Terms, as breaking through the Rules of Juſtice and Honour. To accept Perſons in Judgment is not good, <hi>Prov</hi> 24. 25. Rulers muſt not be lead out of the way of Juſt and Right, either by undue Favour to Friends, or unjuſt Prejudice againſt Enemies. There is alſo a Criminal Tenderneſs &amp; Compaſſion to the Poor, as well as a Faulty Reſpect to the Rich, which is equally an Enemy to Juſtice, and muſt be avoided: The Small as well as Great are to be heard; yet the Small no more than Great to be Reſpected in their Cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> Rulers are not to be moved by Fear; they muſt not fear the Faces of men. Courage is a neceſſary Qualification in a Ruler. The Ballances of Juſtice ſhould be held ſteadily; but this can't be where Fear makes the Heart and Hand to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. They that are like <hi>Ephraim, Silly Doves, without an Heart,</hi> are a Reproach to Government; and can never maintain the Honour, nor diſcharge the Duties of their Character. The Sword of Juſtice in a Cowards Hand will never be, either a

Protection to the Innocent, or Terror to the Guilty.</p>

               <hi>Again,</hi> As <hi>Gods</hi> they muſt not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by Private Advantage: It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlike for Rulers to Cry, <hi>Give, Give.</hi> It is inconſiſtent with the End of Rule, and will be a deep ſtain upon Government; when Juſtice is Bought and Sold: and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes Rulers to the Rebukes of a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous GOD; for the Tabernacles of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery peculiarly ly open to the Devouring Flames of Heaven. And how unbecoming it will be ſuch, who bear the <hi>Name of GOD</hi> upon them thus to Proſtitute Juſtice! Thus Impartial ought Rulers to be in their Adminiſtrations. And it is but what the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of mankind approves of. And the Admonitions hereof were given by the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who were wont to pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray their Rulers <hi>Blind</hi> and <hi>without Hands; Blind</hi> that they might not reſpect Perſons, and without <hi>Hands,</hi> that they might receive no Gifts; which the Wiſe man tells us will Blind the Eyes of the Wiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> As Rulers muſt Adminiſter Juſtice with <hi>Impartiality,</hi> ſo they muſt <hi>Temper</hi> Juſtice with <hi>Lenity;</hi> for this is
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001484_0046_0FB354EC571057B8"/>
to be like GOD: <hi>Lenity</hi> to Particular Perſons, ſometimes may be a Publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury: yet ſometimes <hi>Mercy</hi> is Juſtice; and not to ſhow it would be an Injury. Extream Right is often Extream Wrong. Rulers may be <hi>overmuch Righteous;</hi> when Laws are interpreted in their utmoſt Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and accordingly Executed, when there is a Latitude in the Law, and the End might be obtained by taking it in the moſt Favourable ſence; <hi>Mercy preſerveth the King,</hi> and <hi>upholds his Throne, Prov.</hi> 20. 28. All Laws muſt not, like <hi>Draco'</hi>s be writ in Blood. Puniſhments muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the Nature, and degree of Crimes. There are the <hi>Rods</hi> as well as <hi>Axes</hi> of Rulers. Thus it is <hi>Divine</hi> in Rulers to temper the ſeverity of Juſtice with Clemency: It is an Imitation of GOD; for <hi>Judgment</hi> is GOD's <hi>ſtrange Work;</hi> but <hi>Mercy</hi> is his <hi>Delight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>As Gods</hi> a <hi>Fatherly Affection, Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion</hi> to their People muſt breathe forth in all their Adminiſtrations. This is the Character of GOD's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over his People. In <hi>all their Affliction he is Afflicted for them:</hi> And when he is
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001484_0047_0FB354EF22D92C50"/>
conſtrain'd to chaſtize them, it is with a Fathers hand and bowels.</p>
            <p>And this will be the Glory of <hi>Gods</hi> on Earth, to bear ſuch a Paternal affection to a People as their Children. Of old the Rulers, among ſeveral Nations, gloryed in the Name of <hi>Fathers,</hi> as the moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Title that could be given them. Thus every King among the Philiſtines, upon their advancement aſſumed the appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Abimelech;</hi> the Engliſh of which is, the King my Father. Among the Romans, their Conſuls, Generals, and afterward their Emperors, were moſt ambitious of the Name of Fathers, as the brighteſt Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Honour.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Le Compte's Memoirs.</note> And the beſt as well lateſt accounts of <hi>China</hi> tell us, that it is a ſtanding Maxim of that Government, that Kings are properly the <hi>Fathers</hi> of their People, and not <hi>Maſters</hi> placed in the Throne to be Served by Slaves: And this Idea of their Prince is ſo deeply imprinted in the Minds of all; that when any Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick is made in praiſe of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> it is upon this head of his affection to his People; and form his Character not from
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001484_0048_0FB354F04C4B3780"/>
his ſkill in War, and Politicks, but as he has approved himſelf a <hi>Father</hi> to them. And this well becomes the Character of all Rulers, if they would conform themſelves to the Divine. Their conduct muſt be gentle, ſuited to the Infirmities of the State. They muſt Sympathize with their People in all their difficulties, ſorrows; &amp; ſenſibly reſent all the Evil they groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; even when they ſuffer thro' their own default, and can't be perſwaded by Rulers from thoſe Meaſures that prove fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to them: They muſt be tender of them when infected with evil humours, and the diſtempers of a perverſe Spirit. Their bowels of Compaſſion muſt peculiarly move towards them, when they are under deep Apoſtacies from God, and under ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible impreſſions of his Wrath, both in Temporal Judgments, &amp; Spiritual Plagues. As the <hi>Head</hi> in the Natural body feels the uneaſy State of the whole and each Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; ſo theſe are to have a moſt ſenſible Share, in all the loſſes, reproaches, burdens &amp; dangers, that annoy their People; &amp; their tenderneſs muſt be Expreſt in taking the beſt meaſures for their Relief &amp; Comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:001484_0049_0FB354F1F4B59378"/>
This Paternal Affection appeared in <hi>Moſes,</hi> when GOD's Wrath was breaking in upon the Camp of Iſrael. So in <hi>David</hi> when the deſtroying Angel had made ſuch deſolations among the Tribes of his People. As <hi>Fathers</hi> Rulers muſt be like the <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Samaritan</hi> pour Wine and Oyl into the Wounds of their People, and bind them up: If once a <hi>Breach</hi> be made they muſt thruſt into the <hi>Gap;</hi> If the <hi>Plague</hi> be begun, they muſt haſten an <hi>Atonement:</hi> Thus like <hi>Job</hi> they muſt <hi>Comfort the Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Thus they will reſemble GOD, who is full of Fatherly compaſſion; who <hi>Delivers the needy, the poor alſo, and him, that has no helper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>As Gods,</hi> they muſt render themſelves <hi>Worthy the Truſt and Confidence</hi> of their People. It is the Prerogative of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERLASTING ROCK, GOD AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUFFICIENT, to deſerve the Abſolute dependence, and Intire confidence of the Rational Creature: And it is his Glory to be Stiled the <hi>GOD of hope,</hi> the <hi>Confidence</hi> of the <hi>Ends of the Earth;</hi> under the Shadow of whoſe wings men may with Security truſt; on whom they may devolve all their cares.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:001484_0050_0FB354F332F9ED40"/>
And both the <hi>Glory</hi> of Rulers, and the <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> require that thoſe that are appointed <hi>Gods</hi> on Earth reſemble GOD herein. The <hi>Roman Orator</hi> has Stated it as the Height of Glory to Merit that Eſteem and Reverence of Men, as to be truſted by them. That a People may with Satisfaction, in Subordination to GOD, commit their Lives, Liberties, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Eſtate to their Guardian-ſhip, and Patronage. Now beſides the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments already mentioned, there are more peculiarly three Qualifications in Rulers neceſſary to create, and conciliate this Eſteem and Confidence; in which they are to aſſert the Glory of their Character, and Imitate GOD: <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> 
               <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Diligence</hi> and <hi>Activity in their Poſt;</hi> and a <hi>Steady Conduct.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is requiſite <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Integrity.</hi> It is one Eſſential Character of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Being that He is a <hi>GOD of Truth, Deut.</hi> 32. 4. And <hi>Jethro</hi> makes it a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary qualification for Magiſtrates, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 21. That they be <hi>Men of Truth.</hi> It was <hi>Davids</hi> commendation, that he led GOD's People according to the <hi>Integrity of his

heart, Pſal.</hi> 78. <hi>ult.</hi> Without this, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Policy and Power are not Vertues ſufficient to demand this Truſt and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. Knowledge without this Integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity will render men ſuſpected; and power will render them only formidable; But <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> will put a Divine luſtre upon both. It is a crocked Maxim in Politicks,<note n="*" place="bottom">Qui neſcit diſſimulate, neſcit regnare.</note> That the Art of Diſſimulation is Eſſential to the ſkill of Governing. On the contrary Rulers muſt have a Sacred regard to the Rules of Truth: There muſt be Truth in their Words, Promiſes, and Oaths; their Deportment without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe; without the little Arts of <hi>Simulation</hi> or <hi>Diſſimulation;</hi> neither pretending what is not, nor concealing or diſguiſing what is. Men of falſehood bear the Image of the <hi>Father of Lies.</hi> But nothing ought to be more firm than the Truth and Word of Government. Such only are fit to Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the <hi>Judgment of Truth in the Gates.</hi> This is to be like the <hi>Moſt High,</hi> the <hi>True GOD;</hi> Such only can Expect the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a People: For falſehood, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy

and Deceit remove the foundations of Confidence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> To gain this Truſt there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in Rulers <hi>Vigilance, Activity,</hi> and an Awaken'd Application to the duties of their Poſt. The GOD, and Governour of Iſrael does never ſlumber, nor is He ever weary or faint, but watches over his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple night and day. A Pattern for ſuch, as Rule over Men. A <hi>Sluggard,</hi> who keeps his Arms folded, is unfit for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is the Command of Heaven that Rulers rule with <hi>Diligence:</hi> and <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Continually</hi> on this very thing: <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 8 &amp; 13. 6. To Rule is the Work of GOD, and his Work muſt not be done <hi>Negligently.</hi> It is the ſaying of the Firſt of the Grecian Poets,<note n="*" place="bottom">Homer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iliad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> That a Publick Counſellour may not Sleep a whole night. While others Sleep Magiſtrates muſt Watch; while others are ſecure in their Cabin, theſe muſt be at the Helm all Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. They muſt be <hi>Vigilant</hi> to fore ſee Publick dangers, and <hi>Induſtrious</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them; to obſerve Advantages, and to improve them for the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth.
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:001484_0053_0FB354FACBFE53E8"/>
They may not be ſlothful in buſineſs if worthy of the <hi>Confidence</hi> of a People. Sloth, Eaſe and Negligence in Rulers will as infallibly ruine a State, as evil deſigns. Slothful Rulers will give a looſe to the Reins of Government; the Sword of Juſtice will ruſt in the Scabbard, and be neither a <hi>Terror</hi> to Evil-doers, not an <hi>Encouragement</hi> to them that do well. Hence a drouſy and languiſhing Age not the fitteſt for Publick buſineſs: But that Age that is beſt for addreſs and diſpatch in Execution, and vigour as well as Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dateneſs in Counſel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> A <hi>Steady Conduct</hi> in all their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations is neceſſary to create a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</hi> They muſt govern themſelves by unalterable principles, and fixed Rules, and not by unaccountable humours, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary will, which is lyable to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt levity and inconſtancy. Rulers muſt not be Trimmers, or Time-ſervers; and vary according to the humours of the Giddy Populace, which are as variable as the Weather Glaſs. They are <hi>Foundations</hi> of a State, and therefore muſt be fixed, and not totter and ſhake: They are <hi>Pillars,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:001484_0054_0FB354FFEA84B078"/>
and Pillars muſt not bend like the Oſyer, but ſtand unſhaken like the aged Oak; They are <hi>Lights</hi> that are ſet on High, and muſt approve themſelves fixed in their Orb, &amp; move like the Sun, who as a Gyant runs his race, &amp; nothing can turn him aſide. Theſe muſt ſuffer nothing to diſconcert them, or break their well digeſted mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: Neither fraud nor violence, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flattery nor calumny muſt be able to warp them. That a People may know what to truſt to, and expect; and this is Divine; for GOD governs by fixed Rule.</p>
            <p>Thus Rulers are by their Zeal for Truth, their Activity, Vigilance, and Steadineſs to create a Confidence in them; and their People will find their Perſons, and Intereſts ſafe under their Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and can ſecurely repoſe themſelves <hi>under their Shadow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>As Gods,</hi> they muſt have the ſame <hi>Noble Deſigns</hi> and <hi>Purpoſes in View,</hi> that GOD has. They are by <hi>Office</hi> GOD's Miniſters, and it becomes the Eyes of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to be on the hand of their Maſters. And ought to carry on the ſame deſigns that GOD does in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

ſtudy to form their Adminiſtrations here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. GOD's Government tends to the good of the World; and is eſpecially <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd</hi> for the good of his Children, and therein the Exaltation of His Own Name. He has lay'd this Government on the Shoulders of His <hi>ONLY SON,</hi> who is the <hi>MAN</hi> upon the Throne above the Firmament, according to whoſe direction the <hi>Wheels</hi> and <hi>Living Creatures</hi> move below: Now GOD has made him <hi>Head</hi> over all things for the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22. He Rules Devils, that they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from Effecting their Malicious deſigns againſt the Church; He Sways the Empire over Good Angels, that they may Miniſter to his choſen Inheritance. Civil Rulers are to act under Chriſt, and Ultimately to aim at the ſame deſign, for which He has received All Power in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth: Their Government muſt be ſubordinated, and ſubſervient to his. It is the Wiſdom of Kings to fear, ſerve, and ſubmit to the Son: To carry on Croſs deſigns will incur the guilt of ſetting themſelves, and taking counſel againſt the LORD, and H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="54" facs="unknown:001484_0056_0FB355062D3833D0"/>
Hence Rulers muſt have an Inviolable regard to the Laws of GOD; and Employ all their Power to advance His Kingdom; to guard Religion from the aſſaults, and open Defiances of the Immoral, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane. They ſhould maintain the juſt Honours GOD has put upon His Day, His Inſtitutions, and the Stewards of His Houſe. To neglect theſe deſigns is to betray them; and to betray them will be reſented as Treaſon and Rebellion againſt the Majeſty of Heaven. And hence the <hi>Fear of GOD</hi> is a neceſſary qualification for thoſe that are called to Rule over Men, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.3. This Fear of GOD is not to be only a Swaying <hi>Motive</hi> to their duty, but this Fear muſt be made the <hi>Rule</hi> of their Government, as well as Principle that acts them. And when they are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of theſe Divine Principles, and Deſigns, and accordingly regulate the Exerciſe of their Power, they are <hi>God-like,</hi> and act as thoſe that Rule for GOD.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>As Gods,</hi> they muſt ſet their People <hi>Good Examples.</hi> The Bleſſed GOD is the Pattern and Standard of all Perfection, in Conformity to whom the Perfection and

Glory of Man his Subject does conſiſt: Hence we have theſe Precepts, <hi>To be Holy</hi> as <hi>He</hi> is <hi>Holy;</hi> to be <hi>Merciful</hi> as GOD is <hi>Merciful;</hi> and to be <hi>Followers,</hi> or Imitators of GOD as dear Children. Herein Rulers muſt maintain their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, &amp; approve themſelves <hi>Gods</hi> among men. They muſt be Conſpicuous Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Piety, Juſtice, Sobriety; of Zeal for the Glory of GOD, His Day, Houſe and Ordinances. Good Manners muſt not only be legible in their Laws, but alſo in their Lives. A Ruler is ſometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by GOD a <hi>Seal</hi> or <hi>Signet,</hi> and poſſibly one reaſon may be, becauſe what ever is ingraven on them will leave its impreſſion on their People: and therefore Rulers had need take care that they bear the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature of undiſſembled Holineſs, that the Impreſſion on thoſe under them may be holy. Superiors by their Example give Lawes to men; Their vertuous Actions may do more to Reform a vicious Age, than all other Methods. The good Lives of ſuch carry Soverignty and Authority in them; they give Life, Light &amp; Heat to Precept; they afford Motive and Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:001484_0058_0FB35510D91829F0"/>
to the Vertuous; but reproach and upbraid the Vicious. Vertue in the Lives of men of Figure and Power appears with peculiar charms, and beauty: There is a lovely, attractive repreſentation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion when it ſhines in the Converſation of the Great. It now appears with beams of Greatneſs; and becomes more Viſible &amp; Conſpicuous, and has a direct tendency to make laſting impreſſions on others. This will ſtrengthen the Authority of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and render their Adminiſtrations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluential to all good deſigns. And the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Government, the deſign of its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution can never be ſecure, unleſs they thus reſemble GOD.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, the <hi>Evil Examples</hi> of Rulers weaken the hands of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſpread a deadly Infection, which <hi>waſteth at noon day.</hi> Theſe make Vice reputable, and charming; give au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to it, take off the reſtraint of fear and ſhame, and render all Endeavours to ſuppreſs it feeble; and ſo harden the vile in their Evil wayes. The Evil Lives of men of Name and Figure are a Publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to others to follow them; and
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:001484_0059_0FB355131749EA00"/>
are as Authentick Paſports to all manner of Iniquity; and a profeſſed Patronage of Vice and Immorality. For as<note n="*" place="bottom">Obſequij quoddam Genus Regis vitia imitari. La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And it is not to be wondered, if Magiſtrates are <hi>Rulers of Sodom,</hi> that thoſe under their Conduct be the <hi>People of Gomorrah.</hi> If a Ruler hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to lies, all his Servants are wicked, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 12. Thus if Rulers be vertuous, they are as the Lights of the World, they will direct their People into the paths of Vertue and Glory; but if Vicious, they are like Baleful Comets, that ſpread Plague and Deſolations thro' a Land by their Malignant Influences. <hi>Upon the whole,</hi> we muſt conclude that ſuch as have the ſtile of <hi>Gods,</hi> ought, as GOD does, to ſet their People good Examples: Otherwiſe they will corrupt the beauty, ſtain the
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:001484_0060_0FB3551622FCD920"/>
Honour, which GOD has put on them; and render themſelves unworthy of the Name of <hi>Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we have taken a view of what is included and pointed at in the Divine Title, that GOD has Characterized Civil Rulers by; which was the Second thing obſerved in the Text. We may proceed to the Third.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III.</hi> That tho' Rulers are <hi>Gods,</hi> yet they are lyable to <hi>Mortality,</hi> and the neceſſary <hi>Conſequents thereof, as Men.</hi> This truth is no Secret, but lyes open to the Obſervation of all; that to Eſſay an Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate Confirmation of it is needleſs: However, it can't be improper by a few hints to Endeavour to awaken a lively ſenſe hereof, that may affect the heart and life.</p>
            <p>The Greateſt Men are but <hi>Spirits in Fleſh:</hi> They are of the ſame Make and Conſtitution with others; That Decree of Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. has the ſame aſpect upon them, as upon the meaneſt, and may not be diſanulled. They are born under the guilt of Sin, and the ſentence of Death; and they bring into the World with them
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:001484_0061_0FB35517F2006270"/>
the Seeds of Mortality; which will in a little time burſt a ſunder the bands by which the Soul and Body are held in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l Union. They are obnoxious to the ſame Diſeaſes, Violences, and Caſualties, as Inferiors are; and the leaſt of theſe are ſufficient to ſtop their breath, and turn them to duſt. What Prerogatives they may lay claim to on other accounts; yet here they ſtand upon a Level. No Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Quality, nor Perſonal Endowment can be any Security from the Arreſts of the King of Terrors.</p>
            <p>Their Power can't over-awe, nor their Riches bribe Death. Where are all thoſe <hi>Sons of Fame,</hi> the Mighty, Rich and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, we read of in Story! The Kings, and Princes that filled their houſes with Gold and Silver, and the Counſellours of the Earth! Are they not gone to Sleep in thoſe <hi>deſolate Places</hi> they built for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves! Are not all the Bright Stars of the Morning cover'd with the dark Cloud of Corruption! Where are thoſe Children of Pride &amp; Oppreſſion, who made the Earth to tremble, ſhook Kingdoms, made the World as a Wilderneſs, and deſtroyed
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:001484_0062_0FB3551C593D3268"/>
the Cities thereof! How are they fallen, their pomp brought down to the Grave, and become as weak as the meaneſt of their Vaſſals! The Worm is ſpread under them, and the Worm covers them. Again, Wiſdom and Policy cannot protect them from Mortality; for the Wiſe dy as well as the Fool. Courage will not; for Death cannot be Conquered but by that <hi>Prince of Life,</hi> who has triumphed over Death, and is the <hi>Life</hi> &amp; the <hi>Reſurrection:</hi> So that after all their breath muſt go forth, and they return to Corruption.</p>
            <p>As they are lyable to Death, ſo <hi>as Men</hi> they are lyable to the Conſequents of Mortality. Their Bodies will undergo the ſame Mortifying Changes and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the <hi>Land of Darkneſs,</hi> which the Bodies of others undergo. <hi>As Men,</hi> their Spirits when ſeperated from their Bodies, will not drop into a State of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity, inſenſibility; nor ſhall be arreſted with a Mortal Lethargy; but their Seperate Souls, will paſs into the Unſeen World of Unbodyed Spirits, and be ſubject to the Laws &amp; Government, to the Work and Rewards of <hi>that World:</hi> They will during
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:001484_0063_0FB3551D447F4E60"/>
that State of Separation be either United to the Society of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>happy Souls,</hi> or be herded with the <hi>degraded Angels,</hi> and <hi>unhappy Spirits</hi> of dead men: they will, during this State of Death, either tremble at the fore-ſight of their re-union to their Ancient Bodies; or wait and long in this State of Expectancy for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of their Bodies. <hi>As Men,</hi> they are <hi>Accountable,</hi> as well as <hi>Mortal;</hi> and muſt appear before the Tribunal of GOD, who <hi>Reſpecteth not the Perſons of Princes:</hi> A State either of Immortal bleſs, or miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Expects them after Death: So that <hi>as Men</hi> they are to dye, and have ſomething to fear, or hope for, beyond the Grave.</p>
            <p>Thus Death and the inevitable Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of it, have an equal Aſpect upon Rulers and Ruled. And what a terrible Rebuke is this to the preſent Pride and Grandeur of <hi>Gods</hi> on Earth? And what happy Influence might the juſt Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation hereof have to implant &amp; nouriſh thoſe Seeds of Vertue, which may give them a bleſſed Proſpect of more Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, Weighty &amp; Enduring Glories in that State, where there ſhall be no more Death!

And this naturally leads us to the Fourth and laſt thing obſerved in our Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IV.</hi> That it will be of great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to <hi>Temper &amp; Qualify</hi> the thoughts of their <hi>Dignity,</hi> with juſt <hi>Reflections</hi> on their Expected <hi>Mortality,</hi> and its Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents.</p>
            <p>Now the Advantage of theſe Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be Conſidered both as to <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Ruled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. It may be of great <hi>Advantage</hi> to <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers;</hi> To <hi>Temper</hi> the thoughts of their <hi>Dignity</hi> with juſt Reflections on their <hi>Mortality,</hi> and its Conſequents. I ſhall mention here three Important Points.</p>
            <p>As,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Theſe Reflections</hi> will teach Rulers not to <hi>over-rate and value</hi> their preſent Advantages of Honour, and Power over Men. It is of the laſt Conſequence to them that they do not Place too great a Price upon their preſent Circumſtances of Superiority: Now theſe thoughts will read them wiſe Leſſons of the Vanity of theſe things; and bring them under a full Conviction of the truth of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts Concluſion: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39 5. <hi>Surely every
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:001484_0065_0FB3552240FA0000"/>
Man at his beſt Eſtate is altogether Vanity.</hi> That can't be very valuable to Immortal Beings, which is not <hi>durable;</hi> but in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time will be loſt. And this is the caſe of the preſent Advantages which men En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy above others. <hi>Death</hi> cauſes all titles of Honour to burſt into Air and nothing as Empty bubbles. It diſarms the Great of all their Power, and they go naked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other World. After all their Pomp and Parade on the ſtage of Life, they drop into their Graves, and nothing of all their <hi>Glory deſcends after them. Death</hi> wreſts the Sceptre out of the Monarchs hand, plucks the Crown from off his head, and turns his Glory into noiſome Putrefaction: and the very fore-thought of it will ſtain the Pride of all their Glory. Hence <hi>Right Reflections</hi> on their <hi>Mortality</hi> will ſuggeſt to ſuch as Sit at the upper End of the World, wiſer thoughts of their preſent State of Exaltation; and will teach them that there can be no <hi>true Greatneſs,</hi> but what is found in Conjunction with <hi>Immortaliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Goodneſs;</hi> and that without this inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Greatneſs of Soul, their external ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Honour, Power, and Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:001484_0066_0FB355235FB8E538"/>
will ſignify nothing; unleſs when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, &amp; prided in, to make their Account more terrible; and their Infamy and Shame more deep and inſufferable, when they ſhall be fixed in the Congregation of GOD's conquered Enemies.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Theſe Thoughts</hi> will be a Powerful <hi>Antidote</hi> againſt the <hi>Infection</hi> of thoſe <hi>Temptations,</hi> that threaten them in their Exalted Stations. Rulers have the ſame Luſts within them, as other men; and are beſet with much ſtronger Temptations to provoke and inflame theſe Luſts. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan will be moſt buſy with ſuch to corrupt and pervert them; and their falls will give the Wrath and Malice of Hell a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Triumph. The World with its higheſt charms, and greateſt advantage to bewitch them: And as they have greater advantages than <hi>Others</hi> to purſue the moſt guilty gratifications; ſo they have fewer reſtraints, and leſs of obſtruction in their way. They have enough to ſhock and try the moſt Eſtabliſhed vertue. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes are they tempted! And in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſullying their Divine Character, by being lead to Pride and Vanity, Sloth and
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:001484_0067_0FB35524E03E6500"/>
Luxury, Covetouſneſs and Oppreſſion. They need to keep the ſtricteſt guard, and lay the ſevereſt reſtraints upon themſelves, to ſecure them from their Spiritual dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
            <p>Now juſt <hi>Reflections</hi> on <hi>Death</hi> and its <hi>Conſequents</hi> will awaken in them ſuch thoughts, as will tend to check, and rein in thoſe luſts, that the charms of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do excite. If they remember they muſt dye, how can they grow giddy, or be unreaſonably tranſported with the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Images of their preſent honours? Will not this thought damp the force of Temptations to Luxury and Senſuality; and cool them in the hot purſuit of forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den pleaſures? What Appetite had <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar,</hi> when he ſaw and underſtood <hi>the hand writing on the Wall,</hi> to carry on the Revel, and compleat the debauch? This proſpect will pall the unhallowed Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of Dominion, and Gain; and will make them think what agonies and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions the remembrance of gain gotten by Injuſtice and Oppreſſion, will cauſe in a dying hour; and what inflaming Items, the charge of Power, Riches, and Honour
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:001484_0068_0FB355263336A438"/>
abuſed, and perverted, will be at that Impartial Tribunal they muſt ſtand before. Thus theſe <hi>Reflections</hi> will be of mighty force to abate the Edge of Temptation; and they will give them a juſter view of things, as they ſtand in the <hi>Light</hi> of the other World: Inſtructing them, that if they muſt dye, and be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like men, then they may not live like <hi>Creatures,</hi> either of <hi>Prey</hi> or <hi>Pleaſure.</hi> And were theſe thoughts more frequently En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and Realized by the Superior part of the World, what a mighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection would they be from thoſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Evils, which if indulged, will debaſe their Character, cloud their Serenity of Conſcience, and lay their Souls <hi>waſte</hi> and <hi>deſolate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Theſe <hi>Thoughts</hi> of <hi>Mortality</hi> and its Conſequents will be moſt forcible <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> to engage Rulers ſo to improve the Advantages of Honour and Power, as may give them the beſt proſpect of a State of Immortality. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Riches and Power are great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for Service, &amp; infer the ſtrongeſt Obligations hereto, to honour GOD, and
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:001484_0069_0FB3552B6B2C0C38"/>
do good to the World. Thoſe of the higheſt Order in Government are but GOD's Stewards; their Power, Honour and Influence are Talents committed to them to <hi>Occupy,</hi> for their <hi>Great LORD,</hi> till HE come, when they muſt account for their improvement: They have not the <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> but only the <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> of theſe, as their <hi>Maſters Goods.</hi> And theſe well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved will give them a joyous proſpect into the Eternal World; and will ſecure to them an <hi>Euge</hi> from their Lord and Judge. Now theſe Reflections on Death and its Conſequents tend to engage them to a <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Faithful</hi> improvement of theſe Talents committed to them: They will incite them to ſtudy ſuch a Management in their Places, as ſhall in the Review not Torment but Comfort them, when the Shadows of Death ſtretch over them. This Proſpect will make them value their ſtate of Diſtinction and Superiority, not by its preſent glittering Appearance, but by their greater Capacity for Service for GOD, his Kingdom and People. This will conſtrain them to think, what good they have Opportunity to do, that they
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:001484_0070_0FB3552E75C57120"/>
may not neglect it; but get it done before Death periods their Seaſons of Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: It will inſpire them with the moſt noble purpoſes; that they may fill up their Places, and be <hi>Gods</hi> to the World while they live. In this way their Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds will be Places of Inconceiveable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment; and have confidence in their Appearance before the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Man:</hi> Their fidelity will fill all their Powers with the warmeſt Tranſports of joy in that Terrible day of the Lord: while at the ſame time the Kings of the Earth, the Great Men, the Rich, and Mighty Men, that have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed and not improved their Talents, ſhall ſtand <hi>Trembling</hi> before the Supream bar of CHRIST, over-powred with the Terrors of the LORD, from whoſe Wrath <hi>Rocks</hi> &amp; <hi>Mountains</hi> can give no Protection. Oh! that they were thus Wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would now conſider their latter End!</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe <hi>Reflections</hi> may be of Service and Advantage to <hi>Such</hi> as are <hi>under Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> And there are Two <hi>Leſſons</hi> of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which the Proſpect of Rulers Mortality will teach a People, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially. As,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:001484_0071_0FB3553002918050"/>
(1.) Theſe <hi>Reflections</hi> on their <hi>Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> will teach a People to make all <hi>favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Allowances</hi> for the <hi>Infirmities,</hi> and <hi>Defects</hi> of their <hi>Rulers.</hi> And were this leſſon well learnt by a People it would be of no common advantage to them.</p>
            <p>And are they <hi>Gods</hi> that muſt <hi>dye,</hi> ſurely then we are not to Expect from them that perfection of Wiſdom and Vertue in their Conduct, as if they were <hi>Immortal</hi> GOD's; Nor that freedom from Error and Miſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement as if they were <hi>Angels</hi> whoſe <hi>dwellings are not in fleſh,</hi> thoſe Sons of GOD, who are the Excellency of Divine Dignity, and the Excellency of Power, who always ſtand in the Preſence of GOD, and in his <hi>Light</hi> ſee <hi>Light:</hi> nor yet as if they were <hi>Unbody'd Spirits,</hi> who have left their Moral Infirmities with their Mortal Bodies here below. A State of Mortality beſpeaks a State of Sin, and Moral Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: for Death is the puniſhment of Sin; and were all the Seeds of Sin purged out, Death would have no power over them. If then they muſt dy as other men; they have the ſame principles of <hi>Moral</hi> as well as <hi>Natural Corruption</hi> in them, as other
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:001484_0072_0FB35531C708F2F8"/>
men, no wonder then we many times ſee theſe ſprout forth in their preſent State of Mortality, and obſcure the Glory of their Conduct. It is not to be Expected that they ſhould move in their Sphere with that vigour, activity and regularity, as if they had put on Immortality, and their Bodies were Endow'd with that Purity, Power and Spirituality, which is to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in the <hi>Reſurrection State.</hi> It is no wonder they are no more vigilant, ſteady and diligent in their work, ſince they are not <hi>Pure Spirits,</hi> nor <hi>Raiſed Saints,</hi> but are clogged with Bodies, endowed with Animal Appetites, Inclinations, &amp; Wants, which are eſſential to their State of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe Thoughts</hi> ſhould diſpoſe us to cover the Infirmities of Rulers with a veil of <hi>Charity,</hi> and not like <hi>Cham</hi> diſcover their Nakedneſs: they will ſuggeſt that we muſt not rudely comment and criticiſe upon their Errors; but make all the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Allowances for the Imperfections, &amp; the force of Temptations, that they are lyable to in their preſent ſtate; and not blaſpheme their Character, ſhould they not
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:001484_0073_0FB35532F6725EA8"/>
in every Article be proof againſt them: For then they muſt be <hi>more</hi> than <hi>Men,</hi> that muſt <hi>dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Theſe Thoughts</hi> will teach thoſe under Government, not to place undue <hi>Confidences</hi> in the beſt Rulers. We muſt not have that dependence on them, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from them, which are due on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Eternal, and Immutable GOD. What is man, whoſe breath is in his Noſtrils! Man who muſt dye, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of! Men of higheſt degree are not to be truſted to, for their Mortality tells us they are but a <hi>Lye.</hi> GOD Himſelf has given us that Admonition, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146. 3, 4. <hi>Put not your truſt in Princes, nor in the Son of Man, in whom there is no help; his breath goeth forth, he returneth to his Earth, in that very day his thoughts periſh.</hi> Let them be never ſo excelling in Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, never ſo full of good and great deſigns, yet Death comes, and puts an End to all; and then they can afford no help: when Death comes they can no longer cover us with their Shadow; no longer be Eyes to the blind, Feet to the lame, or Fathers to the Widow and Fatherleſs; for
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:001484_0074_0FB3553475402038"/>
they are become <hi>weak as other men.</hi> This Conſideration ſhould make us renounce all undue Confidences in thoſe Rulers, that beſt deſerve the Character of <hi>Gods;</hi> leſt we place them in the Place of that GOD, who can never Change or Dye: And happy only are ſuch, as have the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable <hi>Munition of Rocks</hi> for the place of their Defence; and have the <hi>Eternal GOD</hi> for their Refuge.</p>
            <p>APPLICATION.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>USE I.</hi> This teaches us the vaſt <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> of the Rulers Province. The moſt only fix their Eyes on their outward Splendors and Honours, and dream of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Eaſe and Pleaſure, Grandeur in all its gay ſhews; but never think of that Duty, Work and Buſineſs of Government, which is attended with Difficulties as <hi>Great</hi> as their Dignity. Their Station is high, and no common ſupplies of Grace are neceſſary for the diſcharge of the Duties that belong to their Sphere. They are to act for GOD, in his <hi>Name,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Repreſent</hi> him as all that obſerve them may have more

Worthy &amp; Honourable thoughts of GOD, and his Government; and <hi>who is ſufficient for this!</hi> Eſpecially if it be conſidered how many things there are to weaken their hands, and render the burden of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment more inſupportable. There are their own Infirmities, and the ill Humours of their People; Murmurings, Jealouſies, Reproaches, and Diſcontents: Theſe made <hi>Moſes</hi> openly Proteſt before <hi>Iſrael</hi> that he was not not able to bear their <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi> their <hi>Burden,</hi> and <hi>Strife.

and under all act like GOD; as thoſe that bear his Image, &amp; approve themſelves to be <hi>Gods</hi> to the world; and go on ſteady in that way maugre all Oppoſition. <hi>Hic Labor, hoc Opus eſt</hi> Under a juſt view of the Importance, Weight and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of this work of Government, it may not be wondred at, if <hi>the Olive-tree</hi> refuſes to leave her <hi>Fatneſs;</hi> and the <hi>Fig-tree</hi> her <hi>Sweetneſs,</hi> to Rule over the Trees of the Wood.

And when Luxury and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are growing among a People; it would be well if Rulers would avoid, all approaches to it, and the leaſt appearances of it. It was a wholeſome Admonition that <hi>Lemuels</hi> Mother gave him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.4,5. It is not for Kings, O <hi>Lemuel,</hi> to drink Wine; nor for Princes Strong Drink; leſt they drink and forget the Law, and pervert Judgment.

want ſuch, as are fit to Support the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Dignity of Gods;</hi> or when thoſe that are beſt Qualify'd are thro' Prejudice lay'd aſide. This is too often the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly State of a People. Sometimes tho' ſtrict ſearch be made for men to make up the <hi>Hedge</hi> round a People, and to ſtand in the <hi>Gap,</hi> none can be found: They have no <hi>ſtrong Rods for a Sceptre to Rule them,</hi> Sometimes thoſe that are beſt qualify'd by inward Ability's, and outward Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, are thro' a <hi>ſpirit of Prejudice</hi> and <hi>Partiality</hi> overlookt; and Voted unfit to Serve a People.

Victories, and Triumphs, as will be ſcarce Credible to Poſterity.

            <p>May I not add without ſuſpicion of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery? that the <hi>preſent Government</hi> which is immediately over us in this <hi>Province,</hi> ought to be eſteem'd as a Favour of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which challenges a Tribute of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and Praiſe?

Is it not a Rich Bleſſing that we do not ſee men of infamous Luſts, whoſe Lives are the laſt Defiance to all that
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:001484_0083_0FB35553601A98F0"/>
is Sacred, and Divine, to Religion, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Honeſty and Sobriety, openly wallowing in the groſſeſt Pollutions of Senſuality: Is it not a Valuable Bleſſing, that we do not ſee ſuch Madneſs and Folly ſet in great Dignity over us, which would make Vice Reputable? Is it not a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that our <hi>Zion</hi> has ſome of her <hi>own Sons</hi> to take her by the Hand, who cannot but have a peculiar Tenderneſs for her? And of ſuch we ſee this Day the firſt <hi>Chair</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> the <hi>Council Table,</hi> and the <hi>Seats</hi> of <hi>Judgment</hi> filled: May GOD long continue the Bleſſing. And if any, either thro' Stupidity, or Malignity, will not ſee, or not acknowledge the Smiles of Divine Providence on theſe accounts; I wiſh they be never made to feel by doleful Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the vaſt Difference of being Protected and Refreſh'd under the <hi>Shadow</hi> of the ſpreading <hi>Vine,</hi> and being Scratcht and Torn by the <hi>Bramble.</hi>

A Tribute of Honour, Reverence, and Dutiful Regards is their undoubted due from their People. Regard them as GOD's <hi>Deligates,</hi> and <hi>Viceroys;</hi> as Arm'd with his Power, and Engag'd in his Service for your Good; as <hi>Living Images</hi> of the Immortal KING of Glory. Honour them for GOD Himſelf has put Honour upon them. Do all you can properly to Support their Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Maintain their Character: For it can never go well with a People, when Government is brought into Contempt. <hi>Government</hi> has ſomething too <hi>Divine</hi> in it to be inſulted, and rudely treated. You can't deſpiſe their Authority, but you muſt deſpiſe GOD himſelf; and ſpit on his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; which He will certainly reſent. And it becomes a <hi>People</hi> to remember that they are <hi>Mortal,</hi> and <hi>Accountable</hi> as well as their Rulers. Let your regards therefore to Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers be anſwerable to that Condition GOD has placed them in; and as may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with thoſe Beams of Divinity, with which they ſhine. Do all that you may to Encourage them in their Work which is Difficult &amp; moſt Important. Own GOD's <hi>Name, Image,</hi> and <hi>Superſcription,</hi> that they
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:001484_0085_0FB35557DB836D30"/>
bear, and do nothing to Deface them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hence,</hi> All Murmurings, Diſcontents, Evil Surmiſings and Jealouſies, all Seeds of Faction &amp; Sedition muſt be ſuppreſſed with the greateſt care among a People. If Rulers are <hi>Gods,</hi> they are not to be Reviled, Blaſphemed, Arraigned and Condemned by every Haughty, Inſolent, and Diſcontented Spirit. To be <hi>Murmurers,</hi> and to <hi>ſpeak E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of Dignities,</hi> are Evils of a black Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in the Word of GOD; and may not be Play'd with. And yet how common are theſe Evils! And how many Corrupt Principles are too frequently found among a People, which lead to theſe! Some are prompted to foment Jealouſies of Rulers, that they may be <hi>Popular,</hi> or that they may be thought Perſons of a <hi>deeper Reach,</hi> and <hi>quicker Sight</hi> than others; and therefore pretend to ſee evil Deſigns at the bottom of Publick Adminiſtrations, that their <hi>Blind</hi> Neighbours are not aware of. Sometimes they deny Government it's juſt Honours, becauſe, they imagine, they are not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as their Merit calls for: Some are ſo <hi>full</hi> of themſelves, and ſo giddy with the Contemplation of their own ſuppoſed Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:001484_0086_0FB355594A65C228"/>
that they think they have a <hi>Right</hi> to impoſe their <hi>Schemes</hi> as Perfect <hi>Models of Prudence,</hi> and that their Phanſy's ought to be Entertain'd as infallible Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and that it will never be well with <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> till it be ſo. Their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons declare their ſenſe that they are the <hi>Men,</hi> and that <hi>Wiſdom</hi> will <hi>Dye</hi> with them; and that with their <hi>Bolt too ſoon ſhot,</hi> they can out-ſhoot all about them. Hence if their Thoughts are not Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with a deep Silence, profound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and be not made the <hi>Publick Rule;</hi> they Vote themſelves Deſpiſed, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted, &amp; the Publick Betray'd &amp; Ruined. And hence ariſe Diſcontents, Jealouſies, &amp; hard Cenſuring of Rulers: Hence the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Government are needleſly Expoſed, and unkindly Deſcanted on, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Errors only ſuppoſed are Bruited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout as real and certain: Nay their Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable actions inſideouſly repreſented to their diſadvantage. Thus the <hi>Gods</hi> are too often Reviled, and evilly Entreated. <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> theſe things ought not to be ſo: Our Religion will not allow it. GOD was angry with <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam,</hi> tho'
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:001484_0087_0FB3555C348D04A8"/>
Perſons of <hi>Character</hi> themſelves, for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt his <hi>Servant Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> If Rulers are <hi>Gods,</hi> then their Character demands <hi>Submiſſion</hi> and <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> from a People. The Dignity and Authority of their Station calls for it; and both Law and Goſpel require it as their due. Rebellion and Diſobedience againſt GOD's Vice-gerents in the Lawful Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Office is Rebellion againſt GOD himſelf in the laſt reſult. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably we are to be Obedient to Civil Government, not only for <hi>Wrath</hi> but for <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſake.</p>
            <p>I am not Ignorant to what an extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant heighth the <hi>Doctrine of Submiſſion to Rulers</hi> has been carry'd by ſome; and I wiſh I could ſee no danger of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>Extream</hi> of depreſſing it to a meer Nullity. Extreams on both hands are to be avoided; for both are dangerous to a <hi>State.</hi> The <hi>One</hi> may Expoſe a People to the <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> of Sullen <hi>Tyranny;</hi> the <hi>Other</hi> to the <hi>Confuſions</hi> of Lawleſs <hi>Anarchy:</hi> The <hi>One</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects a State to the rigorous <hi>Impoſitions</hi> of a <hi>Deſpotick Power,</hi> Paramount to all Law, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Conſcience, the <hi>Other</hi> lays it open

to the <hi>Wild Humors</hi> of an <hi>Ungovern'd Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;</hi> to the Fury, Madneſs and Noiſe of the People.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs GOD has not left a State without a <hi>Regular Remedy</hi> to Save it ſelf, when the Fundamental Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a People is Overturned; their Laws and Liberties, Religion and Properties are openly Invaded, and ready to be made a Publick Sacrifice. But on the other ſide, it is beyond me to imagine that the <hi>GOD of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> has ever inveſted any men of a Private Station, who can with a Nodd inflame and raiſe the Multitude, with a Lawful Power, on pretence of Publick Miſmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to Embroyl the State, and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Foundations of Government.</p>
            <p>I am neither <hi>Afraid,</hi> nor <hi>Aſham'd</hi> to ſay, I ſhould be glad to ſee the <hi>Doctrine of Submiſſion</hi> to Rulers, in it's <hi>Juſt</hi> and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted <hi>Meaſures,</hi> better Stated and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd on all ſides, than ever yet I have ſeen it: and when ever that ſhall be done, ſure I am, that theſe following Admonitions, and Precepts will not be found Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal, but Apoſtolical and Divine; <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1, 2. <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the Higher

It is the Work of GOD you are Engaged in; be Encouraged in it, and let not your Heart Faint what ever Hardſhips you may Encounter; GOD will obſerve all the Patience, Self-denyal that ſhall be Exerciſed for his Service and his Peoples Good; He will be with you in your Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Adminiſtrations, and your Labours will not be found in Vain.</p>
            <p>And may you always be under Heaven's

Propitious Conduct, to Direct and Succeed your Adminiſtrations: May the Bleſſings of the <hi>Celebrated Joſeph</hi> deſcend upon you; Your <hi>Bow abide in Strength, the Arms of your Hands be ſtrengthned</hi> by the <hi>Hands of the Mighty GOD of</hi> Jacob; <hi>Even</hi> by the <hi>GOD of thy Father who ſhall Help thee, and</hi> by <hi>the Almighty, who ſhall Bleſs thee:</hi> May you be Honoured with more Enlarged Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of His SPIRIT, that you may Shine in your <hi>Exalted Orb</hi> with Brighter and Brighter Beams of <hi>Divine</hi> Grace, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and Glory; that when <hi>Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> ſhall overtake you, which you have dayly Admonitions of in your Bodily In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, you may have an <hi>Euge</hi> from the <hi>SON of GOD,</hi> Your Maſter and Judge; and may joyn the Bright Throng of <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> Angels and the Spirits of Juſt Men, that incircle the <hi>Throne of GOD</hi> and the <hi>LAMB</hi> with <hi>Proſtration</hi> and <hi>Praiſe.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>II.</hi> Let this word of <hi>Counſel</hi> from GOD be Addreſt to the whole GENERAL ASSEMBLY: The Bleſſed GOD, who is a GREAT KING, and whoſe Name is <hi>Dreadful,</hi> does Expect and Require that
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:001484_0099_0FB3557762A4D9C8"/>
you Study to ſhew your ſelves <hi>Worthy</hi> of that Name, with which you are dignify'd. As you are <hi>Gods</hi> by <hi>Office,</hi> labour to be <hi>Gods</hi> by <hi>Analogy,</hi> reaching after the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt conformity to GOD, and the exacteſt imitation of Him, in your Publick Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities; by which alone you will be able to ſecure and illuſtrate the Glory of your Title, and approve your ſelves not only in <hi>Name,</hi> but in <hi>Truth Gods</hi> on Earth. GOD Himſelf has called you <hi>Gods;</hi> but thoſe that are not ſkilful, thoughtful, vigilant and active to promote the Publick Safety and Happineſs, are not <hi>Gods,</hi> but <hi>dead Idols.</hi> The <hi>Name</hi> inſcribed on you is to give Rules and Meaſures, Life and Force to your Conſultations for the Publick Weal. And there never was a day, that called for a more full Exerciſe of your Wiſdom, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Vigilancy and Courage in their higheſt improvements, than this, in which you are called to be the Saviours of this People. The bleeding State of this Land, languiſhing under <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſtir up your Paternal bowels, and <hi>quicken</hi> your Counſels and Endeavours for its Safety. Be then humbly intreated by
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:001484_0100_0FB3534AB20C64A8"/>
your juſt regards for your own Honour, and GOD's Glory; by your Love and Tenderneſs for your People, to approve your ſelves <hi>Miniſters of GOD for our Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there are two comprehenſive Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, in which you may approve your ſelves Worthy of the Character of our <hi>Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) You will <hi>Aſſert</hi> your <hi>Dignity</hi> by Exerting your Powers to free the Land from thoſe <hi>Sins,</hi> which are the <hi>Reproach of a People.</hi> It is beyond queſtion that there are many groſs Sins found among us, by which Heaven is Defy'd and the Land Polluted. Not only Spiritual Iniquities, as Pride, Hatred, Malice, Envyings, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and the Spirit of the World; but alſo open Abominations, and groſs Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities, which do by a natural Cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as well as moral Influence, cauſe the Crown to fall from our heads. Chriſt's <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> can do little to reſtrain many of theſe bold Tranſgreſſors. They may cry aloud and not ſpare, but theſe ſtop their Ears like the deaf Adder. They are too much of an Adamantine temper and make to be <hi>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="99" facs="unknown:001484_0101_0FB3534F1E63E070"/>
are like the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> proof againſt all the Arrows taken out of the quiver of GOD's Word; the <hi>Sword</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> cannot pierce thro' their Scales. We may <hi>warn</hi> them from GOD, and Set the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Eternal Judgment before them, but theſe are at preſent inviſible and diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant things, which their <hi>Infidel Senſes</hi> have no reſentment of. There is but little hope to reform ſuch, unleſs you can make the <hi>Sword of Juſtice</hi> to reach them. And poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly tho' they fear not the Wrath of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible GOD,</hi> yet they may be made to fear the <hi>Wrath</hi> of our <hi>Viſible Gods,</hi> when like a <hi>Roaring Lyon</hi> it threatens to devour them. This therefore calls for your Care, and Courage.</p>
            <p>Is not our Land deluged with <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and <hi>Drunkneſs?</hi> And is not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of this Sin ſpread far and wide in Spite of all Remedies hitherto applyed, and as the <hi>Deſtruction,</hi> not only walketh in darkneſs, but waſteth at Noon day? Is there not too juſt a Complaint thro' our <hi>Towns,</hi> That the <hi>Aſſemblings</hi> of the People whether for Civil Tranſactions, Military Exerciſes, nay for Religion on
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:001484_0102_0FB35350B76CF318"/>
Lecture days, End in Intemperate Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Debauchery? <hi>And what will be the End of theſe things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> Are not the Cryes of <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> and <hi>Diſhoneſty</hi> in our dealings, Evils moſt Scandalous to our Profeſſion, yet loud in the Ears of GOD, and of all that tremble at his Anger? <hi>Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no Phyſitian there? Why then is not the health of this People recovered?</hi> Have there not been proper <hi>Bills,</hi> brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward once and again, by the <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Encouragement</hi> of his <hi>Excellency</hi> our <hi>Governour,</hi> which have hitherto been ſtrangled in the birth? And can any good Account be given of them? May there not be many things done by this Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Court to Save us from theſe deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evils? May not Laws be brought forward which are further neceſſary; and care taken for their Execution, that their Edge may on no pretence be rebated, that Iniquity may be forced to ſneak and hide its guilty head, if not fully reformed? This <hi>Work</hi> belongs to you, <hi>Our Fathers;</hi> be wiſe and reſolute herein, and <hi>GOD will be with you.</hi>

               <pb n="101" facs="unknown:001484_0103_0FB353532BB1E5D8"/>
Suffer me here to add, That it is Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious that the <hi>Province</hi> is in great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by thoſe <hi>Frauds</hi> and <hi>Forgeries</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon out <hi>Bills of Publick Credit:</hi> And may it not be worthy your Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whether ſome more terrible Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, than our Laws have yet provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, may not be Eſtabliſht to Reſtrain ſuch inſolent <hi>Sons of Fraud and Violence?</hi> What <hi>Policy</hi> will allow of I may not determine; but I am well ſatisfy'd that the Crime is of ſo deep a Malignity, that <hi>Conſcience</hi> and Religion will not forbid the <hi>Laſt</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt</hi> Puniſhment.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) You will <hi>Aſſert</hi> your <hi>Dignity,</hi> by doing what you can to maintain the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>CHRIST</hi>'s <hi>Kingdom</hi> among us. You are appointed by GOD as <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> of the <hi>Religion,</hi> as well as Civil Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of his People. Your <hi>Character</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges you to Exert your Power for the Protection, Preſervation, and Glory of his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Allow me Liberty to hint at a few things neceſſary to this End.</p>
            <p>It is requiſite to the Glory of CHRIST's Kingdom, that <hi>Schools</hi> for Liberal Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

be Supported and Cheriſh'd. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this we may Expect the <hi>Revolution</hi> of the <hi>Barbarous Age.</hi> We have good Laws in Force for this Deſign; but are they not Openly Eluded and Play'd with!</p>
            <p>The <hi>Honour</hi> of CHRIST's Kingdom requires that the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> be honourably Supported: But by a criminal neglect hereof how are they brought into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt? their gifts dampt, and under little growth and improvement, being forced to sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> if CHRIST's Kingdom be kept up in its <hi>Glory,</hi> our <hi>Pulpits</hi> muſt be guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>Ignorant,</hi> and <hi>Diſſolute;</hi> the <hi>confident Boaſter,</hi> and the <hi>heady Impoſtor.</hi> And this is to be deſpaired of unleſs a due <hi>Tryal</hi> of the Candidates of the Miniſtry be <hi>Eſtabliſht</hi> by your <hi>Authority.</hi>

The Laſt hint ſhall be, that our <hi>Church Government</hi> muſt be Strengthen'd, if the Kingdom of CHRIST be preſerved in it's Viſible Glory. This Government is much Enfeebled; and one cauſe is becauſe there is not a more Publick Regular &amp; Cloſe U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion between Particular Churches. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to remedy this has been by a <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Synod</hi> Propounded under the Head of the <hi>Conſociation of Churches in a Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</hi> And ſome <hi>Propoſals</hi> have Lately been made, to bring that Synodical Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into Practice, by the Body of our Miniſters; but nothing has been Effected through Weakneſs of our Church State: the <hi>Propoſals</hi> themſelves have been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented, and <hi>Prophanely</hi> deſcanted on, and the Body of our Miniſters inſulted, and Blaſphemed by ſome of the <hi>Sons of Corah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me here take Liberty to Offer to the Conſideration of our <hi>Fathers in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> whether the Convening a <hi>Synod</hi> by your Authority at this Day to Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what <hi>Remedy's</hi> may be Apply'd to theſe

and other <hi>Diſtempers</hi> which our Church State is Enfeebled by, may not be more than a <hi>Prudential,</hi> a <hi>Preſent Duty.</hi> The <hi>Uſe</hi> &amp; <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of SYNODS for Reformation, has been Aſſerted through all Ages of the Church. Can there be a more Favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Opportunity for Calling a <hi>Synod</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, than under the <hi>Preſent Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,</hi> and before ſome of our moſt <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Worthy's</hi> in the Miniſtry are Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated to a <hi>Better World?</hi> If a <hi>Synod</hi> be not a ſufficient <hi>Remedy</hi> for the Evils our Churches Labour of; or the Remedy be thought as <hi>Dangerous</hi> as the Diſeaſe; what Darkneſs, Confuſion, and Diſorder may we not Fear will ſoon overtake us?</p>
            <p>If you are reſolved to appears as <hi>Gods</hi> for us, you have Power to do much for this People on theſe accounts: You have now an <hi>Opportunity</hi> in your Hands. And if GOD ſpirit you for your Work, and make you Inſtrumental to Lengthen out our Tranquility; Uncommon <hi>Honours</hi> will be decreed you in <hi>Both Worlds.</hi> Tho' you muſt <hi>Dy like Men,</hi> yet you ſhall <hi>Riſe</hi> and

Live like the <hi>Angels of GOD.</hi> You are now ſtyled <hi>Gods,</hi> and if you Maintain the Glory of your Character, and Reſemble GOD, you ſhall not be Degraded in the Next Life; You ſhall be found <hi>Worthy</hi> to ſtand before the <hi>SON OF MAN</hi> at his <hi>Appearance</hi> and <hi>Kingdom; Worthy</hi> of that <hi>World</hi> and the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To Conclude,</hi> Let the <hi>Whole Body of this People</hi> be perſwaded to approve themſelves Worthy of ſuch Rulers, by aſpiring after an holy Conformity to, and Imitation of GOD. What remains! But that we lift up our hearts to GOD in Heaven, that He would give us ſuch Rulers to go in and out before us. And if GOD will Anſwer us, and make our Rulers, and this People to be GOD like, we ſhall be a happy People. The <hi>Mountains will</hi> bring forth <hi>Peace,</hi> and the little <hi>Hills Righteouſneſs: Our Land</hi> ſhall not be called <hi>Deſolate, nor Forſaken;</hi> for the <hi>Glory</hi> of the LORD ſhall ariſe upon it.
