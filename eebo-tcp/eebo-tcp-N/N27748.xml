            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IF our government has purſued the courſe dictated by the ſpirit of our revolution; if good government requires the ſubjugation of one half of the community; if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans have deſerved the laſhes and contempt which have been moſt liberally dealt to them in this State for eleven yeare; or if the ſpirit of perſecution has ſubſided: then the writer of theſe pages has been extremely unfortunate in the choice of his ſubject.</p>
            <p>But Intolerance, with its hydra heads, ſtill roams about the ſtate, and no mercy is ſhewn to thoſe, who doubt the wiſdom of the preſent adminiſtration The efforts of an individual are feeble when oppoſed to the phalanx which ſtand prepared to cruſh, in its infancy, freedom of enquiry and diſcuſſion. If theſe ſentiments, claiming no high parentage, ſhould fail of gaining the patronage of <hi>numbers</hi> in the ſtate, they will be unable to endure even through the ſhort period which generally bounds the exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſuch ephemeral productions.</p>
            <p>Theſe pages preſent the corner-ſtone of an AMERICAN PALACE, and the dark vault where are to be entombed, in eternal ſleep, the liberties and hopes of this, and future generations. The foundation of a MONA<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note>. The ariſtocracies already formed, are to be the pillars of this magnificent building. The glory of this latter houſe is to tranſcend that of the edifice of freedom, which, erected on the rains of palaces, lately preſented a maſſy colonnade of human bones. What infant, in his nurſe's arms, is to be the progenitor of an illuſtrious race of AMERICAN MONARCHS, is yet unknown.</p>
            <p>Are ſuch ſuggeſtions to be lightly regarded when it is now known, that a number of men, who have been our political leaders, were holding their meetings in the year 1787, to coutrive ways and means for the eſtabliſhment of what they termed, <hi>A Conſederated Monarchy?</hi> When we read the ſpeech of general Hamilton, in the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral Convention, and now find him at the head of our army? When we hear our leading men avow, that this country can never be governed without an <hi>Hereditary Monarch?</hi> When we ſee the appropriate plans of <hi>Monarchy</hi> adopted by adminiſtration? When we read the federal papers ſided with reſlections on liberty and republicaniſm, and with praiſes of <hi>Monarchical</hi> government? When Fenno, the mouth-piece of the federal party, has juſt publiſhed a ſcheme of a <hi>Federated, Preſidential, Monarchical Ariſtocracy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the following pages I have endeavored to repreſent <hi>truly</hi> the tendency of the leading meaſures of our government; and even if one half of my poſitions and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions be juſt, <hi>a Monarchy is decidedly before us.</hi> The men now in place have been the contrivers or advocates of theſe <hi>meaſures.</hi> If the people approve the <hi>means</hi> and the <hi>end,</hi> they will doubtleſs continue the <hi>inſtruments</hi> in operation; otherwiſe a new elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will open to republicans a new and moſt deſirable proſpect.</p>
            <p>Our ſouthern brechren wonder that Connecticut, once the garden of liberty, ſhould now appear to be the hot-bed of ariſtocracy—that Connecticut, internally the moſt democratie ſtate in the union or in the world—a ſtate, where the opinions of the
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:036977_0003_100B72AD0B2C7170"/>people have governed for more than a century—where goverment is leſs expem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> and energetic than in any other ſtate—and where diſtinction of rank is hardly known, ſhould be attached to expenſive, energetic and ariſtocratic meaſures, tending to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the people and to create odious diſtinctions: But the <hi>people</hi> of Connecticut have not deſerved to loſe the confidence of republicans: They are radically attached to the principles of 1776, and to the declaration of independence, and are mortal ſoes to hereditary monarchy; but by certain operations of federal policy, (as will be ſeen in the appendix) <hi>the people</hi> have no opportunity to expreſs their opinions on federal men and meaſures.</p>
            <p>If atheiſm and modern philoſophy prevailed in the ſtate, there might be ſome fear of the final prevalence of ariſtocracy; but <hi>there is not an atheiſt in the ſtate, nor a ſingle modern philoſopher among the republican party.</hi> D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iſm is not prevalent; yet there are deiſts in both parties, whoſe infidelity has originated from cauſes wholly unco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine Church and State; but the body of the clergy, though they have preached Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſon and Barruel rather freely, have good intentions, and as faſt as they ſhall diſcover <hi>the tendency of our meaſures to be againſt religion,</hi> they will become good republicans. In the ſtate are ſome hypocrites, who carry their religion to market, and are willing to take pay for it in public offices and honors; yet the number of theſe is ſmall and will probably decreaſe.</p>
            <p>For eleven years freedom of the preſs and of opinion has been reſtrained; federal meaſures have been preſented to the people, <hi>highly colored and embelliſhed with cuts;</hi> an habitual confidence in the ſtate repreſentation has been extended to the federal repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation: After the exertions of the revolutionary war, the people, habitually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, retired to their farms and occupations, and the calm, which naturally ſucceeds the turbulence of war, ſuperinduced by federal opiates, has hitherto pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them in a ſtate of peaceful ſubmiſſion to the conſtituted authorities.</p>
            <p>But a ſeaſon has now arrived, when "a little more ſleep, a little more ſlumber, a little more folding of the hands to ſleep," and they aſſuredly wake to a ſtate of <hi>political ruin</hi> more dreadful to freemen than the ruins of empires. Our people are now rapidly declaring themſelves on the republican ſide: The tendency of meaſores has rouſed them, and we ſhall finally prove to the world, that as Connecticut was among the <hi>firſt to aſſert,</hi> ſhe will be among the <hi>laſt to reſign,</hi> the bleſſings of equal government and the ineſtimable rights of man.</p>

            <head>Political Delusion.</head>
            <p>ON the eve of a day ſet apart for a literary feaſt of fat things, I have judged that a plain diſh would be moſt acceptable. Indeed had it been aſſigned to me to ſpeak to you of Greece and Rome; of the inexhauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible treaſures of Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic, or to have diſcuſſed the height and diameter of the antedilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians, or to have explained the cauſe why a black man is not a white man, or why an an elm-tree does not bear apricots: you muſt have ſat here in ſilence, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit would never have moved me to addreſs you. Avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing literary diſcuſſion, I have ſelected as the theme of this occaſion, THE EXTENT AND POWER OF POLITICAL DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LUSION.</p>
            <p>The <hi>character</hi> of deluſion is moſt ſtrongly marked at its firſt appearance in our world, when Satan (<hi>cide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> that old ſerpent, now called "the arch jacobin"<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. Lee's Sermon, preached at Colebrook, July 4, 1800.</note>) practiſed his deceit on our federal mother, ſaying to her, "For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then ſhall your eyes be opened and ye ſhall be as gods knowing good and evil." In the work of deceit Satan has in all ages been uniform; he begins by quoting the knowledge of God in proof of that which is falſe; he wiſhes to perſuade men to do that which they ought to avoid; he promiſes them good, and they ſuffer evil; thoſe, who follow his advice, find the earth curſed for their ſakes; thorns and thiſtles ſpring up in place of fruits and flowers; by the ſweat of their faces they eat their bread, till they return to the ground; and as for Satan, ſooner or later he appears to thoſe, whom he has d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>gents</hi> of deluſion are, the great, the wiſe, rich and mighty men of the world. These, acting with powers of ſubſtitution, are very ſagacious in chooſing, and ſucceſsful in ſecuring, fit inſtruments for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. Deluſion prepares his prime agents with charming outſides, engaging manners, powerful addreſs and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible argument. He furniſhes them with an accurate knowledge of the heart, and opens all the avenues to the paſſions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>means</hi> of deluſion are, uniformly the walking in a vain ſhow, hypocriſy aſſuming the garb of religion, pride of meekneſs, knavery of honeſty, ambition of patriotiſm. As a full aſſumption of character is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſucceſs, and as deluſion naturally over-acts, you find the greateſt impoſtors in our world to have appeared more holy, meek, honeſt and patriotic than other men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>object</hi> of deluſion is, to gain the wealth, honors and favors of men by cheap, falſe and inſidious means.</p>
            <p>The <hi>subjects</hi> of deluſion are, the laboring and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate people throughout the world. Their toil goes to ſupport the ſplendor, luxury and vices of the deluders, or their blood flows to ſatiate lawleſs ambition. Nearly the whole of Africa and a conſiderable part of Aſia, are ſubject to the deluſions of Europe: ſlaves in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe troops muſt ſweat under a ſcorching ſun to bear or follow the palanquin of a lordly maſter: ſlaves by ſhip loads muſt be dragged from their homes to ſerve imperious tyrants; immenſe multitudes muſt be bowing to ſtocks and ſtones, or kneeling before images and lighted tapers, to gratiſy the zeal of impoſtors.</p>
            <p>The <hi>end</hi> of deluſion is, the elevation of the deluders to a condition of power, ſplendor and infallibility, and the reduction of the deluded from knowledge to ignorance,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036977_0006_100B72B419A79C98"/>from freedom to ſlavery, from wealth to want, from preſent enjoymen to a deſtitution of all things, and from future hopes to ceaſeleſs doubt.</p>
            <p>Having defined my ſubject I ſhall exclude from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion all ancient deluſions, from a perſuaſion that to us the preſent moment, the preſent character of man, the preſent form and preſſure of the times are infinitely more intereſting than all the paſt.</p>
            <p>I might have entertained you with ſome of the light ſkirmiſhes of deluſion in the ordinary walks of life; but have preferred to lead you at once into the political field, where he brings into general action all his forces and diſplays all his character.</p>
            <p>Having no leiſure to make long porches, or to take by houſe-row, the meaſures of our government, I ſhall begin with the COMMERCIAL, SYSTEM, which, like a common hall, gives you acceſs to all the rooms of the federal building.</p>
            <p>When republicans<note n="*" place="bottom">The terms "republican and democrat," are uſed ſynonomouſly throughout: becauſe the men who maintain the principles of 1776, are characteriſed by one or the other of theſe names in different parts of the country.</note> complain of a Navy, of diplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic corps, of Algerine tribute, or Britiſh treaty, the uniform reply of the agents of deluſion is, "all theſe things are neceſſary to commerce, and commerce is the handmaid of induſtry; abridge our political arrangements, ſay they, and all your well-earned produce would periſh— your ſhip-timber and ſhips would be of no value—your ſeamen would become towns-poor—your rope-walks go to decay, and your merchants become bankrupt!"</p>
            <p>Now every well-informed merchant knows that there is not one word of truth in all this; yet as Deluſion has forged the ſtory for his benefit, he is diſpoſed not to diſcredit it, and when ſuch a plauſible kind of things get a currency, they will paſs like a well counterſeited bill, till by accident the deceit is diſcovered, by which time the counterfeiter has gained all his ends. Every reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036977_0007_100B72B5A6C98120"/>man knows that if the moſt worthleſs produce in the world will attract our veſſels to the moſt diſtant ports, laden with the ſtaples of this country, then theſe ſtaples would, from their intrinſic and unfailing value, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the profits of the carrying trade, invite the merchants of thoſe ports to come and purchaſe of us. At our own doors we can make better bargains than abroad; we loſe nothing by dangers of ſea, waſtage, caſualties or bankruptcy; we receive every think at full weight and guage, and our articles are put off in the beſt poſſible order without any diminution.</p>
            <p>But, if with free ports and commerce thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, our merchants could not live, then they live now merely by virtue of certain advantages tendered to them by the government, every one of which takes a million of dollars out of your pockets in order to enable you to gain half a million in another way. If the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying trade is valuable, and we retaining this trade by political arrangements ſecure it to our merchants, and yet Spain, Holland and Great Britain are willing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change their manufactures in their own ports for our produce, then ſurely our produce would be in high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and an object of ſupreme competition, if go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would ſuffer the carrying trade to operate as a premium in favor of our market.</p>
            <p>The fundamental propoſition, viz. that ſeparate from the preſent ſyſtem, our articles would not be in market, is pointedly denied, and if this is falſe, the whole ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure falls.</p>
            <p>The real object is diametrically oppoſite to the oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible one. The agricultural intereſt, inſtead of being helped, is vitally attacked. This charming commercial ſyſtem, ſo ſedulouſly and artfully addreſſed to the yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manry of our country, is a ſyſtem of indebtedneſs and eventual bankruptcy. Confining the carrying trade to ourſelves, opens an infinite field of credit to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, Millions of property, belonging to the farmers,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036977_0008_100B72B80AC0FDA0"/>muſt conſtantly be in the hands of the merchants; for if the avails of our produce are to come from all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the globe, there muſt be an average credit given by the farmers till the returns can be made. This draws on to the water an immenſe quantity of property, and intereſts the farmers ſtrongly in the ſucceſs of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants whom they have truſted. This property on the water is within fiſcal purview and control. Government has purpoſes to anſwer. The merchant is indirectly the collector of a great portion of the revenue. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant can lend ſhips and cargoes to government. The merchant can plan long, circuitous and hazardous voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages apparently at his own riſque; but really at the riſque of the farmer; for all loſſes muſt eventually fall on thoſe who truſt. Theſe arrangements lead up great capitals in trade, great bankruptcies and great fortunes. They fill the ſea with veſſels and ſailors, valuable auxiliaries and reverberators to a naval ſyſtem. This laſt being calculated to protect the merchants, ſecures their perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual attachment, and they freely advocate the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary expenſes of an armament. Their influence is thrown directly in the ſcale oppoſed to the farmer, and government has thereby ſecured a number of capital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts to whom reſort may be had in the day when grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing runs low at the treaſury.</p>
            <p>Before the adoption of this ſyſtem ſilver and gold moved according to the laws of induſtry; but now banks are introduced, giving to paper a forced and unnatural circulation, taking the command of the medium of all buſineſs from the agricultural intereſt,<note n="*" place="bottom">Money ought to repreſent induſtry; the farmer's dollars earned by labor do repreſent it: bank bills do not. It is hard on the farmer, that the man who earns nothing through the year, ſhould be able with an indorſed note to ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:036977_0009_100B72BC04A20900"/>
It is no wonder that in the complexity of this policy, the farmer is loſt in the midſt of paper bills, boundleſs credit, crouded harbors, princely eſtates, and made to cry out, O! the depth of the wiſdom of adminiſtration! little dreaming that he has in fact paid and is paying an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually the whole proſits of the carrying trade, the whole of the Algerine tribute, the expenſe of all commercial treaties—of all the conſuls abroad—the amount of all the loſſes by ſea—of all bad markets, and of all navy expenſes—that the money, which he pays, ſuffers many ſweatings before it gets to the treaſury, and that what he does not pay is placed on intereſt, and that the land from which he raiſes this produce, which excites ſuch a fatherly care of government, is pledged for the payment of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and intereſt, and that his children may always ſee the date and amount of the mortgage by calling on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors of the revenue. Little ſhort of miracle can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem men from ſuch maſterly ſtrokes of deluſion.</p>
            <p>This mercantile ſyſtem leads up an appearance of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe proſperity, the reality of which is eraftily aſcribed to government; but individuals appear to the world moſt thrifty, when they are thriftily expending the price of their mortgaged eſtates: nations appear moſt buſy and thriving in ſeaſons of the greateſt expenſe and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic diſſipation: for ſuch occaſions draw all the money into view and give it a rapid circulation. When a dollar changed owners once in a week it counted only for a dollar; but when by the magic power of a forced com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce it changes owners an hundred times in a week it counts for an hundred dollars. If all the property of a town like this were to be tranſported every day through all the ſtreets, there would be great commotion and a great ſhow of buſineſs and wealth, and the gaping world might admire the thrift of the place and might lend mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney on the credit of it. Juſt like ſuch a farce is that of the great public proſperity now enjoyed. The people are not more induſtrious than they were before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution:
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036977_0010_100B72BD88DB74C0"/>they are certainly more extravagant, mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages abound more on the records—<hi>including public and private indebtedneſs, there never was a ſeaſon before this when the people were ſo deeply involved.</hi> Burn all your paper-bills and your paper evidences of debt, public and private, worlds full of which would not add one cent to the real wealth of any country, or collect the debts evidenced by theſe papers, and which now lie as a heavy weight on the houſes, lands and induſtry of the people, and this viſion of proſperity would vaniſh: but this deluſion anſwers the political purpoſes of unſettling the public mind, of deſtroying frigid ideas of economy, and of making tolerable many public projections, which otherwiſe would be deteſted.</p>
            <p>This commercial ſyſtem preſents to the world an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe tonnage, which not only fortifies the appearance of proſperity; but affords employment to a numerous claſs of men on land, who muſt feel grateful for a ſyſtem which yields them wealth; and it employs a number of maſters and mates, who muſt kiſs the hand which feeds them; and ſailors, who are moſt valuable aſtringents in the ingredient of power, and may anſwer for lining to wooden walls: and deluſion whiſpers that by theſe things all the money is ſaved among ourſelves. Though this is among Deluſion's weak tricks, yet it is too often ſucceſsful. It has been well ſaid that it will coſt two ducats to keep one in priſon. To the man, who is able to pay for money, it matters not whether that which is to fill his coffers be now in his own town, or in Madrid or Canton: his induſtry will draw in from the ends of the earth. If we lived on an iſthmus or an iſland, the ſuggeſtion of ſaving the money might be more plauſible; but living in a country of immenſe extent, capable of employing more than ten times its number of inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, capable of infinite internal defence, and of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tributary to us all nations ſo long as natural or arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial wants ſhall be known in the world, it is an idle
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036977_0011_100B72BFEA722A48"/>ſuggeſtion—and the time will come, when it will be hard to make the readers of hiſtory believe that Americans in the infancy of ſociety, of ſettlement and agriculture, did ſeriouſly undertake to fight their way through nations, whom they could not buy nor bribe, to carry the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of life to the men of thoſe nations who were periſhing for the want of them, and then with a return-cargo of far leſs uſeful produce to fight their way home again—and that all this was done with the full and free conſent of the men who raiſed the exports, and who could have ſold them without hazard for a better price at their own doors.</p>
            <p>Commerce, aided by banks, draws property into the hands of men without the medium of induſtry. Such men not knowing the earning of money are adventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and extravagant. They become embarraſſed—and nearly one half of the people in our populous cities are running after the other half in conſequence of this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment. The debtor walks quick when he is avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his creditor. The creditor moves quick after him. The bankrupt ſells rapidly his ſtock on hand. The vendue rooms receive the refuſe. Theſe are domeſtic ſcenes of proſperity! On the water we are loſing ſhips and cargoes and lives, and to foreign courts are dancing attendance or paying tribute for theſe privileges.</p>
            <p>On this commercial ſubject deluſion is ſtrong; it preſents imaginary advantages, demonſtrable on paper, but falſe in fact, and theſe can be preſented in every variety and ſucceſſion. Impreſſions are eaſily made: loſs or gain equally ſtimulate the ſpirit of adventure. Commerce draws into its vortex one claſs of men after another, and when the farming intereſt yields decidedly to this faſcinating ſyſtem, but a few years elapſe before commerce commands all the wealth of the country. A navy becomes neceſſary, and the ſame neceſſity which laſt year led up ſloops of war, this year leads up frigates, and the next ſhips of the line; ſloops can only beat off
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036977_0012_100B72C178B79B88"/>gun-boats; frigates and ſhips can only meet equal guns: the principle of power demands that we be the moſt powerful; increaſed debt and taxes are inevitable: the enormous expenſe of ſupporting a navy<note n="*" place="bottom">The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

During the ſeaſon of war, the miniſter has an army and navy at command—war requires expenſe, huſhes clamor and veils in myſtery all cabinet meaſures. I ſhall now open to you the appropriate deluſions of the WAR SYSTEM.</p>
            <p>War preſents to all the country a commiſſion to ſeize and carry to legal adjudication the commercial
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036977_0014_100B72C7146173F8"/>property of an adverſe nation. War opens all the floodgates of the human paſſions. War calls into the employment of government an immenſe multitude. Contractors through all the mechanical arts pronounce a bleſſing on war. The grazier adores the adminiſtration. The legions attached to admiralty courts, inſurers, deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in ſtock, bankrupts and all men to whom change of times muſt be for the better, bleſs the government. The capitaliſt who has long kept his money for the public, bleſſes the occaſion, and over them all the chaplain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces an hearty amen. In the midſt of all, the ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling patriots, unwilling to be outdone by their brethren, bring their offerings of rags to the treaſury, and from the midſt of expenſe and national diſſipation forth comes the government immenſely rich in all the magnificence of paper.</p>
            <p>Though Deluſion has played this farce a thouſand times, over, and has always ſucceſsfully compaſſed the <hi>means,</hi> it has never concealed the <hi>end.</hi> That end is uniformly the degrading of morals and religion—de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of buſineſs—increaſe of national debt, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a long train of public burdens—decreaſe of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and ſocial happineſs, and a certain ſinking of the people beneath the civil, military and naval functionaries of this mighty farce.</p>
            <p>The tribes of Africa fight, becauſe Europeans will buy their priſoners. Cabinets wage wars, becauſe by them they are ſure of their object, which is to exalt themſelves and to humble thoſe who are beneath them. This has always been the caſe, and always will be, ſo long as the people give the reins out of their own hands; ſo longs as they beſtow more power on government than is abſolutely neceſſary, ſo long as they ſuffer themſelves and their opinions to be deſpiſed. Wars have been the means by which theſe cabinets have effected their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.

Courtiers tell <hi>slaves</hi> that liberty is in danger, or that infidels abound and the church is in hazard, or of plots at home, or invaſions and inſults abroad. Courtiers' waiters echo the alarm. Court-telegraphs ſpread the ſound. Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſuiſts find it typified in the pentateuch.

               </gap> armies are raiſed; the legions, who depend on war for ſupport, are all in motion; the papers are full of news; public curioſity is on the ſtretch. The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, which in time of peace was occupied only in the means of internal order, has now to conſult the balances of foreign governments—to receive letters weighing five ownces in ſhips of 500 tons ſailing in ballaſt—is thronged with expreſſes; great ſcences are opening; the naval armament, which but for this had been laid up in dry docks, and the army, which in time of peace was in no eſtimation, riſe into importance; prize-maſters arrive with the ill-gotten wealth of honeſt adventurers. The country abounds with proof prints of admirals and generals, and naval engagements, forts ſtormed and all the dignified array of carnage and deſolation.</p>
            <p>Here Deluſion opens batteries, which are never ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced till liberty and public happineſs are gone forever; for a war ſyſtem is fatal to them both.</p>
            <p>When courtiers tell you that ſuch a ſyſtem can alone preſerve peace, fly or fight the deluſion. Mark you that the man who learns the art of fencing in his youth is ſeldom contented with having received his leſſons; you will hear of him in a duel. An army or a navy well officered and manned is always reſtleſs in a ſtate of peace: war muſt and will be had at ſome rate.

A nation which makes <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> its poleſtar can never be free: beneath national greatneſs ſink individual greatneſs, honor, wealth and freedom. But though hiſtory, experience and reaſoning confirm theſe ideas; yet all-powerful Deluſion has been able to make the people of every nation lend a helping hand in putting on their own fetters and rivetting their own chains, and in this ſervice Deluſion always employs men too great to ſpeak the truth, and yet too powerful to be doubted. Their ſtatements are believed—their projects adopted—their ends anſwered, and the deluded ſubjects of all this artifice are left to paſſive obedience through life, and to entail a condition of unqualified non-reſiſtance to a ruined poſterity.</p>

            <p>But admiral Harvey has ſaid that our 44 gun frigates were 74's in diſguiſe! well perhaps he had heard that they coſt as much as 74's, or that under the guiſe of theſe frigates was concealed a plan of an immenſe navy, the expenſe of which would eternize our national debt and enſure a perpetuity of energetic government. But our ſhips are not only ſtrong as mountains, they are ſwift as eagles, captain Tryon ſays ſo himſelf: and not only ſtrong and ſwift; but ſo full of courage, "that men are run through the body for looking pale," ſays lieutenant Sterret. Surely all theſe things might have been omened from the ſucceſs attending their launching.</p>

With ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable ſkill every thing has been prepared, and with an eaſy graceful motion the ſhip glides on to the boſom of the waters, which receive the preſent from the earth with humble gratitude.

            <p>In the profeſſion of the law Deluſion has ſecured to government an ariſtocracy highly intelligent and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and to theſe is entruſted the ladder of promotion, which they hold with as much power and claim of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription as the pope holds the keys of St. Peter; and

            <p>All theſe ariſtocracies and meaſures which I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, correſpond exactly with the ſyſtems of monarchical government. At the end of eleven years, the American nation (formerly called the United States) have with great induſtry got into a good ſtate of preparation for an hereditary monarch. Mr. Lyman tells us, that 'the ruling party is united in their <hi>object,</hi> though divided as to the <hi>means</hi>—the firſt is for bold ſtrokes, the laſt for addreſs and reaſoning? We will not run in debt to this defunct federaliſt for a definition of this object. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a republican government; <hi>that</hi> the people have long prayed for in vain. It cannot be to get more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney out of the people; for you, federaliſts, are now ſunk up to your necks in their pockets. It cannot be to ſend more ambaſſadors and conſuls abroad; for they have already glutted every market. It is not to fund more debt; all claims have been deluged with the liberality of government. Why the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is to cruſh oppoſition: theſe two ſegments of fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſm, after having made arrangements obnoxious to one half of the country, are to cruſh that half, and then
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:036977_0026_100B72E4A5938D78"/>the firſt chapter is completed; but they are united in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other object, viz. an energetic, ariſtocratic, monarchic government, which can move without control; both parts are united to ſubjugate the republicans, and now call for a few years more to complete the work.<note n="*" place="bottom">If it be true, as ſome ſay, that a new adminiſtration could not change the preſent ſyſtem, then I agree with the advocates of preſent meaſures, that we ought to have an hereditary monarch.

            <p>My evidence of the exiſtence of ſuch an intention on the one part, (which muſt be the intention of the other if they are united) might reſult from the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of general Hamilton already quoted, or from a declaration of preſident Adams to the ſame effect;<note n="†" place="bottom">That the people will not be happy till their chief magiſtrate is hereditary.</note> for theſe men know preciſely what the leaders are ſeeking: but I chooſe to rely for proof on the complexion of federal meaſures already ſubmitted. We have a ſure key to the <hi>feelings</hi> of the Federal party in their joy at the ſuppoſed capture of Moreau's army; their triumphs on the ſucceſs of Nelſon; their exultation at the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and perjured ſtory of Barbaczy, that the directory had cauſed the murder of their own envoys at Raſtadt; their ſtrong affection for Suwarrow; their zeal for the ſucceſs of the Britiſh arms—and for the humiliation of republicans in France, Holland and Ireland.

            <p>Having diſcuſſed the artful means, and dreadful end of political deluſion, I ſhall now mark to you in diſtinct characters the AGENTS OF DELUSION. A queſtion is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten propoſed, how it is poſſible that our greateſt and moſt pious men ſhould betray us? I anſwer, becauſe you have every thing to loſe and they every thing to gain. Who under the ancient government of France deluded the people and held them in vaſſalage? the greateſt men, the moſt pious men! Who hold in ſubjection the people of Ruſſia, Germany and Poland? the greateſt and moſt pious of men! Who in England delude the people with dreams of national proſperity in the midſt of national
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:036977_0029_100B72EC95AB9F68"/>bankruptcy? the lords ſpiritual and temporal! Who have been filling the world with deſolating wars for many centuries? the dignitaries of church and ſtate: men whoſe elevated birth or talents have raiſed them to elevated ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and given them an immenſe influence over the people. Wealth and talents are like the mines of Peru to crowned heads: they know well how to ſeek, alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize and improve their treaſures. The tendency of all governments is towards monarchy: diſtinction of rank is among the firſt objects. When the leaders have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed this, the body of the people ſink into a ſtupid maſs, to be thereafter ranked as in the firſt claſs of cattle, to be driven to the military ſlaughter-houſes, to be ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped abroad for foreign conſumption, or to be dragging about their hated lives at home, ſubject to the laſh and command of imperious lords, raiſed from nothing, by the power of deluſion practiſed on themſelves.</p>
            <p>Greatneſs and littleneſs are only ideas of compariſon: as the baſe of the mountain is in the depth of the valley; ſo the baſe of great men is in the lowneſs, poverty, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and humility of the people. Pride ſtimulates the knowing to be great: power furniſhes the means. When they would enſlave the people, they preſent to them pictures of liberty; when they would impoveriſh them, they preſent pictures of wealth; when they would lead them to war, they preſent pictures of peace and ſecurity. Deluſion can never ſucceed by exhibiting unadorned fact. Even the powers of reaſon and eloquence, which may be turned to infinite good, are often devoted to the production of infinite evil. When the Britiſh treaty was in diſcuſſion, had the cool reaſon of the country been addreſſed, that inſtrument had never been ratified; but when an eloquent ſtateſman,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Ames.</note> puſhing beyond this cold region, addreſſed the paſſions of the country, alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the farmer with fears of danger, and rouſed the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant by hopes of indemnity, <hi>he gained attention;</hi> when
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:036977_0030_100B72EE186D9DC8"/>he preſented "on the ſea coaſt vaſt loſſes uncompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated; on the frontier, Indian war; on our territory, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al encroachment; national diſcord and abaſement," <hi>he wrought ſtrong impreſſions;</hi> but when fathers were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to witneſs the corn fields fartened with the blood of their ſons and mothers; to hear the war-whoop waking the ſleep of the cradle, <hi>he became irreſiſtible;</hi> and to the tune of ſuch harmonious ſongs the people of every country are in danger of dancing away their rights. When every meaſure fatal to liberty can be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear conducive to it, their is need of infinite vigilance. Our great men are ready enough to preach to us peace and ſafety, even while they are leading us into ſyſtems, which will enſure to the earth a drenching of human blood through all generations, and will waft us to the ſound of the war-whoop from all the military nations of the earth.</p>
            <p>Theſe great men, who are to gain by every ſyſtem inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to freedom and equal government, are the <hi>beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> men in ſociety. They are well verſed in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages and hiſtory and political ſcience, and are able to ſay <hi>more</hi> and argue <hi>better</hi> on the wrong ſide of the queſtion than the people are on either ſide of it. In all governments they are retained in favor of meaſures, if not by offices and bribes; yet by hopes of office, of emolument, of honors and influence. All their hopes are pledged on a perfect underſtanding of every part of the ſubject. Their paſſions combine with their intereſts to make them eagle-eyed and diligent to know what the people will bear; to watch the fit moment; to attack the weak ſide, and to make entry wherever they find a looſe clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board. Such men harangued the country at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our government, by telling them "that the people would be ſovereign; that the poor would be favored; that the agricultural intereſts would be held ſacred and eſpecially <hi>that taxes would be light.</hi>" But when a heavy debt was created, oſtenſibly from motives of juſtice to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:036977_0031_100B72EF9B78E1F8"/>the ſoldiers, though few had any intereſt in it, the air was filled with proteſtations of gratitude and honeſty.— The people were indignant; but theſe artful men ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the riſing murmurs. Deluſion ſat aloft and ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſubtilty of her ſons.</p>
            <p>Theſe men can prove concluſively that a national debt is a bleſſing or a curſe; that an army deſtroys or cheriſhes freedom; that the friends of government are the guardian angels of liberty, and that the oppoſers are a part of Satan's choſen legion. They can prove that the people virtually choſe electors, when the men, choſen to <hi>preſcribe the manner</hi> of the people's chooſing, ſay<note n="*" place="bottom">The conſtitution of the U. S. declares, that each ſtate ſhall appoint, in ſuch manner as the legiſlature thereof ſhall <hi>direct,</hi> a number of electors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By the word <hi>ſtate,</hi> is meant <hi>the people of the ſtate.</hi> The wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neither the people nor the legiſlature will chooſe them A few <hi>wiſe</hi> men in the legiſlature will chooſe them, and they will cauſe the <hi>weak</hi> men (if any ſuch ſhould be found in the precincts of that houſe) to vote according to orders.</note> that they are the people, and will chooſe for themſelves. They can prove that counſellors<note n="†" place="bottom">See Appendix.</note> and members of congreſs, choſen by men who never ſaw nor knew them, are more cautiouſly and judiciouſly choſen, than if their conſtituents were their own neighbors; becauſe in the laſt caſe partiality or paſſion might influence, which never could be the caſe when they know nothing about them.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Here reference is had to the ſtate's voting at large (inſtead of voting by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts.)</note> They can prove that the country grows rich, in proportion to the taxes paid; juſt as a trench grows wide, in proportion to the lands taken from it.</p>
            <p>Subtle arguments, well directed and eloquently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced, ſometimes lead men aſtray on queſtions of mere right and wrong. Shall we then wonder that men ſhould be deluded on ſubjects far more complicated?</p>
            <p>The end to be anſwered by theſe arguments is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe? it compaſſes all the objects at which deluſion has been aiming ever ſince it appeared in Eden. Do
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:036977_0032_100B72F31304D1F8"/>you ſee any wordly motives in theſe eloquent patriots? Have you never known that a director of a bank wiſhes for a large capital to be ſubject to his control? that a judge is pleaſed with an extenſion of his juriſdiction? that a general is anxious for an increaſe of the army eſtabliſhment? and that a ſea-captain likes an addition of tonnage and guns to the ſhip which he is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? Theſe men, who talk thus perſuaſively to you either are, or expect to be, ſharers of the power which they wiſh you to delegate; or truſtees of the confidence which they wiſh you to repoſe; or managers of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which they wiſh you to pay. Hence their zeal: hence their perſuaſive eloquence! If you ſeem to doubt them they will aſk, are not we of you? are not our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts the ſame as yours? <hi>They are indeed, of you:</hi> ſo is the oak, which ſhades all the ſmaller trees and draws its nouriſhment from their roots, a part of the grove. <hi>They are of you:</hi> they tread the earth which you cultivate; they feed on the luxuries which your induſtry ſupplies, and if an earthquake ſhould ſwallow the contry, they muſt condeſcend to ſink with you; but by circumſtances of fortune, birth or ſuperior endowments of mind, or better education they have ceaſed to be <hi>as you;</hi> their political condition is immenſely different from yours: they are to govern, you are to be governed. <hi>They are well-born, you are baſe-born!</hi>

They are made to believe that religion is attacked; that the French are coming upon us; that the democrats are raiſing an army, or that the rays of preſidental favor, after melting down all the great men above them, may finally honor them with a ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. A great temptation with the baſe-born is, that by thus doing they keep the track of the great, dignified and wealthy; exactly the company which deſpiſes them and which they ought to avoid. If among theſe baſe-born ſhould be any abſtract philoſophers, who ſeeing that great beaſts devour little ones, and great fiſh the ſmaller, and are willing to devote themſelves by heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombs to the rapacity and gluttony of theſe great men, I wiſh them many conſolations as they are experiencing the work of maſtication and digeſtion. Surely devoured they will be, provided their learned, pious, juggling leaders, ſhould ſerve them as ſuch men have ſerved their followers in every age of the world.</p>
            <p>The uniform language of theſe great men is, 'a little more patience, a little more money, in a ſhort time <hi>ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams</hi> will be in abundance,' yet never was ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe realiſed.

            <p>That conſtitution delegated powers calculated for the contingencies of centuries; but it is a ſingular fact, that all thoſe contingencies have occurred in the courſe of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years of peace, and that theſe great men actually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, under the power of raiſing armies expreſsly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to congreſs, to provide that an army of 80,000 men might be raiſed <hi>at the pleaſure of the preſident.</hi> As well might they have ſaid 800,000, or have left the number wholly indefinite, or they might have made a general law that the preſident of the United States ſhould always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the functions of the legiſlature under this article. They might have gone further and enacted laws which, like the collects of the Romiſh ritual, would have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered all purpoſes, and then have ordained that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident might bring into operation thoſe laws, whenever he judged beſt, and then have adjourned without day. Theſe great men made a ſedition act; which, however conſtitutional in terms, was unconſtitutionally and baſely directed towards placing one claſs of our citizens at the feet of the other. They made an alien act, which was a very ingenious thing; but it would not go! And finally
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:036977_0035_100B72F7B733B2D8"/>having exhauſted their other powers, they raiſed a batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againſt the remonſtrances of the people, manned by a committee of privileges<note n="*" place="bottom">See proceedings of the Senate in the caſe of Duane.</note>; and began to work <hi>ſecretly</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the general clauſe, empowering them, 'to make all laws, which ſhould be neceſſary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, veſted by the conſtitution in the government of the United States or in any department thereof.' This, as they were about to work it, was to operate as a wide open gate, out of this encloſure which was ſo well fenced. They even attempted to take from the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the power, which theſe laſt <hi>had wreſted from the people,</hi> of chooſing electors. The machinery of this bill was perfect; but it would not go!</p>
            <p>Well, ſay theſe great men, the conſtitution is not yet violated: and, let me ſay, on your vague principles it never can be violated: but the conſtitution <hi>is in fact</hi> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, whenever an act is paſſed without the motives or cauſes, which that conſtitution contemplated as the baſis of ſuch act: for example, the conſtitution ſays, "you may borrow money on the credit of the United States; may coin money, raiſe and ſupport armies; provide and maintain a navy; appoint ambaſſadors;" now if money is unneceſſarily borrowed, or coined at great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and without occaſion; war declared; armies raiſed and navies provided without juſt cauſe; if ambaſſadors are ſent abroad to ſee whether water is fluid; what are the expenſes of living abroad; and what a wicked world we live in; ſurely, in all theſe caſes the conſtitution is violated; <hi>for the power is exerciſed under circumſtances which will not warrant its exerciſe.</hi> Even if the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution had ſaid "do whatever your hands find to do with all your might;" yet this would not have ſanction<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the enaction of one uſeleſs, oppreſſive or intolerant law, nor have juſtified the waſte of a cent of public money, nor the impoſition of one unneceſſary tax.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:036977_0036_100B72FB64818520"/>
It is Deluſion's ſelf which is conſtantly crying to you that the conſtitution is your ſacred bulwark and that it is yet inviolate. You, the people, muſt be the bulwark of that conſtitution, or it will never preſerve your rights: your ſentiments, your actions, your very ſouls muſt animate that conſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ution and give life and effect to its language. When the ſpirit of the people is lulled by the ſoft zephyrs of Deluſion into ſecurity in the lap of the conſtitution; when it relies on inanimate paper for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of rights, that people is in the firſt ſtage of ſlavery. Of what avail think you was the <hi>magna charta</hi> of Great Britain, to the millions who have been preſſed into na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val or military ſervice; to the authors and printers, who have periſhed in dungeons, or to the tens of thouſands, who for aſſerting ſome privileges under the magna char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta of the great God, have been tranſported to Botany-Bay, or ſuffered a gibbet at home? yet this magna charta, this precious boon of a king, benignantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring to the people one half of their rights, has been kept <hi>literally inviolate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a free government the rulers muſt reſign their pride, vanity and avarice; and in conſideration of the truſt repoſed in them <hi>muſt make ſacrifices,</hi> in order to yield to the people the bleſſings of a republic: but our rulers are not tempered to ſuch bargains: they like the money, the power, the titles and diſtinctions; but <hi>avoiding the ſacrifices,</hi> are puſhing hard to have the ſubſtance of ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocratic government under the form of a republic.— Hence their conſtant demands for energy to cruſh op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; but the ſeeds of oppoſition are ſown in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet.</p>
            <p>There is a ſtout hardy race of men in this country, who fought and paid for a republic. They have <hi>learned tactics</hi> which will enable them to out general your oblique manoeuvres. They dont reaſon logically as your great men do; but they have learned to ſpeak in language
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:036977_0037_100B72FDC03E9388"/>which kings and courtiers are obliged to underſtand; and ſhould there be any very loud call for additional energies, nothing but reſpect for the laws will reſtrain them from ſpeaking that language. They are even now inſulted with all the arguments which have been uſed in favor of <hi>energetic</hi> governments, ever ſince the days of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah: but every one knew long before our revolution that an energetic government could be ſupported: it is a piece of unfailing machinery; invented many centuries ago, and conſiſts in governing as much, in collecting as many taxes, and in employing as much force as the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned will bear without revolt. The patriarchal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of ſlaves is <hi>energetic;</hi> it goes to the utmoſt verge of endurance. Peter the Great, who civilized his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſuſpending them by thouſands over the Wolga in the moſt cruel tortures, was an <hi>energetic</hi> prince. The late Frederic, practiſed all the tactics of <hi>energy.</hi> Henry 4th and Lewis 14th were <hi>energetic.</hi> Nearly all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Europe are groaning under the bleſſings of <hi>ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getic</hi> government; and whenever the cry for energy with us overpowers the cry of the people for freedom, we ceaſe to have the government for which we bled.

            <p>Monarchy and republicaniſm part at this point; the firſt inſiſts on unity and energy; the laſt on ſuch a diviſion
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:036977_0038_100B73002029B420"/>of power that it cannot be dangerous. With ſuch divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion no laws can be made and no plans projected, except<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they be of general and obvious utility.

If it be ſaid we can have no peace nor wealth, except we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it by force: no reſpectability, except we conform to the policy and manners of other courts; <hi>Then-take that courſe with all its ſplendors. 'Tis not the courſe of a republic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Deluſion is ready to whiſper, theſe are all idle va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garies; but they are not the vagaries of modern philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, all the ſubjugated people of the earth have found them to be ſolemn, humbling, dreadful realities. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can prevent their eſtabliſhment here, but the united and perſevering efforts of thoſe who are deſtined to be deluded.</p>
            <p>Having preſented a courſe of deluſions under the head of theſe great men: you may be ready to aſk, If theſe men are dangerous, how ſhall we get rid of them? I anſwer, that theſe great and dangerous men, whoſe feelings and intereſts are always oppoſed to equal rights generally compoſe about <hi>one tenth</hi> of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. You have no other means to extricate your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but by paſſing over that part of the <hi>nine tenths</hi> whom they have ſecured by favors of deluded by their enchantments, and to chooſe from the remainder the firmeſt and moſt intelligent. What cries one and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will you leave our men of abilities and put in the <hi>baſe-born</hi> to govern us? Be compoſed, gentlemen, the <hi>baſe-born</hi> ſupport the government, and ſuppoſe you ſhould juſt let them have a peep through the key-hole of the treaſury door; they may ſee what will amuſe them. But you may be comforted, theſe great men are made of very flexible materials; and as ſoon as they find power to be decidedly on the other ſide of the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:036977_0039_100B7302F4704160"/>equation, they will be after it: and perhaps ſome of theſe <hi>baſe-born</hi> may prove themſelves to be better than they appear. You will recollect that the citizens of this country are like trees, all ſet out together: but, through the influence of a ſyſtem of favor, one part of them have been nurſed and watered, and the earth about them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched: they have had all the nouriſhment of the ground, the others have been neglected. Not only ſo, but the language to them has been "be ye accurſed, let no fruit grow on ye forever." Are we to wonder that all paſſers by admire the thrift and flouriſhing ſtate of the firſt, and are diſpoſed to ſay that the laſt ought to be cut down and gathered into bundles?</p>
            <p>'Tis a real misfortune to the nine-tenths of ſociety, that the other tenth ſhould be oppoſed to them; but never let it be fogotten, that the argument drawn from the coincidence of great and wiſe and holy politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in public meaſures, is of all others the moſt alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Theſe are the only men whom you have to fear. If ſome are apparently more holy than their neighbors, then if they meddle with your politics they are moſt capable of deceiving you: their holineſs may recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to heaven; but is no guarantee for their political rectitude. This claſs, however, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſet on by other great men: not by thoſe who are great becauſe they are rich; for theſe are the tools of another ſet, who are the knowing ones. In Athens thoſe who became too great and influential ſuffered oſtraciſm: but in this country we ought to have pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough to prevent any man, or claſs of men, from deſerving ſuch an honorable baniſhment.</p>
            <p>For my own part, I am willing to be governed by men greater, wiſer and richer than myſelf: but have no opinion of having men ſo great that their altitude muſt be taken by a quadrant and their width by a four rod chain: through exceſſive indulgence we have, already, a number of men too great for a republic. How comes
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:036977_0040_100B7304871B61B8"/>it that theſe great men are ſo very fit to govern? Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal government is deſigned to control inordinate paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: great men are moſt proud, avaricious, and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical: will you then ſelect theſe to curb pride, avarice and tyranny? Republican ſociety is to protect the weak againſt the ſtrong: but, if the ſtrong are to have all the power the weak will be oppreſſed. But ſays one and another, what will become of our great men? My anſwer is, that they always had addreſs enough to work their own paſſages. The great hoſt of mankind, the nine-tenths, are thoſe, which a republican government ought to concern itſelf about: and if this is faithfully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, the other tenth will ſtill gain ſuch a portion of power and money as will make them uſeful inſtead of dangerous. They are the very men for your purpoſes whenever you have reduced them to the ſtandard weight and meaſure of the people.</p>
            <p>I am well aware of the great convenience which many of you find in keeping cloſe to theſe knowing men, in gathering the crumbs which fall from the tables of the rich, and in ſailing under the lee of the eccleſiaſtical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy-ſhips; but you are taking a bad road: it is a broad road; it is <hi>the</hi> broad road: thouſands have paid turnpike toll on it before you were born; and, if you follow it, it may lead you to wealth and honors; it may ruin your country; but will certainly land you where it has landed all your predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>Having little confidence in addreſſing placemen, court ſycophants and thoſe who expect the wages of hirelings, I turn to the laſt general head of political deluſions, which is the ſubject of ELECTIONS TO OFFICE.</p>
            <p>If the career of deluſion could be ſtopped at the end of every two or four years, and the people could be left to exerciſe free and unbiaſſed elections, all the evils propoſed to you might be remedied; but deluſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves his greateſt ſtrength and ſubtlety for theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:036977_0041_100B7307B62C7050"/>which, in their turn, demand from me an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated force of diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p>Let me firſt preſent to you the deluſions, which have attended paſt elections. Formerly, the people of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try had ſenſe enough to originate and organize govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and, by their intelligence and energies, to keep it in operation; now, by force of <hi>federal opiates,</hi> they have juſt ſenſe enough to chooſe the wiſeſt and greateſt men, but, as ſoon as the choice is over, they ſink into a torpid ſtate, and thus remain for two years, till the trump of new election wakes them to new life and energy: but even then they have been ſo long dormant that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the crew of a ſhip muſt be murdered; this murder muſt be regiſtered in ſermons for the edification of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical ſaints; the men muſt continue bona fide dead, till the election is cloſed; miracles muſt be wrought at the bottom of meal tubs; the Indian tribes muſt be all in motion to invade the frontiers; mighty ſhips with mighty men in them muſt be traverſing the ocean on mighty, portentous and unaccountable errands; the whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical ſtage muſt be veiled in darkneſs and myſtery; clouds, tempeſts and coruſcations muſt mark the ſky: and, in the midſt of all this ſcenery, Satan with his infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal hoſt muſt be advanving to take his long leaſe of the earth, and to make princes and nobles of thoſe infernal oppoſers of religion and good government, whom all friends of <hi>order</hi> are called on to keep out of place. All this, in modern days, is neceſſary to wake the people to a recollection that the men, whom they choſe laſt are the fitteſt candidates for another election.</p>
            <p>But mark how ineffectual are all theſe cauſes to produce the wiſhed effect, till, joining the wonder-working hoſt, <hi>the clergy</hi> (and as Cowper to aid his verſe, ſo I, my proſe, with awe profound repeat the ſacred name, the clergy) heralds of the prince of peace, ambaſſadors of him, who diſclaimed for himſelf and his followers the honors of men; <hi>the clergy,</hi> preachers of the word of life, deign

This completes the ſcenery, and lethargy ſtarts into life and vigor. At this moment by the light of thoſe great moral luminaries Robiſon<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe are the writers who undertook to prove that the French revolution origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in philoſophiſm, and infidelity.

The election being ſatisfactorily cloſed, the people, like the bird, whom they repreſent, fly to their hiding places to wait for a biennial reſurrection.</p>
            <p>Let no one imagine that I would repreſent the clergy as acting out of their ſphere in all this ſcenery; for is it not ſaid unto them, <hi>"Go ye into all the world and preach politics unto every creature.

            <p>Fortunately for us, moſt of theſe deluſions have loſt their effect. Robiſon and Barruel, can deceive no more. The 17 philoſophiſtical work-ſhops of Satan<note n="†" place="bottom">See Mr. Lewis's oration delivered in New Haven, July, 1799.</note> have never been found: not one illuminatus major nor minor has been diſcovered in America, though their names have been publiſhed, and though their exiſtence here is as clearly proved as was their exiſtence in Europe. The cannibal's progreſs and bloody buoy, have deſtroyed each other: the political prayers ſent up on former occaſions have never reached the tops of the ſteeples, nor have they brought one bleſſing down: the pantomimical ſermons, which have graced political ſabbaths are laughed at: the ſuggeſtions about Jefferſon's atheiſm are deſpiſed, ſince
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:036977_0044_100B730ED6437A68"/>many who make them are found to be men, who would fell all the temples and altars in the country for 12 fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates: the monſtrous noiſe about ancient wickedneſs and infidelity is abated, ſince mankind have reflected that the ſins of the antediluvians are not particularly charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able on democrats.

            <p>In this confuſed ſtate of the leading party, it is difficult to calculate in what form deluſion is to attack you. Whether the diplomatic corps abroad are to operate, or whether ſermons on a new conſtruction are to be ſerved up, is yet a matter of doubt. I ſhall, however, venture to preſent you ſome of the probable deluſions and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain obſtructions which are to operate againſt your exerciſe of free election.</p>
            <p>Look at once on the ariſtocracies, which I have nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you, conſider their wealth, their force, their ſubtlety, the immenſe intereſts which they have at ſtake; remember that theſe furniſh the men, who, in the definition of my ſubject, were ſtiled the prime agents of deluſion, who know the heart and the avenues to the paſſions, and who can place before you, with ſtrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, every conceivable motive of hope and fear. Your treaſury, ſupplied with your own money, is to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate againſt your freedom of election. See the hoſt of your brethren, who depend on that treaſury. Tens of thouſands of men in our country live on the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but independent of them and their weight and influence is found moſtly in the governing ſcale. If the firſt officers loſe their election the ſubordinate ones may loſe their offices and emoluments: therefore every new election has exactly all their influence, and generally that of all their connections to balance againſt an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial iſſue, and by all that influence which is incalcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably great and increaſing thoſe in place have a chance of re-election ſuperior to thoſe not in place. This idea
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:036977_0046_100B7313AE3387A8"/>opens to you the inducement which the higher officers have to lead up a funding ſyſtem, an army, a navy, federal city, valuation tax. All theſe things lead to new appointments in abundance, to a ſyſtem of favor,<note n="*" place="bottom">Had the conſtitution veſted appointments in a committee to be changed every two years, ſome evils now experienced would have been avoided: perhaps an amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on this part would be full as valuable as an amendment aimed at the perſon of Albert Gallatin.</note> which engages a hoſt of expectants in addition to the ſucceſsful candidates and whenever theſe offices amount ſufficiently to create a moral certainty of re-election,<note n="†" place="bottom">Elections would be well guarded if officers of government could be excluded from voting.

The characters, principles and feelings, of thoſe who are oppoſed to preſent men and meaſures are to be torn in pieces.

<pb n="48" facs="unknown:036977_0047_100B7317079E3200"/>to hold you up as a hiſſing and a bye-word, as jacobins, anarchiſts, and fit companions for infernal ſpirits. Such has been part of the ſyſtem of tyranny, which, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our own eyes, has been acted repeatedly on the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable anniverſaries of our independence. Happy would it be were this confined to the great cities; but our government has led up a number of little ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies no bigger than pea-bruſh in our ſmall towns— where either prieſt or lawyer, or federal officers, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern whigs and their aſſociates, muſt, like their ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, be lording it over the poor convicted democrats.</p>
            <p>A great art, on theſe public occaſions, has been to paint up a certain character in every deformity of vice; then to rob the infernal wardrobe to dreſs him, then to call this a democrat, diſorganizer, jacobin and ſataniſt. Their creed is to be as monſtrous as their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; they are made to believe things incredible, to practiſe things horrid, and to meditate miſchiefs infinite. There, ſay they, ladies and gentlemen, is a republican and this is republicaniſm. Then to ſhew the power of contraſt, you have preſented a charming, amiable, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine character, dreſſed in celeſtial robes, believing, prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing and contriving all which is good and deſerving. This, ſay they, is a federaliſt, and this is federaliſm. They then proceed to muſter up all the infernal actions of all the bad men in the world, and ſet them up as the admiration of theſe infernals. They make them look complacently at blaſphemy, ſmile at murder and fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a broad laugh at atheiſm. They then aſſign to them as companions all the wretches, who have in every age diſgraced humanity: and on the other ſide all the good actions throughout the world; all men famous for piety, goodneſs and ſcience, are preſented as the objects of love and eſteem for their celeſtials. They claim all holy men of every age as federaliſts. Then, to crown the work, they ſend theſe infernal jacobins to the infernal world, and tranſlate the federaliſts to a ſtate of glory.</p>

                  </gap>t of means with the moſt abandoned of ends.</hi> There is a great hoſt of intelligent republicans in this country; not one of whom wiſhes for the abolition of religion and government; not one of whom approves any of the unjuſtifiable meaſures of France.</p>
            <p>But Deluſion knows that many men fear to be on the weak ſide; therefore theſe occaſions are ſometimes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to ſhew that there are <hi>few or no democrats</hi> in theſe northern ſtates. I ſhall ſhew the fallacy of this by two ſhort traverſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, go about the country and aſk the people, do you like Mr. Adams, Mr. Pickering, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> they don't know. Do you like the conſtitution? Yes. Do you like the funding ſyſtem, federal city, foreign intercourſe, ſtamp-act, army, navy—no, decidedly not one of them. But aſk them whether they intend to vote for federal men—they will anſwer, yes, certainly; for we are told <hi>that all the democrats are atheiſts, and would pull down all religion and government.</hi> Now ſurely a federaliſt muſt be aſhamed that men, thoroughly republicans at heart ſhould be obliged to make war on their feelings, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and liberties, under the influence of ſuch a falſe, barefaced deluſion. The man, who told them this knew it to be falſe: he never ſaw any man in his ſenſes, who wiſhed to deſtroy all religion, and ſurely he never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that great exertions would be made by men to get into place, if their object was no other than to tear down the edifice of government and to bury themſelves in its ruins. Multitudes of rational men are for deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that kind of religion, which is made a foot-ball or ſtalking horſe, and which operates only to diſhonor God and ruin man: but the world at large is well diſpoſed to have due homage paid to the ſource of being, though
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:036977_0049_100B731A19A571E8"/>it may differ about the forms, in which that can be moſt acceptably rendered.</p>
            <p>But let us try another traverſe. From the whole number of reputed federaliſts, deduct thoſe, who depend directly or indirectly on government for ſupport; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the expectants of federal office; <hi>theſe</hi> ſurely are not impartial judges; then deduct the great hoſt of men who are marked like a box of glaſs, with a <hi>keep this ſide up,</hi> who would be pleaſed with any government under a dey, bey, monarch, grand duke, grand ſeignor, or viceroy, provided they could ſhare the power of it: men, who praiſe all preachers, ſerve all great men and are lacquies to every thing but truth and honeſty; then deduct the great number of men who are wholly unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on the ſubject of government and who are fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral, merely becauſe they are hauled about by a federal windlaſs; then deduct the men in advanced life, who have ſeen many changes and have been deluded in them all, and who calculate that in any government things will be as bad as the men in power can make them.</p>
            <p>After theſe deductions you may look round for fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts, you will not ſee <hi>men as trees walking.</hi> Separate thoſe who follow for the loaves and fiſhes, with thoſe who habitually follow the multitude, from the ſincere admirers of preſent men and meaſures, and the reſult would preſent the concluſions which your minds ought to admit.</p>
            <p>But, ſay theſe deluders, 'ſuppoſe there are a few demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crats ſee who they are, a poor ragged noiſy company! but to theſe rags you owe your robes: theſe men have been taxed ſeverely to ſupport a government, which gloried in depriving them of the means. When a federal tax-gatherer appeared, they could not, as you could, reſort to federal purſes; but caſt your eyes ſouthward and you will ſee ſome men with whole clothes, correct morals and unqueſtionable intelligence, daring to oppoſe ſtrength to

Jails, fines, and gallowſes ought to be our portion. We deſerve even in the midſt of ſuffering to be jeered and laughed at by our tormentors; to be traduced in the news-papers of federal truth, and to be ranked in faſt and election-ſermons among infern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſpirits.

If you are ignorant of this you ought to read. Well, have you any power of attorney from theſe men to abuſe them? have you a patent for the excluſive uſe of all the opprobrious terms in the language? or do you claim to be key-keepers to that world, whither you have ſo often ſent the democrats? how comes it that every orator, on ſuch occaſions, is able to call before him all the great, and brave, and wiſe men of ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern days, of this and all other countries and to catechiſe and curſe them?

            <p>Not leſs deluſive than the orations are the toaſts on thoſe days.

            <p>I have introduced this little ſpecimen of toaſts to ſwell the liſt of deluſive arts which are practiſed to render palatable the meaſures of adminiſtration, and to give force to a remark, that on the ſide of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have been prayers, ſermons, orations, toaſts, offices, influence and treaſury; and againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans, alien and ſedition laws; excluſion from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; abuſe in and out of congreſs; reviling in newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers; and yet, with all this, at the end of 11 years, if the officers of government could be choſen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>When deluſion has given command to attack the democrats on the ſcore of their attachment to the cauſe of France, the ſtage, the deſk and the preſs have been alike at his ſervice. Falſehood has borrowed the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred tongues of fame, and each tongue has had full em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in detailing the enormities of the French, and in repreſenting theſe enormities as the objects of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the republicans; but they have ſhrunk from the diſtinction between the cauſe of ſtruggling freedom and the enormities inſeparable from a revolution.</p>
            <p>To render ſuch baſe deluſions contemptible, let me call to your view the tottering thrones of Europe; the exhauſted finances of royal tyrants: ſee where feudal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm and vandaliſm had overſpread kingdoms, ſunk in the calm of deſpotiſm, ſhrouded in the night of ſlaviſh deluſion: ſee freedom, like the lightning of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, burſting from the midſt of darkneſs in rapid

Let not the <hi>convulsions</hi> which attend an unparalleled ſtruggle for freedom alarm <hi>you,</hi> who witneſſed the <hi>spasms</hi> of our partial revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If with exceſs of pain and ſtrong cryings the blood returns into the veins of a man in a ſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſcitation, ſhall we wonder at the ſtrong convulſions and inexpreſſible agonies which nations experience, when freedom, that vital fluid of ſociety, after a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of 900 years, is again made to flow freely in its veins? Writers may tell you of the cruelties and exceſſes of the French revolution; Britiſh writers told the ſame of us when we contended againſt them. Summon up the faults of the beſt of men, you may fill a page; thoſe of the worſt of men might employ a pamphlet; thoſe of nations in a ſtate of peace would require volumes; and, in a ſtate of war, if their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are to be their biographers, the world would hardly contain a catalogue of their crimes.</p>

How often was Suwarrow victorious when he was flying before the French? How often was Moreau's army defeated by the humane conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of Iſmael?

Well, ſay theſe deluders, let the democrats have their way, they will appoint a preſident who will turn out all the old tried officers, and put a ſet of men in their place, who would annihilate the funding ſyſtem and bring confuſion out of order: then goes national character: for theſe men have no idea of honeſty or public faith; but theſe democrats who beſt know their own calculations, profeſs that a preſident of their choice would probably retain in place all men who had ſerved faithfully. As to their principles he might well calculate to find them in a bundle with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and in a few weeks they would draw well in republican geers. The funding ſyſtem would be anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated as faſt as means to diſcharge it could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.

Now if the contempt of theſe great men for the nine tenths of ſociety were all it might be borne; but immenſe ſums muſt be levied by them in order to ſupport their ſplendor and their ſchemes of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I have avoided to ſpeak to you of unaccounted for millions; but HAVE PRESENTED SYSTEMS BY WHICH THE WEALTH OF THE WORLD IS TO BE WASTED, AND THE BLOOD OF MILLIONS IS TO FLOW; yet it may be well for you to know that the ſupport of your government now amounts to 42,000 dollars a day:<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix.</note> that this expence has been, and is increaſing; and that, in the laſt ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it was found impoſſible to provide ways and means to raiſe the 15 millions of dollars for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of the preſent year.

Large loans are convenient ſops for a greedy ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fund—when public reſources fail, and public good requires ſome object to be compaſſed too aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to juſtify a tax or a ſubſcription, a lottery is often propoſed, and in the ſcheme immenſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages are offered to the purchaſer: <hi>no less than one chance in</hi> 25,000 <hi>to draw the higheſt prize.</hi> An old ſoldier would be ſhot at for one cent, if his chance of being killed was no greater than one in 25,000; but worſe than bad chances, the ſinews of induſtry muſt be cut in the purchaſer: relying on dame fortune he muſt quit dame induſtry; for they keep their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers at different hotels. <hi>Scarcely two and a half blanks to a prize!</hi> and why ſhould not fortune deluge a man for this once, when before ſhe had never dropped on him a particle of her dew? But the fortunate adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer muſt reſign 15 per cent. in order to entitle him to a draw-back of 15 per cent. in his chance for

            <p>All this bears in front the marks of deluſion, and it is far better to be thus deluded than to have money raiſed upon us by indirect means. When my tax-maſter fears to preſent me his bill, leſt I ſhould aſk the whys and wherefores, he contrives in ſome artful way to pick my pockets.

He ſees that ſtreams of wealth are flowing into the treaſury thro' the medium of ſugar hogſheads and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſts. I feel that my reſources are expending: he cheers me up with, <hi>"fear not, the hairs of your head are all numbered;"</hi> to which I might well reply, <hi>"yes, and all the pence in my pocket."</hi> But lotteries draw money from the credulous; indirect taxes from the voluptuary: imperious neceſſity demands a ſtamp, and valuation tax: all will not ward off the dreaded criſis. Tho' in an individual the lending of money at 8 per cent. is a crime, denominated by ſtatute corrupt and uſurious, and meriting a forfeiture of the whole ſum loaned; yet the exigencies of government drive them to procure the commiſſion of this crime.

It is not the atheiſt Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon; not the <hi>infamous</hi> diſcoverer of a ſtandard of weights and meaſures by the vibrations of a pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum; not the <hi>base</hi> author of the letter to Mazzei. Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraliſts need not apprehend that ſuch a man is to be held up; but your candidate is,</p>
            <p>JEFFERSON, preſident of the philoſophical ſociety, who, in all his communications to them, has ſpoken reverently of the wiſdom and goodneſs of God;<note n="†" place="bottom">See Appendix.</note> the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:036977_0066_100B73429A731E40"/>man who in his writings has ſpoken reverently of the chriſtian religion, and has for years ſupported at his own expence a preacher of the goſpel; a man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable morality both in theory and practice; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable in private life; holding the ſecond office in your government by the free ſuffrages of the people; the <hi>ingenious</hi> diſcoverer of a perfect ſtandard of weights and meaſures, and the man who in public, as well as private, has dared to ſpeak truths galling to federal ears; has dared to ſay that we had men, who preferred the calm of deſpotiſm to the tempeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſea of liberty; that we had an ariſtocratic, monarchic, Britannic faction in this country. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accurately the power of deluſion, he ventured to predict, that after the war there would be a relapſe of ſpirit in the people; that abuſes would creep in and continue, till a criſis, when, by the energy of the people, our rights would revive; or, <hi>till they</hi> ſhould expire in a convulſion: and herein he predicted this very day. Our ſpirit has declined; groſs abuſes have crept in; we have a powerful ariſtocratic, monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chic, Britannic faction; but by a due exertion of your conſtitutional right of election, your rights may yet revive; and the man who predicted this, lives to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the teſtimony of your reſpect and confidence, the withholding of which may lead you to the ſad cataſtrophe of ſeeing your dearly earned rights lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally expire in a convulſion.</p>
            <p>However you may be agitated on the ſubject of religion, reſt aſſured, that you are not to depend on any adminiſtration of government for the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Zion. You will not, like the people of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, expect that examples of piety, iſſues of grace, and ſtreams of ſalvation, are to flow from his moſt ſacred majeſty, and the titled ſlaves which compoſe a luxurious court. The chariot wheels of ſalvation, are far different from the chariot wheels which are to be rolling round the ſtreets of the federal city, with loads of domeſtic and imported infidelity.</p>

Finally, republicans, be ſtrong: tho' they, who are oppoſed to you may ſay, "we are called legion; for we are many," fear not their numbers. Though they may offer you all the kingdoms in the world in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your ſubmiſſion: tho' they may ſay, "follow us, and ye ſhall be as gods," <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eed them not: their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to delude you. Singular as it may ſeem, though you have been called infidels; yet you have to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat ſyſtems deſtructive to religion: though you have been called jacobins; yet you have to contend for that equal rational freedom which no jacobin ever ſought: tho' you have been called infernals; yet you have the ſame enemies to fight which the ancient church had: you have principalities and powers, and the rulers of the darkneſs of this world, and ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual wickedneſs in high places, with the prince of the power of the air at the head of them. Though a government which you equally obtained and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupport, has been directed both in language and laws againſt your feelings, liberties and rights; yet you have waited <hi>peaceably,</hi> tho' <hi>impatiently,</hi> for the day of your conſtitutional deliverance. Soon will your priſon doors be ſet open; the day to redeem yourſelves from great and little tyrants is at hand. If you have firmneſs to meet the criſis, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to act your parts in it, you may ſhout, for your redemption is at hand.</p>
            <p>But if in any of you preſent, deluſion has wrought its perfect work, if you have bowed the knee to the political Baal: if you are ſlaviſhly devoted to the <hi>self stiled</hi> friends of order and good government, then bid an eternal adieu to the freedom which you never merited; prepare your necks for the yoke; hail Iſachar as your venerated anceſtor; ſay to delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>"thou art my father,"</hi> and to the funding ſyſtem, federal city, foreign intercourſe, army, navy, <hi>"ye are our brethren and sisters."</hi>

               <p>In Connecticut theſe officers are choſen by the ſtate at large, not by diſtricts. In both claſſes nominations are firſt made, and the men nominated are generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the freemen: So true is this, that if the name of George Penroſe, or Henry H. Childs, were ſet in the liſt, they would ſtand a good chance of being within the firſt 18 for Congreſs or the firſt 20 for Council, though theſe men do not live in the ſtate. But for the ſake of giving permanency to theſe offices, the names of thoſe who have been in office are generally at the head of the liſt, and have a far greater chance of gaining the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination than thoſe near the foot of it. When the votes for counſellors are counted, if the ſenior counſellor of the laſt year ſhould be found to have the <hi>leaſt</hi> number within the firſt 20, yet he will be returned to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as <hi>firſt</hi> in nomination: whereas he ought to be the <hi>laſt.</hi> Place him <hi>laſt</hi> and it would be next to a miracle if he ſhould be appointed. Place him <hi>firſt</hi> and he will ſurely be re-elected. If the houſe of repreſentatives at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to alter this they are always negatived by the council. The council thus permanently fixed, are aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated with the corporation of Yale college, which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally compoſed of intelligent miniſters of the goſpel. This combination of Church and State, furniſhes a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of influence which has been hitherto uſed in favor of the men in place. The right of the people to chooſe electors has been taken from them. Their right to have the man returned as firſt in nomination, whom they placed firſt, has been taken from them: Multitudes of freemen have ceaſed to attend freemen's meetings, from a perſuaſion that with their beſt exertions, they will be unable to effect any thing; and it really is not important for them to re-aſſert their rights of election, till they
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:036977_0075_100B735AEC08A4E0"/>have reſolved to break the enchantments and baniſh the deluſions which encompaſs them.</p>
               <p>The deluſion above explained, has been brought into partnerſhip with that of depriving the people of chooſing electors: both are now made ſubservient to federal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes —each ſtrengthens the other and the people are held at arms length from an intelligent exerciſe of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage.</p>

                  <p>"The errors ſeem not ſufficiently eradicated, that the operations of the mind, as well as the acts of the body, are ſubject to the coercion of the laws. But our rulers can have authority over ſuch natural rights only as we have ſubmited to them. The rights of conſcience we never ſubmitted, we could not ſubmit. We are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for them to our God. The legitimate powers of government extend to ſuch acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbour to ſay there are twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg. If it be ſaid his teſtimony in a court of Juſtice cannot be relied on, reject
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:036977_0076_100B735D536C1F48"/>it then, and be the ſtigma on him. Conſtraint may make him worſe, by making him a hypocrite, but it will never make him a truer man. it may fix him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately in his errors, but will not cure them. Reaſon and free enquiry are the only effectual agents againſt error. Give a looſe to them, they will ſupport the true religion by bringing every falſe one to their tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, to the teſt of their inveſtigation, They are the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural enemies of error, and of error only. Had not the Roman government permitted free enquiry, <hi>chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> could never have been introduced. Had not free enquiry been indulged, at the era of the reformation, the corruptions of <hi>chriſtianity</hi> could not have been purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away. If it be reſtrained now, the preſent corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be protected and new ones encouraged. Was the government to preſcribe to us our medicine and diet, our bodies would be in ſuch keeping as our ſouls are now. Thus in France the emetic was once forbidden as a medicine, and the potatoe as an article of food. Government is juſt as infallible too when it fixes ſyſtems in phyſics. Galileo, was ſent to the inquiſition for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that the earth was a ſphere: the government had declared it to be as flat as a trencher, and Galileo was obliged to abjure his error. This however at length prevailed, the earth became a globe, and Deſcartes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it was whirled round its axis by a vortex. The government in which he lived was wiſe enough to ſee that this was no queſtion of civil juriſdiction, or we ſhould all have been involved by authority in vortices. In fact the vortices have been exploded, and the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonian principle of gravitation is now more firmly eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed on the baſis of reaſon, than it would be were the government to ſtep in and make it an article of neceſſary faith. Reaſon and experiment have been indulged, and error has fled before them. It is error alone which needs the ſupport of government. Truth can ſtand by itſelf. Subject opinion to coercion: whom will you
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:036977_0077_100B735FA6D0EB90"/>make your inquiſitors? Fallible men; men governed by bad paſſions, by private as well as public reaſons. And why ſubject it to coercion? To produce uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But is uniformity of opinion deſirable? No more than of face and ſtature. Introduce the bed of Procruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes then, and as there is danger that the large men may beat the ſmall, make us all of a ſize, by lopping the former and ſtretching the latter. Difference of opinion is advantageous in religion. The ſeveral ſects perform the office of a Cenſor morum over each other. Is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity attainable? Millions of innocent men, women and children, ſince the introduction of chriſtianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, impriſoned: yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity.— What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites. To ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port roguery and error all over the earth. Let us reflect that it is inhabited by a thouſand millions of people. That theſe profeſs probably a thouſand different ſyſtems of religion. That ours is but one of that thouſand, That if there be but one right, and ours that one, we ſhould wiſh to ſee the 999 wandering ſects gathered into the fold of truth. But againſt ſuch a majority we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not effect this by force. <hi>Reaſon and perſuaſion are the only</hi> practicable inſtruments. To make way for theſe, free enquiry muſt be indulged; and how can we wiſh others to indulge it when we refuſe it ourſelves. But every ſtate, ſays an inquiſitor, has eſtabliſhed ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. No two, ſay I, have eſtabliſhed the ſame. Is this a proof of the infallibility of eſtabliſhments? Our ſiſter ſtates of Pennſylvania and New-York, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, have long ſubſiſted without any eſtabliſhment at all. The <hi>experiment was new and doubtful when they made it. It has anſwered beyond conception.</hi> They <hi>flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh infinitely.</hi> Religion is well ſupported; of various kinds indeed, but all good enough; all ſufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve peace and order: or if a ſect ariſes whoſe tenets
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:036977_0078_100B7362DBDCEB58"/>would ſubvert morals, good ſenſe has fair play, and reaſons and laughs it out of doors, without ſuffering the ſtate to be troubled with it. They do not hang more malefactors than we do. They are not more diſturbed with religious diſſentions. On the contrary, their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is unparalleled, and can be aſcribed to nothing but their unbounded tolerance, becauſe there is no other circumſtance in which they differ from every nation on earth. They have made the happy diſcovery that the way to ſilence religious diſputes, is to take no notice of them. Let us too give this experiment fair play, and get rid, while we may, of thoſe tyrannical laws. It is true we are as yet ſecured againſt them by the ſpirit of the times, I doubt whether the people of this country would ſuffer an execution for hereſy, or a three years impriſonment for not comprehending the myſteries of the trinity. But is the ſpirit of the people an infallible, a permanent reliance? Is it government? Is this the kind of protection we receive in return for the rights we give up? Beſides, the ſpirit of the times may alter, will alter. Our rulers will become corrupt, our people careleſs. A ſingle zealot may commence perſecuter, and better men be his victims. It can never be too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated, that the time for fixing every eſſential right on a legal baſis is while our rulers are honeſt and ourſelves united. From the concluſion of this war we ſhall be going down hill. It will not then be neceſſary to reſort every moment to the people for ſupport. They will be forgotten therefore, and their rights diſregarded. They will forget themſelves, but in the ſole faculty of making money, and will never think of uniting to effect a due reſpect for their rights. The ſhackles therefore, which ſhall not be knocked off at the concluſion of this war, will remain on us long, will be made heavier and heavier till our rights ſhall revive, or expire in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion."</p>
