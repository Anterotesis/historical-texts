            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN Anſwer to your Requeſt, I have ſpent ſome thoughts upon the Subject of our laſt Converſation, <hi>viz</hi>: Inocculation, which has cauſed ſo many idle words, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Diſcourſes; to ſay no more of 'em. And firſt, as to the practice in it ſelf conſider'd. I muſt confeſs, I am not Maſter of Philoſophy enough to enable me to determine for or againſt the uſe of it, upon natural reaſons: But as fools uſe to do, muſt wait till experience does more fully inſtruct me. But then Secondly, as to the Manner of introducing, and carrying on the practice here in this Country; if I have the truth of the fact, (which I confeſs 'tis difficult to come at in this day, to our ſhame it will be ſpoken) I can but condemn it upon the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing reaſons; which I offer by way of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſubmit them to you and the Worlds Conſideration and Cenſure. The fact I take to be this: A certain <hi>Clergy-man</hi> (by the way of <hi>Europe</hi>) received Advice of the Practice among the <hi>Maſſel-men,</hi> &amp; faithful people of the prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi>; alſo more immediately and <hi>viva voce</hi> from ſome of the ſcattered Members of the good people in <hi>Guinea,</hi> who communicated to the Phyſitians in your Town; one of whom (without conſent of his Brethren) introduces
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002229_0003_0FDB19120357D1D8"/>the Practice here in the midſt of a populous Town, ſoon after, (if not before) the Guards which were placed by Authority at the doors of Infected Houſes, (to prevent the carrying out any Infection) were taken off; when there was at leaſt a poſſibility that the ſpreading of the Diſtemper might be prevented. Now againſt this, I offer to your Conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether this Practice was not an offence against the Civil Government, and contrary to the Peace &amp; Quiet of His Majesties Liege People?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How daringly bold this Practice? for one ſingle Apothecary, without conſent of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, without asking the Civil Power, without conſent of the Neighbours; yea, againſt their Fears, their Cries and Clamours, to infect his Family, with a Diſeaſe very Mortal and very Contagious! The late riotous wicked diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, ſhews the dangerous conſequence of ſuch raſh practices. I mention not this in the leaſt to excuſe that horrid fact; No, I deteſt it as much as any man, and pray God deliver us from ſuch a Spirit. But I think that <hi>Inocculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> as it was firſtly practiſed, carried in it as much threatning and danger; yet being done with a good and charitable intention, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſign of miſchief to any man, did not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Actor ſo criminal. To ſpread a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Contagion, What is it but to caſt abroad Arrows and Death? If a man ſhould wilfully throw a Bomb into a Town, burn a Houſe, or kill a man, ought he not to die? ſo if a man
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002229_0004_0FDB191445EF93B8"/>ſhould wilfully bring Infection from a perſon ſick of a deadly and contagious Diſeaſe, into a place of Health; is not the miſchief as great? Suppoſe that <hi>Inocculation</hi> is to all thoſe that uſe it very ſafe and beneficial, that it anſwers all the deſired ends upon them; yet how can they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it, to hazard the deſtruction of their Neighbours, who are not of their opinion, and dare not practice it! Suppoſe then again (as we reaſonably may) that of thoſe many who are lately ſlain by the <hi>Small-pox,</hi> ſome few have taken it by their <hi>Inocculated</hi> Neighbours, who might otherwiſe have eſcaped it. How ſhall we excuſe our <hi>Mahometan</hi> Miſſionaries, from being truly, tho' not deſignedly the cauſe of their death? If any perſons are ſatisfied, that this Practice is a good method to ſave them from the dangers of a mortal Diſeaſe which threatens them; I do not ſay they ought not to uſe it, but they ought to uſe it in ſuch a manner, as may be with Surety to their Neighbours as well as themſelves. If men therefore will have ſuch practices, muſt they not make them lawful, and withdraw from the Community into ſuch places where there can be no danger to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, or elſe obtain a common conſent</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether as the Practice has been carried on, there has not been offered horrid Impiety against Almighty God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not ſee how we can be excuſed from great Impiety herein, (altho' the Doctors bold practice was conſecrated by the Authority of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002229_0005_0FDB1915C321ECF8"/>five or ſix Reverend Subſcribers to a certain Writing, deviſed for that purpoſe at the time) when Miniſters and People, with loud &amp; ſtrong Cries made Supplications to Almighty God, to avert the Judgment of the <hi>Small-pox</hi> (profeſſing their faith in his Power and Goodneſs) that though in the ordinary view of men it muſt ſpread, yet that it would pleaſe him (if it might be agreeable to the ends of his Holineſs) to Exert his Almighty Power, and be better to us than our fears, in preventing the further ſpreading of the Diſtemper, as in his Mercies he had heretofore done. And at the ſame time, ſome have been carrying about inſtruments of <hi>Inocculation</hi> and bottles of the poiſonous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to Infect all thoſe who were willing to ſubmit to it, whereby we might as naturally expect the Infection to ſpread, as a man to break his bones, by caſting himſelf head-long from the higheſt Pinacle. Can any man infect a Family in a Town in the Morning, and pray to God in the Evening, that the Diſtemper may not ſpread? No, it is a Temptation from the Devil: for it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> No more can any man that have promoted it make this prayer without ſin. Now then ſuppoſe that to avoid Sin, they have omitted this prayer; is it a right thing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it? Is not the <hi>Small-pox</hi> a ſore Judgment of God? and ſhould we not then pray, <hi>Deliver us from Evil</hi>? Yes, but then it may be ſaid, that tho' the <hi>Small-pox</hi> as God ſends it in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002229_0006_0FDB191A45C850F0"/>courſe of his Providence be a ſore Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet by this invention of <hi>Inocculation,</hi> it becomes much lighter; and tho' we don't pray that it may not ſpread, yet by praying for a bleſſing on this practice, we pray againſt the Judgment. This is indeed the beſt face that can be put upon it, in my opinion; and in this dreſs if we view it well, it has an horrible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; and I wiſh it don't in the end prove a Fighting as well as praying againſt the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. Are we not all one Church of Chriſt, and People of God? and ſhall we divide in our Supplications to God, and think to be heard of him? One part praying &amp; confeſſing, <hi>Lord we have Sinned, and are afraid of thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are out against us; ſay unto thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying Angel, it is enough, stay now thine hand; and Lord, if it be thy holy Will, let not this ſore Diſeaſe ſpread further among us</hi>! And another part praying, <hi>Lord, we have Sinned, &amp; thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are upon us in ſore Sickneſs; but we have (by thy Providence) found out a way to lighten it, give us thy bleſſing upon it, &amp; then it ſpread, the faster the better; no danger of death this way, and but little ſickneſs; and let us have the benefit of this Invention, tho' others of thy people that are ſo blind they will not ſee the benefit of it, are ever ſo much endangered by it.</hi> Theſe laſt words ſound a little harſh, but is it not the true language of the practice? Thus we are brought into a ſtate of War, Sin and Contention in our very prayers, by carrying on this practice in ſuch a lawleſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002229_0007_0FDB191BAE7EC178"/>manner; and did the Gentlemen that promoted it ever think of any regulation? I am ſure they never effected it, which ought to have been the very firſt ſtep in a matter of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to a people. Now as theſe things have an evil aſpect in themſelves, is it not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that they have ſo in their effects &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences? Inſtead of being humbled under the holy hand of God in this Judgment upon us, and treating one another with meekneſs &amp; charity, are we not filled with contentions, and every wicked work? I pray God grant us Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, leſt deſpiſing the Chaſtenings of the Almighty, we provoke him to bring yet ſorer Plagues upon us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee that at preſent I am neither Inocculator nor Anti-inocculator, conſidering it only in a Phyſical ſence: But I muſt condemn upon the foregoing reaſons, ſuch a raſh managing a matter of ſo great concern, without advice or Caution which in my opinion is a great Contempt to God and Man. That which moved me to Anſwer you juſt at this time is, the fear that I and my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are in, for our ſelves and Families. We are adviſed that the Practice of <hi>Inocculation</hi> is carrying on in our Country Towns, which (if it proceed) will undoubtedly infect and endanger the Lives of vaſt numbers more than otherwiſe would be: I mean of ſuch as are not to be <hi>Inocculation.</hi> The <hi>Small-pox</hi> thro' Gods Goodneſs has not been wont to ſpread generally in our Country Towns; but a Family here and there has been viſited. But now, if this Practice obtain among us, ſuppoſe but
<pb n="8"
                   facs="unknown:002229_0008_0FDB191D27A43D38"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>a few, ſay a Twentieth part of a Town take up with it, living in the ſeveral Quarters of the Town: It will undoubtedly infect the whole. I know ſome will ſay, they may all be <hi>Inocculated,</hi> its an Excllent way; They will be ſafe in the uſe of it, and ever after out of Danger. But generally People are not perſwaded of either the expediency or Lawfulneſs of the Practice; and if ſome are, ſhall they in this manner force it upon others? Is it ſo pleaſant and beneficial, that 'tis better to undergo it than not, where we may by the bleſſing of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a proper care be in little danger? For my part, when I ſee this Sword of the Almighty in the Angels hand, I tremble, &amp; am afraid of his Judgments? But let him wield his own weapons; &amp; if he ſlay me, <hi>yet will I truſt in him.</hi> But when I hear of <hi>Quacks</hi> boldly medling with theſe edged tools, in ſuch a raſh and lawleſs man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; (tho' the hand of God is to be ſeen in this alſo,) yet it raiſes other reſentments in me. And it is ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing to me, that the worthy Members of our General Aſſembly, my Country Neighbours (who ſtart from their buſineſt, looking pale with fear by the danger of this Diſtemper) ſhould not ſpend one thought upon this practice, which will render their danger a thouſand to one greater. And now after all, to their Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we muſt leave it, hoping in their care and wiſdom this matter may be brought under ſome regulation; That if they allow it, there may be proper Peſt Houſes in ſolitary places, to receive thoſe that have a mind thus voluntarily to infect themſelves, with ſevere pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties on thoſe that ſhall dare to do otherwiſe, to the endangering the lives of their honeſt Neighbours; or elſe to baniſh the Practice to the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whence it came; and if ever they allow it in ſuch an unguarded manner as we have done, I dare to be bound to be Inocculated.</p>
