            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>MEEKNESS and Patience, and a mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion and Forbearance towards one another, are Duties incumbent on all the Diſciples of Chriſt. The Example of their great Lord, as well as his Doctrine, was peculiarly calculated to inforce and recommend them, as being of eminent Note in the Chriſtian Scheme. And if we take a View of the State of Things in the World, and conſider the incredible Miſchiefs that have ariſen to Mankind from their Pride and Peeviſhneſs, and their inſulting and domineering over one another; we ſhall ſoon be convinc'd, that theſe Duties are not only of the laſt Importance to the preſent Eaſe and Quiet of Men in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Relations and Affairs of this Life, but Reaſon will tell us, they cannot be leſs neceſſary to prepare them for the Society and Happineſs of the future World; where there ſhall be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to hurt and deſtroy, or to grieve and vex the bleſſed Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants forever.</p>
            <p>But though theſe Duties are incumbent on all Chriſtians, and ſhould make a diſtinguiſhing Part of their Character from the Reſt of Mankind; yet the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Chriſt ſhould look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves as in particular call'd to excel in them. Their Relation to Chriſt beyond that of Chriſtians in common, and the Nature and Buſineſs of their Office, <hi>viz.</hi> to teach the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Chriſt to others ſhould be conſidered by them, as a perpetual Admonition to 'em to approach the neareſt poſſible to the Likeneſs of Chriſt, and be a Pattern themſelves to the Reſt of their Fellow-Chriſtians. The great Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:005332_0004_1017003F15CFEC60"/>whoſe Example next to that of our Bleſſed Saviour, is the moſt eminent of any one recorded in the New-Teſtament, took particular Care of his Duty in theſe Reſpects: And we are very frequently notified of it, to the End, without Doubt, that others in the ſacred Office might be excited from thence <hi>to go and do likewiſe;</hi> and become Followers of this <hi>prime Miniſter</hi> of the Chriſtian Church, as he followed Chriſt the <hi>Author and Finiſher of our Faith.</hi> Hence in the Text, after a large Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, through the whole foregoing Part of the Chapter, of his Meekneſs and Forbearance and Condeſcenſion towards all Sorts of Perſons under the various Prejudices of their Education, and the different Turns of Mind with which they atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on his Miniſtry, the Apoſtle aſſigns the Reaſon of ſuch his Conduct: Saying, <hi>And this I do for the Goſpel's Sake, that I might be Partaker thereof with you;</hi> giving us to underſtand, he did not condeſcend to the Weakneſſes and Prejudices of People, to aggrandiſe himſelf in their Eſteem, or that by little mean popular Arts he might exalt himſelf above his Brethren, employ'd in the ſame evangelical Miniſtry: Much leſs did he do it, that by working on their Paſſions, he might obtain ſuch a Maſtery over their Underſtandings, as to be able to manage them to his own particular Humour, and ſerve his worldly Ends by them: This was too much the Manner of falſe Teachers; but he did it <hi>for the Goſpel's Sake,</hi> i. e. as he expreſſes it in ſome of the foregoing Verſes, that he might gain and ſave them, <hi>viz.</hi> gain them to Chriſt and not to himſelf, and ſave them from the Dominion of their Luſts, and not from the due Exerciſe of their Reaſon: And that what he aim'd at with Reſpect to himſelf, was to be a Sharer of the ſame Benefits, and a Partaker of the Goſpel with them.</p>
            <p>There are two Things here imply'd which I ſhall make the Heads of the enſuing Diſcourſe
<list>
                  <item>I. That the Miniſters of Chriſt ought to aim at being Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Goſpel, in common with all the Faithful. And,</item>
                  <item>II. That in Order hereto, they ought to ſet up the Goſpel in their View, as that for the promoting of which their Office was deſign'd; and in the Reputation, Defence, Succeſs, and Propagation of which, all their miniſterial Endeavours ſhould center.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:005332_0005_1017004247DB6DC8"/>
I. That the Miniſters of Chriſt ought to aim at being Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Goſpel in common with all the Faithful. <hi>That I might be Partaker thereof with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Miniſters have the ſame Concern and Intereſt in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion with the reſt of Mankind. They have Souls to ſave or loſe as well as their People; their Lives are equally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious and uncertain; <hi>their Strength is not the Strength of Stones, nor their Fleſh of Braſs;</hi> they have the precious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Goſpel but in <hi>Earthen Veſſels,</hi> that are ſoon and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily daſh'd to Pieces—And they are no more exempted from appearing in the laſt Judgment: <hi>They muſt give Account of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God</hi> as well as the reſt of Mankind, <hi>and receive the Things done in the Body whether they have been good or evil.</hi> They ought not then to be ſo intent upon the ſaving of others as to neglect their own Salvation. It ſhould ſeem indeed as if this was in no wiſe likely ever to happen. But they that know the Multiplicity of Cares and perpetual Hurry of Buſineſs in which the Miniſtry for the moſt Part involves a Man, will not think ſuch a Caution needleſs. There are, 'tis true, ſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of a religious Nature attending on an Employment in the Work of the Miniſtry: but then the Temptations likewiſe peculiar to that Office, or more eſpecially beſetting thoſe who are employ'd in it, are in a great Meaſure a Ballance to them. And if any ſhould grow remiſs upon this Account, under Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that they are continually taken up in religious and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Affairs, it would certainly be a great and moſt dangerous Miſtake.</p>
            <p>It is conſtantly found, that Miniſters are Men of like Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with others; and though good People are apt to conceive a more rais'd Opinion of their Sanctity than of their own, or of other Men's, yet it will not from hence follow, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould think thus of themſelves: Nor can there be any Foundation for it meerly from their being employ'd in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Function. This indeed ſhould be a Motive to them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in all Chriſtian Goodneſs and Virtue; that they may be Examples to <hi>Believers in Word, in Converſation, in Spirit, in Faith, in Charity, in Purity:</hi> But then in Order hereto, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Religion muſt be no ſmall Part of their Care; and while they are employ'd in keeping the Vineyard for others, they muſt not neglect their own. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in many Places
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005332_0006_10170043CB9CABE8"/>informs us of his own daily Exerciſe herein; <hi>he kept under his Body, and brought it into Subjection, leſt that by any Means, when he had preached to others, he himſelf ſhould be a Caſt-away.</hi> He took Care to have his Converſation in the World in <hi>Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not according to fleſhly Wiſdom, but the Grace of God.</hi> He was <hi>willing in all Things to live honeſtly,</hi> and uſed his utmoſt Endeavours <hi>to keep a Conſcience void of Offence, both towards God and towards Man.</hi> And in the Text, to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other Place at preſent, <hi>This I do for the Goſpel's Sake,</hi> THAT I MIGHT BE PARTAKER THEREOF WITH YOU. This ſhews what he had in View with Reſpect to himſelf, <hi>namely</hi> to be a Sharer with all the Faithful in the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the Goſpel, to experience its Divine Energy in changing and transforming him into the Image of Chriſt in this preſent World; and then in the World to come, to be a Partaker of eternal Life, which is the great and final Reward the Goſpel propoſes. Here then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Miniſters ſhould aim at being Partakers of the <hi>ſaving Efficacy</hi> of Goſpel-Truths. They ſhould not content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with meerly teaching the Truths of the Goſpel to others, (though this they ſhould do very diligently, it being a main Branch of their Office,) but in Order to their own Salvation they ſhould likewiſe ſee to it, that they experience in themſelves the effectual Operation of thoſe Truths purifying and governing their Hearts and Lives.</p>
            <p>It is not teaching the Truths of the Goſpel, but obeying and living them, that will denominate us good Men. Whenever therefore we are preaching upon any important Subject to our People, we ſhould, as often as may be, bring the Matter home, to ourſelves by ſuch ſerious, ſolemn Reflections as theſe, <q>How am I affected, and what is my own Concern herein? What is the State of my own Soul in Reference to theſe Things! And what have I to do more than I have yet done in Order to a due Improvement of theſe Truths, that I may not be condemn'd in the laſt Day <hi>out of my own Mouth?</hi>
               </q> Oh my Brethren! It will be a dreadful Thing to have the Judge ſay to any of us, <hi>Thou wicked Servant, out of thine own Mouth will I condemn thee.</hi> And yet this will certainly be the Caſe, be we ever ſo diligent in <hi>teaching</hi> the Goſpel to others, if we are not careful to <hi>live</hi> it our ſelves. We muſt be renew'd in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005332_0007_101700456B1EE8F0"/>the Spirit of our Minds, the Knowledge of the Truth muſt make us free; we muſt be ſanctified by our Faith in Chriſt, and be inſpired and animated to a Victory over the World, or it is impoſſible we ſhould be ſav'd. The Want of theſe Things can no more diſpenſed with in Miniſters than others: Yea, but higher Attainments are requir'd, <hi>for to him that knoweth to do Good and doth it not, to him it is Sin. And that Servant which knew his Lord's Will, and prepar'd not himſelf, nor did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it, ſhall be beaten with many Stripes.</hi> This then we ſhould continually aim at, to find in ourſelves the powerful Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of thoſe Truths which we preach to our People; that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Spirit of Chriſt, and being full of Goodneſs and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, we may appear to be his, and to have a real, ſaving Intereſt in him.</p>
            <p>And to encourage, excite and animate us hereto, we ſhould alſo,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Aim at being Partakers of the Goſpel, as that Phraſe may ſignify our being Partakers of the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> which the Goſpel reveals.</p>
            <p>It can be no more unlawful in Miniſters than in private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <hi>to have a Reſpect to the Recompence of Reward;</hi> and to animate themſelves to their Duty from the Conſideration of the Glory and Happineſs of the future World. As this is the greateſt that can be, <hi>what Eye had not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor had entered into the Heart of Man,</hi> before the Goſpel diſcovered it; ſo, no Doubt, this Diſcovery was made, that we might, from thence forward, ſet this Glory and Happineſs up in our View, and earneſtly aſpire at being Partakers of it. If this had been unlawful, an infinitely wiſe and merciful God would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have made the Diſcovery; becauſe it would have been caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a Stumbling-Block in the Way of his reaſonable and intelligent Creatures, as muſt (unleſs they had acted in plain Contradiction to the Nature which he himſelf had given them) inevitably prove their Ruin.</p>
            <p>It is certainly then not only lawful, but a Duty both in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and People, to aim at being Partakers of the Goſpel in this latter Senſe, when they likewiſe aim at being Partakers of it in the former, i. e. to aim at Glory and Happineſs in the Way of Holineſs and Virtue. And it is only unlawful and abſurd, when Men don't ſeek, and aim, and labour after it in the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005332_0008_10170049A797E128"/>Way the Goſpel preſcribes, but in Ways of their own Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not by a lively, effectual Faith in the Son of God, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Hearts, and reforming their Lives; not by Obedience to the Goſpel, and the Practice of that Goodneſs and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which it requires; but either by ſome or other Scheme of meer ſpeculative Notions, or by the Practice of ſuch Things as are no where requir'd at their Hands; when Jeſus Chriſt is not made the chief Corner Stone of the Building, and the Foundation of their Hope is not laid in the Merit of his Blood and Righteouſneſs; but they either imagine their own Doings ſufficient to recommend them to God, without the Benefit of the Goſpel-Covenant, and the Interceſſion of the Saviour; or elſe, that be their Doings what they will, they are neither the nearer, nor yet the farther off from a juſt and rational Hope of eternal Life.</p>
            <p>Both theſe are dangerous Errors, and Miniſters and People ſhould equally guard againſt them: Either that we have no Need of the Blood of Chriſt to cleanſe us from our Sins, and of his Interceſſion to recommend our Perſons and Performances to the Divine Acceptance; or elſe, that be our Perſons and Performances what they will, whether we be Wicked or God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether we live like Chriſtians or live like Heathen, the Blood of Chriſt may be equally ours and we hope to be ſav'd by it, ONLY IF WE TAKE CARE CONFIDENTLY TO EXPECT IT, AND BE SURE NOT TO BE IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FLUENC'D BY IT TO LIVE ANY BETTER THAN WE SHOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE. We ſhould beware, my Brethren, how by any Means we go into ſuch Sentiments: Or, ſo far as it ſhall be in our Power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, ſuffer any of our People to do ſo. The former Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is entirely ſubverſive of Chriſtianity; and the latter, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of moral Virtue and Honeſty. Infidels err the former Way, and Enthuſiaſts generally the latter. Let us look for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life, but look for it <hi>as a Gift of God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord;</hi> and as a Gift which he will only beſtow upon them that <hi>have their Fruit unto Holineſs;</hi> and let the Belief and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation hereof have a powerful, abiding Influence upon us. The more it influences us to Holineſs and Virtue, ſo much the better; even if under the Influence of this Divine Hope we ſhould purify ourſeves, as he that calls us to Glory and Virtue, is pure; if, <hi>foraſmuch as we know that our Labour is not in
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005332_0009_1017004DDA8959A8"/>vain in the Lord,</hi> we ſhould from thence ſeek always to abound in the Exerciſes of our Chriſtian Duty, and if, under the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and Terrors of an evil World, we ſhould be ſtedfaſt and immoveable, and undaunted, and unfainting <hi>while we look not at the Things that are ſeen and are temporal, but at the Things which are not ſeen and are eternal.</hi> In a Word, This is ſuch a Spring and Principle both of active and paſſive Obedience to the Will of God, as no good Man, and much leſs Chriſtian Miniſter can ſpare; and we ſhould never therefore ſuffer it to be wreſted out of our Hands. What ſhall we do, when the Times are ſuch (as they have more than once been, and may be again, if God ſhould ſee Cauſe righteouſly to permit it) that if in this Life only we had Hope, we ſhould of all Men be moſt miſerable; I ſay, what ſhall we do, if we have not then a <hi>Hope entering into that within the Vail, which as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor of the Soul both free and ſtedfaſt,</hi> may keep it ſafe amidſt the Storm; and be a Means of that bleſſed Tranquillity, as to put us out of Danger of making <hi>Shipwreck of Faith or of a good Conſcience?</hi> For my own Part, I ſhall endeavour to be always firmly poſſeſs'd of this Principle: Aiming at Glory and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, <hi>and forgetting the Things that are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe that are before, I will preſs forward towards the Mark for the Prize of the high Calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> Nor will I ever be aſham'd to profeſs my ſelf as acting in <hi>Hope of Eternal Life which God that cannot lie, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed to the other general Head propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. To ſhew that in Order hereto, the Miniſters of Chriſt ought to ſet up the Goſpel in their View, as that for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of which their Office was deſign'd; and in the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Defence, Succeſs, and Propagation of which, all their miniſterial Endeavours ſhould center.</p>
            <p>The Miniſters of Chriſt have not only <hi>themſelves to ſave</hi> but alſo <hi>them that hear them:</hi> And they can't ſecure their own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, unleſs they likewiſe ſincerely endeavour the ſaving of their Charge; which is the End of their Office, and that for which it was ſet up in the Church. They are to be <hi>Helping</hi> of the Faith and Holineſs and Comfort of the People of <hi>God.</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:005332_0010_1017004F5FF81118"/>They are to teach the Diſciples of Chriſt to <hi>obſerve all thoſe Things</hi> which he <hi>commanded;</hi> and are perpetually to admoniſh them that profeſs to believe in God, <hi>to be careful to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good Works;</hi> and ſo adorn their Chriſtian Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>The very Buſineſs of Miniſters as ſuch, is to promote the Goſpel, i. e. a right Underſtanding and firm Belief of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Chriſt, and a Converſation in all thoſe who profeſs the ſame, agreeable thereto. And next to their own Salvation this ſhould ever lay upon their Minds, <hi>viz.</hi> promoting the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Happineſs of thoſe with whoſe Inſtruction they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted: Shewing them the good and right Way, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to walk in it: Laying before them the Precepts and Motives of the Goſpel, and from Time to Time impreſſing their Minds with a Senſe of the Reality, Nearneſs, and infinite Importance of unſeen, eternal Things. The making of their People good and happy, next to ſecuring the Favour of God, and eternal Happineſs for themſelves, ſhould be their great Care and governing Deſign. Not their own ſecular Advantage, not their Grandeur, not their Eaſe, not their own Reputation or Life, ſhould lay ſo near their Hearts, as promoting the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt in their People, leading them to a true Faith in him, and guiding them in Paths of Virtue and true Holineſs to eternal Glory. For this End, and with this in their View, the ſhould be a always ready to deny themſelves, and take up their Croſs; <hi>not pleaſing themſelves, nor ſeeking their own Profit, but the Profit of many that they may be ſaved:</hi> With Prudence and Meekneſs inſtructing and perſwading thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, <hi>if God peradventure will give them Repentance to the Acknowledgment of the Truth.</hi> The Deſign of the Goſpel is to make Men good and happy: and this is what Miniſters are to be carrying on; <hi>as Workers together under God, beſeeching Men not to receive his Grace in vain.</hi> And if they meet with Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition herein, they are not preſently to call for Fire from Heaven; but by Gentleneſs and Goodneſs, Forbearance and Longſuffering, ſhould ſeek to overcome their Luſts and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices.</p>
            <p>Indeed there may be Inſtances, and at certain Seaſons they may abound, wherein, if Miniſters ſhould be more reſolute, they would not want the Countenance of Scripture. The great Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who in our Text and Context men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005332_0011_10170051250591D0"/>his Condeſcenſion, without Doubt, as being examplary, and worthy of Imitation, does elſewhere ſpeak of his very reſolute Behaviour, and even glory in his not <hi>giving Place by Subjection to Adverſaries; no, not for an Hour.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. 2.5.</note> And ſays, <hi>If I yet pleaſed Men I ſhould not be the Servant of Chriſt,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Ch. 1.10.</note> i. e. if he made it his main Deſign to render himſelf agreeable to the Luſts and Prejudices of thoſe he convers'd with, and for the Sake of pleaſing Men in Sentiments oppoſite to his own, ſhould violate the Light and Conviction of his own Mind and Conſcience, he ſhould not behave himſelf at all ſutable to the Character of a Chriſtian Miniſter. Where Good may be rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally hoped for from Moderation, a condeſcending Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and meek and patient Inſtruction, it is, no Doubt, to be practis'd: But ſome Tempers are not to be wrought on or gain'd in that Way. The Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> therefore exhorts, <hi>of ſome have Compaſſion, making a Difference; and others ſave with Fear, pulling them out of the Fire.</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Jude 22, and 23d Verſes.</note> It remains then that in all the Particulars of their Conduct, the Miniſters of Chriſt need that <hi>Wiſdom which is profitable to direct;</hi> and ſhould daily aſk it of God, who has promiſed to give it liberally. And what I have ſaid is, that in general, this End is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually to be had in View, and is what they ſhould make the ruling Meaſure of their Conduct; <hi>promoting the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then there are diverſe Things pertaining to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which ought to be a little more diſtinctly conſidered, upon Account of the Influence they ſhould have upon us, as,</p>
            <p n="1">I. The <hi>Reputation</hi> of the Goſpel. This ſhould be unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably dearer to us than our own. Our own Reputation is but a little Thing and of little Worth, further than as it may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us more extenſively ſerviceable in our Day and Generation. In this View of it, a good Name is very deſireable. and can hardly be ſet at too high a Rate; but in other Reſpects, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and Obloquy may perhaps be ſafer for us. To be ſure, neither the Praiſe nor Diſpraiſe of Men, Can be of any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to us long; for we ſhall not ſtand or fall by their
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005332_0012_10170054590E3328"/>Judgment upon the laſt Trial. But the Reputation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is of the vaſteſt Conſequence, as the Happineſs of Millions, even their eternal Happineſs, has a Dependance upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and Entertainment which they ſhall give to it. The Goſpel is not at all likely to profit thoſe who have no Opinion of its Worth and Excellency: If Men take up mean, low, and contemptuous Thoughts of the Chriſtian Religion, they will treat it accordingly. Miniſters therefore ſhould be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely tender of doing any Thing that may turn to its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; and on the other Hand, they ſhould neglect nothing but do every Thing in their Power, to give it Credit and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence among Men. But here ſuffer me to ſay, we are not to imagine as if we could do this, <hi>promote the Honour and Reputation of the Goſpel,</hi> by making Additions to it of our own: As if it could receive Perfection from our Imperfection. A vain Deſign, a moſt fooliſh Attempt! The Goſpel will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be moſt beautiful in its own native Simplicity. When it was firſt thus taught in the firſt and pureſt Times of the Church, it had wonderful Reputation and Succeſs. And if we would preſerve to it, in any Meaſure, the ſame honourable Eſteem and efficacious Influence, we muſt be careful to teach the <hi>Truth as it is in Jeſus:</hi> We muſt ſtrip the Religion of Chriſt of thoſe ugly and falſe Diſguiſes that have been put upon it by weak or ill-minded Men: We muſt diſtinguiſh from it, and put away, what is of meer human Invention: For with this corrupt Mixture, the Reputation of the Goſpel muſt needs ſink, and the Defence of it be inſufficient: The Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being in no wiſe equal to what is genuine; nor of the ſame Nature with it, but for the moſt Part, irrational and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was exceeding zealous againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing to Chriſtianity the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites and Ceremonies; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew they would marr its Beauty, and weaken its Influence with a great Part of Mankind. And the Additions that have been made to it ſince that Time, eſpecially in <hi>Popiſh</hi> Countries, have been far from being leſs detrimental than thoſe would have been.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Defence</hi> of the Goſpel ſhould be another Part of the Miniſter's Care. To this Purpoſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> preſcribes, that a <hi>Biſhop</hi> or Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Miniſter ſhould not only be of modeſt and good Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005332_0013_101700587842CD30"/>but one <hi>apt to teach, a Workman that needeth not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, and able by ſound Doctrine to convince Gainſayers; for there are many unruly and vain Talkers,</hi> ſays he, <hi>whoſe Mouths muſt be ſtop'd, who ſubvert whole Houſes.</hi> And is not a good Meaſure of human Literature requiſite hereto? Many of the <hi>Adverſaries</hi> of Chriſtianity are Men of ſome Learning; and what a miſerable, pitiful Figure will an <hi>illiterate</hi> Miniſter make, ſhould he chance to fall into ſuch Hands! we are not born Workmen at any Thing: But muſt be inſtructed and educat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Buſineſs in which we would ſerve our Generation. And ſhall the ſacred Calling only coſt a Man no Pains to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for it? Is every Man <hi>apt to teach?</hi> Are all <hi>able to convince Gainſayers?</hi> And yet I don't ſee but that Miniſters ſhould be furniſhed and qualified in theſe Reſpects in ſome good Meaſure, or elſe, that their very undertaking the Work muſt be eſteem'd unlawful. Indeed it is not to be expected that all Miniſters ſhould be alike able and ſkilful herein; but the leaſt that can be reaſonably requir'd is, that they ſhould be Men of good natural Powers, and have had ſome ſuitable Advantage for Improvement. Upon this Account, the happy Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on laid by our Forefathers for the training up of Youth for the Service of the Sanctuary, can never (I think) be enough ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by us their Poſterity: Nor ſhall we ſhew our ſelves worthy of ſuch Anceſtors, ſhould we ever ſuffer the leaſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to be caſt upon our <hi>Colleges</hi> without due Reſentment. Every ſincere Friend to the Religious Intereſts of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I believe will heartily join with me in ſaying, May theſe flouriſhing Societies ſtill flouriſh in good Senſe and uſeful Learning, as well as Piety and univerſal Virtue; and may our Churches be ſupplied from them with paſtors that ſhall feed them with Knowledge and Underſtanding, and be the Defence as well as Ornament of the Goſpel, as long as the Sun and Moon ſhall endure.</p>
            <p>I paſs on,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Thing that the Hearts of Miniſters are to be much ſet upon, is the <hi>Succeſs</hi> of the Goſpel upon thoſe who profeſs it. Alas, it is the Want of this that creates the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Difficulty in the Defence of Chriſtianity. Had the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Religion but its due Influence upon the Hearts and Lives of its Profeſſors, all Mankind would ſoon acknowledge its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005332_0014_1017005CA26DA110"/>Original and Excellency. There is nothing elſe wanting to render the Chriſtian Church <hi>the Perfection of Beauty;</hi> and to attract the Eyes, and engage the Eſteem of the admiring Nations. Let but <hi>Zion</hi> become a <hi>Mountain of Holineſs,</hi> and it would ſoon be <hi>the Joy of the whole Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then ſhould be the Miniſter's main Care, to inſtruct his People in the Nature, and to convince them of the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of true Holineſs; that <hi>except a Man be born again he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the Kingdom of God;</hi> that <hi>they which profeſs to believe in God muſt be careful to maintain good Works;</hi> and that all, in the various Relations of Life, who call themſelves Chriſtians are under an indiſpenſable Obligation to <hi>deny Ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godlily in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Things Chriſtian Miniſters muſt ſpeak and exhort, and rebuke with all Authority: And they muſt repeat the awful Cautions ſo often found in Scripture, <hi>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: For whatſoever a Man ſoweth that ſhall he alſo reap.— He that ſoweth to his Fleſh ſhall of the Fleſh reap Corruption: But he that ſoweth to the Spirit ſhall of the Spirit reap Life everlaſting.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Gal. 6.7, 8.</note> And, <hi>let no Man deceive you,</hi> (the Holy Ghoſt foreſeeing what Oppoſition this Doctrine which is according to Godlineſs, would meet with in the ſeveral Ages of the Church) <hi>he that doth Righteouſneſs is righteous. He that committeth Sin is of the Devil.— In this the Children of God are manifeſt and the Children of the Devil: Whoſoever doth not Righteouſneſs is not of God, neither he that loveth not his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">I John 3.7, 10.</note> And they muſt command their People's Attention, and oblige them not to overlook ſuch plain Paſſages as thoſe, Rom. 2.6, 7, 8. <hi>Who will render to every Man according to his Deeds: To them that by patient Continuance in well-doing, ſeek for Glory, and Honour, and Immortality, eternal Life. But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the Truth, but obey Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs; Indignation and Wrath.—And, 2 Theſſ. 1.7, 8.9.—The Lord Jeſus ſhall be reveal'd from Heaven— in Flaming Fire, taking Vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel:—Who ſhall be puniſh'd with
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005332_0015_1017005E32F929F0"/>everlaſting Deſtruction from the Preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power: When he ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admir'd in all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Once more,</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Miniſters of Chriſt ſhould be concern'd for the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation</hi> of the Goſpel, or a farther Spread of Chriſtian Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge than it has hitherto obtian'd. It ſhould be their Heart's Deſire, and their daily Prayer to God, that <hi>all Men may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth:</hi> Nor ſhould they be wanting in any proper methods, to contribute their utmoſt Endeavours that <hi>the People which ſit in Darkneſs, and dwell in the Region and Shadow of Death,</hi> may be favour'd with this great Light. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was in a particular Manner concern'd for this; therefore <hi>ſtrove to preach the Goſpel, where Chriſt had not been ſo much as nam'd.</hi> Indeed the oridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Miniſters of Chriſt, who are Officers in particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, are not oblig'd, or at Liberty in this Reſpect, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were, who had it in their Commiſſion to go into all the World, and to preach the Goſpel to every Creature: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as theſe have their particular Stations and Provinces aſſigned them. Theſe were in Primitive Times <hi>ordain'd in every City;</hi> and their Charge was to <hi>feed the Flock of God over which the Holy Ghoſt had made them Overſeers.</hi> Their Buſineſs was not ſo much to plant Churches, as to take Care of thoſe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their particular Overſight. The Apoſtles, and other extraordinary Perſons rais'd up by God for that Purpoſe, were to <hi>Diſciple</hi> the Nations, and gather them into diſtinct Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Bodies: And then thoſe who were put in Truſt, in the ſeveral Churches by them, were to maintain Chriſtianity where they had planted it. Not that New Churches might not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Direction be formed and gather'd out of old ones, as their Numbers ſhould increaſe and their Circumſtances call for it; this was neceſſary even to the Maintenance of Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity where it had been planted by the Apoſtles; but what I would be underſtood arguing againſt, is the Practice of thoſe, who, though ordinary Miniſters (if any at all) yet as if they were Apoſtles, go from Place to Place, and from Country to Country, either having no proper Charges of their own, or neglecting them, if they have any, and rambling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005332_0016_101700338CEEF960"/>in thoſe of other Men's, exciting Parties and Factions: Which is ſo far from being a Means to propagate the Goſpel <hi>where it is not,</hi> that it has the moſt direct Tendency to ſubvert and overthrow it <hi>where it is.</hi> We are ſtation'd, my Brethren, in different Parts of our Lord's Harveſt; and we ſhould <hi>ſtudy to be quiet, and to do our own Eaſineſs.</hi> We ſhould not ſo much as have a Mind to crowd our ſelves into the <hi>Labours of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men;</hi> much leſs ſhould we endeavour to crowd out any of our Fellow Labourers from thoſe Parts of the Harveſt which by our common Maſter, <hi>the Lord of the Harveſt,</hi> are aſſign'd to them. And as we ſhould not aim at this our ſelves, ſo neither ſhould we <hi>tamely</hi> ſubmit to it from others, but boldly oppoſe and ſtedfaſtly reſiſt ſuch Criminal Diſorders in any of our Fellow Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,— But I may not enlarge.</p>
            <p>I have thus finiſh'd what I propos'd; and have ſhown what Miniſters ſhould aim at both with Reſpect to themſelves and their People, <hi>namely,</hi> in one Word, to be <hi>good Men,</hi> and make <hi>them</hi> ſuch; to underſtand, believe, embrace, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the Religion of Chriſt, and teach it truly and ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to others. I ſhall only crave your Patience further, while I make ſome <hi>Application</hi> of what has been ſaid, in the uſual Addreſſes; <hi>Firſt,</hi> To my Fathers and Brethren in the Miniſtry, and more particularly to the <hi>Perſon now to be ordained;</hi> And <hi>then,</hi> to my Chriſtian Hearers in general, but eſpecially thoſe of the <hi>Congregation in this Place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Permit me to addreſs, and make ſome Application of what has been ſaid to my <hi>Fathers and Brethren in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How critical is the Situation of our Place, and of what vaſt Conſequence is the right Deportment and due Behaviour of our ſelves in ſuch important Stations! We are put in Truſt with the Goſpel of Chriſt, the richeſt and moſt invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Treaſure, and we have this to improve not for our ſelves only, but for many others. With this in our Hands, with theſe <hi>Goods of our heavenly Maſter,</hi> we are to <hi>trade</hi> and <hi>occupy.</hi> And our Buſineſs is, not only to improve our ſelves in the Knowledge and Love of God, and Conformity to his Image and Will, but likewiſe to gain <hi>others</hi> to Chriſt, even as many
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005332_0017_10170065553513C0"/>as we can, and to promote in them the ſame heavenly Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. We are not to deal in Party Matters (our Lord will not have his Goods thus beſtow'd) in promoting Factions and Schiſms, and in dividing and alienating the Minds of Men, and of Chriſtians from one another. We are not to deal in <hi>proud Wrath,</hi> and to ſpend our Lord's Money in fomenting a better Zeal ariſing from Men's <hi>doting about Queſtions and Strifes of Words;</hi> but our Buſineſs is, with the <hi>Words of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and the Doctrine which is according to Godlineſs,</hi> to promote Faith and Love and that <hi>godly Edifying</hi> which is in Chriſt Jeſus. We are not at Liberty to ſpend that Time and Strength in contending with our Fellow-Servants, which is given us for other and better Purpoſes. We have a great Work upon our Hands; and ſhall we let it <hi>ceaſe while we come down</hi> beneath the Dignity of our Office, to quarrel about Trifles? Let us hear the great <hi>Apoſtle</hi> giving his ſolemn Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to a Chriſtian Miniſter, <hi>Follow</hi> (ſays he) <hi>Righteouſneſs, Faith, Charity, Peace with all them that call on the Lord out of a pure Heart. But fooliſh and unlearn'd Queſtions avoid, knowing that they do gender Strifes. And the Servant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle unto all Men—in Meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves.—</hi> Though we ſhould be firmly reſolv'd in the Strength of God's Grace, to profeſs and ſtand by the Truth ſo far as we ſhall know it, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Fear or Favour of Man; yet we ſhould hate Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry, and with an equal Zeal avoid whatever has a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to ſtir up Strife, and to ſet Chriſtians at Variance one with another. <hi>The End of the Commandment,</hi> ſays the inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed St. <hi>Paul, is Charity — from which ſome having ſwerved, have turned aſide unto vain Jangling.</hi> Though we are ſet for the Defence of the Goſpel, and ſhould contend earneſtly for the Faith that was once delivered to the Saints; yet it will not unbecome us to let our <hi>Moderation</hi> be known to all Men; and in Order to the former, we muſt carefully diſtinguiſh what is Goſpel and what not, what is the Faith that was once delivered to the Saints, and what has been added to it ſince by Man. And here let me ſay, the Credit and Honour of Chriſtianity demand this at our Hands, and the Defence of it makes it abſolutely neceſſary. And I ſhould think the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of it too, might be reaſonably hop'd to bear ſome good Proportion to the Purity and Simplicity in which it is taught.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005332_0018_101700682E88CFB0"/>To be ſure, the Goſpel never had ſuch Succeſs as in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times before the Face of it was overſpread with that great and general Corruption, which even the <hi>Reformation from Popery</hi> (though the greateſt of Bleſſings, yet I fear) has not entirely carried off. It is the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> my Fathers and Brethren, our Office was deſign'd to promote, the Goſpel of Chriſt, and not any human Schemes or Syſtems. 'Tis <hi>this</hi> we are to teach our People; and for this we ſhould ſhew our ſelves becomingly zealous: But if we <hi>teach</hi> them <hi>for Doctrines the Commandments of Men,</hi> as we ſhall not be able to anſwer it our ſelves to God, ſo neither ſhall we profit our People at all; for the true Fear of God is not to be taught in that Way, Iſa. 29.13. and Mat. 15.9. We cannot then be too care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in this Reſpect, as the Honour and Defence, and Succeſs and Propagation of the Goſpel have all ſo great a Dependance on it, which are the Things we are perpetually to have in our View.</p>
            <p>I would now turn my ſelf to the Perſon, at whoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and for whoſe ſpecial Service this Diſcourſe was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dear Sir,</hi> I doubt not but you have heard with a particular Self-Application. I have ſaid nothing (I think) diſcouraging; for why ſhould it be thought an hard Saying, that we muſt be plain, honeſt Men, and aim at what we profeſs to aim at, and ſerve the Maſter we profeſs to have choſen. You will preſently be acknowledg'd a Miniſter of Chriſt, and receive the Charge of Souls. Your Buſineſs then will be, to preach Chriſt and watch for Souls; no Work more honourable or more important. But in Order to your doing this ſucceſsfully, <hi>the Life which you live in the Fleſh, you muſt live by the Faith of the Son of God,</hi> depending on, and deriving from him, the Head of all vital Influences, the Aſſiſtance you ſhall need from Time to Time. Oh be not ſatisfied with meerly preaching Chriſt, while you ſhall allow yourſelf to live a Stranger to him; or with watching for the Souls of others, while you neglect the keeping and the cultivating your own Soul. Preach the Goſpel, but live it withal; and know that in ſo doing you ſhall be a <hi>Partaker thereof;</hi> you ſhall more and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the ſaving happy Influence of Divine Truths; the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005332_0019_10170069C865D760"/>Doctrine which you preach to others ſhall continually be of the greateſt Advantage to your ſelf, making you an holy and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an happy Man: And at laſt you ſhall partake of the great Reward which the Goſpel has ſet up in the View of its Miniſters and Profeſſors to animate them to their Duty with a lively Zeal, even <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> This is enough Sir, we can't need any greater Encouragement: We ſerve the beſt of Maſters; <hi>his Yoke is eaſy, and his Burden light,</hi> but the Reward of ſerving him, <hi>an exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory.</hi> And if we are call'd at any Time to ſpecial and more difficult Trials and Services, <hi>his Strength will be made perfect in our Weakneſs.</hi> He will not put us upon Impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; he knows we are Fleſh, and has had Experience of our Infirmities. If the Sufferings of Chriſt ſhall abound in us, ſo ſhall likewiſe thoſe Conſolations which are by Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>And as thy Days ſo ſhall thy Strength be.</hi> Is not this enough? Is not he faithful who hath promiſed, and will he not do it? With an entire Dependance then upon theſe faithful Promiſes, do thou, my Brother, <hi>do faithfully whatſoever thou doſt;</hi> and never let the Fear of Man, or any worldly Conſideration, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to draw you into Compliances againſt your Conſcience. 'Tis impoſſible that any outward Thing ſhould be a millionth Part of that Service and Comfort to us, that the Teſtimony of our Conſcience to the Simplicity and Integrity of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, will be. The Joy of an innocent Mind alone can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be equal'd by all earthly Comforts put together; and the more we ſuffer for Well-doing, or ſo long as we do well, the greater and more ſenſible will this be, as well as the future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Let Men then do their worſt, the good Man's Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is in his own Power, for to be good is to be happy. Let theſe Things, dear Sir, ſink deep in your Heart; and have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuch a Senſe of the Happineſs of being good, that you may be unwearied and unfainting in your Endeavours to make every Body elſe ſo. In this Deſign, God be with you and make you a proſperous Man.</p>
            <p>I am now in the next Place,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To apply what has been ſaid to my <hi>Chriſtian Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in general.</hi> And are you then <hi>Chriſtian Hearers?</hi> This one Word ſpeaks and the Duty I can teach you. You profeſs yourſelves Chriſtians; may God enable you to be ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed!
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005332_0020_1017006BE5A102C8"/>But if you would be ſo more than in Name or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion only, your Knowledge of the Truth muſt make you free; free from the Power and Dominion of every corrupt Affection and Appetite; you muſt be ſanctified by your Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus; the Spirit of Chriſt and of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel muſt reign and prevail in you. You muſt be <hi>Partakers of the Goſpel;</hi> of the ſaving, divine Efficacy of Goſpel Truths, which ſhall renew you in the very Spirit of your Minds; purify your Souls, all fill you with the Love of God, and the Love of Goodneſs. You cannot be Chriſtians without this; <hi>if a Man has not the Spirit of Chriſt be is none of his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have heard the Duty of Miniſters: Now you may eaſily learn your own from thence; for it is in common with the Faithful; that they are to aim at being Partakers of the Goſpel; though indeed they ſhould aim at peculiar Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures thereof. But if common Chriſtians ſhould aim as high as their Miniſters, could any Body blame them? If they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to a Prophet's Goodneſs, ſhall they not receive a Prophet's Reward? Be not ſtraitn'd then, my Hearers; be not ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in your own Minds, for you are not ſtraitned in Chriſt. The Foutain of Grace is open to you; Oh drink, <hi>drink a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly,</hi> and be not contented with any low Meaſures of Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>It is a melancholly Thought, the low Ebb of Chriſtianity in the World: how little is it underſtood, how little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with? The Name indeed is common, but the Thing how rare! Oh, my Leaneſs, my Leaneſs, how juſt and how general might the Complaint be, among all Orders indeed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all Profeſſions, and through al the various Diſtinctions, that divide Mankind! Let me intreat you, my Chriſtian Friends, not to ſatisfy your ſelves with barely being ſenſible of the Evil, and bewailing it: But up and be doing, and make Proof of what Chriſtians may attain to. The nobleſt Heights are attainable; ariſe then, be ſtrong, take hold of God's Strength, and Eternal Life is before you.</p>
            <p>I now turn my ſelf particularly to the <hi>dear People of this Pariſh.</hi> Through the good Hand of God towards you, a Man of Underſtanding, and as we hope, of ſincere Piety, is given
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005332_0021_1017007011C6FEB0"/>you this Day. Oh, magnify the Redeemer for ſuch a Gift. Yet, though we cannot but greatly rejoice with you in the Proſpect you have of ſo happy a Settlement, we muſt however warn you to <hi>ceaſe from Man whoſe Breath is in his Noſtrils; for wherein is he to be accounted of? Lord what is Man, Man that is like unto Vanity, and whoſe Days are as a Shadow that paſſeth away!</hi> And admoniſh you, to put your Truſt <hi>in the living God, in whoſe Hand is the Soul of every living Thing, and the Breath of all Mankind;</hi> every Creature being that, and no more as to our Comfort and Happineſs in it, than he is pleas'd to make it. Let it be your Care, to do nothing that ſhall diſcourage ſo fervent a Zeal, or cramp ſuch Gifts as your Miniſter is ſetting out with. We are Witneſſes of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of his Mind towards you, and of his laudable Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to excell. A Thouſand Ways you may encourage or diſcourage him, provoke his Endeavours yet further to ſerve you, or damp his Spirit, and ſink his Mind. I know the Heart of a Miniſter, the Fears, Temptations and Diſcouragements, that ſuch are peculiarly incident to; and I know what it is in ſome good Meaſure, to have a kind, obliging People; a People that ſtedfaſtly adhere to their Miniſter under all his Troubles, and don't gad about after every Stranger; who know how to bear with their Miniſter's Infirmities, and are diſpos'd to make the beſt of it, if there be any good Thing in him. I can't but wiſh, you may be ſuch a People, or a better to him who is this Day to be ſet over you in the Lord. If you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him you will certainly reap the Advantage of it your ſelves. No Man can do under ſinking Oppreſſions, as if a People were kind to him. And if ſome find Fault (as 'tis impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe, where there are ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Minds) why may not others commend? I don't mean that it is deſireable, there ſhould be differing Sentiments among the ſame People. So far as it may be, <hi>they ſhould all ſpeak the ſame Thing, and be perfectly join'd together in the ſame Mind, and in the ſame Judgment.</hi> But as this is not to be expected unleſs we underſtand it (perhaps as we ought to do) only of an Agreement in Fundamentals; ſo in other and leſſer Matters, there ſhould be a mutual Chriſtian Forbearance one of another. And if every one is not pleas'd in every little Thing, or Mode, or Circumſtance of the Miniſter's Behaviour, or Preaching, or the like, who can help it? What diſguſts ſome, may be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005332_0022_1017007438ADB078"/>to others: and if ſome find Fault (I ſay) others may commend. Not again, that I would have you to flatter your Miniſter; nothing is more unprofitable, nothing more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. But that there may be an <hi>Equality,</hi> and his Spirit not ſink under the Captiouſneſs of thoſe, who will never be eaſy long with any Miniſter, or under any Preaching. My Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Friends, I hope you don't look for Perfection in your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. Let it be his Care to be as perfect as he can, and yours to maintain that Charity whoſe Property it is to <hi>cover a Multitude of Faults.</hi> Be more concern'd about your own Duty than his; be more concern'd to know your ſelves how to <hi>live,</hi> than to teach him how to <hi>preach.</hi> And on the other Hand, never ſatisfy your ſelves with meerly admiring and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding his Preaching. Oh, empty, vain Thing, unprofitable to Miniſter and People! Commend your Miniſter's Preaching by improving under it in Knowledge and Virtue, by leading ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, righteous, and godly Lives; this will afford the greateſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction both to him and you. Let your Profiting then, as well as his, appear to all Men; and therefore give Attendance to Reading, to Meditation and Prayer in your Families and Cloſets, as well as to the publick Hearing of the Word; and be much in theſe Things. Oh, let the Word of Chriſt dwell in you richly, and aim at being Partakers of the Goſpel. Set the Glory and Happineſs of the future World continually in your View; live in a realizing ſincere Belief and Expectation of the <hi>Judgment to come;</hi> and know, that in Order to your being found in <hi>Chriſt</hi> in that Day without Spot and blameleſs, you muſt here in this World love his Name and be his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; you muſt ſtudy and obey his holy Will; you muſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely endeavour to find out the Truth for your ſelves, and live in all good Conſcience before God; exerciſing a daily Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for your daily, manifold Infirmities, and a lively continual Faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, who loved us and gave himſelf for us, an Offering and a Sacrifice to God for a ſweet ſmelling Savour:</hi>— To whom therefore, with the Father and Holy Spirit, be given Praiſes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, Amen.</p>

            <p>WHatever was originally intended by the RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP, this Ceremony, as practiſed in theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, is an Acknowledgment of the Validity of their Ordination to whom it is given, of their Equality as Miniſters of the Goſpel, and mutual Obligations to aſſiſt each other in managing the Concerns and promoting the Intereſts of Chriſt their common Lord.</p>
            <p>It adminiſters therefore Inſtruction and Conſolation to him that receives it. <hi>On the one hand,</hi> it admoniſheth him to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify his Office and maintain his Equality amongſt his Brethren in the Miniſtry againſt the injurious Claims of any affecting a Superiority which Chriſt never gave <note n="‡" place="bottom">Matt. 20.20, — 28.</note>.

And as it ſucceeds to a Charge the moſt Important that Man can be intruſted with, and of which an Account muſt be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in <hi>that Day,</hi> when Jeſus ſhall appear in the Glory of the Father with all the holy Angels to judge the quick and the dead, it may be conſidered as deſign'd to encourage the Heart and ſtrengthen the Hands of him that receives it, who if he be duely ſenſible of the Nature of his Office cannot but need it. And this it doth, as it is a Promiſe of brotherly Love and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, dear Sir, by giving you this Right Hand of Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip in the Name of your Brethren in the Miniſtry, and by the Appointment of the venerable Council convened upon the ſolemn Occaſions of this Day, I acknowledge you to be regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparated to that Office which I ſuſtain in the Chriſtian Church. And I admoniſh you that you and I are equal, and that neither of us is upon any Occaſion whatſoever, to aſpire at that <hi>Dominion</hi> and Authority which Chriſt hath forbidden us both; no, not yet to ſuffer it each other.—May God ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more grant as much of that humble heavenly Temper of Mind, whereby we may be reſtrained within the Limits of our Duty, and on the other Hand, that Wiſdom and Fortitude by which the Pretenſions of every bold Invader of the Rights of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Fellow-Servants may be ſucceſsfully oppoſed.</p>
            <p>And as I am ſure the weighty Charge this Day devolved upon you and repeated to me, tends to inſpire us with great Fear and Sollicitude of Spirit, let us, my Brother encourage ourſelves with the ſupports Chriſt hath provided for us which are many and mighty. We are engaged in a Calling that is divine, and are Workers together with God: The holy Spirit, the Sanctifier and the Comforter, operates in us and with us in the ſame great Undertaking: The holy Angels are oftentimes ſent forth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like weighty Errand of miniſtring to thoſe who ſhall be the Heirs of Salvation: Good Men too are with us in our Work by their fervent Prayers, ſeaſonable Counſels, and the perſuaſive Argument of a good Example: Finally, To thoſe Miniſters who ſhall be faithful to the Death, Chriſt hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the encouraging Promiſe of a Crown of Life.</p>

To all which, dear Sir, I add, your Brethren, engaged in the ſame holy Calling, willingly promiſe, what in their Turn they expect from you all neceſſary Aſſiſtance by their Prayers, Counſels, Admonitions and Reproofs, and the Exerciſe of their miniſterial Powers.</p>
            <p>And now, may God of the Riches of his Grace grant you to acquit your Self in your ſeveral Functions with Induſtry, Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Succeſs, that hereafter you may receive that tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sentence from the Judge of all the Earth, <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant, thou haſt been faithful in a few things, I will make the Ruler own many things, enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</hi>
