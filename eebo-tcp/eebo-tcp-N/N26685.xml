            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>IT is thought neceſſary to inform the Reader that a ſermon preceded this, from Matthew</hi> xvi. 27. For the Son of Man ſhall come in the glory of his Father, with his holy Angels, and then ſhall he reward every man according to his works.—<hi>In this diſcourſe, the particular object was to ſhew, that all our conduct, in every relation in life, will peculiarly intereſt and concern us, at the final Judgment. The relation between Miniſters and their People, was particularly conſidered; the object of the Head of the Church in the appointment of them; their accountableneſs to Him, in the diſcharge of their office; the obligation of the People to attend to the true Miniſters of Chriſt; and that Chriſt now views, and will, at the day of Judgment, treat the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of People toward faithful Miniſters, as conduct toward himſelf, agreeably to his own declaration, "He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that ſent me; and he that diſpiſeth you, diſpiſeth me; and he that diſpiſeth me, diſpiſeth him that ſent me: He that will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, nor hear your word, it ſhall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorra<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in the day of Judgment, than for him." Theſe ſketches are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, becauſe reference is had to this diſcourſe in the Addreſſes in the following Sermon, and in other parts of it alſo, as will be ſeen by the reader.</hi>

            <p>THE Author hath no expectation that this Sermon will affect the minds of Readers as it did thoſe who heard it, as that was a peculiar oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.

It is hoped it will be of no diſſervice to any, and that candor will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by the reader.</p>

            <p>THE apoſtle Paul, in the courſe of his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, came to Corinth, and there he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the goſpel about ſix years before he wrote this laſt epiſtle to them. At that time he tarried among them about a year and an half. During this viſit, many who heard him, believed, and turned from their idols to the ſervice of the true God, and embraced the glorious goſpel of his Son: The happy effects of his miniſtry among them through the bleſſing of God, greatly endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to each other. After having been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from them about five years, and having in this time heard of things in their conduct contrary to the ſpirit of the Goſpel, and being likewiſe requeſted by them in a letter to him, to anſwer ſome particular queſtions; he embraces an opportunity amidſt all his oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cares, to write to them, with a manifeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to correct their errors, to lead them further into the knowlege of true chriſtianity, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their queſtions. The next year he wrote them this moſt feeling and ſpiritual epiſtle which
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035495_0005_1004E0500ECE4498"/>
contains our text: theſe two epiſtles contain more than he wrote to any other church. It appears that the church at Corinth was peculiarly on the mind of the apoſtle, and that he had ſpent much time and care for them; but in this epiſtle he cloſes his ſervices among them, and takes his leave.</p>
            <p>Tho the church at Corinth, in general, highly eſteemed the apoſtle, yet he had his enemies; who, tho they acknowleged him great and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful in reaſoning, yet diſliked his perſonal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and to whom his ſpeech was contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible, as appears from this epiſtle. It is evident that this church had ſome members unfriendly to the doctrines, the ſpirit, and practice of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; for the apoſtle charges them with being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch fornication, as far exceeded what was even named among the gentiles; that one ſhould have his father's wife—that they were alſo carnal, ſelfiſh, and contentious; that one was for Paul, another for Apollos, &amp;c. all which proved them deſtitute of the ſpirit of the goſpel. Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the ſacrament was much to the diſhonor of the goſpel, and inconſiſtent not only with he ſobriety and purity of the chriſtian religion and its holy and ſolemn inſtitutions, but even contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to common decency, that one ſhould be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and another drunken, at this religious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity.</p>
            <p>One reaſon why there were ſo many inſincere profeſſors at Corinth, while the goſpel was gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally unpopular, may probably be, that Criſpus the chief ruler of the ſynagogue believed, and all his houſe, and alſo one Gous; theſe, and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035495_0006_1004E051D6796330"/>
characters rendered it popular to profeſs chriſtianity at Corinth, tho it was not the caſe in other places.</p>
            <p>It was in vain for theſe enemies of Paul, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly to oppoſe his doctrines, or to impeach his moral character: they muſt then uſe ſuch wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons againſt him as they could find. In ſeeking for objections, nothing could be found for open attack, but the meer defects of nature. He was not a man of a ſtately and commanding viſage, nor a good ſpeaker. His letters, ſay they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily preſence is weak, and his ſpeech contemptible. Such public clamor is often popular with the unſtable, irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and inconſiderate part of mankind; and is frequently a ſtronger objection againſt a miniſter, in the mind of many, than herecy, or immorality; for neither of the latter are ſo contrary to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified heart. Though this clamor might tend to hinder the ſucceſs of the goſpel at Corinth; yet it did not alter the opinions and feelings of the really religious and diſcerning chriſtians, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the apoſtle. They conſidered ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections as groundleſs cavils, and the fruits of an unfriendly mind to the goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Whether theſe or other reaſons operated to prevent the apoſtle from further particular atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, care, and labor among the Corinthians, does not appear. It is evident he lived, at leaſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix years after he wrote this laſt epiſtle, as a laborer in the vineyard of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Whatever might be his reaſons, it is clear he felt himſelf warranted in ceaſing his particular attention to them; and therefore in the cloſe of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035495_0007_1004E056C34C19D8"/>
this epiſtle, and particularly in the words of our text, he takes leave of them. It appears from his epiſtles, that he dearly and tenderly regarded the real friends of Jeſus; and tho he deſpiſed the cavils of theſe falſe profeſſors, yet he wiſhed their good, and ſincerely pitied thoſe who might, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautiouſly, be ruined by their means.</p>
            <p>Far would I be from comparing myſelf with this great apoſtle, as a man inſpired, or as being his equal, in natural abilities or real graces; but in unequal characters, there may be ſome like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in circumſtantial things. How far the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs the apoſtle in the beginning of his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Corinth and ſome things which happened after, and have now been mentioned, may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with what hath taken place among us ſince my ſettlement among this people, I ſhall leave to the judgment of the candid, and acquainted.</p>
            <p>In the words of our text the apoſtle expreſſes his good will and ſincere deſire for the proſperity of that church, which, under God, he had labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to erect, and build up on the plan of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
            <p>We are not to ſuppoſe the apoſtle intended by this phraſe a mere parting compliment without much meaning, as at this day is become cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary: to ſhew his meaning and real deſire that they might fare well in the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſenſe, he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joins with it the friendly term of brethren, but alſo exhibits before them the way to farewell in the higheſt degree poſſible. As the way to this felicity he exhorteth them to be perfect, to be of good comfort, to be of one mind, and to live in peace; with this aſſurance, that in ſo doing, the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035495_0008_1004E05B9ED1BD70"/>
God of love and peace, the infinite fountain of good, would be with them.</p>
            <p>Perfection intends holineſs of heart, and of life, and a ſtrict and conſtant walk with God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the command of the glorious goſpel.</p>
            <p>To be of good comfort, is not to ſink, and be diſheartened at the dark and gloomy ſcenes which might happen; but in the exerciſe of true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vital piety to God, and benevolence to men; they ſhould place their hope, their truſt, and confidence, in the all powerful care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of that God, who is ever mindful of them that rely on him, that they ſhould be comforted. In a view of God's conſtant care of his cauſe, and of his people, and the unfailing interceſſion and wiſe government of Jeſus Chriſt, who is head over all things to his church; and who is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat all the devices of the enemies of his people, and to give them a glorious and compleat victory at laſt, who truſt in him for ſalvation; that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Jeſus the great captain of ſalvation, and the mighty conqueror, they might be ſure of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory at laſt, however dark and critical their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent circumſtances might appear.</p>
            <p>He further recommends to them union and oneneſs of mind, both in faith and practice, tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard God and men; that they ſhould be united in the faith and fellow-ſhip of the goſpel; that they might not be rent by diviſions and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſo be expoſed to the ravages of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies of God, and of his people; but that they ſhould be united in love to God, and poſſeſs the fellow-ſhip of the ſpirit; as union in the truth, is the great bulwork of the church againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035495_0009_1004E05D240DBC80"/>
of the adverſary. He exhorts them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to lay aſide contention, to ſtudy and ſeek for peace and love in the truth, by all proper condeſcention one to the other, which could be conſiſtent with the religion of the benevolent goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, of the meek, the lowly and condeſcending Jeſus; that they ſhould ever ſhun and guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an inclination too common among profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chriſtians to diſagree; that they ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in every thing, in faith and practice, and ſo eſcape contention, and party opinion, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty zeal; that in lowlineſs, in humbleneſs of mind, in charity, and tenderneſs towards each other, and the truth, they ſhould ſeek to know the will of God, and the path of duty, and in this way ſtrive together for the promotion of the glory of God, the good of his kingdom, and the mutual benefit of each other, and the good of the whole body; and that they might all be one in Chriſt, and be perfectly joined together in the ſame mind and in the ſame judgment, and become one body in Chriſt the glorious head of all principality and power.</p>
            <p>In this way he aſſures them that they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be unconquerable, by any of the arts and devices of the adverſary, and might expect that their united prayers would conſtantly aſcend to heaven with full acceptance; and that God by his ſpirit would continually dwell in and among them, and that he would be as a wall of fire round about them, and the glory in the midſt of them.</p>
            <p>In theſe directions the apoſtle compriſes all religion, both of faith and practice, in a moſt feeling manner; and alſo the ſum of bleſſedneſs
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035495_0010_1004E05EC22B7738"/>
that ſhall attend it; and this was of high import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the church at Corinth, conſidering their danger, both from ſome of their own body, who appeared evidently not to be real friends to the doctrines and duties of the goſpel, and alſo from a frowning world around them; and I may add, that it was eſpecially needful to them, as they were now to be denied the aid of that great apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for their guide.</p>
            <p>But it is proper that we come to a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular application of what has been ſaid this day, and eſpecially on the particular occaſion and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Myſelf, and the Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this Society.</p>
            <p>In this place, allow me to refreſh your minds with a very brief recital of ſome things, which have taken place in the courſe of my miniſtry:—You will then recollect, that fourteen years laſt January, I was, in compliance with the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous voice and deſire of this church and ſociety, ſolemnly ſet apart, and took upon me the care and charge of them as their Paſtor. At this time it was at leaſt implied, that we ſolemnly engaged, before our God, to diſcharge the duties of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and People in the fear of God, and as thoſe who muſt give account, before his Bar, at the Great Day.</p>
            <p>We then began that important relation, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in the forenoon, and which muſt occaſion us a moſt ſolemn meeting at the Tribunal of God, in the preſence of an aſſembled univerſe, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to him for the diſcharge of our duty, in this relation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:035495_0011_1004E063AABCCBC0"/>
Soon after theſe mutual engagements, it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God of his infinite kindneſs to pour upon us his ſpirit, to call up the attention of many ſecure ſinners, and hopefully to bring home a number of ſouls to the knowlege and acknowlegement of the truth; joy filled the hearts of the friends of God among us.</p>
            <p>At this time I found it eaſy, tho very labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to diſcharge the duties of the miniſtry. Of this delightful and happy time for nearly two years, many here preſent are living witneſſes.</p>
            <p>At the decline of theſe joyful and laborious days, to me, another and very different ſcene commenced; and tho it leſſened my calls for fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent preaching, public conferences, and private inſtructions of a ſpiritual kind; yet it was a far more troubleſome and difficult taſk to do my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to my own ſatiſfaction, and that of the people, than the other. This troubled my mind, it ſunk and diſheartened my ſpirits. Tho the matters firſt agitated were moſtly ſmall in themſelves, yet they manifeſtly led to thoſe which were material.</p>
            <p>I was much diſcouraged when I found we could not think alike in thoſe matters; and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially was this the caſe with me, after repeatedly urging for a mutual council, which was utterly rejected; for this I ſuppoſed, and ſtill conceive, was the only way to compoſe our difficulties; and ſuch a council, I am now perſuaded, would ſoon have convinced us of our duty, and pointed out the path in which we might have gone in peace and harmony to this day.</p>
            <p>In a view of theſe matters, at their firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I think the word of St. James may well be
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035495_0012_1004E06656EBFB20"/>
applied: "Behold what a matter a little fire kindleth."</p>
            <p>In a view of the difficulties attending a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of my duty as a miniſter for eight years paſt, (in my private meditationſ) I have often had the ſubject of the forenoon; the judgment of the great day croud itſelf forcibly on my mind, with regard to myſelf and you my brethren and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and have been frequently led to think, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was not much to be deſired that our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn relation to each other (tho vaſtly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in its nature) ſhould be diſſolved. This hath once and again induced me to bring this ſubject before this church and ſociety.</p>
            <p>But God's time is always the beſt.</p>
            <p>Providence has now brought the event to paſs, but not without our exertions; and probably, not without great blame to ſome, if not the moſt of us.</p>
            <p>I am far from claiming perfection to myſelf; nor did I ever pretend to be a chriſtian of high attainments in grace or holineſs; tho for thirty-ſix years, I have had an hope that I had paſſed the new birth; and tho I have ever hoped, yet I have often feared. I feel that I depend on the ſovereign mercy and grace of God, in Chriſt, and on the holy Spirit, to carry on and compleat in me, that which I hope is begun. This is all my expectation of a glorious immortality.</p>
            <p>I can freely ſay, that in my days of trouble, I have on ſome occaſions been more diſturbed and agitated in mind, than my cooler judgment after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dictated. I think, however, I can with truth ſay, I have not wiſhed nor ſought real evil
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035495_0013_1004E067DBCA5D58"/>
to this people, nor to an individual; but rather their beſt, their eternal good.</p>
            <p>I muſt ſay alſo, that in my hours of reflection, on matters that have paſſed, I have not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, of having taken the wrong ſide of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>I think it my duty, further, to ſay on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that the doctrines and duties I have taught you, my brethren and friends, are thoſe by which we muſt ſtand or fall before our Judge at the great day; at which time let us remember we muſt have a moſt ſolemn meeting: and O that God of his infinite mercy would grant, that it may be joyful to us all, through his ſpirit and grace attending us, in our future lives, and by the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious atonement of his Son the Judge.</p>
            <p>At your requeſt I have reſigned that ſacred charge and care of your ſouls, which once I took upon me, by your unanimous deſire; ſuppoſing this choice of yours, and the deciſion of a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al council, render it proper and juſtifiable before my God.</p>
            <p>It being your requeſt that I ſhould in this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic way take my leave of you, allow me to cloſe by a few addreſſes; the firſt of which will be to this church:</p>

                        <p>When firſt I took the paſtoral charge of this Church, the whole number was twenty-nine. The moſt of thoſe who were the founders and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of this Church, now ſleep in duſt. In the courſe of my miniſtry, ninety-three have been added; and a large number of theſe, have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

an hope of renewing grace, under my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. Theſe have in time paſt acknowleged me (under God) their ſpiritual father and guide. Whatever may be their preſent feelings with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to me, if they are not deceived in their hope, I <hi>truſt</hi> they will again acknowledge me at the great day, and that I ſhall yet have them by their free conſent as ſeals of my miniſtry, and crowns of my rejoicing before God.</p>
                        <p>As I leave you, at your own choice, it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to ſuppoſe you eſteem it a privilege, and not a loſs. That it is to the promotion of your good that this ſhould take place, you cannot therefore expect that I ſhall have that peculiar anxiety for you on this event, as if you conſidered it to your injury, or if it had happened contrary to your minds. If any ſhould conſider this as an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of rejoicing, I would not wiſh unneceſſarily to diſturb their feelings; Yet in faithfulneſs to God, and your ſouls, and to the good of Chriſt's kingdom among you, in future, I think it my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to tell you, you are as ſheep without a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd; and if it be better than while I was your paſtor, yet it is ſtill a dangerous ſtate, and hath ever been found to be ſuch, in every age of the church, and is conſidered ſuch by the great Head of the church; and an inſenſibility of it greatly increaſeth the danger. If you would ſupport the character of a real Church of the Glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, let me tell you, your troubles are not likely to end this day. I think myſelf ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſtate of this Church, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſtate of our land, as to foreſee you are in danger from every quarter. Within, you are

expoſed by at leaſt the remains of an evil heart, by which means, when you would do good, evil will be preſent with you. Want of a thorough knowlege of the path of duty may alſo expoſe you to go aſtray. A ſubtle adverſary who will appear in almoſt every ſhape will beſet you: at times he will appear as an angel of light, full of love and zeal for religion, with ſome fatal error under a ſecret cover: at other times he will bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attack ſome eſſential and fundamental truth, to which, for want of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                        <p>I muſt, to be faithful, tell you that many falſe teachers, flatterers, corruptors of the word of God, and men pleaſers, are gone out into the world, of whom let me beſeech you, beware; for in your deſtitute ſtate, you will be apt to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted with theſe intruders.</p>
                        <p>Let me then, my brethren, recommend to you the holy Scriptures for your conſtant guide; and intreat you earneſtly and ſincerely, to look to the great head of the church for his ſpirit to lead you into a clear diſcernment and true underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his holy word, and that he would prepare your hearts, readily and conſtantly, to keep and do all things which he hath commanded: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit yourſelves, as individuals and as a church, to God's holy and conſtant aſſiſtance and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; implore his conſtant preſence and care over you, and lean not to your own underſtanding and ſufficiency. You need to be conſtantly on your guard, and much on your knees, before God, for his conſtant protection, to ſecure you from the errors and miſchiefs to which you are

In a word, take the direction of the great apoſtle to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and may the God of Love and Peace be with you: and when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, may we meet our glorious Lord and final Judge with acceptance.

Many of you have been particularly kind to me; from whom I have received many favors, and for whom I have ever had, and ſtill have, a very tender regard.</p>
                        <p>I am now to take my leave of you as your guide in your ſpiritual and eternal concerns. It ſenſibly affects me on this occaſion, that my paſt labours have, to appearance, been without ſaving benefit to your precious and immortal ſouls; that after all, I muſt leave you as I found you, with regard to your eternal ſalvation. With reſpect to ſome of you, according to the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, your glaſs is almoſt run; only a few ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

That I muſt leave you is decided: but how ſhall I leave you thus? how can I take my leave of you in this your condition; to meet you hereafter, O dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thought! on the left hand of the final Judge? to have thoſe truths which you have heard from me, bear witneſs againſt you at the great tribunal! O my friends, think on the ſcenes before you; think on your preſent condition, and on that of your families, your dear children, whoſe preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and immortal ſouls, as well as your own, ſhould be your ſpecial care. Think on your preſent ſtate, as ſinners, and the ſubject of the endleſs curſe of God's law. Think on the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous goſpel, which brings ſalvation to every true penitent. Think on the ſhort and uncertain time of your probation and opportunity of obtaining pardon, and the favor of God by Jeſus Chriſt. Realize the final judgment to yourſelves, and the eternity to follow. Let theſe ſubjects ever be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a place in your minds, and in your hearts. I may—I am allowed this once, as the laſt time, to warn and invite you to be reconciled to God by Jeſus Chriſt: "Behold then to day, after ſo long time, as it is ſaid, to day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts." Now then my friends, let religion be your great, your chief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, in what of your lives remain, that ſo our meeting at laſt, before the tribunal of our final Judge, may be joyful and happy. Realize the religion of the cloſet, the family, and the houſe of God. Remember that without repentance you will die in your ſins, though I ſhould be found to have been unfaithful as a watchman;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035495_0018_1004E0734DD66B60"/>
and let me add, that I am confident the way I have endeavored to point out, and urge your compliance with, is that which at the great day of God, you will find, the only way of acceptance before his throne. In a view of theſe truths, and your duty, and in expectation of a moſt ſolemn meeting with you at the great tribunal, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no longer a right, as your paſtor, to urge theſe things upon you, and it being your voice that it ſhould be thus, I bid you, in this relation, a final Farewell.</p>

courſe of my miniſtry, been peculiarly inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the young? If this be the opinion of any, let me inform you, that my ſermons, if examined, will ſhew, that the youth have been often parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly addreſſed on the important concerns of religion and their ſouls. A meeting alſo for the purpoſe of inſtructing the youth, particularly in religion, was inſtituted ſoon after my ſettlement, which proved very uſeful to many, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued until it was neglected or mis-improved, ſo as to he thought, both by myſelf and others, beſt it ſhould be diſcontinued. I mention theſe things in a brief manner, to ſhew you that the youth have not been forgotten by me.</p>
                        <p>As, my young friends, you are conſidered in favor of my diſmiſſion, and as being diſſuited with me; if this be the caſe with any, or all of you, let me ſeriouſly aſk you, and let conſcience give the anſwer—Is it not the doctrines I teach, and the ſelf-denying duties of the goſpel, and the reſtraints theſe lay on ſenſual pleaſures, that have rendered me unpopular to you? Is it not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for ſmooth things, and an eaſier way to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that have determined your choice in this matter; and would not theſe objections lead your minds in chooſing another paſtor? If this be true, let me ſincerely pity you, and pray God in infinite mercy to your ſouls, to diſappoint your wiſhes: for let me aſſure you in this my laſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to you, that if ever you find mercy before God, it will be by believing and obeying that goſpel I have preached unto you. I can freely forgive all diſreſpect to myſelf; but in duty to God, and to your beſt good, I muſt tell you God
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035495_0020_1004E07C063A0650"/>
will not forgive your ſins and impenitence toward him, except you repent and believe the goſpel. My young friends, my heart's deſire and prayer to God for you hath been, ſtill is, and I truſt will be, that you may be ſaved. The little proſpects of ſucceſs among a people when diviſions exiſt, and eſpecially when the miniſter is the object of contention, has at times probably retarded my exertions for the promotion of religion among you, to a fault. It is my ſincere wiſh that you may be earneſtly deſirous of knowledge both hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and divine, and that you may obtain this object, that you may alſo be ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt; that you may indeed love God, and his glory, and the good of mankind; that when you come upon the ſtage of action, and your fathers ſhall be no more, your natural and moral virtues may be ſuch, and ſuch your bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, that you may begin that golden age pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted in holy writ concerning our diſordered and confuſed world; that your lives may be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and happy, your death's comfortable, your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and judgment joyful, and your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality glorious. Tho I now quit my miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial concerns with you for this world, yet let us remember this is not our laſt meeting, nor the laſt concerning the things which have happened ſince my ſettlement among this people: nor will you be idle ſpectators at this ſcene. You muſt account to God how you have heard and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved your warnings; and the reaſons muſt then be known why you have not repented, and believed the goſpel. My young friends, it is a good day for you to prepare for eternity; it is a
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035495_0021_1004E07EC26F17B8"/>
day of great mercy with God, for enquiring ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Then be perſuaded to know the things which belong to your peace. It is a day of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, of trembling, and ſeeking for mercy, and of obtaining in many places, with children and youth. Were ſuch here preſent, and had opportunity, they would tenderly invite you to come and ſee their glorious Lord, whoſe conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations tranſcend every joy they ever had before, or that this world can afford. Finally, my youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friends, let me earneſtly beſeech you to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for our laſt and ſolemn meeting at the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and awful tribunal of our final Judge.

As a teſtimony of my ſincere good will and concern for your beſt good, and as it is perhaps the laſt opportunity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting your future happineſs, let me tell you, though you are now young, yet you muſt ſoon die, and come to judgment. It becometh you to love and be kind one to the other; to love and obey your parents, and above all to love your God and Savior; early learn to know and to do his will. Though I may never ſpeak to you on theſe ſubjects again in this world, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you will ſee me at the judgment day, when before God, angels, and all men, you muſt be reminded of what I have now, and what I have heretofore ſaid in your hearing, on your duty to God, your parents, and to all people. And now bear it hereafter always on your mind, that you muſt be condemned before the bar of

            <p>Mr. Wildman was choſen moderator, and Mr. Hart ſcribe.</p>
            <p>The Council was opened with Prayer by the moderator.</p>
            <p>VOTES both of the Church and Society, reſpecting the Diſmiſſion of the Rev. Mr. Fowler from his Paſtoral relation to them; were preſented and read. Mr. Fowler, and a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee from the Church and Society, ſignified their deſire, that conſidering the preſent diſſatiſfaction among this People, ſaid relation ſhould be diſſolved. It appeared to be the wiſh of both Church and Society, that if the Relation between them and Mr. Fowler be diſſolved; he ſhould be diſmiſſed in character, as againſt him, they have nothing to alledge either Heretical or Scandalous.</p>
            <p>The Council having taken the matter into ſerious and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate conſideration—</p>
            <p>Voted unanimouſly—</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:035495_0024_1004E087461AF918"/>
That under the preſent diſagreeable circumſtances of this Church and Society, it appears expedient, that the partial rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Mr. Fowler and the Church and Society in this place be diſſolved. They do therefore adviſe that ſaid Relation be diſſolved; and it is accordingly Diſſolved.</p>
            <p>While we eſteem it neceſſary to form this reſult; we feel deeply affected that a Miniſter whom we believe to have been a faithful, prudent Preacher of the Goſpel, ſhould be reduced to ſuch unhappy circumſtances as render it needful for him to be diſmiſſed from his labors in this part of Chriſt's vinyard. At the ſame time, we rejoice that the Votes of both Church and Society fully clear the Character of Mr. Fowler from any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of miſconduct; and deſire him to be diſmiſſed as a regular Miniſter of Chriſt. This deſire being perfectly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant with our own opinions and feelings; we do cheerfully and cordially Recommend Him to the Churches wherever God in his Providence ſhall call him; as a ſound; faithful and pious Miniſter of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>We lament the unhappy circumſtances of this Church and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety which have led them to <hi>deſire;</hi> and Mr. Fowler to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his diſmiſſion. We earneſtly pray the great Head of the Church to unite this Church. A Society; to raiſe up for them a faithful Miniſter of the Goſpel to improve the future labors of Mr. Fowler as a bleſſing to the Churches; to cauſe harmany and love to abound among this people and finally that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
