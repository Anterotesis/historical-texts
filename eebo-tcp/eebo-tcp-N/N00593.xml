            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Solomon</hi> himself had but <hi>One Son</hi> that we Read of; and <hi>He</hi> too was None of the Best.

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Text</hi> before you, is the first of those <hi>Proverbs:</hi> and I make no doubt, that <hi>Solomon</hi> had his own, Only, Silly <hi>Son,</hi> in his Eye, when he Wrote it; the first part of the Text, his <hi>Father</hi> had fulfilled in <hi>Himself;</hi> the last part of the Text, <hi>Himself</hi> had fulfilled in <hi>Reheboam.</hi> The <hi>Gladness</hi> of a <hi>Father,</hi> over a <hi>Wise Son,</hi> and the <hi>Sadness</hi> of a <hi>Mather,</hi> over a <hi>Foolish</hi> One, is in this <hi>Proverb</hi> Declared; Nevertheless, the <hi>Gladness</hi> of the <hi>Mother</hi> as well as the <hi>Father,</hi> over the <hi>Wise Son,</hi> and the <hi>Sadness</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi> as well as the <hi>Mother,</hi> over the <hi>Foolish</hi> One, is herein Implied.

But yet it may be worth while to Enquire, Why 'tis rather the Gladness of the <hi>Father</hi> than of the <hi>Mother,</hi> that is here mentioned upon the <hi>Wise Child?</hi> Unto this I answer; 'Tis because the <hi>Father</hi> ordinarily has most <hi>Share</hi> in procuring, and most <hi>Sense</hi> in perceiving, the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of his Children. When Children are come to such <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity,</hi> that their <hi>Wisdom</hi> does become Observable, ordinarily the <hi>Mother</hi> has more dismissed them from her Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, that the <hi>Father</hi> has from <hi>his:</hi> and the <hi>Father</hi> is many wayes more capable of the Joyful Resentments, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of <hi>His,</hi> I say, <hi>His,</hi> Well Educated Children appearing now abroad in the World: the Child is now more Emphatically become, an <hi>Abner,</hi> that is to say, <hi>The Father Light;</hi> or, an <hi>Abigail,</hi> that is to say, <hi>The Fathers Joy.</hi> But if you will go on to Enquire, Why 'tis rather the Sadness of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> than of the <hi>Father</hi> that is mentioned upon the <hi>Foolish Child?</hi> Unto this I answer; 'Tis because when Children miscarry, the <hi>Mother</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> Grieving the Heart of a Parent.</hi> Yea, it is a Sin, that rarely, if ever, misses of an Exemplary <hi>Retaliation</hi> here.

unreasonably Strained, especially about their <hi>Callings,</hi> or their <hi>Matches,</hi> often, like Spanish Flies, raises those Plisters on the Minds of the Sons, that the Sons can show nothing but <hi>Ill Humour</hi> after it. Or, finally, Have you <hi>Pras'd</hi> for your <hi>Children,</hi> with <hi>Effectually fervent Supplications?</hi> There is cause to judge, that all the Children of <hi>Job</hi> were such, that none of them were <hi>Lost</hi> for ever. Now, 'tis noted, in Job 1. 5. <hi>Job offered Burnt Offerings, according to the Number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my Sons have Sinned, and have taken their Leave of God,</hi> [for so I take Leave to Translate it] <hi>in their Hearts; Thus did Job continually.</hi> Have any of your <hi>Children,</hi> so <hi>Sinned</hi> against God, as to <hi>Take their Leave</hi> of Serving Him? See whether you have Prayed for them Every One by <hi>Name,</hi> Every Day, since you have had them, that it might not be so?</p>
               <p>If neither of these <hi>Two Enquiries,</hi> do Discover any Transgression in you then put a <hi>Third Interrogatory,</hi> of this Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: Whether, you have Thoroughly <hi>Repented</hi> of all your own <hi>Youthful Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness,</hi> in any kind whatever. Your Hearts it may be, have never yet been
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000723_0023_0FAA44CC6C9DE000"/>
Endamed, unto a due degree of <hi>Revenge,</hi> against all your own Sins; and so God permits this New Occasion for it; <hi>Oh! thus is the Murderer that has kill'd my poor Child!</hi> Methinks, this may Enkindle in you a fresh Animosity against <hi>all Sins</hi> wherever you can discover it. When the Ungodly <hi>Absalom</hi> was afflicting of his <hi>Father,</hi> T<hi>hen,</hi> as 'tis thought, the Old Man was awakened unto that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, in Psal. 25. 7. <hi>Remember not the Sins of my Youth, nor my</hi> T<hi>ransgressions, O Lord.</hi> Many a Godly person, had need of a Renewed Repentance, for the Youthful <hi>Iniquity of his Heels,</hi> which by their Forgetfulness they have now, even Laid at <hi>their Heels.</hi> Now, their Children afterwards are Left unto the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Same Iniquities,</hi> that so T<hi>hey</hi> may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitable Recollections Repent of their <hi>own Iniquities,</hi> over and over again.

               <p>First. A Lesson of <hi>Easiness,</hi> is hence taught unto those that are <hi>Deny'd,</hi> or <hi>Depriv'd</hi> of <hi>Children.</hi> The strongest of all the <hi>Desires,</hi> which God has Implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Nature</hi> of Man, T<hi>o Live after Death with a sort of Jointed Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in a Lasting</hi> P<hi>osteritie,</hi> is that, it seems, wherein God has Crossed you. But I am now to tell you, That your Condition in this Thing, is <hi>Easier,</hi> than the Condition of many Godly Persons, who have their <hi>Children</hi> about them. It was denounced as a sore Affliction upon <hi>Jechonias,</hi> in Jer. 22. 30. <hi>Write ye this man Childless.</hi> They that will have the <hi>Salathiel</hi> mentioned in our Lords Genealogy, to be the proper S<hi>on,</hi> of that <hi>Jechonias,</hi> yet a Son who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from Succeeding his Father in his Royal State, choose to read it so, <hi>Write this man Desolate, or Distressed.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the <hi>Childless,</hi> are <hi>Childishly</hi> enough

But I can tell you of a worse thing far away than this; <hi>Write ye this man the Parent of Ungodly Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren!</hi> and that is worse a thousand times.</p>
               <p>Are you by S<hi>terilitie</hi> Debar'd of <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?</hi> The Prophet of God has told you, <hi>That you may have a Name better than of Sons and of Daughters.</hi> If by <hi>Union</hi> with the Lord Jesus Christ, you come to have that Name. <hi>A Child of God,</hi> you have then a <hi>Better Name,</hi> than if you should be called, <hi>The Parent</hi> of never so many <hi>Sons</hi> or <hi>Daughters.</hi> An <hi>Absaloms</hi> Pillar, what is it worth? As for the <hi>Name</hi> of such a <hi>Parent,</hi> it is <hi>Better</hi> to have no such <hi>Name</hi> at all, than to have Wicked S<hi>ons</hi> or <hi>Daughters: They</hi> do all they can, to make your <hi>Name</hi> suffer abroad in the World, and <hi>Rot,</hi> and <hi>Stink,</hi> like their own.
