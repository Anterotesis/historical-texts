            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </opener>
               <p>YOUR <hi>Friendly Letter,</hi> which was publiſhed in December, 1791, I could not obtain until ſeveral months after; and have not the pleaſure of acknowledging your politeneſs in ſending me a copy; although from an apology offered by your generous <hi>brothers,</hi> I am inclined to hope it was not a deſigned omiſſion.</p>
               <p>In my other <hi>Piece</hi> I obſerved, "that it was not the love of controverſy which induced me to write." I have the happineſs ſtill to believe, that this is not my greateſt motive. And had your arguments proved our ſentiments and practice reſpecting communion, to be <hi>unſcriptural,</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent</hi> with that brotherly affection which the Goſpel requires, I ſhould indeed <q>have been a gainer by the controverſy,</q> and would have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged

                  </gap>o you for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. But after I had carefully examined your arguments, I did not find the evidence ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to produce conviction: therefore, am obliged in <hi>ſincerity</hi> to abide by my former opinion.</p>
               <p>Was the diſpute between us to be conſidered merely <hi>perſonal,</hi> and unconnected with the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of religion, I ſhould not think myſelf called upon to attempt a reply. But ſince the honour of Chriſt as Head of the church, and Law-giver in his own kingdom, and the peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of two denominations of Chriſtians are in ſome meaſure involved in this diſpute, it appears to me of importance that the ground of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy ſhould be fully aſcertained. And as you have endeavoured to lay the blame whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to our denomination, I ſhall moſt cheerfully come forward with a vindication of myſelf and brethren.</p>
               <p>In purſuing my preſent deſign, I ſhall be led to remark upon ſeveral things, which are offered to conſideration in your <hi>Friendly Letter.</hi> In doing of which, I hope to be governed by a ſpirit of candour and Chriſtian love; and can aſſure you, that nothing would give me more ſenſible regret, than to miſconceive, or miſrepreſent your meaning. In ſome inſtances I could have wiſhed that you had been more explicit, which would have relieved me from the fear of miſtaking you.</p>
               <p>It will not be expected, that I ſhould follow you in the exact order in which you have treated the ſubject; nor that I ſhould reply to all that you have written. Some of your obſervations
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:026602_0005_0FD0B60565F65688"/>are agreeable to my views; and ſome of them appear to be unconnected with the ſubject in diſpute. To avoid prolixity, I ſhall omit many things which might with propriety be urged in the preſent controverſy.</p>
               <p>You have obſerved, that with ſome degree of care you had peruſed the pamphlet which I had written: if ſo, you muſt have obſerved our main objections to free communion to conſiſt, eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, in two things; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That Baptiſm is a divinely appointed pre-requiſite to communion at the Lord's table.</item>
                     <item>2. That immerſion upon a profeſſion of faith is eſſential to Goſpel baptiſm.</item>
                  </list>
The firſt of theſe I take for granted you have given up: for you obſerve, (p. 9) <q>The queſtion is not, whether baptiſm in <hi>ſome</hi> mode be an <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential qualification;</hi>
                  </q> you alſo add, (p. 13) <q>I do not deny that baptiſm was <hi>prior</hi> to coming to the Lord's table in the apoſtolic practice. I ſuppoſe it was: and I alſo ſuppoſe their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be worthy of imitation in like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</q> Thus, Sir, he who is unbaptized; however amiable his character may appear, is <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially diſqualified</hi> in your eſteem. In this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular we ſeem to be agreed, that baptiſm in <hi>ſome mode</hi> is eſſential to a due qualification for the Lord's table. And I believe this to be the general ſenſe of the two denominations. The other objection remains yet to be diſputed; which may be divided into two queſtions: i. e. Who are the proper <hi>ſubjects</hi> of baptiſm? And, What is the appointed <hi>mode?</hi> I have ſaid in my other <hi>Piece,</hi> that we conſider "profeſſed believers as the <hi>only</hi> proper ſubjects of baptiſm;" and that
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026602_0006_0FD0B5E2E57055D8"/>immerſion is not a mere <hi>circumſtance,</hi> or <hi>mode</hi> of baptiſm, but eſſential to the ordinance. I have not obſerved in your <hi>Letter</hi> that you have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved theſe ſentiments; but what you have ſaid in this reſpect, ſhall be attended to in its place. For the preſent we ſhall only ſay, that you have raiſed a huge hoſt of <hi>ſuppoſitions</hi> and <hi>conſequences,</hi> and brought them all againſt our ſentiments, as if you were determined to frighten us out of our allegiance to the great <hi>Law-giver:</hi> but we may ſay as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in another caſe, <hi>None of theſe things move us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If I have rightly comprehended your reaſoning in favour of <hi>free</hi> communion, the moſt material arguments are the following.
<list>
                     <item>1. <q>That the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of baptiſm does not conſiſt in any one particular mode whatever.</q> (p. 10.)</item>
                     <item>2. If it ſhould finally appear, that you had miſſed the divine appointment, yet, as <q>godly <hi>ſincerity</hi> is the very SOUL and ESSENCE of conformity to Chriſt,</q> you are therefore <q>as well accepted in the ſight of God, as though <hi>your</hi> outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct had been according to the appointed mode.</q> (p. 19, 21.)</item>
                     <item>3. <q>Suppoſing that the Paedo-baptiſts are really in an error, if Chriſt does not view the error as ſo eſſential but that he will commune with them, why cannot you commune with thoſe at the table, with whom God communes?</q> (p. 28, 29.)</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe appear to be the main pillars on which your ſuperſtructure is built; and ſhall each of them be particularly conſidered. Having thus ſtated the conſtituent parts of the diſpute, we are now prepared to attend to each particular.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION II.</hi> Profeſſed Believers the only appointed Subjects of Baptiſm.</head>
               <p>IN your third part you obſerve, <q>The queſtion to be diſputed is ſummarily this: Whether, for a perſon to be baptized by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion, after believing, be an eſſential term of communion at the Lord's table?</q> Of this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you inform your readers that I <q>take the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative ſide.</q> But, my dear Sir, you have not ſtated the queſtion right: that is, if you mean to have me take the affirmative. Nor will your quotations from me ſupport ſuch a ſtatement. The paſſages quoted, and from which you make the miſtake, are in theſe words; that "baptiſm is to be adminiſtered only in one mode, and to one kind of ſubjects." That "profeſſed believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are the <hi>only</hi> proper ſubjects of baptiſm." I ſuppoſe the difference to be eaſily diſcerned. I ſaid "profeſſed believers," you ſay <q>to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized after believing.</q> The former ſuppoſes that a perſon may ſatisfy a judgment of charity, and yet be a hypocrite: the latter, that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly a believer. I conclude, that a perſon may be baptized according to Chriſt's inſtitution, and yet be a hypocrite; but he cannot be baptized inſtitutionally, without a profeſſion of faith. We are obliged by the Goſpel rule to require a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; but we are not obliged to <hi>know</hi> the <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity</hi> of the perſon who makes it.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, to ſome the queſtion may appear to be the ſame; but it is evident that there is
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026602_0008_0FD0B5E467047EB0"/>a very ſpecific difference; and, from the wrong manner in which you have ſtated it, you have gone on to draw falſe concluſions, and to ſaddle a train of diſagreeable conſequences upon our ſentiments, which will appear of no force, when the queſtion is rightly conſidered.</p>
               <p>You inform you readers, (p. 12) that we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, "not only that immerſion is eſſential to the ordinance of baptiſm, but that none are proper ſubjects of it but viſible believers." From this you draw the following inference: <q>If none are proper ſubjects but viſible believers, none are proper ſubjects but real believers.</q> You illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate it as follows: <q>For although a perſon's outwardly appearing to be a proper ſubject, may give him a right in the ſight of men, it does not in the ſight of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You will permit me here to inquire, whether you have any other method to judge of the <hi>'real piety,'</hi> the <hi>'godly ſincerity,'</hi> or the proper quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of perſons for ſpecial ordinances, but what is viſible, or in the ſight of men? If you have, it is a prerogative which we do not claim. I think, Sir, the inference grants, that they have a right in the ſight of men; and although God may know them to be hypocrites, as he is not pleaſed to interpoſe and make the matter viſible, who will dare to challenge their right, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>roceeding?</p>
               <p>That this obſervation may appear in its proper light, we will bring the matter upon trial; and, if you pleaſe, we will borrow an example from the New Teſtament to illuſtrate it by. In the eighth chapter of the Acts, we have an account
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026602_0009_0FD0B608639D0508"/>of <hi>Philip</hi>'s viſiting and preaching the Goſpel in <hi>Samaria,</hi> and of the happy effects which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That a people who had long been bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were now reduced to reaſon and religion, which was the occaſion of <hi>great joy in that city;</hi> and it is ſaid, "when they believed <hi>Philip</hi> preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jeſus Chriſt, they were baptized, both <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women.</hi>" It is alſo added, that <hi>Simon believed;</hi> that is, he <hi>appeared to Philip and others to believe:</hi> for we cannot ſuppoſe, from the account afterwards given of him, that he was a <hi>real believer,</hi> though at this time there was nothing appeared to the contrary. Now, what was <hi>Philip</hi>'s duty in the preſent caſe? It is evident that he required, as a <hi>pre-requiſite</hi> in his candidates, that they <hi>believe with all the heart;</hi> as appears from another circumſtance recorded in the ſame chapter. And although <hi>Simon</hi> appeared to him to be a true believer, yet, in the ſight of God, he was nothing but a hypocrite.</p>
               <p>It is abundantly evident, that <hi>Philip</hi> required the ſame qualifications, in order to baptiſm, that the Baptiſts do at the preſent day. It is equally evident, that he baptized a perſon, who, in the ſight of God, had not thoſe qualifications. The preſent inquiry is, whether he did right or not? If you ſhould chooſe to ſay, he did not act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his principles; this will lead us to inquire again, what reaſons could determine him in acting otherwiſe, as he did not know the heart of <hi>Simon?</hi> But as this anſwer would neceſſarily involve you in a controverſy with him, I ſhall for
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026602_0010_0FD0B5E5EFDC55A8"/>the preſent leave it, to be ſettled between you. But ſhould you give your opinion in favour of his conduct, by whatever arguments you would vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate <hi>that,</hi> the ſame will ſerve to vindicate <hi>ours,</hi> under ſimilar circumſtances.</p>
               <p>It may be proper here to attend to the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences you have drawn from the preceding ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations; i. e. that upon our principles <q>it <hi>may</hi> be neceſſary to adminiſter the ordinance of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm fifty or a hundred times to the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</q> Alarming as theſe conſequences may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you, they do not greatly terrify us: For our <hi>principles</hi> have had a practical exiſtence for <hi>ages</hi> paſt; and yet I can aſſure you, I have never heard of a perſon's being baptized <hi>five and twenty times.</hi> Nor is it common with us to baptize a perſon more than once. But if we ſhould think it neceſſary upon any occaſion to repeat it, <hi>Paedo-baptiſts</hi> do even the ſame. <hi>Some</hi> of them have become ſo liberal, as not only to <hi>immerſe,</hi> or <hi>ſprinkle,</hi> as the candidate may chooſe; but, to <hi>immerſe</hi> thoſe who have been ſprinkled in infancy, and have been members of their churches for many years!<note n="*" place="bottom">If I am rightly informed, the Rev.

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026602_0011_0FD0B60A18089680"/>baptized the <hi>ſorcerer,</hi> upon the ſame footing which he did the other <hi>Samaritan</hi> converts, i. e. up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n a <hi>profeſſion of faith.</hi> But, when <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> came to viſit the brethren at Samaria, and had laid their hands on a number, by which means the <hi>miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> gifts of the Holy Ghoſt were conferred; <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> beholding, was filled with aſtoniſhment, and proceeded to offer them money, in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this power. This conduct betrayed his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the true ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap> of religion; and expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to that moſt ſevere reproof from <hi>Peter;</hi> "Thy money periſh with thee,—thou haſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part nor lot in this matter: <hi>for thy heart is not right in the ſight of God.</hi> For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity." He was no longer to be conſidered as a Chriſtian, but under the reigning power of guilt and unbelief.</p>
               <p>Now ſhould we ſuppoſe <hi>Philip</hi> to return this way again in a few weeks, and after inquiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtate of his young converts, he is informed of the ſituation of <hi>Simon,</hi> and from the account he receives is deſirous of a perſonal interview with him:—It is agreed to,—and when the time ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives, <hi>Simon</hi> comes before him; bluſhing and confuſion appear in his face, ſhame and ſorrow mingle in his eyes; he pauſes—he ſighs!—at length thus addreſſes the ſweet Evangeliſt: "I have indeed done diſhonour to the Chriſtian name, and have given ample proof to the world, that I was a ſtranger to the power and divinity of the Goſpel: and although my admiration was raiſed by the miracles I beheld, my paſſions moved and charmed by the ſoft cloquence of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:026602_0012_0FD0B5E776D20EC0"/>your perſuaſive tongue; yet, alas! I was but in love with myſelf, inſtead of a Saviour; but <hi>my iniquity has found me out, and now appears hateful to me."</hi> He informs <hi>Philip,</hi> that the exhortation given him by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter to repent,</hi> was ſo accompanied with the divine energy, that he had now reaſon to hope that he had become a true penitent. <hi>Philip,</hi> and the church at Samaria, are fully ſatisfied, that although <hi>Simon,</hi> when he made a profeſſion, was <hi>in the gall of bitterneſs and bond of iniquity,</hi> yet that he is now become a true child of God.</p>
               <p>You will permit me here in my turn to inquire, Whether <hi>Simon</hi> can now be looked upon as a <hi>viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly qualified</hi> member for church fellowſhip and communion? or whether he is to be baptized again? I do not wiſh to anticipate your anſwer; but as it is a difficulty of your own propoſing, I think it reaſonable to give you the labouring oar; and whatever <hi>way</hi> you are pleaſed to decide in this caſe, will undoubtedly relieve us under ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, does it not appear evident to every candid reader, that we require no more, nor any other qualifications in our candidates for baptiſm, than what were required in the apoſtolic age? They required their candidates to <hi>believe with all the heart;</hi> we require no more. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whatever conſequences are fairly deducible from our principles in this point, the ſame are equally chargeable upon theirs.</p>
               <p>Agreeably to the foregoing obſervations are the ſentiments of many Paedo-baptiſt writers. I will here cite the words of one. "It is manifeſt
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026602_0013_0FD0B60B6442E9C8"/>(ſaith he) that <hi>Philip</hi>'s principles were, to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize none but what had ſaving grace, and believed with all their hearts." Alſo, "It is manifeſt that the Apoſtles did not intend to baptize any adult perſons, except they had knowledge or ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they had the ſeed of grace ſown in their hearts. Witneſs the inſtance of <hi>Philip</hi>'s baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eunuch; again, for proof, <hi>Peter</hi>'s baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cornelius, and thoſe Gentiles that believed, after they had received the Holy Ghoſt, as well as the believing Jews: So alſo the inſtance of the jailor's family. Not to multiply inſtances, it is well known, or may be well known, that faith is always ſpoken of in the word of God before bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and we all agree that baptiſm is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered to a perſon before the Lord's ſupper."<note n="*" place="bottom">Frothingham's Right to the Lord's Supper, p. 65, 66.</note> If this be a juſt ſtatement of facts, that neither <hi>Philip</hi> nor the Apoſtles meant to baptize any adults, but thoſe who believed with all the heart; and that it is well known that faith is always ſpoken of in the word of God before baptizing; ſurely the Baptiſts cannot be reaſonably blamed, for endeavouring to imitate apoſtolic practice.</p>
               <p>From the preceding remarks, you may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſee wherein you have miſtaken the matter, in charging our ſentiments with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rror reſpecting the qualifications of candidates for baptiſm. You ſeem to ſuppoſe, that becauſe we require them to be <hi>viſible believers,</hi> that we are obliged to know that they are <hi>real believers:</hi> This is evidently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in your objection, <q>That if none are proper ſubjects but viſible believers, none are proper ſubjects but real believers.</q> That every man
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026602_0014_0FD0B5E8F664A6F0"/>who profeſſes religion ought to be what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, no one will deny; but, that we are obliged to <hi>know</hi> them to be ſincere, I have never yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Were we, for fear of the conſequences, to refuſe to adminiſter either the ordinance of baptiſm, or the Lord's ſupper, until we abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew who were <hi>ſincere,</hi> I believe we ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter no more until the day of judgment.</p>
               <p>But, ſhould we allow all the conſequences which you have ſuppoſed to be true— (which will by no means be granted) and ſhould we then ſuppoſe again, that ſome imagination, more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile than yours, might ſuggeſt twice as many more—what then? Are we to mutilate or lay aſide a poſitive inſtitution, for fear of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which are very unlikely ever to take place? Is our obedience to be meaſured by our own conveniency, or to be withheld becauſe of ſome ſuppoſed difficulties? Surely not.</p>
               <p>Poſitive inſtitutions require our implicit obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the ſovereign will of Him who inſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, without aſſigning any reaſons for their fitneſs, or making a proviſo in caſe of ſuppoſed dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties. They are well diſtinguiſhed from moral precepts, by a late learned writer.

               <p>I conclude it will not be denied; that <hi>profeſſed believers</hi> are proper ſubjects of baptiſm: but the queſtion before us is, Whether they are the <hi>only</hi> proper ſubjects? When <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it aſks, <q>Whether that is any evidence that
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026602_0016_0FD0B5EA7907EE08"/>infants were not alſo baptized?</q> It will be granted that it is not poſitive evidence that they were not; nor is it that they were not anointed with the <hi>holy chriſm,</hi> or <hi>ſigned</hi> with the ſign of the croſs, or twenty other things done to them of which the 'ſcripture is <hi>ſilent.</hi>' But it is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial evidence that they were not: for, that the ſacred hiſtorians, when recording the many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the baptiſm of believers for the ſpace of near ſixty years, until the volume of inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was cloſed, and never once mentioning a ſingle inſtance of an infant, muſt look like a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign againſt Infant-baptiſm, provided it was then in practice. It is not eaſy to account for their neglecting to <hi>record</hi> a <hi>fact,</hi> on which ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, as the future peace, and order of the church of Chriſt. Nor does it appear to us a ſufficient apology for an omiſſion ſo intereſting to ſay, that the right of infants was ſo well eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed under the Jewiſh diſpenſation, that it was unneceſſary that any expreſs mention ſhould be made of it in the New Teſtament: unleſs bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is to be conſidered as a Jewiſh <hi>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In order to bring this head to a cloſe, you will permit me to inquire, Whether Paedo-baptiſts in general do not require, in all unbaptized adults, a perſonal profeſſion of faith, in order to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted to the ordinance of baptiſm? That they do, will appear from their own teſtimony. "Baptiſm is not to be adminiſtered to any that

               <p>Shall I add to this another, from a late advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for Infant-baptiſm, who has complained much of the Baptiſts for their <hi>"aſſuming"</hi> language, in calling the baptiſm adminiſtered by them, by way of diſtinction, <hi>"Believers' Baptiſm."</hi> "Whereas, (ſaith he) there is no other baptiſm adminiſtered in our churches but the baptiſm of believers, or thoſe who are accounted ſuch, either upon their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal profeſſion, or in the repute of the church, and God's gracious acceptation.

               </p>
               <p>This gentleman, from the general manner of his expreſſions, muſt be underſtood to repreſent the whole denomination; and evidently carries the matter quite as far as we do. If a <hi>profeſſion of faith</hi> be the only terms on which you admit adults to baptiſm; if, after this, they ſhould prove their profeſſion to be falſe, you are as much obliged to baptize them <hi>'fifty times,'</hi> in order to be conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent upon your ſentiments, as we are upon ours. The ſtrongeſt <hi>terms</hi> you have quoted from me are, "That none are proper ſubjects of baptiſm but <hi>profeſſed believers.</hi>" We have juſt heard, that there is "no other baptiſm adminiſtered in your churches, but the baptiſm of believers:" not will it relieve the matter for any to ſay that it is added, "or thoſe who are accounted ſuch upon their perſonal profeſſion." This is all that we
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:026602_0018_0FD0B5EBF4D87910"/>contend for as anſwering the rule: for we do not pretend abſolutely to know, that thoſe whom, we baptize are <hi>real believers,</hi> only we account them ſuch upon their perſonal profeſſion. Nor can it be conſidered as an exception what is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther added, That they are believers. "in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of the church:" for no church could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently <hi>repute</hi> a perſon to be a believer, without rational evidence, that he was ſuch. But the laſt, expreſſion ſeems to carry the matter to a degree of certainty; That they are believers in "God's gracious acceptation:" for although perſons may profeſs, and churches may account them to be believers; yet certainly God, as he cannot be deceived, will not <hi>accept</hi> any as ſuch but thoſe who are ſo in reality.</p>
               <p>We will next take notice of that very ſcriptur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al account given by Dr. <hi>Hopkins.</hi> When deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubjects of baptiſm, he ſays, "The proper ſubjects of baptiſm, if adult, are thoſe who, by profeſſion and appearance, are believers in Chriſt and true friends to him. None but they who are really ſuch, do in heart <hi>put on Chriſt:</hi> They muſt therefore be really holy, in order to put on this viſibility and profeſſion of it, with propriety and truth, which they do in baptiſm: for if they be not really ſuch, they are utterly unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the ſight of God, to be admitted to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as it is, on their part, only a piece of hypoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy. Therefore none are to be admitted to this ordinance, but thoſe who, in the view of the church, appear to be true friends to Chriſt or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in him, and really holy, and are juſtly conſidered by them as ſuch; who can judge only
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026602_0019_0FD0B60FE6602478"/>by outward appearance, and cannot certainly know the heart.</p>
               <p>"That none but ſuch, who are thus viſibly, and in the charitable judgment of the church, and of thoſe who adminiſter this ordinance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Chriſt and really holy, are the proper ſubjects of this ordinance, and to be admitted to baptiſm, <hi>is abundantly evident from ſcripture,</hi> as well as from the nature of the tranſaction, and the reaſon of things. The Apoſtles, when they firſt began to adminiſter Chriſtian baptiſm, and form a church, baptized none but ſuch who <hi>gladly received the word.</hi> When the eunuch deſired to be baptized, <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid, <hi>If thou believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt with all thine heart, thou mayeſt.</hi> This implies that he was not qualified for baptiſm, or a fit ſubject of that ordinance, unleſs he were a true believer in Chriſt: and that he could not baptize him, unleſs he profeſſed and appeared to be ſuch a believer. Hence all who were baptized, and formed into churches, were conſidered and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed by the Apoſtles, in their letters to them, an ſaints for holy perſons, believers in Chriſt, and friends to him; as thoſe who were ſaved, and heirs of eternal life; or, which is the ſame, as real Chriſtians: of which every one muſt be ſenſible, who reads the Acts of the Apoſtles, and their epiſtles."<note n="*" place="bottom">Syſtem of Divinity, Part II.

               </p>
               <p>If indeed it be evident from ſcripture, and in the charitable judgment of the church, "That none but ſuch, who are thus viſibly believers in Chriſt, and really holy, are the proper ſubjects of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:026602_0020_0FD0B5ED6408DE68"/>this ordinance, and to be admitted to baptiſm," as has juſt been aſſerted; and, that the Apoſtles, when they firſt began to adminiſter Chriſtian baptiſm, and form a church, baptized none but ſuch who <hi>gladly received the word,</hi> we can but wonder that a body of Chriſtians who profeſs to take the WORD OF GOD, as their only rule of faith and practice, ſhould blame us for ſo nearly imitating thoſe firſt builders of the Chriſtian church! For had the gentleman but now quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, been giving a narrative of the <hi>ſentiments</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> of the Baptiſt churches at the preſent day, he could not have given an account diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilar, without contradicting ſober fact. If it ſhould be objected to what has new been ſaid, that the preceding is only an account of the true qualifications of adults, it will be readily grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and at the ſame time aſſerted, that the Bible knows but of one kind of qualifications in can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates for baptiſm; it knows nothing of <hi>higher</hi> and <hi>lower,</hi> of <hi>poſitive</hi> and <hi>negative</hi> qualifications.</p>
               <p>"Neither the Forerunner, nor the Apoſtles of Chriſt have ſaid any thing on which ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction can be founded; as they inſiſted on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and faith as neceſſary in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God, and remiſſion of ſins, ſo they inſiſted upon the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of them, in order to their being admitted into the <hi>viſible</hi> kingdom or church of CHRIST.

               <p>You have endeavoured to evade part of the ſcripture evidence in favour of immerſion, by ſuggeſting that the baptiſm adminiſtered by <hi>John</hi> was not <hi>Chriſtian</hi> baptiſm. Your objections are the following. You ſay, <q>We have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuppoſe that <hi>John</hi> baptized in all reſpects agreeable to the Chriſtian <hi>mode</hi> of baptiſm:</q> But why not? Becauſe, <q>it is pretty evident, that he did not baptize in the name of the Trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.</q> But ſuppoſe, Sir, he had baptized in the name of <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednege,</hi> it would afford no argument in favour of a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>mode,</hi> or any reaſon to ſuppoſe that the <hi>act</hi> of baptizing was not the ſame. <hi>John</hi> and the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles baptized among the ſame people; hence it is moſt likely they underſtood the <hi>word</hi> in the ſame ſenſe. In ſupport of your obſervation, you mention the inſtance in the nineteenth chapter of Acts. From which you infer, That the twelve diſciples would certainly have heard of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and would not have been again bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, had <hi>John</hi>'s baptiſm and the Chriſtian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution been the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:026602_0023_0FD0B612E54CC460"/>
It appears evident that the queſtion did not reſpect the <hi>ordinary influences,</hi> or <hi>name</hi> of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt: for, they could not be believers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>former,</hi> nor <hi>John</hi>'s diſciples without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard of the <hi>latter. John</hi> expreſsly declared, at the time of his baptizing, That One ſhould come after him mightier than he, who ſhould baptize with the HOLY GHOST and <hi>fire.</hi> This was the ſubject of <hi>Paul</hi>'s inquiry, and had refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence only to the miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit, the beſtowment of which they had not yet heard. But, you aſk, <q>Why were theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples again baptized?</q> I ſhall not undertake to tell why, nor do I believe that they were. I ſee nothing in the reading which requires this conſtruction: for the paſſage before us appears not to be <hi>Luke</hi>'s account of <hi>Paul,</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>John</hi>'s doctrine and baptiſm. For it is written, <hi>Then ſaid Paul, John verily baptized with the baptiſm of repentance, ſaying unto the people, that they ſhould believe on him who ſhould come after him, that is on Chriſt Jeſus. When they heard this,</hi> (that is, the people whom <hi>John</hi> taught) <hi>they were baptized</hi> (by <hi>John</hi>) in the name of the Lord <hi>Jeſus.</hi> This concludes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi>'s account of <hi>John.</hi> The hiſtorian then takes notice of <hi>Paul</hi>'s conduct, that <hi>when he had laid his hands upon them, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt came on them; and they ſpake with tongues, and propheſied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſeem to think that theſe diſciples were re-baptized by <hi>Paul</hi> in the Chriſtian mode; but did you obſerve, Sir, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is not mentioned in the form of adminiſtration here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded? It is only ſaid, <hi>They were baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>

That the reader may not conſider us to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in the explanation now given, I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that many eminent Paedo-baptiſts have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it in the ſame light which we do. I ſhall mention but two or three, as ſufficient to my preſent purpoſe. Dr. <hi>Robbins,</hi> when ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>John</hi>'s baptiſm, has the following remark upon this paſſage; "When they heard this, they were baptized IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS; that is, they were baptized by <hi>John</hi> himſelf."<note n="*" place="bottom">Reply to Cotton's Eſſays, p. 21.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In perfect agreement with this are the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Mr. <hi>Poole, "When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> that is, the diſciples, or thoſe that <hi>John</hi> preached to, who, when they heard what the Baptiſt ſaid in the foregoing verſe, were baptized." "As for <hi>Paul</hi>'s impoſing his hands upon them who are ſaid to be baptized, it might very well be: That the twelve diſciples might have been baptized by <hi>John,</hi> and now receive the Holy Ghoſt in theſe extraordinary gifts by the laying on of the hands of St. <hi>Paul:</hi> For to what end ſhould theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, who had been baptized with St. <hi>John</hi>'s baptiſm, be again baptized by <hi>Paul?</hi>" He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adds, "It is evident that the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were only baptized with the baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> for there were none elſe to baptize them."<note n="†" place="bottom">Vid.

But I grant that <hi>that</hi> was the <hi>true</hi> baptiſm of <hi>John</hi>'s, and all one and the ſelf-ſame with the baptiſm of Chriſt; but I deny that they were baptized again." And in another place he ſaith, "Whereby alſo it is made moſt certain, that the miniſtry of <hi>John</hi> was altogether the ſame which was afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Apoſtles. For the different hands wherewith it was adminiſtered, make not the baptiſm different; but, the ſame doctrine ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to be the ſame baptiſm. <hi>John</hi> and the Apoſtles agreed in one doctrine; both baptized into repentance, both into the forgiveneſs of ſins, both into the name of Chriſt."<note n="*" place="bottom">Inſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Should it ſtill be inſiſted upon, that they were re-baptized by <hi>Paul,</hi> it will by no means help your argument, unleſs proved, that they were <hi>ſprinkled,</hi> or had water poured on them, inſtead of being immerſed. To allow that they were re-baptized, will ſtill be in our favour, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate our conduct in baptizing thoſe who have not been baptized according to the Chriſtian mode.</p>
               <p>In concluding your remarks upon this head, you ſay, <q>
                     <hi>John</hi>'s baptiſm was both begun and ended under the Jewiſh diſpenſation.</q> But, may I not inquire by what authority you aſſert this? Was there any thing in the manner of <hi>John</hi>'s miniſtry, which reſembled a Jewiſh <hi>prieſt?</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:026602_0026_0FD0B5F1E394BFD8"/>Or was there any thing in the Jewiſh <hi>ritual</hi> that required <hi>John</hi> to baptize repenting ſinners <hi>in Jordan?</hi> If ſo, you will oblige us in making it appear.</p>
               <p>If <hi>John</hi>'s baptiſm belonged to the Jewiſh diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, why were the chief prieſts and elders ſo ſurpriſingly ignorant of it, that when Chriſt aſked them, Whether it were <hi>from heaven or of men</hi>—they ſaid, <hi>We cannot tell?</hi>

               <p>But, Sir, when you ſay, <q>
                     <hi>John</hi>'s miniſtry was under the Jewiſh diſpenſation,</q> you evidently mean, that he belonged to it. If ſo, he muſt have been inaugurated according to their ritual, or otherwiſe be conſidered as an impoſtor. But do the ſacred pages any where teach us to believe, that <hi>John</hi> ever paſſed under thoſe <hi>conſecrating</hi> cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, or was ever clad with a prieſtly veſtment? Or, do you conſider him only as a Prophet of that diſpenſation? If the <hi>Latter,</hi> then the tranſlators made a miſtake when they finiſhed the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Malachi,</hi> in ſaying, "THE END OF THE PROPHETS."

But, is it not abundantly evident, that the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh clergy conſidered <hi>John</hi> as introducing a new diſpenſation? That this was the caſe, and that the matter may ſtand in a fair light, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what is written, <hi>John</hi> i. 19—25. <hi>The Jews ſent prieſts and Levites from Jeruſalem to aſk him,</hi> (John) <hi>Who art thou?

               <p>Now as <hi>John</hi> had come baptizing with water, in a way different from all the requirements of the ceremonial law, and by an authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to them, they reaſonably concluded that he muſt be <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other</hi> of thoſe perſons they were looking for.</p>

I wiſh to add two paſſages of ſcripture, as fully confirming the above obſervations. The firſt is <hi>Luke</hi> xvi. 16. <hi>The law and the prophets were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til John: ſince that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man preſſeth into it.</hi> This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation made by Chriſt, cannot reaſonably be referred to <hi>John's birth</hi> or <hi>death;</hi> but evidently reſpects the beginning of his miniſtry: for then he began to preach the kingdom of God, and to proclaim the advent of the Saviour; and men in multitudes flocked to this new diſpenſation, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the kingdom of God. The other paſſage is, <hi>Mark</hi> i. 1—4. THE BEGINNING OF THE GOS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PEL OF JESUS CHRIST <hi>the Son of God: As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I ſend my meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger before thy face, which ſhall prepare thy way before thee. The voice of one crying in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtraight. John did baptize in the wilderneſs, and preach the baptiſm of repentance for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, the Evangeliſt here calls <hi>John</hi>'s min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry <hi>The beginning of the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But you inform your readers, that it was under, or belonged to the Jewiſh diſpenſation. It will now be leſt to the impartial to judge, whether, for the ſake of ſupporting a particular hypotheſis, you have not erred from the truth. And although you conclude that every 'candid inquirer' muſt view the matter in the ſame light which you do, it is very poſſible that ſome who are entitled to that character, may differ from you.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, you have left your readers ſtill under one difficulty reſpecting the matter. As you deny
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:026602_0029_0FD0B6178007C830"/>that <hi>John's miniſiry</hi> belonged to the Chriſtian diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, you have not informed them when that begun. From the analogy of your reaſoning, we muſt ſuppoſe you begin it at the death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>You will now permit me to inquire, whether the baptiſm adminiſtered by the Apoſtles of Chriſt before his death was Jewiſh baptiſm? Or, which diſpenſation it belonged to? Or, whether to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? It is ſaid, <hi>John</hi> iii. 22—24, <hi>After theſe things' came Jeſus and his diſciples into the land of Judea; and there he tarried with them, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. And John alſo was baptizing in Enon, near to Salim, becauſe there was</hi> MUCH <hi>water there:— For John was not yet caſt into priſon.</hi> The Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees alſo heard <hi>that Jeſus made and baptized more diſciples than John, (though Jeſus himſelf baptized not, but his diſciples.)</hi> This baptiſm was cotem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary with <hi>John</hi>'s, and undoubtedly under the ſame diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>But will Chriſtians in general be willing to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that both <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were miniſters of the legal diſpenſation? And that the ordinances inſtituted, and adminiſtered by them, belonged to that diſpenſation? I ſaid <hi>ordinances:</hi> for, if bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is to be conſidered in this light, undoubtedly the ſacred Supper is to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ewed upon the ſame footing; for, this was inſtituted and adminiſtered by Chriſt before his death, and never inſtituted by him afterwards.</p>
               <p>As Chriſt was the ſame divine perſon before his death, that he was after he aroſe, it was by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and authority, that his diſciples were ſent to <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>baptize.</hi> They did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their commiſſion from the chief prieſts, but
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:026602_0030_0FD0B5F51C9D0AF0"/>from JESUS. And <hi>John</hi>'s preaching, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, were as independent of the Jewiſh diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that of the diſciples of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The authority by which <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> acted, both in preaching and baptizing, is expreſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the Evangeliſt <hi>John,</hi> chap. i. verſe 6. <hi>There was a man ſent from God, whoſe name was John.

               <p>The Jewiſh rulers knew nothing of <hi>John</hi>'s bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm as belonging to their diſpenſation; you know nothing of its belonging to the Chriſtian, and perhaps it might puzzle you both, to determine whether it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>Upon the whole, if the baptiſm adminiſtered by <hi>John,</hi> as <hi>the beginning of the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that which was adminiſtered by the diſciples of Chriſt, by his authority, and in his preſence, were not <hi>Chriſtian baptiſm,</hi> we know of none which is deſerving of the name.</p>
               <p>I have been more particular upon this point, becauſe modern writers lay ſo much ſtreſs upon it. But it really appears, that to conſider <hi>John</hi>'s miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as a part of the Jewiſh diſpenſation, is both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural, and prejudicial to the <hi>cauſe</hi> of religion.</p>

Finally, ſhould it even be ſuppoſed, that there could be a diſtinction made between the baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> and the Chriſtian inſtitution, reſpecting the form of words uſed in the adminiſtration, it would by no means affect the caſe before us. For you will pleaſe to remember that the diſpute is not about the <hi>form</hi> of words; but the <hi>act</hi> of baptizing. Hence if <hi>Mahomet</hi> had written his Koran in Greek, and had ordered his diſciples to be baptized in his name; and had expreſſed the act by the ſame <hi>Greek verb</hi> by which Chriſtian baptiſm is expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſhould we not reaſonably conclude that they baptized in the ſame mode which Chriſtians did, notwithſtanding the difference of <hi>ſaith</hi> and <hi>names</hi> into which they were baptized? Let candour judge, and I will abide the deciſion.</p>
               <p>Therefore until you, or ſome other perſon, ſhall prove that <hi>John</hi>'s miniſtry belonged to the Jewiſh diſpenſation, we ſhall confide in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Evangeliſt, that it was <hi>the beginning of the goſpel diſpenſation.</hi> And conſequently the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>John</hi>'s baptizing, may be conſiſtently urged to eſtabliſh the <hi>mode</hi> of Chriſtian baptiſm.</p>

               <p>BAPTISM, like man in his prime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val ſtate, when it firſt came out of the hand of its inſtitutor, was pure. But it has been baſely contaminated, and perverted from its original de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,

               <p>It is evident, Sir, that you and I differ, both in opinion and practice, reſpecting the <hi>mode of baptiſm.</hi> I have ventured to ſay in my other Piece, that "baptiſm is to be adminiſtered only in one mode," and that "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mmerſion is eſſential to the ordinance." You have given it as your opinion, (p. 10) <q>That the <hi>eſſence</hi> of <hi>baptiſm</hi> does not conſiſt in any one particular mode what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;</q> and that <q>it may be acceptably perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either by <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> by <hi>pouring on water,</hi> or by <hi>immerſion.</hi> In the following page you add, It may be ſcrupled whether you, or any other man, can aſcertain preciſely the apoſtolic mode of baptiſm.</q> If this be indeed the caſe, then we may undoubtedly do as the children of Iſrael did when they had <hi>no king, every man what is right in his own eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, whether the ſubject be involved in ſo much uncertainty as you ſuggeſt, is worthy of ſerious inquiry. We cannot ſuppoſe you to be confident with regard to your own mode, nor that you will attempt to prove it to be apoſtolic; unleſs you mean to emphaſize the adverb <q>

                  </q> and include in it all thoſe trivial circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances you have mentioned (p. 10): Such as whether <q>the ſubjects were put into the water backward or forward, or what length of time they kept them under water, or at what time they called the name of the Trinity over them,</q> &amp;c. But ſuppoſing it ſhould be difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:026602_0033_0FD0B61A63912DC8"/>upon ſome of the circumſtances you have mentioned, and we ſhould poſſibly miſtake one or more of them,—would any reaſonable perſon conclude, that ſuch an omiſſion would affect the validity of the ordinance, as much as to change it from <hi>immerſion</hi> to <hi>ſprinkling?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, Sir, you ſay the <q>
                     <hi>eſſence of baptiſm</hi> does not conſiſt in any one particular mode whatever.</q> What you mean by '<hi>eſſence</hi>' without, or independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of mode, or of any particular mode, appears unintelligible. For, if the <hi>eſſence</hi> of baptiſm can exiſt without the <hi>inſtituted mode,</hi> it can undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly in any mode, or without any. But by what <hi>chymical art</hi> you extract the <hi>eſſence</hi> of baptiſm from the <hi>mode,</hi> you have not yet told us. We cannot ſuppoſe by <hi>eſſence,</hi> that you mean the <hi>holy deſires</hi> or <hi>gracious diſpoſitions</hi> of the ſubjects of baptiſm: for, from the infant-condition of the greater part of thoſe whom you baptize, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed there can be no evidence of their being poſſeſſed of ſuch holy tempers. If by the <hi>eſſence of baptiſm,</hi> you mean the <hi>form of words</hi> uſed in the adminiſtration of it, then undoubtedly that muſt be conſidered valid where the due form of words is uſed, although <hi>water</hi> be wholly left out: which if we may credit hiſtory, has been the caſe in ſeveral inſtances.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> place the <hi>aſſence</hi> of baptiſm in dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in water; and had a perſon been ſprinkled ever ſo decently in any period of life, they would not therefore think him baptized; becauſe, in their opinion, to baptize is to dip, and nothing elſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Robinſon's Hiſtory of Baptiſm, p. 463, 464.</note>

               <p>Many writers on your ſide the queſtion, have endeavoured to prove Chriſtian baptiſm to have had its origin in the waſhing of Jewiſh proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes; which may reaſonably be conſidered as a Jewiſh <hi>fable,</hi> unknown in the ritual of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or any part of the Old Teſtament. A practice not to be found in the writings of <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> and <hi>Philo,</hi> thoſe two great hiſtorians, but is
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:026602_0037_0FD0B61DC4D18540"/>principally taken from writers of a much later date, and particularly from the Yad Chazaka of Maimonides.<note n="*" place="bottom">A celebrated Jewiſh writer, who was the head of a famous ſchool in Egypt, in the beginning of the twelfth century.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is worthy of obſervation, that the Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt writers in this controverſy rarely, if over, mention the baptiſm adminiſtered by <hi>John,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in ſome negative ſenſe, or to anſwer ſome ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments drawn from it againſt their ſentiments. But the waſhing of Jewiſh proſelytes is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned, as an indiſputable auxiliary to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſm, by many noted writers on that ſide.<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Lightfoot, Dr. Wall, Dr. Lathrop of Weſt-Springfield, and others; but ſcrupled by the learned Dr. Benſon, and poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by others.</note>
               </p>
               <p>A queſtion here naturally ſuggeſts itſelf to the mind; Why do Paedo-baptiſts go back to Jewiſh tradition, or forward to the death of the Saviour, in order to aſcertain the origin of goſpel baptiſm, and cautiouſly omit the firſt accounts given of it in the ſacred hiſtory? Perhaps the moſt natural anſwer is, becauſe <hi>that</hi> appears incongruous with their practice. It will require a large ſtock of art and ingenuity, to perſuade a candid inquirer that <hi>John</hi> baptized any beſide <hi>aduits,</hi> or adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the ordinance in any other way than by <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion.</hi> The particular places which he choſe for the conveniency of baptizing, muſt afford a ſtrong argument in favour of immerſion; nor can there be a very rational account given of his conduct upon any other footing. Had <hi>John</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered in the preſent popular mode, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume a ſingle caſk of water would have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for all he ever baptized!—and in whatever
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:026602_0038_0FD0B5FAE55F7588"/>place people had lived, there could have been no want of water ſufficient to baptize.</p>
               <p>In order to evade the force of this argument, many things have been ſaid. One time we are told, that Jordan was ſo ſhallow that there was not a ſufficient depth of water to immerſe, or bury a perſon in; again, that the large quantity of water was neceſſary, for the people and their beaſts to drink; again, when <hi>John</hi> baptized in Enon <hi>becauſe</hi> there was <hi>much water</hi> there, we are told that (<gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>The fact appears to be this, that <hi>John</hi>'s mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry continued for a conſiderable time, and that the people from time to time went out to hear him, and often we may ſuppoſe he had crowded aſſemblies.

It is ſaid of <hi>John</hi> that the people who went out to him, <hi>were baptized of him</hi> IN <hi>Jordan.— And Jeſus, when he was baptized, went up ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> OUT OF THE WATER.<note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. iii. 6, 16.

               <p>Now, Sir, can any perſon compare theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts for a moment, and not ſee the manifeſt agreement in the <hi>action</hi> of <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Philip.</hi> Let the rite be performed in what mode ſoever, it is evident it was the <hi>ſame</hi> in the people whom <hi>John</hi> baptized, and in the Saviour, and in the eunuch. You obſerve in this laſt inſtance, there is <q>no account of any particular mode whatever.</q> I muſt take the liberty here, again to diſſent from you: for, I conclude it is a very particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the mode of plunging. Were you to be informed by a perſon of your acquaintance, that he ſaw a miniſter who was a ſtranger to him, go down into the water with a candidate, and that he baptized him, and that they came up out
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:026602_0041_0FD0B62085848D48"/>of the water,—I am perſuaded, without heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you would conclude that they were Baptiſts; and the account here given would decide the point in your mind, and perhaps in any other perſon's, in what <hi>mode</hi> the ordinance was admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtered. Again, if inſtead of ſaying they went down both into the water, it had been ſaid that the candidate aſcended, or was carried up the pulpit ſtairs, (which is now the cuſtom in many places) it would afford a ſtrong preſumption in favour of affuſion.</p>
               <p>You obſerve the inſtance abovementioned is the only one, <q>recorded in ſcripture, of going to a river, pond, pool, or brook, to baptize with Chriſtian baptiſm.</q> Sir, you will pleaſe alſo to obſerve, that this is the only inſtance recorded, after the death of the Saviour, in which the <hi>act</hi> of baptizing is deſcribed; and here it evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes immerſion.</p>
               <p>But you ſay, <q>If we admit, according to out tranſlation, that they both of them went down <hi>into</hi> the water, this is no evidence that either of them were plunged all under water. You will not ſuppoſe, that this text is a proof that <hi>Philip</hi> went all under water. But why not? If going into the water proves immerſion, it proves that <hi>both</hi> were immerſed; for they went down both into the water.</q> To ſome of your readers, this criticiſm does not appear in the moſt logical light; for no perſon ever ſuppoſed, that for <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>eunuch</hi> to go into the water up to the <hi>knees</hi> or <hi>loins,</hi> would be to immerſe either; but when they had got into the water, there was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſomething done to one, that was not to
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:026602_0042_0FD0B5FDE7739FE8"/>the other; i. e. <hi>Philip</hi> baptized or <hi>immerſed</hi> the eunuch; but <hi>he</hi> did not baptize <hi>Philip.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the ſake of immerſing the eunuch, they went both into the water, as that could not be conſiſtently performed without. In this light their going <hi>into the water</hi> will appear rational; but in every other view, totally inconſiſtent. Had the object been only to <hi>ſprinkle</hi> the eunuch, this could have been performed at the water ſide, without going down into it; yea, probably it might have been done decently in the chariot: for it is moſt reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that a perſon of his diſtinction and equipage would not travel that deſert country, without ſome veſſels to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and convey water, when he came to it; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he meant to ſerve himſelf in the way that <hi>Gideon</hi>'s men did.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, does it not appear to be the moſt eaſy and natural conſtruction of the paſſage, to ſuppoſe the baptiſm of the eunuch to be an immerſion? I might here, if neceſſary, produce a cloud of witneſſes from Paedo-baptiſt expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, full to my purpoſe; but I omit them for the preſent. And although I would not addreſs you in that full ſtrain of aſſurance, which the great Apoſtle did king Agrippa, yet I may mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly inquire, <hi>Believeſt thou not theſe things thyſelf? yea, I doubt not but thou believeſt.</hi>

               <p>You take notice of this as a ſingle inſtance, in which Chriſtian baptiſm has the <hi>appearance</hi> of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion.

<pb n="43" facs="unknown:026602_0043_0FD0B621E4E7C8D0"/>Surely you could not. You might as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſuppoſe, that where <hi>circumciſion</hi> is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the <hi>act</hi> not formally deſcribed, that it was performed upon a different part, or in a different way from what the inſtitution pointed out, as, that baptiſm was adminiſtered in a <hi>different mode</hi> from the ſpecimens given of it.</p>
               <p>It may be profitable here to reflect upon the ſubject a moment, and put a few circumſtances together, which may afford ſome light in the preſent caſe.</p>
               <p>When <hi>John,</hi> that bright morning ſtar, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to give knowledge of ſalvation, he came to prepare the way, and proclaim the approach of the Sun of righteouſneſs. In order to this, he came preaching repentance for the remiſſion of ſins, and baptizing with (or <hi>in</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The prepoſition <hi>to</hi> might perhaps be better rendered <hi>in,</hi> as it is Matt. xii. 41. and many other places.</note>) water. The manner in which <hi>John</hi> baptized is ſo particularly deſcribed, that very few Chriſtians, of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, have doubted its being by immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This was the beginning of the inſtitution; therefore it was proper to deſcribe it. The act was performed in Jordan. But, as the Baptiſt had informed the people, that there would come one after him mightier than he, who ſhould bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize with the Holy Ghoſt and fire,—therefore, to avoid the danger of a miſtake which might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be made from this, in ſuppoſing that Chriſt, when he came, would introduce a different <hi>mode</hi> of baptiſm from what <hi>John</hi> practiſed,—we are expreſsly told, not only that he was baptized by <hi>John,</hi> but that it was adminiſtered in the ſame
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:026602_0044_0FD0B5FF9AC78B88"/>way to him, as to the people. He, alſo, <hi>was baptized in Jordan, and came up ſtraightway out of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After Jeſus had paſſed in triumph through the dark domains of death, he came to his diſciples veſted with all power in heaven and earth, and enlarged their commiſſion, and ſent them to preach to Gentiles as well as Jews; with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command, to baptize in the name of the triune God. Now, leſt we ſhould look for ſoma alteration in the mode of baptiſm, it is again ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified, and here we ſee it to be the ſame as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; <hi>Philip</hi> and the candidate go down into the water, he is baptized, and they come up again out of it. Thus we ſee the baptiſm adminiſtered by <hi>John,</hi> in the beginning of the Chriſtian diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, before Chriſt began his perſonal miniſtry; and that adminiſtered to Chriſt himſelf; and that adminiſtered after he gave the great commiſſion, as to the <hi>mode,</hi> were uniformly the ſame.</p>
               <p>From this, we think it r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Incompetent as this evidence may appear to you, we think it a ſufficient anſwer to your queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein you aſk by what authority we make immerſion eſſential to baptiſm, &amp;c.

Although what has been offered may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as ample proof of the queſtion in diſpute, yet being deſirous of giving you full ſatisfaction, I ſhall proceed to lay before you one conſideration more, which appears to us of conſiderable weight in the preſent caſe; and that is, the native ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the <hi>Greek</hi> verb, (<gap reason="foreign">

We are fully ſenſible at the ſame time, that this ſenſe has been controverted by many men of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent abilities; notwithſtanding, we think the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence greatly preponderates in our favour.

This kind of evidence I conclude you can have no reaſonable objection to, becauſe you cannot ſuſpect them of any deſign againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor will they make any conceſſions to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents which they oppoſe, further than truth obliges them to; therefore, I may ſay of their evidence in the preſent caſe, as <hi>David</hi> did of <hi>Goliah</hi>'s ſword, <hi>there is none like it.</hi>

               <p>If you pleaſe, we will now look at the ancient <hi>Helvetia Confeſſion,</hi> firſt written in the year 1536, by or under the direction of <hi>Bucer,</hi> ten years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the death of <hi>Luther,</hi> and afterwards publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again by the paſtors of <hi>Zurich,</hi> in 1566: In which we have the following unequivocal decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: "Baptiſm was inſtituted and conſecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, and the firſt that baptized was <hi>Jehn,</hi> who DIPPED CHRIST IN THE WATER IN <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan;</hi> from him it came to the Apoſtles, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo did baptize with water."</p>
               <p>The Confeſſion of <hi>Saxony,</hi> written by <hi>Melancthon,</hi> in the year 1551, perfectly agrees with the above; I will now tranſcribe it.

               <p>The above quotations are all made from Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-baptiſt writers, to which I wiſh to add one obſervation from a late learned hiſtorian:—"A linguiſt (ſays he) determines himſelf by his own knowledge of the Greek language, and an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate man, by the beſt evidence he can obtain

               <p>"To the latter it is ſufficient to obſerve, that the word is confeſſedly <hi>Greek,</hi> that native Greeks muſt underſtand their own language better than foreigners, and that they have always baptized, and do yet baptize, by immerſion. This is an authority for the meaning of the word infinitely preferable to that of European lexicographers; ſo that a man, who is obliged to truſt human teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, and who baptizes by immerſion, becauſe the Greeks do, underſtands a Greek word exactly as the Greeks themſelves underſtand it; and in this caſe the Greeks are unexceptionable guides, and their practice is in this inſtance ſafe ground of action."<note n="*" place="bottom">Robinſon's Hiſt, of Baptiſm, p. 5, 6.</note> This laſt remark is confirmed by Dr. Wall, who aſſures us that "The <hi>Greek</hi> church, in all the branches of it, in Europe, Aſia, Egypt and Ethiopia, has always preſerved the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of <hi>dipping</hi> infants in baptiſm, that were in health, and able to bear it."<note n="†" place="bottom">Defence of Hiſt, of Infant-baptiſm, p. 148.</note> By the term <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,</hi> we muſt underſtand from the time when they firſt began to baptize infants.</p>

I conclude, if human teſtimony can eſtabliſh any point, we muſt allow, from the diſintereſted nature of the evidence now conſidered, that the native ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the Greek verb <hi>Baptizo,</hi> (which muſt determine the proper ſenſe of our Engliſh word to baptize) to be fairly ſettled.</p>

Should it be objected that any, or all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons above quoted, held, notwithſtanding, that baptiſm might be lawfully adminiſtered, either by <hi>pouring</hi> or <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> in ordinary, or at leaſt in particular caſes; this would by no means invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date their evidence, with reſpect to the point in hand; it would only prove them inconſiſtent with themſelves, and that they ſuppoſed that they had a right to depart from the inſtituted way, and adopt one which, in their view, appeared better calculated to ſerve the intereſts of religion.</p>
               <p>Should we ſuppoſe a number of perſons, of eſtabliſhed veracity, to appear before a court of judicature, to give evidence upon oath in a certain caſe, and they ſhould all jointly agree in confirming a particular fact; but at the ſame time ſhould add, that it was their <hi>opinion,</hi> that there might be other circumſtances connected with the atteſted fact, which, if true, would be equally important to the caſe in hand, although they could not be poſitively proved;—no perſon would be at a loſs how to decide a caſe of this nature, nor would he put this ſuppoſititious evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon an equal footing with <hi>ſober fact,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he were governed by intereſt or prejudice.</p>

We have alſo heard the teſtimony of ſeveral celebrated writers, in eſtabliſhing the meaning of the word to <hi>baptize.</hi> Theſe declarations, taken from Paedo-baptiſts, muſt always remain in our favour, notwithſtanding all that may be ſaid of their practiſing in a different way.</p>
               <p>Hence we conceive that immerſion, as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed mode of baptiſm, has been fairly made out, both from ſcripture and reaſon, and from the full conceſſions of the writers upon your own ſide. And if what has now been ſaid, ſhould not convince you or any of your brethren, yet it will undoubtedly ſuggeſt ſome of our reaſons for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from you in our practice.</p>
               <p>If the mode of applying the water of baptiſm be indifferent, then the diſpute is at an end; but, if it be important, the neceſſity of one condemns the other. But to me it appears inconſiſtent to ſuppoſe, that there can be a poſitive command, and the <hi>mode</hi> of our obedience be indifferent: for this at once takes off the authority of the command. Yet here, Sir, we have not the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to be agreed in opinion: for you ſuppoſe the matter to be indifferent, and attempt to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate it by the poſture of the body in prayer. But a moment's reflection muſt convince you, that the caſes are not parallel. The poſture of the body makes no part of prayer, any more than the place does where the man is when he prays: for prayer is properly a mental exerciſe, and not immediately connected with any poſition of the body whatever. But this can by no means be ſaid of the application of water in baptiſm: for this makes a material part of the ordinance, and is eſſential to its very exiſtence.</p>

If the inſtitution require no more than to ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle a few drops of water in the face, any perſon muſt be ſtrangely ſuperſtitious to be immerſed.

               <p>From a careful retroſpection of the arguments made uſe of in the courſe of this lengthy Section, the candid will be able to judge, whether we are unreaſonable, in ſaying that <hi>immerſion</hi> is eſſential to the right adminiſtration of the ordinance. That I have not exaggerated ſober fact, will be made evident by a quotation which I ſhall now ſubjoin. Dr. <hi>Wall,</hi> who has before been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was ſo highly eſteemed by the Engliſh clergy for his learning and zeal in defending Infant-baptiſm, that in a general convocation, Feb. 9, 1706, they paſſed the following vote; "Ordered, That the thanks of this houſe be given to Mr. <hi>Wall,</hi> Vicar of Shoreham in Kent, for the learned and excellent book he hath lately written concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infant-baptiſm." Yet not withſtanding this gentleman's profound learning, and all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages he had derived from his painful reſearch into the remoteſt depths of antiquity, to procure materials of defence,—he was obliged to acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, that Dr. <hi>Gale</hi> had drawn him into a diſpute upon the mode of baptiſm, "wherein (ſaith he) <hi>he</hi> knew, that the examples of ſcripture and other antiquity, and the full perſuation of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and of all the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> church to this day, is on his ſide; and I had the diſadvantage to plead for a way of baptiſm, of which the beſt I could ſay, was, that it was ſufficient for the eſſence of baptiſm; but could not deny the other (except in the caſe of danger of health) to be the fitteſt."<note n="*" place="bottom">Defence of the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Upon the whole, this much is certain, that there is neither expreſs command, or example, either in the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or in the goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to ſprinkle water upon new-born infants, as an initiating feal of any covenant whatever.<note n="*" place="bottom">The male children of the Jews were to be circumciſed on the eight day, by divine appointment; but paſt the middle of the third century, the honeſt Biſhop <hi>Fidus</hi> wrote to <hi>Cyprian</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> too know whether children might be baptized before they were eight days old; for by his Bible he could not tell.

               <p>MUCH has been already ſaid upon the mode of baptiſm; but as it is evidently a conſtituent part in the preſent <hi>diſpute,</hi> it appears neceſſary to ſet it in the cleareſt light. Hence
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:026602_0054_0FD0B62AE434E7D8"/>we ſhall proceed to conſider the practice of the ancient Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>The primitive Chriſtians not only underſtood the word in the ſenſe for which we plead, but they practiſed accordingly. This has been touched upon already, but will be more fully illuſtrated in what follows.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Cave,</hi> who wrote about a hundred and twenty years ago, (not particularly as a diſputant, but as a hiſtorian) in deſcribing the religion of the fathers, after mentioning ſeveral things which they connected with baptiſm, he ſaith; "The action having proceeded thus far, the party to be baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was wholly <hi>immerſed</hi> or put under water, which was the almoſt univerſal cuſtom of thoſe times, whereby they did more notabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and significantly expreſs the <hi>three great ends</hi> and effects of baptiſm; for as in immerſion there are in a manner three ſeveral acts, the <hi>putting</hi> the perſon into the water, his <hi>obiding</hi> there for a little time, and his <hi>riſing</hi> again: ſo by theſe were repreſented <hi>Chriſts death, burial,</hi> and <hi>reſurrection</hi> to a new courſe of life. By the perſon's being put into the water, was live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented the putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh;—by his abode under it, which was a kind of burial in the water, his entering upon a ſtate of death or mortification; like as Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for ſome time under the ſtate or power of death; therefore as many as are baptized into Chriſt, are ſaid to be baptized into his death, and to be buried with him by baptiſm into death, that the old man being crucified with him, the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth he might not ſerve ſin; for he that is dead is freed
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:026602_0055_0FD0B651269F7380"/>from ſin, as the Apoſtle clearly explains the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this rife.

               <p>The words of Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> are very ſimilar to the above; "We Chriſtians (ſaith he) who by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm were admitted into all the kingdom and church of Chriſt, were baptized into a ſimilitude of his death; we did own ſome kind of death by being BURIED UNDER WATER; which being buried with him, i. e. in conformity to his burial, as a confeſſion of our being dead, was to ſignify, that as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead into a glorious life with his Father, even ſo we, being raiſed from our typical death and <hi>burial</hi> in baptiſm, ſhould lead a new ſort of life, wholly different from our former, in ſome approaches towards that heavenly life that Chriſt is riſen to."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Paraphraſe on Rom. vi. 3, 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Burkit</hi> alſo, fully acknowledges this to be the practice of the ancient church, when he ſays, "The Apoſtle no doubt alludes to the ancient manner and way of baptizing perſons in thoſe hot countries, which was by immerſion, or putting them under water for a time, and then raiſing them up again out of the water; which riſe had alſo a myſtical ſignification, repreſenting the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of our old man ſin in us, and our reſurrection to newneſs of life."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Expoſitory Notes on Rom. vi. 4.</note> Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s words are near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly verbatim.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Pol. in loc.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But, Sir, you are ſenſible that very few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors have written concerning the practice of
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:026602_0056_0FD0B62C64F5CEA8"/>the firſt Chriſtian church, who have not acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged, that it was the almoſt univerſal cuſtom of thoſe times to baptize by <hi>immerſion.</hi> This fact will manifeſt itſelf as we proceed.</p>
               <p>You will undoubtedly recollect, that the firſt inſtances to be met with in ancient hiſtory, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they pretended to baptize otherwiſe than by immerſion, were in caſes of ſuppoſed <hi>neceſſity;</hi> and conſidered even in thoſe caſes as not fully anſwering the inſtitution.</p>
               <p>The baptizing of <hi>ſick</hi> or <hi>dying</hi> perſons by affu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, originated in the third century<note n="*" place="bottom">Robinſon's Hiſt. p. 449.</note> (a period fruitful of religious inventions) and had its found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in error.</p>
               <p>Several things united in bringing it into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence: as 1. Miſconſtruing that paſſage of the Apoſtle, where it is ſaid, <hi>If they who have once been enlightened,</hi> (which at this time, by many, was underſtood of baptiſm) <hi>ſhall fall away, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to renew them again to repentance.</hi> This led <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and many other ſerious perſons, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay their baptiſm until near the cloſe of life. 2. Another ſentiment equally erroneous aroſe, from a miſapplication of the words of Chriſt —<hi>Except a man be born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> Thus on the one hand, they fearing a fatal relapſe after baptiſm, and on the other, (as Dr. <hi>Cave.</hi> obſerves) "Not daring to paſs into another world without this <hi>badge</hi> of their initiation into Chriſt,—they preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſignified their earneſt deſire to be baptized, which was accordingly done, as well as the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of a ſick bed would permit. Theſe were
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:026602_0057_0FD0B652CF7A5378"/>called <hi>Clinici,</hi> (of whom there is frequent mention in the ancient writers of the church) becauſe bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized as the lay along in their beds." "This (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues the Doctor) was accounted a leſs <hi>ſolemn</hi> and perfect kind of baptiſm; partly becauſe it was done not by <hi>immerſion,</hi> but by <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> partly becauſe perſons were ſuppoſed at ſuch a time to deſire it chiefly out of fear of death."<note n="*" place="bottom">Primitve Chriſtianity, Part I.

               <p>We have a fair ſpecimen of this in the inſtance of <hi>Novatus,</hi> the Greek philoſopher.<note n="†" place="bottom">Sometimes called <hi>Novatianus.</hi>
                  </note> According to <hi>Euſebius,</hi> "He fell into a grievous diſtemper, and it being ſuppoſed that he would die immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, he received baptiſm (being <hi>beſprinkled</hi> with water) on the bed whereon he lay: <hi>(if that can be called baptiſm).</hi>"<note n="‡" place="bottom">De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l. Hiſt. Lib. vi. C. xliii. p. 113.</note> Thus it appears, that this ancient father will hardly allow <hi>ſprinkling</hi> to be <hi>called</hi> baptiſm. This took place near the middle of the third century, and ſerves to ſhow in what light <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> even in <hi>caſes of neceſſity,</hi> was view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that day.</p>
               <p>It may afford us further light in our preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, to conſider the caſe of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> He has generally been honoured as the firſt Chriſtian Emperor. But if according to your argument, a man is not to be conſidered as a Chriſtian with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out baptiſm, then he muſt be looked upon as a <hi>heathen,</hi> long after he fought under the <hi>banner of
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:026602_0058_0FD0B62DF97240C8"/>the croſs.</hi> And conſequently, muſt be conſidered as a Chriſtian but a few hours before his death. But, to ſuppoſe this, is to ſuppoſe, that baptizing a man makes him a Chriſtian, which is too abſurd to be admitted in this enlightened period. We may as well argue that the <hi>epelette</hi> worn by an <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,</hi> is what makes him an officer; as, that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm makes the perſon baptized a Chriſtian. Whereas a perſon muſt be an officer before he can have any right to wear the <hi>badge;</hi> ſo a perſon ought to be a Chriſtian, before he takes upon him the ſacred badge of <hi>that</hi> profeſſion.</p>
               <p>It appears that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Chriſtian doctrine in the beginning of his reign, which continued upwards of thirty years; but he was not baptized until a little before his death.<note n="*" place="bottom">He was proclaimed Emperor in the 1ſt year of the 271 Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad, or A. D. 305.</note> Being at this time in an ill ſtate of health, he repaired to the warm baths at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> but his complaints increaſing, he went from thence to <hi>Helenopolis,</hi> and from thence to the ſuburbs of <hi>Nicomedia;</hi> where he called the Biſhops together, and ſpake to them in the following manner. "This was the time long ſince hoped for by me, when I thirſted and prayed, that I might obtain ſalvation in God. This is the hour, wherein even we may alſo enjoy that ſeal which confers immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. —I had heretofore taken a reſolution of doing this in the ſtream of the <hi>river Jordan,</hi> where our Saviour himſelf, in likeneſs to us, is recorded to have partaken of the laver."<note n="†" place="bottom">Euſeb.

It is a given point that he was baptized by immerſion; but, if it had then been conſidered as a matter of ſuch indifferency, as is plead for in the preſent day, he would undoubtedly have excuſed himſelf from going <hi>into</hi> the water, in his ill ſtate of health.</p>
               <p>This inſtance muſt carry a degree of evidence to every unprejudiced mind, in favour of immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: for in this we have the opinion of this great man, in what <hi>mode</hi> the Saviour was baptized; and of his determination to <hi>imitate</hi> him in it, both as to the manner and place.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is abundantly evident, that many perſons who were born of Chriſtian parents, and educated in the Chriſtian faith, were not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized until they came to <hi>adult</hi> years, and made a perſonal profeſſion.

                        <hi>Helena,</hi> the mother of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> was a very devout and zealous Chriſtian, yet he was not baptized upon her faith.

In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this, the reader is deſired to call to mind what has already been ſaid, that ſprinkling firſt made its appearance in <hi>Africa,</hi> in the third century, in favour of <hi>Clinicks</hi> or bed-ridden peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But even African Catholics derided it, and reputed it no baptiſm, or at leaſt a very imperfect one.<note n="*" place="bottom">Jo. Andreae Boſii de clinicis exercit. Hiſt.

Sprinkling in theſe caſes, appears to have been in uſe ſeveral centuries before pouring was ever practiſed for baptiſm.</p>
               <p>The firſt appearance of baptizing by <hi>pouring,</hi> (which has occurred in my reading) was in the eighth century; when Pope Stephen III. allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the validity of ſuch a baptiſm of infants in danger of death.</p>
               <p>The queſtion propoſed to him was, Whether in <hi>caſe of neceſſity</hi> occaſioned by illneſs of an infant, it were lawful to baptize by <hi>pouring</hi> water out of the hand, or a cup, on the head of the infant? <hi>Stephen</hi> anſwered, if ſuch a baptiſm were perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in ſuch a caſe of neceſſity, in the name of the holy Trinity, it ſhould be held valid.</p>
               <p>The learned <hi>Baſnage</hi> makes ſeveral remarks on the canon of <hi>Stephen,</hi> referred to above. "Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (ſaith he) it is accounted the firſt law for ſprinkling, yet it doth not forbid dipping: that it allows ſprinkling, only in caſes of imminent danger: that the authenticity of it is denied by ſome Catholics: that many laws were made after this time in Germany, France, and England, to
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:026602_0061_0FD0B655A77B9310"/>compel dipping, and without any proviſion for caſes of neceſſity: therefore, that this law did not alter the <hi>mode</hi> of dipping in public baptiſms. And that it was not until five hundred and fifty-ſeven years after, that the legiſlature, in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Ravena,</hi> in the year thirteen hundred and eleven, declared <hi>dipping,</hi> or <hi>ſprinkling indifferent.</hi>"<note n="*" place="bottom">Jacobi Baſnagii, Monument.

               </p>
               <p>There was indeed in ſome parts of the Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian church, long before this, ſuch a ceremony as <hi>pouring</hi> water upon the head, but was diſtinct from baptiſm, and like exorciſm conſidered only as a preparation. This pouring was called <hi>capitulavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> or waſhing of the head; and was uſually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on Palm-Sunday upon the competents, as a preparatory to baptiſm.</p>
               <p>If hiſtory can eſtabliſh any fact, it undoubtedly does this. that baptiſm was univerſally adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by <hi>immerſion</hi> in the whole Chriſtian church (except in caſes of neceſſity as above) for thirteen hundred years together; and continued ſo in the Engliſh nation until about the middle of the ſixteenth century.

               <p>I wiſh to add one remark more from Dr. <hi>Wall</hi> under this head. "There has (ſaith he) no nov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty or alteration, that I know of, in point of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, been brought into our church, but in the <hi>way</hi> or <hi>manner</hi> of adminiſtering it. The way that is now ordinarily uſed, we cannot deny to have been a novelty, brought into this church by thoſe that learned it in Germany, or at Geneva. And they were not content to follow the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of pouring a quantity of water, (which had <hi>there</hi> been introduced inſtead of immerſion) but improved it (if I may ſo abuſe that word) from pouring to ſprinkling; that it might have as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reſemblance of the ancient way of baptizing as poſſible."<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 403, 404.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This indefatigable hiſtorian has aſſigned two reaſons for this alteration, which are as follow; "I muſt own in the firſt place, that many of the clergy ſeem to be of the opinion of the late biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op of <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> That the coldneſs of our climate is a good reaſon to change <hi>dipping</hi> into <hi>pouring.</hi>" Upon which he obſerves, "That our climate is no colder than it was for thoſe thirteen or fourteen hundred years from the beginning of Chriſtianity here, to queen Elizabeth's time, and not near ſo cold as <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and ſome other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where they do ſtill <hi>dip</hi> their children in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,

<p>It is ſaid by an Engliſh hiſtorian, that at <hi>Peterſburgh</hi> they ſometimes baptize their children in a river or canal, by cutting a hole through the ice; upon which he obſerves, "I have heard that a prieſt, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſing a child, (for baptiſm, is performed by the immerſion of the whole body) let it ſlip, through inattention, into the water. The child was drowned; but the holy man ſuffered no conſternation.— <hi>"Give me another,"</hi> ſaid he, with the utmoſt compoſure, <hi>"for the Lord hath taken that to himſelf."</hi> The Empreſs, however, having other uſes for her ſubjects, and not deſiring that the Lord ſhould have any more, in that way, at leaſt, gave orders that all children to be baptized in the hole in the river ſhould henceforth he let down in a baſket."— <hi>W.

                  </note> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this, with many, might be accounted a ſufficient reaſon for the alteration, the Doctor ſuppoſes the following had more influence.

               <p>Thus, Sir, from the obſervations now made, we clearly ſee what was the practice of the ancient Chriſtians; and how the alteration has been brought about.

               <p>As <hi>ſprinkling</hi> is acknowledged to be a <hi>novelty</hi> by thoſe who practiſe it, and that it was brought in, in <hi>"imitation of Calvin,"</hi> and not in "imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the baptiſm of Jeſus Chriſt,"—we do not ſee our way clear to acknowledge the validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it.

                  <hi>SECTION VI.</hi> Godly Sincerity, as connected with external Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, conſidered.</head>
               <p>IN my other Piece I have a few times uſed the term <hi>ſincere,</hi> and its ſubſtantive <hi>ſincerity.</hi> I have ſaid, that "ſincerity is not the term of communion, but being conformed to the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles' doctrine, and continuing ſtedfaſtly therein. I have alſo ſaid, that "whatever we practiſe which is not according to the will of Chriſt, is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereto; although we be ever ſo ſincere in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it." To this you reply, <q>If I rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, it exhibits a ſentiment which is falſe in its nature, pernicious in its conſequences, and a firſt principle of your miſtake reſpecting cloſe communion.</q> Sir, if your <hi>conjecture</hi> be right, we are now in a fair way to get at the root of the difficulty. You however acknowledge the firſt part of the ſentence. "that whatever we practiſe which is not according to the will of Chriſt, is contrary thereto:" This, you ſay, <q>is very plain and good doctrine;</q> but when I added, although we be <hi>ever ſo ſincere,</hi> you ſay, I preſent a difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Really, Sir, it appears to me as you conſtrue the paſſage, it preſents a much greater difficulty: for, if an act were really diſagreeable to the will of Chriſt, and our performing it in ſincerity would render it agreeable, we muſt ſuppoſe his will to be dependent on the ſincerity of his creatures; if ſo, his will cannot be a rule of conduct for us, but we muſt be governed by our own ſincerity.</p>
               <p>That we may not diſpute about words rather than ſentiments, it may be proper here to ſettle
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:026602_0065_0FD0B65924A0D0D8"/>the meaning of the term <hi>ſincere.</hi> You allow that <q>the word is ambiguous in the cuſtomary uſe of it;</q> but conclude, <q>as it is uſed in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it generally, if not invariably, implies or intends pure and upright affections of heart.</q> That it is uſed in this ſenſe in the epiſtle to the Philippians, will be granted; but, that it is uſed in ſomewhat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f a different ſenſe by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> muſt alſo be acknowledged: For he ſpeaks of the <hi>ſince e milk of the word,</hi> which being of the neuter gender, does not include affections of any kind. Theſe two, are perhaps the only inſtances in ſcripture, in which this adjective is uſed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the marginal reading.</p>
               <p>But ſhould it even be granted that the word, when uſed in ſcripture, is conſtantly uſed in the ſenſe for which you plead; will you hence argue that I am obliged to uſe it in this ſenſe? Have I not a right to uſe it according to common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation? Surely I have not mentioned <hi>godly,</hi> or <hi>ſcripture ſincerity.</hi> I have indeed annexed the adverb <hi>ever,</hi> to ſincere; which you are pleaſed to ſay, <q>extends to all kinds and to all degrees of ſincerity.</q> But have you, by the fair rules of criticiſm, a right to this concluſion? Moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly yoy have not. It will be allowed, that the term uſed will extend to the higheſt degree; but by no means determines the kind or quality of ſincerity.</p>
               <p>Should you agree to meet a friend to-morrow evening at eight o'clock, and ſhould ſay, <q>I will not fail of being there although it ſhould be <hi>ever</hi> ſo dark</q>—It might with as much proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be argued, that <hi>this</hi> included all kinds of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:026602_0066_0FD0B633F5089D48"/>natural, preternatural, moral and ſpiritual; as, that <hi>ever</hi> ſo ſincere includes all kinds of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity.</p>
               <p>To prevent any miſtake in future, I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to let you know how I underſtand the word, and how I wiſh to be underſtood when I uſe it. The plain, natural ſignification of the word ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be this—<hi>The honeſt perſuaſion of the mind, according to the degree of light in the underſtanding;</hi> and in general is to be underſtood in diſtinction from hypocriſy. Thus, a man may be a ſincere friend to the Federal Conſtitution. He may be a good man in a <hi>moral</hi> ſenſe, and yet his ſincere attachment to the laws of his country, may be the effect of his political ſentiments, rather, than his piety. Another man may ſincerely believe the xxxix articles of the Church of England, and as ſincerely believe that all the Diſſenters are wrong. I ſhall not pretend to ſay that this is godly ſincerity, or that it is not; but I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay he may be a good man, and this may be his ſincere opinion.</p>
               <p>In farther remarking upon this part of the ſubject you ſay, <q>Your words imply, that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may, in the exerciſe of godly ſincerity, act contrary to the will of Chriſt.</q> In order to make a ſatisfactory reply to this, is will be proper to inquire what is meant by the will of Chriſt.—When I uſe the term, I mean his WILL <hi>reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his word:</hi> For I know nothing of his will farther than he has therein made it known. It is a general maxim with Proteſtants, that the word of God is a perfect rule of faith and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Therefore, to talk of things as being agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:026602_0067_0FD0B65A2E356050"/>or diſagreeable to the will of Chriſt, in any other ſenſe than as they are approved or diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the <hi>word</hi> of God, is to talk merely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the footing of conjecture. Hence, Sir, if you underſtand the will of Chriſt in this ſenſe, I free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge it to be my opinion, that a good man may ſincerely act contrary to it. You may call this <hi>godly ſincerity,</hi> or by any other name that your pleaſe.</p>
               <p>If good men cannot be ſincerely wrong, or in other words, ſincerely erroneous, then all their errors and miſtakes, muſt be conſidered as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the will of Chriſt; or otherwiſe, as acts of criminal hypocriſy! But you aſk, <q>Is not godly ſincerity the very <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>eſſence</hi> of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> to Chriſt?</q> I anſwer, it is impoſſible to conform to the <hi>will</hi> of Chriſt without ſincerity, or uprightneſs of heart; but mere ſincerity is by no means conformity to Chriſt's will, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to poſitive inſtitutions. It can only be conſidered as a neceſſary qualification for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. Unden the Moſaic economy, a lamb for ſacrifice muſt be without blemiſh; but the perfection of the lamb did not make it a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, this only rendered it ſuitable; but it was its being actually offered up. So with regard to our obeying any poſitive precept, ſincerity is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to acceptable obedience. A man may be convinced that it is his duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a needy brother; and alſo ſincerely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine at a convenient ſeaſon to do it; yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain circumſtances may take place, ſo as finally to prevent its being accompliſhed. That God may approve of his <hi>ſincere intention,</hi> will not be
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:026602_0068_0FD0B635D88607C8"/>diſputed; but we can have fellowſhip in his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity no farther than we <hi>know</hi> it, which is only by his acting it out. It will be granted that Chriſt judges the moral qualities of our actions by the intentions of the heart; but he has not given this as a rule to us, any farther than it diſcovers itſelf in the action. Chriſt pronounces the man guilty of adultery, who looks on a woman crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to luſt after her; but we have no right, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the laws of God or man, to charge any perſon with that crime, without the actual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of it.</p>
               <p>I conclude, that a good man may, in one pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of its, <hi>ſincerely</hi> believe that he is acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of Chriſt, and at another, as ſincerely believe that what he then did, was never commanded, or enjoined by Chriſt; but was the mere effect of education or tradition.</p>
               <p>Nothing can bring the matter more familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into view, than the ſubject now in diſpute.—We will ſuppoſe, that in the ſincerity of your heart, you have deſired to open a door for free communion with ſome of the Baptiſts; and as <q>
                     <hi>ſincerity</hi> is the very eſſence of conformity to Chriſt,</q> we muſt conclude, in this particular you act agreeably to his will. On the other hand, the Baptiſts to whom you make the friendly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, <hi>as ſincerely</hi> believe, that it is not according to the will of Chriſt, that they ſhould commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with you in your preſent ſituation. This alſo contains the eſſence of conformity to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, if I underſtand your argument, this muſt be the concluſion; that it is the <hi>will</hi> of Chriſt, that the Paedo-baptiſts ſhould communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:026602_0069_0FD0B65BA78E09A0"/>with the Baptiſts; and at the ſame time, it is his <hi>will,</hi> that the Baptiſts ſhould not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with them! I ſhall take it for granted, that the Baptiſts do in the <hi>ſincerity</hi> of their hearts, refuſe to communicate with thoſe whom they look upon as not baptized according to Chriſt's inſtitution. If this <hi>refuſal</hi> be made with <hi>godly ſincerity,</hi> (and who will dare to ſay it is not) then according to your argument, it muſt be <q>above every thing elſe pleaſing to Chriſt;</q> equally ſo, as communicating with other denominations at the table.</p>
               <p>To illuſtrate your doctrine of <hi>ſincerity</hi> you aſk, <q>Would it be according to the will of Chriſt, for a perſon to conform to your mode of baptiſm, while he really thinks it would be contrary to the will of Chriſt for him ſo to do?</q> To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this, it will be neceſſary firſt to inquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the mode of baptiſm practiſed by us, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſt's revealed will? If not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our <hi>thinking,</hi> or <hi>not</hi> thinking, can poſſibly make it ſo. If it be according to his will, our thinking otherwiſe cannot alter it, unleſs his will is entirely dependent on the opinion of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>Again, you aſk, <q>Would it be according to the will of Chriſt, for a perſon to <hi>neglect</hi> to have his children baptized in <hi>our</hi> mode, while he real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinks it is the will of Chriſt for him thus to bring them to the ordinance?</q> 
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> If Chriſt has any where declared it to be his will, that new-born infants ſhould be dedicated to him, by <hi>ſprinkling</hi> water upon them in the name of the ſacred Trinity, it can by no means be
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:026602_0070_0FD0B63706E365B0"/>duty to <hi>neglect</hi> it. If not, it may with proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be aſked, <hi>who hath required this ſervice at your hands?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But may we not further inquire, Would it be according to the will of Chriſt, for a perſon to <hi>neglect</hi> to have his male children <hi>circumciſed,</hi> while he really thinks that it is the will of Chriſt that they ſhould be?</p>
               <p>Again, Would it be according to the will of Chriſt, for a perſon to <hi>neglect</hi> to bring his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized infants to the communion, while he real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinks that it is his will that they ſhould be brought?<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Pierce's Eſſay on giving the Euchariſt to Children.</note> In ſhort, to grant your argument, will not this be the conſequence, that every thing which a pious perſon <hi>ſincerely</hi> believes to be according to the will of Chriſt, is according to it, however abſurd or inconſiſtent it may be?</p>
               <p>You have attempted to extricate yourſelf from this conſequence, in your marginal note, (p. 24) wherein you ſay; <q>What has been ſaid does not imply, that a man always <hi>does right</hi> when he thinks he does right; nor that a man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is always acceptable to God, when he acts agreeably to his own ſentiments.</q> 
                  <q>A man may act according to his own ſentiments from <hi>ſelfiſh deſires,</hi> as well as from <hi>holy deſires.</hi>
                  </q> True, Sir; and how are we to know which of theſe govern his conduct? You have now ſuggeſted the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; but have not propoſed a remedy. If men's actions did always repreſent the ſentiments of their hearts, we ſhould not be expoſed to the liability of a miſtake; but as they do not, we may ſuppoſe that they may deceive themſelves,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:026602_0071_0FD0B65DFA7DD4C8"/>and others, with reſpect to their motives of <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,</hi> as well as any thing elſe.</p>
               <p>As you have put your <hi>theory</hi> of <hi>ſincerity</hi> upon trial, in ſome of the foregoing inſtances, we are willing to compare the matter a little farther. We will grant, that the Paedo-baptiſts, in the <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity</hi> of their hearts, believe it to be the will of Chriſt, that they ſhould give up their children to him in baptiſm; and that ſprinkling ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently anſwers the mode. On the other hand we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill allow, that the Baptiſts, influenced by the <hi>ſame kind</hi> of <hi>ſincerity,</hi> really believe that it is the will of Chriſt, that they ſhould be immerſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a profeſſion of faith (whether they have been ſprinkled in infancy or not) and that there is no command to baptize their children; but to <hi>bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi> Now, ſincerity being the very <q>eſſence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Chriſt, and under the exerciſe of godly ſincerity, they cannot act contrary to his will;</q> they are both in complete conformity to it; unleſs you will undertake to prove one of them inſincere. Hence it follows, that it is the will of Chriſt, that one part of his church ſhould imitate HIS baptiſm IN <hi>Jordan,</hi> by being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed; and that another part ſhould believe, that <hi>the baptiſm of Jeſus Chriſt is not to be imitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſtians.</hi> That one branch of his church ſhould give up their children to him <hi>in baptiſm,</hi> and thereby initiate them into the ſchool of the ſacred myſteries, without their knowledge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, at a period of life when they are incapable of acting for themſelves; and that another part of his church ſhould, from <hi>principle,</hi> neglect the
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:026602_0072_0FD0B63863623270"/>baptiſm of their infants; whilſt they conſider Chriſtianity as addreſſing itſelf to the conſciences of all; and that none can become the diſciples of Chriſt, without <hi>their perſonal conſent.</hi> How com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex! how variable, does this doctrine repreſent the will of Chriſt!</p>
               <p>But you inform us that you have <q>one more ſerious queſtion to aſk.</q> (it ſhall now be attended to,) <q>

               <p>To illuſtrate the doctrine of <hi>ſincerity</hi> now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration, you introduce the following ſimile. <q>A phyſician may, in certian circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,

Admitting, that with benevolent intention, you have propoſed free communion with us, yet if we really believe it to be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant with ſome part of Chriſt's revealed will, we cannot with the <hi>ſame</hi> purity of intention comply.</p>
               <p>But it is time to attend to the application you make from the above obſervations. You ſay— <q>Granting that immerſion be the <hi>appointed mode</hi> of baptiſm, and believers the, <hi>only</hi> proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, yet if a Paedo-baptiſt really think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and with an <hi>obedient heart</hi> offer up his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in our mode—the perſon in ſo doing, is as well accepted in the ſight of God, as though his outward conduct had been according to the <hi>appointed mode</hi> of baptiſm.</q> Granting this, and I beg to know what foundation Paedo-baptiſm ſtands upon!—If it be not ſupported by <hi>divine appointment,</hi> it can have no other origin than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man tradition; and conſequently muſt fall to the ground; unleſs you can make it appear, that your <hi>ſincere opinion</hi> is of equal authority with
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:026602_0074_0FD0B63A25DF7710"/>divine appointments. <q>

                  </gap>hat then? Why this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſedes the whole force of the divine command, and authorizes his own opinion as the <hi>rule</hi> of his conduct! And leſt he ſhould ſcruple the valid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of it, he is aſſured, that in <q>ſo doing <hi>he</hi> is as well accepted in the ſight of God, as though his outward conduct had been according to the appointed mode.</q> According to this argument, divine appointments are of little conſequence to Paedo-baptiſts, if they have a right whenever they think proper to ſet them aſide, and ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute others in their room. Perhaps the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words of our Saviour, may not be thought wholly inapplicable to this ſentiment. <hi>Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own traditions.</hi>

               <p>Is it reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that God would make appointments for his people which he did not think proper for them to obſerve? Or has he left diſcretionary orders with any man, or any body of men, to ſet aſide, alter, or amend any of his poſitive inſtitutions?

                  </q> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps this is one inſtance where you would apply it. For, if God has thought fit to appoint the mode, and deſcribe the ſubjects of baptiſm; and a Paedo-baptiſt may offer <hi>ſubjects</hi> eſſentially dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoſe deſcribed in the inſtitution, and that in a mode quite unlike the divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and yet be <hi>'as well accepted,'</hi> as though he had obſerved the moſt exact conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity

               <p>This is the voice of revelation with reſpect to poſitive inſtitutions; and notwithſtanding you have challenged the judgment of <hi>common ſenſe</hi> in favour of your ſentiments, we are willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commit the matter, and abide the impartial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. If it be not a dictate of common ſenſe, that God's commands ſhould be implicitly obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his poſitive inſtitutions ſtrictly obſerved,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:026602_0076_0FD0B63B64362058"/>without the leaſt known deviation; and that the <hi>ſincere obſervance</hi> of his appointments ſhould be more acceptable to him than the <hi>ſincere neglect</hi> of them; then, of courſe your argument will be eſtabliſhed, and we muſt conclude, that like the <hi>Athenians,</hi> in <hi>theſe things</hi> we have been too <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You acknowledge, (p. 27) that <q>integrity of heart does not render the judgment infallible, with reſpect to aſcertaining the will of God.</q>— This indeed appears to me to be true; but why then do you blame me for ſuppoſing a perſon with godly ſincerity, may act contrary to the will of Chriſt? I think it undeniably follows, that if he may with <hi>integrity of heart miſtake</hi> his will, or not <hi>aſcertain</hi> it, then he may with the ſame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs act contrary to it. But did you not tell us above, that <q>ſincerity is the very <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>eſſence</hi> of conformity to Chriſt?</q> What, in the heighth of conformity to the <hi>will</hi> of Chriſt!—and yet not able to aſcertain what it is?

As to the pernicious conſequences which you have diſcovered in it, I may have overlooked them; probably, becauſe they are not ſo high
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:026602_0077_0FD0B660E55D46F0"/>coloured as the charge. But what pernicious conſequences can we imagine from our conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to the Apoſtles' doctrine, and ſtedfaſt contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance in it?—Or from following the plain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in God's word, rather than our own ſancied notion of <hi>ſincere obedience,</hi> without exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conformity? I think you will not pretend to ſay, that I have inſiſted upon a conformity to the Apoſtles' doctrine, which did not include <hi>ſincerity.</hi> You cannot ſay it without injuring me, and contradicting youſelf.<note n="*" place="bottom">If, as you ſay, (p. 12.)

               <p>To proceed—You obſerve, that <q>it is not the <hi>enternal conduct</hi> which is pleaſing or diſpleaſing to Chriſt; but it is <hi>ſincerity</hi> or <hi>inſincerity.</hi>
                  </q> I and far from thinking that the ſtricteſt external conformity without ſincerity would be pleaſing to him. Yet, I think it reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that a <hi>ſincere external</hi> obedience to the poſitive commands of Chriſt, muſt be more pleaſing to him than a <hi>ſincere</hi> omiſſion of them. For, ſaith he, <hi>Whoſoever therefore, ſhall break one of theſe leaſt commandments, and teach men ſo, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the kingdom of heaven: but whoſoever ſhall</hi> DO <hi>and</hi> TEACH <hi>them, the ſame ſhall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</hi>

Therefore, with a little variation, I may uſe the language of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired writer; "Show me thy <hi>ſincerity</hi> without thy <hi>external obedience</hi> to the appointments of Chriſt; and I will ſhow thee my <hi>ſincerity</hi> by my <hi>external obediencer</hi> to them.</p>
               <p>Whether <hi>ſincerety</hi> departing from God's poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive commands, be as pleaſing to him as <hi>ſincere</hi> external conformity, will more fully appear in what follows.</p>

But while coming, God made known to <hi>Samuel,</hi> that <hi>Saul</hi> had <hi>turned back from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him.</hi> When <hi>Samuel</hi> came forth in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Saul</hi> met him, and thus addreſſed him:— "Bleſſed be thou of the Lord, I have performed the commandment." Although he had not gone to the extent of the commandment, yet he might ſincerely think, as he had made ample pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for one of the richeſt ſacrifices that ever ſmoaked upon the Jewiſh altar, that in thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

               </p>
               <p>This ark by divine appointment was to be borne by the prieſts, by the ſtaves which went through the rings of it. But as the inſtituted mode might appear rather inconvenient at this time, they might think the one adopted by the Philiſtines would do as well. And as they might call to mind, that "God delighted more in mercy than in ſacrifice;" both <hi>David</hi> and his people very <hi>ſincerely</hi> concluded, that it would do to carry it in a decent <hi>new cart.</hi> But the way being rough, and the oxen unaccuſtomed to this hallowed bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, ſo agitated the ſacred ark, that <hi>Uzzah</hi> put forth his hand and took hold of it. <hi>And the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>What there was, either in the conduct or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of <hi>Uzzah,</hi> which was ſo offenſive to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being, as to mark him out as a monument of ſacred diſpleaſure, is perhaps unknown to mortals. It is evident that <hi>David</hi> did not diſcover, any criminality in the conduct of <hi>Uzzah;</hi> for if he had, he would not have been diſpleaſed becauſe the Lord made a breach upon him. There was at leaſt the appearance of <hi>ſincere</hi> regard, in his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to ſteady the agitated ark. But God

               <p>This alarming providence checked their pious joy, and put a ſudden period to all their tuneful numbers. An awful fear of the great Jehovah was now impreſſed upon their minds.—Silent, and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, they retire and leave the ark without the city!</p>
               <p>Will any perſon ſay that <hi>David</hi> did not go in the <hi>ſincerity</hi> of his heart? Let thoſe who deny it, make out the proof.</p>
               <p>It may perhaps be difficult for us to diſcover any real difference in the <hi>deſign,</hi> or <hi>ſincerity,</hi> of <hi>David</hi> and his people at this time, or three months after, when they brought up the ark into the city of <hi>David</hi> with ſhouting. But, we ſhall readily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a difference in their viſible conduct. In the former, they followed their own imaginations. In the latter they went according to divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.

               <p>I have one more obſervation from ſcripture to make upon this head. If I rightly underſtand the <hi>revealed will</hi> of God, we are ſtrictly forbidden to worſhip any creature, however exalted. <hi>For it is written, thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him</hi> ONLY <hi>ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi>

               <p>Yet I find that the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> twice ſell down to worſhip an angel! I hardly think you will
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:026602_0082_0FD0B63FE48D4108"/>ſcruple the ſincerity of the beloved diſcriple upon this occaſion. The queſtion now is, whether it were agreeable to the will of Chriſt for <hi>John</hi> to worſhip the angel? It is evident he thought it to be his duty; and his conduct has every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of <hi>ſincerity.</hi> Allowing <hi>John</hi> to be <hi>ſincere,</hi> and his conduct in this particular inſtance agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the will of Chriſt, then the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned prohibition muſt be underſtood condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. "It is written, thou ſhall worſhip the Lord thy God, and him <hi>only</hi> ſhalt thou ſerve;" <hi>unleſs thou ſhalt ſincerely think it duty to worſhip a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> If it were not agreeable to the will of Chriſt that <hi>John</hi> ſhould worſhip the angel, then it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarity follows, that a good perſon may, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſe of <hi>ſincerity,</hi> act contrary to his will.</p>
               <p>If, to evade the force of this argument, you ſhould ſay, <q>Although <hi>John</hi> ſincerely thought it to be his duty to worſhip the angel, yet he was undoubtedly miſtaken,</q> this it to give up the argument: for we have always been willing to allow, that Chriſtians may be <hi>ſincere,</hi> and yet be miſtaken as to the will of Chriſt. That this was the caſe, with either <hi>John</hi> or the <hi>angel,</hi> is abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly evident. And in order to ſave your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from falling, it appears neceſſary to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, either that it was agreeable to the will of Chriſt for <hi>John</hi> to worſhip the angel; or, that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincere in attempting it. Until one or the other is made out, we ſhall conclude he <hi>ſincerely</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to do that, which was expreſsly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the revealed will of God.

               <p>In purſuing your argument you conclude, thoſe perſons differ from Chriſt, who <q>ſuppoſe, that a good tree may bring forth <hi>corrupt fruit.</hi>

I ſuppoſe the ſame external modes of conduct may be the <q>expreſſions both of holy and ſinful affections.</q> But this by no means proves, that there is no morality in our external conduct. If we are rational agents (and we certainly are) whatever mode of external conduct we purſue, muſt be our choice, rather than any other; and how this can be without morality, I am totally at a loſs.</p>
               <p>I conclude, Sir, that you will allow that eating bread and drinking wine, are external acts; but if there be no morality in them, it is hardly worth while to waſte our time in a diſpute about ſuch trifling things. I do not conclude, however, that the morality of the act is merely in maſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating bread, or in ſwallowing wine, which a brute may do as well as an intelligent agent; but the circumſtances which lead us to chooſe and adopt this particular mode of conduct, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly tinge the <hi>act</hi> with morality.</p>
               <p>Your other obſervation which I ſhall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, is the following, that <q>There is nothing of a moral nature in <hi>mere ſentiments</hi> or <hi>mere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals.</hi>
                  </q> If by 'mere <hi>ſentiments,</hi>' you mean no more, than thoſe fugitive thoughts which flutter upon the ſurface of the brain, as <hi>butterflies</hi> do in the ſun-beams, we ſhall not contend. But, if by <hi>ſentiment,</hi> we underſtand that reſult of the mind which leads us on to <hi>external</hi> acts, we ſhall undoubtedly find that it is connected with the
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:026602_0089_0FD0B66B19E97BE0"/>heart, as well as the head. <hi>The fool hath ſaid,</hi> not in his head, but <hi>in his heart, there is no God.</hi> This is his ſentiment, and a very innocent one it is, if deſtitute of morality!</p>
               <p>You will permit me to add a remark from a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſentimental writer. Saith he, "Error in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſentiment, eſpecially in things of a moral nature, is always wrong; and does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſt or originate merely in any defect of the moral faculties of the mind; but is of a moral nature, in which the taſte, affection, or inclination of the heart is concerned; and therefore is always, in ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery degree of it, morally wrong, and more or leſs criminal. Were the moral faculties of the mind, were the heart, perfectly right, man would not be capable of error, or of judging wrong, or making any miſtake eſpecially in things of religion. The natural faculties of the mind, conſidered as ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the inclination or will, do not lead, and have no tendency in themſelves, to judge wrong, or contrary to the truth of things. To do ſo, is to judge without evidence, and contrary to it, which the mind never would or could do, were not the inclination or heart concerned in it, ſo as to have influence, which muſt be a wrong incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and contrary to truth and to evidence; and therefore is morally wrong or criminal."</p>
               <p>"Therefore, all the miſtakes and wrong opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions which men entertain reſpecting the <hi>doctrines, inſtitutions</hi> and <hi>duties</hi> revealed in the bible, are criminal, and of a bad tendency."<note n="*" place="bottom">Hopkins's Syſt. Treatiſe on the Millen. Vol. II. p. 61.</note> If this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning be true, it cannot be ſaid that there is nothing of a <hi>moral nature</hi> in our <hi>ſentiments.</hi>

I conclude that the bible exhibits a fair ſyſtem of truth, ſupported by rational evidence; and were it not for the blindneſs of the human <hi>heart,</hi> and the prejudices occaſioned by <hi>ſinful affections,</hi> men would yield their cheerful aſſent to truth, in exact proportion to the evidence laid before them; and would not <hi>chooſe darkneſs rather than light.</hi> It is believed that good men, (however they may differ in opinion here) in the coming ſtate, will ſee eye to eye: perhaps not owing ſo much to the ſuperior light of truth, as to their being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from thoſe ſinful affections which oppoſe the truth. This obſervation will appear evident from this conſideration, that thoſe who have the greateſt advantages to know the truth, often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be moſt oppoſed to it. The Jews, who had the oracles of God, and conſequently the beſt information reſpecting the Meſſiah, when he was preached to them, oppoſed and blaſphemed, while the Gentiles believed.</p>
               <p>Upon ſuppoſition, that <q>there is nothing of a <hi>moral nature</hi> in mere ſentiments,</q> why is <hi>unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> a crime? or why is a man to blame for being an <hi>infidel?</hi> this is a mere ſentiment. In ſhort, why do we blame the Jews for accuſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering Chriſt to be crucified? It is evident they did not believe him to be the Son of God.

But their <hi>ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> were that he was a deceiver, and a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer; and they had <hi>a law</hi> given them by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> againſt ſuch, and by this law they ſaid he ought to die. And their <hi>external conduct</hi> was to put him to death. Now where was their crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality? You will probably ſay it originated in their hearts, <q>where all real criminality is to be found.</q> It will be granted. And did not their ſentiments originate there likewiſe? Out of the HEART proceed evil thoughts, murders, &amp;c. and not out of the head as unconnected with it.</p>
               <p>In order to apply the foregoing obſervations to the ſubject before us, we are willing to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that we do not think a man to blame, for ſincerely acting according to his conſcience, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be ever ſo erroneous. But he may be exceedingly to blame, for having an erroneous conſcience. If we do not improve the beſt means of information which we are favoured with, we are certainly to blame for the neglect.</p>
               <p>It is a maxim in civil law, "That a man is obliged to know it at his peril." This holds good with regard to the divine law. The man who tranſgreſſed the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, however ſincere, was nevertheleſs guilty; and when it came to his knowledge he was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to offer a ſacrifice.<note n="†" place="bottom">I. cv. iv. 13, 22, 27.</note> And he who killed his neighbour at unawares, without in the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning his death, was nevertheleſs doomed to ſuffer a certain puniſhment; for, to be confined

               </p>
               <p>Upon the whole, what reaſon can be given for our conſtruing the divine law differently? Or why ſhould one man ſee a revealed truth, and another under equal advantages ſhould not; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the latter be under the influence of moral blindneſs? If the poſitive inſtitutions of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are ſufficiently plain (as they undoubtedly are) why ſhould we read and underſtand the ſame bible ſo very differently? I cannot think we are both right. If Chriſt has commanded his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to dedicate their infant-ſeed to him in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, then we muſt conclude that all the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt churches are in an error in this particular. On the other hand, if the goſpel teacheth us, that with the <hi>heart</hi> man believeth unto righteouſneſs, and with the <hi>mouth confeſſion</hi> is made unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that this confeſſion is to be made by every candidate for baptiſm; then we muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our Paedo-baptiſt brethren are in an error, in not inſiſting upon the ſame viſible qualifications which the Apoſtles did. In ſhort, can it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the ſame divine law, which enjoins ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other,</hi> can approve of the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect? If not, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that if you are right, we are wrong; and ſo <hi>vice verſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is often ſaid by our opponents, "We are willing to acknowledge your baptiſm to be valid, and why cannot you be as <hi>liberal</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ours?" We are ſorry to bear the charge of illiberality; but had much rather do it than
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:026602_0093_0FD0B66C2F3CE158"/>violate our conſciences. When perſons are ſo liberal, as to be willing to divide and mangle an inſtitution of Chriſt, in order to accommodate a painful diſpute; while <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The woman whoſe the child was, could by no means conſent; but would either have it alive undivided, or elſe give it up ſo to the other: <hi>but the other ſaid, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.</hi> To have divided the child, would have deſtroyed its exiſtence: So to divide an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt, is to make it mean any thing, and every thing, and conſequently nothing. For when a divine law is ſuppoſed to be condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and is to be left to the judgment or fancies of men to determine, whether one mode of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience be not as acceptable as another, it of courſe loſes its authority, and ceaſes to be a law</p>
               <p>From the above argument it will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that one man has a right to dictate, or preſcribe a mode of obedience for another: for to our <hi>own Mafler we ſtand or fall.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the divine law is not conditional, but abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute;
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:026602_0094_0FD0B64A2359D1E8"/>and its requirements muſt be fixed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate, although we may not underſtand them. ONE LAW <hi>ſhall be to him that is home born, and unto the ſtranger that ſojourneth among you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude this Section, dear Sir, I wiſh you ſeriouſly to conſider your arguments upon ſincer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, whether you have not carried the matter too far; and whether they are not calculated in ſome inſtances, to diſſerve the cauſe of Chriſt, and to ſtrengthen the hands of error. For admitting that either you or we are in an error with reſpect to one of the inſtitutions of Chriſt, yet as your ſentiments aſſure us, that if we ſincerely think we are right, <q>We are as well accepted in the ſight of God, as if our external conduct had been according to his appointments,</q> ſhall we not be apt to releaſe ourſelves from a painful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the evidences for, and againſt our particular ſentiments; and conclude to ſlide ſmoothly on, in the good old way which our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers went; and perhaps, have no higher reaſon to believe it to be right, than becauſe <hi>they</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived it to be ſo?</p>
               <p>It is often ſaid, "When we get to heaven, we ſhall not be aſked what particular principles we were of." This objection implies too great an indifferency to the requirements of <hi>truth;</hi> and leads us to ſuppoſe that many determine to get to heaven as cheap as they can. And whenever perſons would wiſh a releaſe from the toil of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, and expenſe of retraction, they may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove your argument as a cordial auxiliary.</p>
               <p>But were we even to grant <hi>ſincerity</hi> to be a term of communion, yet ſhould we not be obliged to
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:026602_0095_0FD0B66DA5C670D0"/>fix upon ſome external acts of obedience, as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential of ſincerity? Or are we to judge a man to be ſincere by the looks of his face? Or by the tincture of his thoughts? Or are we to believe it becauſe he profeſſes to be ſincere? Perhaps the man was never yet found propagating any ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of religion whatever, who would own himſelf inſincere.</p>
               <p>If <hi>ſincerity</hi> be the only thing ſought for, and agreement in ſentiment unneceſſary to Chriſtian fellowſhip, then we may open the door wide, and receive all who appear to be ſincere, however erroneous, and by whatever names diſtinguiſhed, whereever they appear ſincere.</p>
               <p>Perhaps there is no one act in the circle of Chriſtian duty, which expreſſes more fellowſhip, than communicating at the Lord's table. And if we can occaſionally communicate together, why can we not ſtatedly? We ſhall alſo be led farther to inquire, upon what principle is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be juſtified? Why did the Proteſtants come out from the church of Rome? There were undoubtedly many ſincere Chriſtians in that church, notwithſtanding the body of clergy might be thought to be corrupt. Why did the diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers leave the church of England, and the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents the preſbyterians, and theſe diſſent one from another? It would be uncharitable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that there were not many ſincere Chriſtians in thoſe churches. Objections ſimilar to thoſe now mentioned have in fact taken place.</p>
               <p>When <hi>preſbyterianiſm</hi> was about to be eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the Britiſh government, the aſſembly of divines at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> appointed a committee to
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:026602_0096_0FD0B64B24D6A230"/>hear and anſwer the petition of thoſe who ſhould not conform to the government.</p>
               <p>To theſe the independents preſented their requeſt, Dec. 4, 1645, which was only this: "That they may not be forced to communicate as members in thoſe pariſhes where they dwell; but may have liberty to have congregations of ſuch perſons who give good teſtimony of their god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and yet out of a tenderneſs of conſcience cannot communicate in their pariſhes, but do voluntarily offer themſelves to join in ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations."</p>
               <p>To this the aſſembly gave a flat denial, Dec. 15. The <hi>independents,</hi> unwilling to loſe the privileges of the eſtabliſhment, made the following conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. "That they would maintain occaſional communion in their churches." But ſtill their preſbyterian brethren would not allow them ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arate congregations. They rather improved this compliance, to ſtrengthen their arguments againſt granting ſuch liberty. "If (ſay they) they may occaſionally exerciſe theſe acts of communion with us once, a ſecond, or a third time, without ſin; we know no reaſon why it may not be ordinarily without ſin, and then ſeparation and church-gath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering would have been needleſs. To ſeparate from thoſe churches ordinarily and viſibly, with whom occaſionally you may join without ſin, ſeemeth to be a moſt unjuſt ſeparation."<note n="*" place="bottom">Schiſm tried and condemned, p. 25, 27, 28. in Croſby.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Every candid reader will judge, whether the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions now ſuggeſted, are not involved in the idea of occaſional communion, upon the term of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. Another intereſting queſtion appears to be
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:026602_0097_0FD0B66F2611D1B0"/>connected, viz. Whether it be conſiſtent to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with any perſon, or body of Chriſtians, with whom we could not unite in full fellowſhip, as members of the ſame church? If there be any act more ſolemn, more expreſſive of unity and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, let it be pointed out! For perſons to ſeparate from each other, merely on account of diſagreement in ſentiment, and yet hold occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al communion (which expreſſes their agreement) is the height of abſurdity.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, if <q>baptiſm was prior to coming to the Lord's table in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>SECTION VIII.</hi> Whether the Divine Conduct towards us be the Rule of Duty towards our Chriſtian Brethren, rather than God's revealed Will; briefly conſidered.</head>
               <p>IT will be readily granted, that ſome parts of the divine conduct are to be imitated by
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:026602_0098_0FD0B64CDC46E058"/>all who love God. Yet our obligation to <hi>be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of God as dear children,</hi> does not originate ſo much from what he <hi>does,</hi> as from what he <hi>commands.</hi> Therefore, we are not to imitate the divine conduct, in any thing which would lead us contrary to his revealed will.</p>
               <p>There are ſome parts of the divine conduct, which it would be highly improper for us to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to imitate; ſuch as the following: <hi>He</hi> ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the eſtabliſhed laws of nature, "and held the falling day," until Iſrael had gained the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory over his enemies. <hi>He</hi> arreſted <hi>Jordan</hi> in its courſe, and compelled its waters to retire, and made a paſſage for his choſen tribes. <hi>He</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the mouth of <hi>Balaam</hi>'s aſs, and cauſed the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid brute to reprove the more brutiſh prophet. <hi>He</hi> commanded <hi>Abraham;</hi> as a teſt of his love and obedience, to offer up his beloved ſon for a ſacrifice; and it is certain he highly approved of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s conduct, and bleſſed his unreſerved obedience. I preſume no one will infer from this, that we are to expreſs our love to God by ſacrificing our children to him. God has at ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral times deſtroyed his enemies by fire from heaven; but when the two diſciples were deſirous of puniſhing the ungrateful Samaritans in the ſame way, Jeſus reproved their blind zeal, and told them plainly, they knew not what ſpirit they were of.<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xix. 24. 2 Kings, i. 10. Luke ix. 54.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Inſtances might be multiplied from ſcripture, to ſhow, that the divine conduct is not in all caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the rule of our duty; but you have ſuppoſed one, which you conclude is worthy of our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation—
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:026602_0099_0FD0B670A3599368"/>It ſhall now be the ſubject of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
               <p>You take it for granted, that God communes with the Paedo-baptiſts at his holy table; and hence aſk, <q>Why cannot you commune with thoſe at the table, with whom God communes?</q> As this queſtion was anticipated in my other Piece, you have from thence introduced the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing reply, i. e. "It is not what God can or does do, but his revealed will, which is the rule of our duty." On this you obſerve, <q>I hope, Sir, I ſhall never object to your making the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will of God the rule of your duty. But this, Sir, is a part of his revealed will, <hi>Be ye fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of God, as dear children.</hi> And if God be <hi>willing</hi> to commune with Paedo-baptiſts, why ſhould you be <hi>unwilling</hi> to imitate his example in this reſpect?</q>
               </p>
               <p>You will permit me, Sir, to inquire, whether you ſincerely think, that the Apoſtle had particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reference to communion at the Lord's table, when he exhorted the Epheſians to be <hi>followers of God?</hi> If he had not, it affords no proof for your argument. If this were his object, he muſt be underſtood as addreſſing them in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner: Brethren, God communes with you, and why cannot you communicate with one another? <hi>Be ye followers of God, as dear children.</hi> But was the church of Epheſus at this early period ſo divided, that they did not hold viſible communion together? Were there then in the church Paedo-baptiſts, and Anti-paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, who had ſet up ſeparate communions? When this is fairly proved, we ought to believe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="unknown:026602_0100_0FD0B6ACA6FFD360"/>
You go on to ſay— <q>Suppoſing that the Paedo-baptiſts are really in an error; if Chriſt does not view the error as ſo eſſential, but that HE will commune with them, why ſhould you?—Is the ſervant grester than his lord?</q> By no means: <hi>for the ſervant knoweth n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t what his lord doeth.</hi> And although he giveth rules to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to regulate their conduct by; yet he is not particularly bound by them himſelf. But you ſeem to ſuppoſe, that Chriſt commune, with you in a certian ſenſe, in which we are unwilling to. But how are we to underſtand you? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not that Chriſt comes perſonally among you, or that he actually communicates with you in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he bread and wine? If not, we muſt ſuppoſe it is ſpiritually. That is, he may own and bleſs you, notwithſtanding there may be ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in your obedience. But are we unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to commune with you ſpiritually? Have not all good men, as far as they have the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of each other, communion in this ſenſe? And do they not heartily approve of all ſincere Chriſtians, as far as they view them walking in the truth? We may not from hence infer, that Chriſt approves of the errors of any, or that the moſt profuſe charity requires it of us.</p>
               <p>To ſuppoſe that the Paedo-baptiſts are in an error, and that this is of ſuch a nature that Chriſt could not commune with or bleſs them, would it not be to ſuppoſe it fatal, and inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with their eternal ſalvation? And ſhould it be granted, <q>that God communes at his table with the pure in heart of both denominations,</q> yet never in ſuch a ſenſe as to approve of the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of either.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="unknown:026602_0101_0FD0B68F69165F20"/>
That God has communed with, or bleſſed good men, notwithſtanding they were guilty of ſome errors, will appear from what follows:—It is ſaid of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that he loved the Lord, and walked in the ſtatutes of <hi>David</hi> his father; only he ſacrificed and burnt incenſe in high places.—The ſame is ſaid of <hi>Jehoaſh,</hi> and <hi>Jotham,</hi> that they <hi>did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord: But the high places were not taken away: the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtill ſacrificed and burnt incenſe in the high places.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Kings, iii. 3. 2 King xii. 2, 3, and xv. 34, 35.</note> We can here only conceive, that God approved of what was right according to his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; while he wholly condemned their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing in high places and groves.</p>
               <p>When the ordinance of the paſſover had not for a long time been obſerved <hi>as it was written,</hi> king <hi>Hezekiah</hi> iſſued his proclamation, ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Iſrael to attend the ſolemn feaſt. But when the people came together, many of them had not thoſe external qualifications which the ordinance required; and conſequently did <hi>eat the paſſover otherwiſe than it was written: but Hezekiah prayed for them, ſaying, the good Lord pardon every one that prepareth his heart to ſeek God, the Lord God of his fathers, though he be not cleanſed according to the purification of the ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Chron. xxx. 18, 19.</note> Hence it is evident, that they were in ſome degree guilty, for omitting thoſe external pre-requiſites which the ordinance required; notwithſtanding they prepared their <hi>hearts</hi> to ſeek the Lord. If this were not the caſe, they could not have needed a pardon, for this ever
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:026602_0102_0FD08037C2EB73A8"/>ſuppoſes guilt. Thus while they experienced the divine approbation in preparing their <hi>hearts</hi> to ſeek God, they needed his pardon for ſome <hi>external</hi> omiſſions.</p>
               <p>You will recollect, Sir, that you have given it as your opinion. <q>That the <hi>eſſence</hi> of <hi>baptiſm</hi> does not conſiſt in any one particular mode whatever.</q> Undoubtedly this may be ſaid, with as much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, reſpecting communion; that the <hi>eſſence</hi> of it does not conſiſt in any particular mode whatever; but in right affections of heart.</p>
               <p>If this obſervation be juſt, that the eſſence of an ordinance does not conſiſt in the externals of it, but in ſincerity of heart; and that Chriſtian communion does not require agreement in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, but only a union of 'affection and deſires;' in this ſenſe, I preſume, the Baptiſts and Paedo-baptiſts do cordially commune.</p>
               <p>In remarking upon the motto of my other Piece, you have ſaid, <q>There muſt be a union between God and man, or they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune together—there muſt be a cordial union. We muſt love the ſame objects which God loves, and hate that which he hates.</q> You ſuppoſe, <q>the ſame kind of agreement is eſſential to our walking together?</q> Now, Sir, if this cordial affection and union can fully exiſt, and we diſagree in one divine inſtitution, why can it not, and we diſagree in another? Why is it thought more eſſential to our Chriſtian fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and union to be agreed in the ordinance of the ſupper, than in the ordinance of baptiſm? Or are there any reaſons for exalting the former ſo much above the latter? If agreement in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:026602_0103_0FD0B69078065C88"/>be unneceſſary to our Chriſtian fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, then it can be of no conſequence for us to be agreed in the ordinance of the ſupper. For according to this argument, two perſons or churches may enjoy mutual communion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, although one of them ſhould partake of the bread and wine, and the other ſit by at the ſame time and not partake.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, I ſee nothing to forbid this concluſion, That we do commune with the Paedo-baptiſts in the ſame ſenſe which God does. We may not indeed in the ſame degree, as we have not the ſame degree of knowledge, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their conformity to his <hi>moral</hi> image, or poſitive requirements; but ſo far as we ſee them bearing the image of <hi>truth,</hi> ſo far we love and eſteem them.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, do you conceive that God communes with you in a higher, or different ſenſe, in the ordinance of the ſupper, than what he does in the ordinance of baptiſm? If not, why may you not draw an argument equally forcible from that, to urge us to a compliance with your mode of baptiſm? I am willing to own, that I am enthuſiaſtic enough to believe, that God as <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> manifeſts his all-approving preſence with us in the ordinance of <hi>baptiſm,</hi> as in that of the <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> But, ſhould we from hence urge the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of your adopting our mode of baptiſm, without producing any other proof in ſupport of it, would you think the argument concluſive? Moſt certainly you would not.</p>
               <p>You have taken it for granted, that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munes with the Paedo-baptiſts, and that his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:026602_0104_0FD080398543D6E0"/>is worthy of imitation. But have we not as much reaſon to believe, that the baptiſm of Chriſt by an immerſion in Jordan, was deſigned as an example for believers through every age, as that his communing with your denomination is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned as an example for us to imitate? But, the <hi>ſacrilegious</hi> practice of imitating Jeſus Chriſt in his baptiſm, has been loudly exploded, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We cheerfully acknowledge that this is not the caſe with us; for we do really endeavour to <hi>imitate the baptiſm of Chriſt;</hi> nor did we ever yet feel conſcious of reproof, for the preſumptuous act!

               <p>Should you think the queſtion not fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by what has been already obſerved, and ſtill inquire, <q>If God communes with the Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, why ſhould you be unwilling to follow his example?</q>—I would wiſh to aſk, Whether you would think it duty for us to be followers of God, otherwiſe than according to the <hi>rules</hi> laid down in his word? You will permit me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind you, that you have acknowledged, that thoſe <hi>rules</hi> require baptiſm antecedent to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. This is evidently your meaning when you ſay, <q>I do not deny that baptiſm was <hi>prior</hi> to coming to the Lord's table in the apoſtolic practice.

               <p>That there can be circumſtances in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſituation which may render it neceſſary, or even juſtifiable, to depart from the <hi>apoſtolic prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,</hi> I cannot conceive. Yet here we are not ſo happy as to be agreed in opinion; for you ſay— <q>I am not certain that there can be no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in which it might be lawful to admit to the Lord's ſupper prior to baptiſm.</q> Eſpecially if the mode of baptiſm be immerſion. <q>For a real Chriſtian may for many years be ſubjected to ſuch bodily diſorders, that it would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption rather than duty, to be plunged all under water; and yet at certain times he might be able to attend the ordinance of the Lord's ſupper. And muſt he be debarred this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, or forbidden this duty, merely becauſe he is unable to be immerſed? <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 14.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It appears to me, Sir, that you draw conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions without premiſes. For you ſuppoſe we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar a perſon from a <hi>privilege</hi> in one inſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is unable to do his <hi>duty</hi> in another. I ſuppoſe you are miſtaken in both. For firſt, I do not believe that God requires any duty of his creatures, which his holy providence has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them unable to perform: which is the ſuppoſed caſe with regard to baptiſm. Nor ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ondly,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:026602_0107_0FD0B692DF479950"/>do I believe that it is the duty or privilege of any perſon to attend one ſacred ordinance, while God in his providence prevents his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another, which has a <hi>prior</hi> claim on his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and while the <hi>latter,</hi> by <q>apoſtolic prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,</q> is a neceſſary qualification for the <hi>former.</hi> This idea you have fully illuſtrated in your next page, where you obſerve; that <q>Many things which are ordinarily incumbent duties, are not ſo in all circumſtances.</q> This obſervation appears perfectly juſt, and the very circumſtance you have mentioned of the perſon's being unbaptized, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it inconſiſtent with duty for him to partake of the Lord's ſupper.</p>
               <p>For I can as eaſily conceive of its being a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's duty or privilege to go to meeting, while by the providence of God he is confined at home; as to believe that it is his duty to go to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-table, while by the ſame providence he is unable to attend the previous qualifications which the inſtitution requires.</p>
               <p>Allowing immerſion to be eſſential to goſpel baptiſm, and a perſon to become a real Chriſtian when but nine years old, and the ſtate of his health ſuch as would render it unſuitable for him to be baptized, ſhould he live to be nine hundred and ſixty-nine, I ſhould never ſuppoſe it to be his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to communicate while in that ſituation; nor can I ſuppoſe any well enlightened Chriſtian would ever deſire it.</p>
               <p>But, ſhould it even be ſuppoſed, that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the inſtitutions might be diſpenſed with in particular caſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, ſo far as to admit to communion pious perſons, whoſe bodily infirmities would not
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:026602_0108_0FD0B673AB240588"/>allow of their being baptized—What then? Shall we from hence argue to a general practice, and admit unbaptized perſons to communion who have no ſuch infirmities to plead? If this be not the caſe, your argument loſes the whole of its force; unleſs your communicants are all <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valids!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The inconcluſiveneſs of this argument will more fully appear, by attending to the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions you have brought to illuſtrate it by. The firſt is, the inſtance of <hi>David</hi>'s taking the <hi>ſhew bread.</hi> You obſerve, <q>He was hungry, and had need of it for the ſuſtenance and preſervation of life;</q> but will you from hence conclude, that it was lawful for <hi>David,</hi> or any other perſon in ordinary caſes, to have taken the <hi>hallowed bread,</hi> when there was no ſuch neceſſity? If this be not the caſe, it will not help your cauſe; for the matter in diſpute is not a caſe of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> but of ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conveniency; and which, in order to its being practiſed, muſt be lawful in ordinary caſes. Your other obſervation reſpecting a perſon's being nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſarily detained from the houſe of God, is much of the ſame tenor: for granting that a perſon's infirmities may excuſe him from the duty of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending public worſhip, ſhall we hence infer that this is any excuſe for others, or even for the ſame perſon when well? Surely we ſhall not.</p>
               <p>You ſuppoſe when <hi>David</hi> violated a <hi>poſitive precept,</hi> he did it to preſerve his life, and that in this ſenſe he conducted himſelf agreeably to the <hi>moral law.</hi> Now, Sir, when it can be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that a perſon's life, or eternal ſalvation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on communicating at the Lord's table, I
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:026602_0109_0FD0B6958FE609B0"/>cannot ſay but in ſuch a caſe, it may be lawful to go contrary to poſitive inſtitutions; to depart from <hi>apoſtolic practice;</hi> and plunge ourſelves into almoſt every inconſiſtency, <hi>rather than a weak brother ſhould periſh for whom Chriſt died.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your obſervations in favour of giving the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to the ſick who are not inſtitutionally qualified to receive it, lead us to compare it with the ancient cuſtom of baptizing the <hi>clinics.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A learned hiſtorian obſerves, "At firſt all times were alike, and perſons were baptized as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and occaſion ſerved, but it was after reſtrained to two ſolemn and ſtated times of the year, viz. <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſuntide.</hi>" Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the fifty days between: "Yet if there was a <hi>neceſſity,</hi> (as in caſe of <hi>ſickneſs</hi> and danger of <hi>death</hi>) they might be baptized at any other time."<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Cave's Primitive Chriſtianity. p. 104.</note> And notwithſtanding they allowed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion to be the proper mode, yet, in caſe of danger of death, they would ſprinkle perſons as they lay in their beds. It is evident they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the inſtitution; and your notion of giving the communion to the ſick who are unable to be baptized, has a little of the ſame appearance.</p>
               <p>I do not find that theſe ancient Chriſtians plead apoſtolic authority for this practice, nor did they allow of this mode of baptiſm in ordinary caſes.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould it be thought neceſſary for a real Chriſtian to receive the communion, ſo long as his bodily infirmities forbid his being regularly baptized? It cannot be thought neceſſary to his eternal ſalvation; for if a Chriſtian, that is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſecured: nor that the goſpel rule requires it;
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:026602_0110_0FD0B67657486360"/>for that enjoins, that <hi>all things be done decently and in order:</hi> nor yet the glory of God, for that nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er requires ſubmiſſion to any <hi>poſitive law,</hi> but of thoſe who are capable of the poſitive pre-requiſites to obey it. Hence I conclude, that every unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Chriſtian, whoſe infirmities may be ſuch, as to render it unſuitable for him to be baptized and join the viſible church, ought ſubmiſſively to wait, until God in his providence opens a door for him in a regular manner to approach his holy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and not to act fooliſhly like <hi>Saul,</hi> who grew impatient in waiting for <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>forced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and offered a burnt-offering.</hi>

               <p>I have endeavoured thus far to trace your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and have not yet found ſufficient reaſon to depart from the <hi>apoſtolic practice,</hi> but as we are ſo happy as to be agreed in this point, that baptiſm according to their practice was <hi>prior</hi> to coming to the Lord's table, on this ground we will bring the matter to trial. Now, Sir, I would wiſh to aſk, How we can conſiſtently communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with you. If we communicate with you as <hi>baptized</hi> perſons, we practically give up our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; if we communicate with you as <hi>unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,</hi> then we unwarrantably depart from the apoſtolic practice. You cannot be inſenſible, my dear Sir, that this is the very <hi>pith</hi> of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy; and that one or the other of the above difficulties will inevitably fall to our ſhare, in caſe we eſtabliſh communion with you.</p>
               <p>It is a fact generally known, and which we do not wiſh to conceal, that we cannot acknowledge <hi>Infant-ſprinkling</hi> to be <hi>goſpel</hi> baptiſm. Could this
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:026602_0111_0FD0B6959642A390"/>be allowed, the diſpute would be at an end; and our ſentiments at an end with it. For if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution requires no more than <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> then <hi>plunging</hi> muſt be forever unneceſſary; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we ſhall be juſtly chargeable with re-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, a practice we condemn as much as you do. But you ſeem to be willing that we ſhould be Baptiſts, and yet blame us for not communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with other denominations. But, why do you not <hi>lay the axe to the root of the tree,</hi> and blame us for being Baptiſts, and not blame us for being conſiſtent?</p>
               <p>I doubt not but every unprejudiced mind will readily perceive, that the matter comes to this point with us, that in order to communicate with you we muſt either give up what you and we agree was the apoſtolic practice, or our ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as Baptiſts. One or the other of theſe will be a rational inference from our conduct.</p>
               <p>From what has now been obſerved, it will be eaſy to perceive the different ſituations we ſtand in to each other. When perſons join your churches, who have been baptized by us, I have never heard of your baptizing them again. On the other hand, we always baptize thoſe who come from your churches to us, unleſs they have been immerſed upon a profeſſion of faith. But is this difference of conduct to be attributed to catholiciſm in you, or the want of it in us? By no means. The truth is this, <hi>immerſion</hi> includes <hi>ſprinkling;</hi> but ſprinkling does not include im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion: therefore the perſon who is immerſed, is in your view lawfully baptized; whilſt he who is only ſprinkled is not ſo in ours. It hence
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:026602_0112_0FD0B6765E3A1D08"/>follow, that, conſiſtently with your ſentiments and view of the <hi>'apoſtolic practice,'</hi> you may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite us to communicate in your churches; while we, having the ſame views, cannot invite you.</p>
               <p>It is hoped that the preceding obſervations will fully ſatisfy our Paedo-baptiſt brethren, that our reaſons for not communicating with them, do not ariſe from the want of brotherly affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards them; but from a conſcientious regard to what we underſtand to be <hi>the order of the goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So long as we allow the goſpel to contain a complete ſyſtem of faith and practice, we muſt endeavour to follow the rules there given, rather than imitate other ſuppoſed parts of the divine conduct.</p>
               <p>But ſhould we even carry the matter as high as you have ſuppoſed; that Chriſt ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally come to one of your communions, and actually partake with you; and ſhould addreſs you as his friends, and bid you eat and drink: I am not certain that his conduct in ſo doing would call for our imitation, ſo long as the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed laws of his kingdom remain as they now are.</p>
               <p>When Chriſt firſt commiſſioned his diſciples, and ſent them forth to preach the goſpel, heal the ſick, &amp;c.—<hi>he commanded them ſaying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. x. 5.</note> Nevertheleſs, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf went into the borders of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> and there healed the daughter of the <hi>Syrophenician</hi> woman, who was a Gentile.<note n="†" place="bottom">Mark vii. 24—30.</note> He alſo paſſed

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">John iv. 26, 39, 40.</note> Hence we ſee, that Chriſt did thoſe things which his diſciples were not authorized to do. Therefore I conclude we are to follow the particular rules laid down by Chriſt in his word, rather than any ſuppoſed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances or manifeſtations he may make to his people in any way whatever. If this be not the caſe, we are likely to ramble in eternal uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! But, bleſſed be God, <hi>we have a more ſure word of prophecy, to which we do well to take heed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be proper here to take notice of the conſequences you have drawn, from the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of our proving, that a conformity to our <hi>mode</hi> of baptiſm is an eſſential term of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. You ſay, <q>Should this be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, it will then alſo appear, that all the Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-baptiſts, who have thought, they enjoyed communion with God at his table, have been <hi>moſt miſerably deluded.</hi>
                  </q> If ſo, the conſequence is dreadful indeed! Enough to ſhock the tender feelings of every pious Paedo-baptiſt, and lay an effectual <hi>bar</hi> in the way of their admitting the evidence of a truth ſo diſguſting, though ſhining with the greateſt clearneſs. You alſo conclude, that if baptiſm in our mode be an eſſential qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ification; <q>then the Paedo-baptiſts are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially wrong and <hi>wicked</hi> in coming to the table;</q> and their conduct an <hi>abomination</hi> in the ſight of God.<note n="†" place="bottom">Page. 28.</note> My dear Sir, are you ſo intoxicated
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:026602_0114_0FD0B677A20117E8"/>with ſentiment as to forget your own ſyſtem? No farther back than page 20, you have ſaid, <q>I deny that there can be any <hi>moral evil</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct which proceeds from godly ſincerity; yet I grant there may be <hi>natural evil,</hi> or incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, through inadvertency or miſapprehenſion.</q> Is it poſſible that 'natural evil' or 'incongruity,' ſhould account for all the frightful things now mentioned, ſuch as <hi>'miſerable deluſion,' 'wicked'</hi> conduct, even ſuch as is <q>
                     <hi>abomination</hi> in the ſight of God?</q> If not, your argument fails in one or the other: either your conduct muſt be charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with <hi>moral evil,</hi> or your conſequences can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be juſt.</p>
               <p>In your next page you go on to ſay, <q>Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that immerſion be the <hi>appointed</hi> mode of baptiſm, and believers the <hi>only</hi> proper ſubjects, yet if a Paedo-baptiſt <hi>really think</hi> otherwiſe, and with an obedient heart offer up his children in our mode, his conduct is not chargeable with any <hi>moral evil.</hi> All the evil which is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to his conduct, is of the <hi>natural</hi> kind.— And the perſon in ſo doing, is as well accepted in the ſight of God, as if his external conduct had been according to the appointed mode of baptiſm.</q> It is peculiar indeed, that with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the inſtitution of <hi>baptiſm,</hi> you ſhould conclude, that if you honeſtly miſtake both the <hi>ſubjects</hi> and <hi>mode,</hi> and practiſe in a way entirely different, it by no means hinders the divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and acceptance. But with regard to the ordinance of the <hi>ſupper,</hi> if it ſhould be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that you had <hi>as</hi> honeſtly made a miſtake with regard to a previous duty, and have thought that
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:026602_0115_0FD0B696E65CE088"/>you enjoyed communion with God at his table, the conſequence muſt b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, that you have all been <hi>miſerably deluded!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to the above argument, all that is neceſſary to render baptiſm acceptable, is only to <hi>'really think'</hi> you are right: hence by a parity of reaſoning, if you are not accepted of God in the ordmance of the ſupper, we muſt ſuppoſe you do not 'really think' you are right when you come to the table. But are you not as ſincere in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lord's table, as in offering up your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? If you are not, I ſhall join with you, that your conduct is an abomination to the Lord. But, allowing you to be ſincere, and to really think you are right, and we muſt ſuppoſe that you have as much reaſon to think you have been <q>miſerably deluded</q> in the <hi>former,</hi> as in the <hi>latter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, I have endeavoured carefully to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the argumentative part of your <hi>Friendly Letter,</hi> and have attempted to anſwer thoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments on which I ſuppoſed you laid the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtreſs; either in a direct way, or by ſhowing the invalidity of the evidence by which they were ſupported. And however an impartial public may judge, I have the ſatisfaction to think, that in the preceding ſheets the following particulars have been fairly eſtabliſhed, by evidence from ſcripture, reaſon, and the concurring teſtimony of many eminent Paedo-baptiſt writers.
<list>
                     <item>1. That viſible, or profeſſing believers, are the <hi>only proper ſubjects of baptiſm,</hi> known and deſcribed in the word of God.</item>
                     <item>2. That an entire immerſion in water, is neceſſary to the due adminiſtration of the ordinance.</item>
                     <item>3. That by apoſtolic practice,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:026602_0116_0FD0B67914793600"/>which is a ſtanding law to the church of Chriſt, baptiſm <hi>was,</hi> and therefore ſtill <hi>is, prior</hi> to coming to the Lord's table.</item>
                  </list>
Hence it follows, by <q>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequence,</q> that a conformity to <hi>our mode</hi> of baptiſm (if that has been proved to be the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel mode) is to the conſidered as a neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiſite or (if it ſuits you better) <hi>term</hi> of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion at the Lord's table, ſo long as we think it important to follow the <hi>'apoſtolic practice.'</hi> We do not mean by this to dictate to our brethren of other denominations with regard to their terms of communion; but only ſhow the general prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples on which we proceed among ourſelves.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION IX.</hi> Obſervations on the Plan of Communion propoſed in the 'Friendly Letter,' with Remarks on ſeveral other Things connected with the Subject.</head>
               <p>SIR, your profeſſed deſign in writing, has too much of the appearance of friendſhip, to be paſſed over unnoticed. But whether if your plan were adopted, it would produce the deſired effect, is a matter of ſerious inquiry.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>To promote the peace and proſperity of Zion, by opening a door for free communion between the Baptiſts and Paedo-baptiſts,</q> is your profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed object. And notwithſtanding I have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the other ſide of the queſtion, I perſuade myſelf, that no perſon would be happier in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our objections fairly removed, and a conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent way pointed out for a mutual interchange of
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:026602_0117_0FD0B6989B4ED458"/>communions. But if it muſt be done at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of our <hi>ſentiments</hi> as Baptiſts, you will not think us unreaſonable in requiring ample proof that we are wrong, before we do it.</p>
               <p>The particular boundaries of your plan are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the following words. <q>It is not my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, nor my deſire, to have a door opened for free communion among all who <hi>proſeſs</hi> religion on either ſide; but only with regard to thoſe whoſe viſible conduct is evidential of real piety.</q> It is a little difficult here to underſtand your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If you mean to eſtabliſh communion with ſome churches which you may conſider as ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox in doctrine, and regular indiſcipline, while you reject others, your plan may be practicable. But as the terms or qualifications you propoſe, may be the lot of individuals rather than churches, it appears to be attended with ſome difficulty. For it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe that in every Chriſtian, community there may be ſome ſound, <q>whoſe viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible conduct is evidential of real piety.</q> With thoſe it ſeems you would wiſh to communciate, while with the church as a body you could by no means hold fellowſhip.</p>
               <p>In order to reduce the idea to practice, we will ſuppoſe ten members of a Baptiſt church in your vicinity, attend at one of your communion ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with a deſire to enjoy privileges with you; but when the church is called upon to act upon their requeſt, they inform thoſe brethren that with five of them they are fully ſatisfied, and bid them a cordial welcome to a ſeat in their communion; but to the others they obſerve, they have not obtained the evidence of their <q>real pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</q>
                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:026602_0118_0FD0B67A859DF530"/>and therefore muſt conſcientiouſly refuſe to partake with them. It is natural to ſuppoſe that the feelings of theſe brethren would be wounded upon ſuch an occaſion; ſome on their own account, and ſome on account of others. And the church to which they belong might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider themſelves injured; and it is likely the effect would be contention, rather than peace. Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ſimilar to the above are fairly ſuppoſeable.</p>
               <p>If you pleaſe, Sir, we will now ſuppoſe a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent caſe. It ſo happens, that ſeveral of your brethren remove into the neighbourhood of a Baptiſt church, and from their ſituation are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of enjoying privileges with them. The Baptiſts, enlightened by your ſentiments, are equally deſirous of indulging them; and although theſe brethren have not received baptiſm in the way which the church underſtand the inſtitution, yet as they appear to be <hi>ſincere,</hi> which <q>is the very, SOUL and ESSENCE of conformity to Chriſt,</q> the church cordially grant their requeſt. For a ſeaſon they enjoy privileges together, and no particular difficulty ariſes; but at length one of thoſe communicants becomes diffatisfied with reſpect to his Infant-baptiſm; and in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of godly <hi>ſincerity</hi> is led to believe, that it is his indiſpenſable duty to be immerſed. But while waiting a convenient opportunity for that purpoſe, a communion ſeaſon intervenes; it now becomes a ſerious queſtion, both with him and the church, whether it be duty for him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in his preſent ſituation? As the church adopted this new mode of communion in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to your ſyſtem; they think proper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur

They firſt conſult the terms on which you propoſe free communion; theſe they find to be <hi>'real piety'</hi> or <hi>'godly ſincerity.'</hi> That the man was a ſubject of theſe qualifications when they firſt admitted him, they have no doubt; and they are equally ſatisfied of his <hi>ſincerity</hi> and <hi>piety</hi> with his preſent views; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But there is one difficulty ſtill which ſeems to embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs their proceeding; that is, if they underſtand you right, (p. 9) it is not a queſtion with you, <q>Whether baptiſm in <hi>ſome</hi> mode be an <hi>eſſential qualification.</hi>
                  </q> And although the perſon once <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely</hi> believed himſelf to be baptized, he now <hi>as</hi> ſincerely believes he is not; and <q>as a man <hi>think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his heart ſo is he.</hi>
                  </q> For the ſcripture being '<hi>ſilent</hi> reſpecting his Infant-baptiſm,' the only thing which gave it validity, either with himſelf or the church, was his ſincerity; but <hi>that</hi> failing in this particular, <hi>this</hi> muſt conſequently fail with it; and he can no longer be conſidered as baptized, than while he ſincerely believes himſelf to be ſo. He is now, in his own view, and in the view of the church, unbaptized. And I cannot ſee but that he muſt appear in the ſame light to you, upon your own ſcale of reaſoning. But, however, he is unqueſtionably poſſeſſed of <hi>real piety</hi> and <hi>godly ſincerity,</hi> which are your diſtinguiſhing terms of communion; and yet, as he is in his own opinion unbaptized, he lacks an <hi>'eſſential qualification.'</hi> It follows, that by your ſyſtem he is both quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and unqualified, at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Baptiſt church would not appear
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:026602_0120_0FD0B67C14E64BC8"/>in the moſt conſident light, to baptize a perſon with whom they had probably communed ſeveral years; and yet the man cannot act conſiſtently with godly ſincerity without it.

                  </gap> forbidden his partaking at the paſchal feaſt.</p>
               <p>To this you anſwer, <q>We ſhall not diſpute but that <hi>Moſes</hi> would have admitted thoſe ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to preach; being convinced of their divine commiſſion. Nor would he have forbidden their partaking of the paſchal feaſt, had they been circumciſed, whether it were done in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy or adult age, before or after believing, with a knife, a razor, a ſcythe, a ſickle, or even a ſharp ſtone.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, did you think this would be conſidered as an anſwer? It certainly will not. Inſtead of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the argument fairly in the face, you have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured quite to evade it.</p>
               <p>You agree that <hi>Moſes</hi> would have admitted thoſe ambaſſadors to preach. The queſtion then was, whether he would have received them to the paſchal feaſt, while uncircumciſed? Inſtead of a direct anſwer, you reply, <q>Nor would he have forbidden their partaking of the paſchal feaſt had they <hi>been</hi> circumciſed.</q> True, Sir; nor will your victory coſt you any thing; for this point was never diſputed. You proceed to remark ſeveral circumſtances reſpecting circumciſion; but take particular care not to mention any which would affect the validity of the <hi>rite.</hi> Nor are the caſes parallel between the circumſtances mentioned, and that of Infant-baptiſm. This will ſufficiently appear by what follows: as
<list>
                     <item>1. <q>Whether it were done in infancy or adult age,</q> no matter which; for infants of <hi>eight days old</hi> were expreſsly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the inſtitution, and they were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that day to circumciſe them; and repeated
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:026602_0123_0FD0B69CE53DF368"/>examples from ſcripture prove that it was done. Let the right of infants to baptiſm be as fairly made out, and the point will be given up.</item>
                     <item>2. Whether 'before or after believing;' this was entirely immaterial. For the command was, <hi>And he that is eight days old ſhall be circumciſed among you, every man-child in your generations, he that is born in the houſe or bought with money of any ſtranger, which is not of thy ſeed—muſt needs be circumciſed.</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xvii. 12, 13.</note> It hence follows, that <hi>believing</hi> was not required in the ſubjects for circumciſion, nor yet that the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi> ſhould be believers; for the child of an idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrous heathen, bought for a ſlave, had as fair a claim to that inſtitution, as any of the believing ſons of <hi>Abraham.</hi> This cannot be ſaid of the goſpel inſtitution; for when one ſaid, See here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? The reply was, <hi>If thou believeſt with all thine heart, thou mayeſt.</hi>

               <p>We will now take notice of what you obſerve (p. 31.) You ſay, <q>It has been difficult for us to ſee the conſiſtency of your conduct, in refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to commune at the Lord's table with our denomination; while at the ſame time, you prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically acknowledge our Miniſters to be autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized and qualified to preach the goſpel.</q> That we are perfectly free from inconſiſtency will not be pretended; nor do we think that a compliance with your mode of communion, would free us from the charge. Perhaps with our preſent dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent views, we cannot act more conſiſtently than to follow the advice given by the Apoſtle; "Whereto we have already <hi>attained,</hi> let us walk by the ſame rule, let us mind the ſame thing."<note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. iii. 16.</note> We have <hi>attained</hi> to an agreement in praying to the ſame God and Father of all; and alſo in preaching the goſpel of his Son Jeſus Chriſt. But we have not attained to an agreement with reſpect to the ſubjects and mode of baptiſm; nor in the viſible qualifications of communicants for the Lord's table. How can two walk together ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:026602_0125_0FD0B69ED507D1D0"/>they be agreed? But muſt we be charged with inconſiſtency, for not diſagreeing in the things we are agreed in, or merely becauſe we are agreed in ſome things, and not in all? If ſo, we muſt patiently ſubmit to the charge, until the happy time comes when we ſhall ſee <hi>eye to eye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although we do not think of clearing ourſelves of inconſiſtency, by charging your conduct with the ſame; yet it may not be improper here to inquire, whether your conduct towards us in ſome inſtances, be quite conſiſtent with your profeſſions of friendſhip in eſtabliſhing <hi>free</hi> communion with with us? If you conſider us as a branch of Chriſt's church, with whom you would be willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Chriſtian communion, why do you refuſe to diſmiſs and recommend your members to us, when they are in good ſtanding in your churches, and wiſh to join ours? I conclude, Sir, you are ſenſible that this privilege has been generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and this reaſon has been often aſſigned for the denial: That to diſmiſs a member to a Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt church, would be to acknowledge it a church of Chriſt. But would you be willing to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with any who do not belong to his church? You certainly would not.</p>
               <p>Permit me, Sir, to mention one thing more. Why are your pulpits ſo frequently denied to the Miniſters of our denomination? Is it becauſe they are heterodox in doctrine, or vicious in their conduct? They are not charged with either. Is it becauſe they may want literary accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? This might be imagined, were it not that thoſe who poſſeſs them are often denied as well as others. Is it becauſe we do not communicate
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:026602_0126_0FD0B68064708D60"/>with you at the table?

In the firſt place, you have charged me with 'quoting ſcripture' in a method 'calculated to miſlead the ignorant and inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;' of 'arrogancy and uncharitableneſs;' and of <q>having done great injury to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </q> (Page 17, 35, 38.)</p>
               <p>The firſt inſtance of which you complain, is in the following words, "Sincerity is not the term
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:026602_0127_0FD0B6A011344C00"/>of communion; but being conformed to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles' doctrine, and continuing ſtedfaſtly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Acts ii. 42." Upon which you thus obſerve; <q>From the manner of your citing, or rather al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding, to this text, it would be natural to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that upon examination we ſhould find the inſpired writer deſcribing the terms of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</q> I conclude, Sir, upon examination this does abundantly appear. Nor am I convinced, that the paſſage is not pertinent to the purpoſe for which it was cited; and if it does not deſcribe the terms of communion, I know not of any one which does. <q>But (you ſay) inſtead of this, we find him ſimply relating the conduct of ſome young converts, who had been already admitted to communion.</q> But, Sir, are you not miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? He is here deſcribing the very manner in which theſe converts were admitted; and which fully ſhows the 'apoſtolic practice.'</p>
               <p>But what is the account given of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? You anſwer, <q>Let us read the 41ſt and 42d verſes in connexion.</q> 
                  <hi>Then they who gladly received the word were baptized; and the ſame day there were added unto them about three thouſand ſouls. And they continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles' doctrine and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> And were they not baptized until they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the word? No, they were not; and were <hi>they</hi> baptized and no others? The ſcripture is totally '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lent' as to any others. Nor did they join the body of believers or church, until they received the word, and were baptized. You ſay, <q>They had already been admitted to communion.</q> I
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:026602_0128_0FD0B681E59CF3B8"/>would beg to know, where you find any account of their having been admitted before this?</p>
               <p>You farther obſerve, <q>That any perſon of good diſcernment may ſee, that in this text there is no appearance of deſign to aſcertain the terms of communion.</q> Let the deſign be what it may, here is evidently aſcertained the apoſtolic prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and the exact manner, ſtep by ſtep, in which they proceeded to communion.</p>
               <p>The paſſage of ſcripture which you introduce, as being ſo very appoſite to your mode of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and on which you lay much ſtreſs, is this; <hi>'Be ye followers of God as dear children.'</hi> The 'diſcerning reader' will now judge, whether in this paſſage there is any greater <q>appearance of deſign, to aſcertain the terms of communion,</q> than in the one which I alluded to. But, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, "If to be conformed to the Apoſtles' doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and continuing ſtedfaſtly in it," be a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous practice, and <q>calculated to miſlead the ignorant and inattentive,</q> we ſhould be glad to ſee the danger pointed out, and a better ſyſtem of doctrine propoſed for imitation.</p>
               <p>In my other Piece, in anſwering ſeveral pleas in favour of free communion, I obſerved that it had been urged, "That the ſcripture account of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, was left in ſo much darkneſs and ambiguity, both as to the ſubjects and mode, that nothing certain could be determined." In remarking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I made the following obſervation; "It may be remembered that when the talents were committed to the ſervants to occupy, the two who improved made no complaints; the other had a hard maſter, an auſtere man, and a great many
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:026602_0129_0FD0B6A164273020"/>difficulties ſtood in the way of duty." After mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſarcaſtical paraphraſe upon my obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you bring forward your charge of <q>arrogancy and uncharitableneſs;</q> to which it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied—The obſervation was deſigned entirely for thoſe who make the above plea; and no one will feel himſelf injured by the application, if he be not the character deſcribed. And however <q>arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and uncharitable</q> it may appear, thus to blame the conduct of thoſe who bring forward the <hi>plea,</hi> ſo long as they are conſidered only as ſervants; it cannot be thought <hi>more ſo,</hi> than the plea itſelf, againſt Chriſt our royal Maſter.</p>
               <p>To plead the want of ſufficient light in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the reaſon of our wrong ſentiments, is indeed to impeach Chriſt. "To ſuppoſe this, (ſaith Dr. Hopkins) is a reproach on divine rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elation, and the Author of it, andian implicit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial that it comes from God."<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid.

               <p>But laſtly, you accuſe me of having <q>done great injury to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </q> If it be ſo I ſhall be ſorry indeed. But what have I done to the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle? Why you ſay, <q>You have quoted his words without any appearance of regard to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion.</q> And what then? Is this injuring the Apoſtle? Are we never to uſe the words of the inſpired writers in any other ſenſe than what they did? Do not the beſt writers frequently quote ſcripture (by way of accommodation, or for the ſake of the phraſe) without attending ſtrictly to the connexion? In ſhort, have you not frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done it yourſelf? One or two of your quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will determine the matter. <q>

                  </q> Did you attend to the connexion here, and uſe the words in the ſame ſenſe which the royal preacher did? It is evident you did not. Again, when you would fix the charge of inconſiſtency upon us, for refuſing to communicate with thoſe with whom you ſuppoſe Chriſt communes, you can introduce the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> as exhorting the Baptiſts, <q>to be followers of God as dear children.</q> I ſhall not ſay that you have 'greatly injured the Apoſtle;' but I hardly think that in the paſſage above, he had reference to our communicating with you at the Lord's table.</p>

Two of the Paedo-baptiſt Miniſters were, Rev. Dr. WEST, Rev. Mr. CAMP. Baptiſts, Rev. Meſſrs. WORDEN and BLOOD.</note>
                  </q> If this be the caſe, no wonder you are alarmed. But, Sir, you are miſtaken. The churches of our denom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination in America, contain upwards of <hi>ſixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand members,</hi> which hold viſible communion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: nor did I ever know, that any attempt had been made on our part, to deſtroy the viſible communion of Chriſtians in general. And ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, were our ſentiments univerſally to operate, they would unite in one great body all Chriſtians to the ends of the earth.</p>
               <p>But you object again and ſay, <q>Your ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice tend to lead people to place the <hi>eſſence</hi> of religion in the external obſervance of ceremonial inſtitutions, to the neglect of the weightier matters of the law.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This, Sir, is not true. For our ſentiments carry the fulleſt demonſtration to the contrary. It is a fact univerſally known, that no perſon can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as a member in a Baptiſt church, let his <hi>externals</hi> be what they may, without ſufficient ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence that he has experienced a change of heart, and has become a real Chriſtian. We do not baptize perſons to màke them Chriſtians, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we look upon them to be ſuch already. And it is well known, that a perſon cannot be accepted with us, on account of <hi>lineal</hi> deſcent
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:026602_0133_0FD0B6A53138D480"/>from <hi>Abraham,</hi> or any other believer; nor by virtue of a pretended <hi>federal</hi> holineſs; nor can they make a profeſſion by <hi>proxy</hi> or <hi>ſponſors;</hi> but by their own voluntary act. We never baptize perſons out of our ordinary way, who are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death; nor do we ever give the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to any who are unbaptized. How then can you poſſibly ſay, with any appearance of modeſty or juſtice, that our <q>ſentiments tend to lead peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to place the <hi>eſſence</hi> of religion, in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal obſervance of ceremonial inſtitutions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You follow this charge with a number of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous reflections, upon the Miniſters of our denomination. To make this appear, I would only aſk; Were I to charge your Miniſters with <q>taking up much of their time in <hi>public</hi> and in <hi>private,</hi> diſputing about</q> Infant-baptiſm; and ſhould have the vanity to ſay, they had better <q>inculcate upon their hearers the nature and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of univerſal benevolence, the duties of brotherly love, juſtice, mercy, and compaſſion; to live uſeful lives, ſerving their generation by the will of God;</q> (as if theſe were almoſt, if not entirely neglected; and ſhould aſſure them, that if they would take my advice) <q>they would do much more good in the world, appear much leſs like the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi>
                  </q> which <hi>they</hi> now reſemble, <q>and much more like CHRIST and his APOSTLES,</q> which <hi>we</hi> ſo exactly imitate. Would you not think me juſtly chargeable with <hi>'arrogancy</hi> and <hi>uncharitableneſs?'</hi> I leave the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to your own feelings. A word to the wiſe is ſufficient.</p>

                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:026602_0134_0FD0B68682A67F50"/>
Another thing you charge us with, is, that we lay an <hi>'undue ſtreſs'</hi> upon the ordinance of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, or at leaſt upon our particular mode. This comes rather with an ill grace, from one of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, which evidently make as much, if not more of the ordinance than we do.</p>

                  </q> I wiſh, Sir, you had proved the matter, inſtead of ſuggeſting your fears, But you add, <q>It has been frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned by thoſe of your denomination, as an evidence of great ſelfdenial, for a perſon to be a Baptiſt, or to be plunged. And when I hear ſuch things, it always excites fears in my mind</q> —Sir, the mere thoughts of a perſon's being <hi>plunged,</hi> ſeems to have ſtruck you with a hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phobia, and quite agitated your mind!—But let us try calmly to examine the matter.</p>

It will probably be granted, that the time has been, when it required ſome degree of <hi>ſelfdenial</hi> to be a Baptiſt: When the <hi>pen</hi> of the hiſtorian, and the <hi>tongue</hi> of the orator, were invidiouſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, in repreſenting us in the moſt ridiculous, and whimſical light.

               <p>In the year 416, a council was held at Mela in Numedia, in order to eſtabliſh a law to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Chriſtians to baptize their infants.

               </p>
               <p>The laſt thing which I ſhall remark upon, is a 'query' which you ſuggeſt in the following words: <q>May it not be owing to the manner in which <hi>ſome</hi> preachers of your denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have treated the ſubject of baptiſm; that ſo many profeſſors of your ſect have turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>deiſts, ſhakers, univerſaliſts,</hi> &amp;c.?</q> Upon this I would briefly obſerve—It is thought you would have acted more conſiſtent with your title page, and other profeſſions of candor, that if you had known any inſtances in which the <hi>ſubject</hi> had been <hi>ſo</hi> treated, to have pointed them out to the imprudent teacher, rather than to have caſt the <hi>ſlur,</hi> indiſcriminately upon the whole denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="unknown:026602_0140_0FD0B68AE4E651D0"/>
But, Sir, we cannot admit the ſuppoſed fact to be tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. For although it may be difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the exact number of <hi>deiſts, ſhakers,</hi> and <hi>univerſaliſts;</hi> and what their ſentiments have heretofore been; yet we think ourſelves under as good advantages to know the ſtate of our churches, as any others can be: for we have an annual correſpondence with them from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict of <hi>Main,</hi> to the State of <hi>Georgia;</hi> and alſo with our brethren on the other ſide the <hi>Adamtis.</hi> Hence we are conſident, that if <hi>they</hi> principally originate from us, their number muſt be ſmall.</p>
               <p>But, ſhould it even be allowed, that a greater number of our denomination had gone over to the above ſentiments than from any other, will it hence follow, that it was becauſe they had once been 'plunged all under water?' Do you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly think that one in thirty would acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, that any circumſtances connected with their being immened, led them to embrace thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents? It is doubted whether this would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon examination.</p>
               <p>You inform us that you <q>ſuggeſt <hi>this</hi> query without any deſign to reproach.</q> Sir, your <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> falls not within our juriſdiction to judge; but the <hi>query itſelf,</hi> we are obliged to view, as a groundleſs, illiberal reflection. If the cauſe you are engaged in cannot be ſupported by <hi>ſober facts,</hi> founded on <hi>rational evidence,</hi> without making uſe of ſuch feeble auxiliaries as your own <q>
                     <hi>fears, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions,</hi> and <hi>queries,</hi>
                  </q> you will not think it ſtrange if we ſhould not become converts to your ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But you continue your ſuggeſtion and aſk, <q>Is it not ſuppoſeable, that from the manner
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:026602_0141_0FD0B6AB24175970"/>in which <hi>ſome</hi> have treated the ſubject of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, theſe apoſtates were firſt led to ſuppoſe it a great attainment in religion, to be plunged all under water?</q> This ſuppoſition places the whole of theſe <hi>apoſtates,</hi> (as you call them) to our account: and that they were led on to this apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy, merely, by wrong inſtructions reſpecting baptiſm. But, do you know this certainly to be the caſe with any one individual? Or with any conſiderable number of them? If not, your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition muſt appear in an unfriendly light, and <q>calculated to miſlead the ignorant and inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You conclude your alarming deſcription, by preſenting them to the eye of imagination, as <q>
                     <hi>now ſinking</hi> in the quick-ſands which border on final perdition!</q> 
                  <hi>Pandora's fatel box</hi> could ſcarce contain more evils, than you attribute to baptiſm by immerſion! Enlightened <hi>reaſon,</hi> however, makes a pauſe,—and aſks, <hi>Gan it be ſo? Hoary experience</hi> inſtantly comes forward and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, that the <hi>fact</hi> is known to be otherwife.</p>
               <p>O thou condeſcending Redeemer, is an humble imitation of thy innoceat example, thus charged with leading the <hi>fatal</hi> way to <hi>infidelity,</hi> and <q>final perdition?</q> Haſt thou not commanded us to follow thee? and ſaid, "If ye love me keep my commandments."</p>
