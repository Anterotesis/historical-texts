            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THO' the pious and ingenious Author of the following Meditations will by no Means allow his Name to be publiſhed; yet we think convenient to ſignify, that he is a Perſon of Liberal Education, and had his Heart ſo ſet on the Work of the Miniſtry, as he voluntarily quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeveral Offices of Uſefulneſs and Honour in the Civil Order, to take the Care of Souls; and continued with great Acceptance in his miniſterial Labours, 'till in the myſterious Providence of GOD, ſuch bodily Diſorders ſeized him as, to the great Sorrow of many, obliged him to leave this his moſt delightful Employment.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, as religious Contemplations are ſtill his main Bent and Exerciſe; He has been prevailed upon by his particular Friends to write
<pb facs="unknown:006193_0003_102807D34B7AB498"/>
down ſeveral of his Tho'ts upon diverſe Subjects, which they with Pleaſure have occaſionally heard him utter in private Converſation. Some whereof are the following Pieces, which after great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, he has at length reſigned to their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, tho' with a poſitive Prohibition of divulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Name. And we are confident they will be very grateful, and by the Divine Bleſſing, hope will be uſeful to the ſerious Peruſer, as they have been to many who have read them in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript.</p>
            <p>May our moſt gracious GOD reſtore him to the free and full Exerciſe of all his former miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Abilities with greater Power and Uſefulneſs than ever, to the Advancement of the Kingdom of CHRIST, and Joy of many: And may the Reader add his Prayers, for the ſame Favour, and reap everlaſting Benefit by theſe excellent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Manhood of JESUS CHRIST is not a Perſon, but a Nature. A Perſon is one that is conſcious to himſelf with reſpect to his own Acts. That is, he can ſay, I did ſo and ſo: It was I, and not another. So in the Trinity, the Father can ſay, I begat the Son, and not another: The Son can ſay, I was begotten of the Father, I took humane Nature, and not the Father, nor the Spirit: And the Spirit can ſay, I, and not another, proceeded from the Father and the Son. So among Angels
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:006193_0004_102807D50889E5D8"/>
and Men, each has a Conciouſneſs, a Senſe or Apprehenſion within himſelf; I did ſo and ſo, and not another; the Praiſe or the Blame of ſuch and ſuch Things belongs to me, and not another. But thus it is not with the humane Nature of CHRIST, conſidered as diſtinct from the Divine. The Manhood in him can't ſay, I did ſo and ſo, and the Acts are to be appropriated to me, and to no other. No, the Words ſpoken come out of the Mouth of a humane Body, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by a humane rational Soul; but that Body and Soul do belong to a Perſon that ſubſiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Worlds, even that WORD which was with GOD, and was GOD, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So, when the Man JESUS ſaid, <hi>My Soul is exceeding ſorrowful unto Death; I thirst,</hi> &amp;c. the true Meaning of it is, not that any particular humane Perſon did ſo or ſo; but the Perſon of the Son of GOD did ſo or ſo in his humane Nature; or the humane Nature of the ſecond Perſon in the Godhead did ſo.— Hence, the Doings and Sufferings of that Nature have their Value and Merit; for they properly belong to the Son of GOD. They are his perſonal Acts; tho' not the Acts of the Divine Nature, yet the Acts of a Divine Perſon in humane Nature, or the Acts of the humane Nature of a Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. His Natures are two, Humane and Divine; his Perſon but one, even that ſame Divine Perſon
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:006193_0004_102807D50889E5D8"/>
that was with the Firſt and Third Perſons in the Godhead before all Worlds. Hence it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the humane Nature to ſin; becauſe all it's Actions were the Actions of a Perſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly and infinitely Holy.— If it be objected, That by the ſame Way of Arguing, no natural Weakneſſes and Infirmities could be attributed to the humane Nature of CHRIST, as Hunger, Thirſt, Wearineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Body Ignorance of ſome Things, Sorrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Soul; becauſe the Perſon of the Son of GOD was infinitely above all theſe Imperfections: — It may be anſwered, That tho' it was impoſſible for a Divine Perſon to be ſubject to any of thoſe innocent Infirmities in his Divine Nature; yet it was poſſible and much for his declarative Glory to aſſume a Nature ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to theſe innocent Weakneſſes; but it would be infinitely diſhonourable, and ſo infinitely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that the humane Nature of a Divine Perſon ſhould be ſubject to any <hi>ſinful</hi> Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And then the Perſon of the Son of GOD has his own humane Nature abſolutely under his Power, and he can't poſſibly ſuffer it to ſin. — Hence alſo the Man CHRIST JESUS, even when here on Earth in his Humiliation, ſpeaks in Language ſometimes proper only to the Divine Nature as, <hi>Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was</hi> I am; for tho' the Words were uttered by the humane Nature,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006193_0005_102807D9021BA470"/>
yet the Perſon to whom that Nature belonged was really and truly GOD. — So the Man JESUS made no Scruple of receiving divine Worſhip and Adoration from Men, thereby <hi>making Himſelf equal with GOD;</hi> for he was conſcious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that He was truly and properly GOD, as well as Man.—</p>
            <p>The humane Nature of CHRIST was every Way like the humane Nature of another Man, Sin only excepted. While it was on Earth it was (with that Exception) every Way like unto Men in their imperfect State: And it is no where aſſerted in Scripture, that I know of, (whatever Tradition has been pretended to hand down) that there was any Thing in his Countenance or outward Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance (except at his Transfiguration) that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed him from his Brethren; unleſs that <hi>his Viſage was more marred,</hi> &amp;c. — And the Endowments of his humane Mind differed only in Degree from thoſe of other holy Men: He had the ſame Kind of Knowledge, Wiſdom, Love, Courage, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> but only in an high. Degree He was always full of theſe Things; there was no ſinful Deficiency: And theſe Endowments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and grew in him as he grew in Years. There was a Time when he did not (as Man) know his Right Hand from his Left, nor his own Mother from another Woman; but he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006193_0005_102807D9021BA470"/>
in Knowledge, Wiſdom, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> as other Children do, by the ſame Means and in the ſame Manner; but with this Difference, that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved his Powers and Advantages to the utmoſt. Even when a Child he never omitted one Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of getting Increaſe in Wiſdom, Knowledge, <hi/> was never chargeable with the leaſt Degree of Indifferency, Negligence or Careleſsneſs; never ſpent one Moment's Time in Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, Recreation, <hi/> but what ought to be ſo ſpent. And his Improvements were vaſtly quick and large, but ſtill gradual as he grew in Age and Stature.</p>
            <p>What Degree of Wiſdom, Knowledge, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> the humane Nature had more for it's Union with the Divine, was purely according to the Will and Pleaſure of the Divine Perſon. As our bodily Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are in great Meaſure under the Command of a Spirit belonging to the ſame Perſon (the Body often ſees, hears, taſtes, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> at the Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Soul;) So the humane Nature knew and acted nothing beyond the Power and Reach of a mere humane Capacity, but only as the Divine Perſon was pleaſed to communicate. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the humane Nature of CHRIST knew not but there were Figgs on the Figg-Tree, till he came near enough to ſee; and yet at another Time that ſame humane Nature knew and could
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006193_0006_102807DAD8AC19E0"/>
anſwer the Thoughts of Men's Hearts, when the Divine was pleaſed to communicate that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. So, the humane Nature while he did not know the particular Day and Hour of the laſt Judgment; and yet at the ſame Time he knew and could foretel the moſt remarkable Events that were to fall out, from the Time then preſent, to the End of the World, and the very Circumſtances of the Laſt Judgment.</p>
            <p>[By the Way, it is ſo far from being a Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to CHRIST'S Perſon, to ſpeak of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Imperfections of the humane Nature, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Scripture Light, that it is the great Illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of his condeſcending Love, that he would take the humane Nature into perſonal Union with the Divine, under ſuch Circumſtances.]</p>
            <p>JESUS CHRIST had all the innocent Paſſions and Affections of the humane Nature; ſuch as Love, Hatred, Joy, Sorrow, Anger, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> and they were moved and wrought upon after the ſame Manner with thoſe of other Men; ſtill always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting any ſinful Imperfection, which thoſe who think aright of theſe Things, will continually bear in their Minds. To inſtance here only in one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, inſtead of many: Tho' he knew the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and was doubtleſs think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it all along his Journey from <hi>Galiiee,</hi> yet we read not of any extraordinary Motion of the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006193_0006_102807DAD8AC19E0"/>
Paſſions, till his Eye affected his Heart: Then, 'tis ſaid, <hi>He beheld the City and wept over it.</hi>— His Body alſo was expoſed to all thoſe Uneaſineſſes and Pains, that another humane Body is, and poſſibly much more ſenſible of them, as being prepared for that very Purpoſe to be the Seat of Sufferings. As the Senſes of Man in Innocency were ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived as to be ſo many Avenues of Pleaſure from every Quarter; ſo the bodily Senſes of the LORD JESUS were deſigned as ſo many Conduits to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey into his Soul the bitter Waters of the Curſe due to the Elect.—Whether the humane Nature of CHRIST were liable to a natural Death by Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Age or no, has been doubted; but we know it was ſubject to a violent one. And what there ſhould be in his Conſtitution (who was made of a Woman) that ſhould preſerve him from the Decays of Age, and the mortal Diſeaſes that Men in General are expoſed to, is not revealed. It was by ſpecial Providence that he was preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Death, natural or violent, till his Hour was come.</p>
            <p>And as the humane Nature of CHRIST was <hi>like unto ſinful Fleſh</hi> in this World; ſo I know of no Reaſon to think now it is in Glory, that there is any eſſential Difference betwixt that and thoſe of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> that are there in their whole Perſons, and what thoſe of all the Saints will be
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006193_0007_102807DE12B86390"/>
after the Reſurrection. The humane Nature of CHRIST in Heaven, conſidered as diſtinct from the Divine, is no more than a Man perfect in all created humane Excellencies. It ſtill remains finite in every Power and Faculty and Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both or Body and Soul, and muſt neceſſarily do ſo forever.</p>
            <p>Whatever Alterations there may be in his <hi>Body,</hi> on the Account of which it may be termed a <hi>ſpiritual Body;</hi> yet ſtill it is a humane Body, and ſubject to the ſame Laws of Matter and Motion that other Bodies are. The Alterations that Bodies are ſubject to here below, are exceeding great and wonderful: To inſtance only in that of a Tallow Candle, Suppoſe an Inch of it, What a norrow Compaſs does it lie in? What a dull and motionleſs little Lump is it? yet do but touch it to another that is lighted and what a Change is there made? It flames and ſhines and diffuſes it's Light, not only through the whole Room, diſcovering that which lay hid in Darkneſs there, but ſpreads itſelf far and wide, and lies (as they tell us, that Study thoſe Things) after the Rate of ſome Millions of Miles, in a Minute. All this ſpreading ſhining Flame is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that ſame little Piece of Tallow that lay a Minute before covered in the ſame Darkneſs with other Things about the Houſe, only putting

on another Form, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — So the humane Body, tho' perhaps transformed into pure celeſtial Light, (which is moſt like Spirit or any material Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance we can conceive of) ſo that it may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſpread it ſelf many thouſands of Miles round in a Minute; and then in another Minute, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract itſelf into the narrow Compaſs of a few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and appear in what Shape the Soul pleaſes; as we read of his appearing ſometimes in one Form and ſometimes in another; yet ſtill it is but the ſame Body in a different Form, that was confined within the Dimenſions of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary humane Body while here below, and could neither extend or contract it ſelf into any other Limits, nor appear in any other Form.</p>
            <p>And ſo whatever Change the humane <hi>Soul</hi> of CHRIST may have undergone by his Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; how vaſtly ſoever the Powers and Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof are enlarged, and all filled to the Brim with Knowledge and Grace, yea with all the communicable Fulneſs of the Godhead; yet ſtill it is but a finite, humane Soul, infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Perfection of the Divine Nature, and muſt of Neceſſity continue ſo ſorever.</p>
            <p>As CHRIST'S humane Nature is in all other ſinleſs Reſpects like other Men, ſo it has a <hi>humane Love.</hi> He had, when here, a natural Affection to his Relations, and a peculiar Love to ſome
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006193_0008_102807E224793FF0"/>
particular Perſons, that either had no Grace at all, as the <hi>young Man</hi> in the Goſpel, or that had no more Grace than ſome others, it may be as the beloved Diſciple <hi>John.</hi> And he had a common Love to all Mankind: As he was in ſome Senſe <hi>the Saviour of all Men,</hi> ſo he had ſtrong Deſires of the Salvation of every individual Perſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Diſtinction of Elect and Reprobate. Nor could he know, as <hi>Man,</hi> unleſs it were made known to him by ſpecial Revelation, who among the Unconverted were the choſen of GOD, and who were not; and therefore did, as his faithful Servants do, labour for the Good of all; and it was the Grief of his Heart that his Labours were no more ſucceſsful. And this was no doubt (next to ſeeing his heavenly Father diſhonour'd) one of the greateſt Afflictions he met with while here, to ſee his Neighbours, (whom he <hi>loved as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> according to the Law he was made under) continually wounding and deſtroying their own Souls, and ſlighting and neglecting the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. That ſame Affection that glowed in the Heart and flamed out of the Mouth of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> towards his <hi>Brethren according to the Fleſh,</hi> was in a far higher Degree (the Sinfulneſs of it excepted) in the Heart of the Lord JESUS towards all Mankind, without Diſtinction: He did actually make himſelf a <hi>Curſe</hi> for them. Tho'
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006193_0008_102807E224793FF0"/>
as GOD he had his Eye and Love in an eſpecial Manner on the Elect; yet as Man (and that is the Nature we are ſpeaking of) he was not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as was ſaid, of making the Diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and others. No, when he looked round from the Croſs on the great Crowd of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were gathered together on that Occaſion, he loved and pitied them all, without Diſtinction, except one of a thouſand perhaps, whom he knew to be Converts by his perſonal Acquaintance with them. There was not one of that vaſt Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that (as Man) he could know was not to be converted about ſix Weeks after, when the Spirit was to be poured out in ſuch a wonderful Manner, unleſs it were particularly revealed to him, and unleſs there were ſome among them who he knew had committed the unpardonable Sin. And what large Additions, may we ſuppoſe it made to the Floods of Sorrow and Diſtreſs that were then pouring in upon him on all Sides, to ſee thoſe whom he loved ſo as to be then actually dying for them; yea, ſome Thouſands of whom he knew were eternally to reap the Benefit of his Sufferings, and to lie in his Boſom forever, all joining to mook and deride him in his Agonies, and like the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> over <hi>Sampſon,</hi> to ſhout and triumph, as having got him whom they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the common Enemy of their Nation,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006193_0009_102807E4D742B258"/>
nailed to the Croſs, and dying the Death of the worſt of Malefactors? It was a Man, the moſt loving, kind, tender-hearted Man, that ever was born of a Woman that ſaw all this; they were his own Fleſh and Blood, and the dearly beloved of his Soul, who were the Actors in this bloody Tragedy.—</p>
            <p>— The humane Nature of the Lord JESUS CHRIST is mentioned as one great Thing that qualified him to be the <hi>Judge</hi> of the World. All Judgment is committed unto him, <hi>becauſe he is the Son of Man.</hi> GOD will judge the World in Righteouſneſs by that <hi>Man</hi> whom he hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Judge will be, not only the Heart-ſearching GOD, but one that had, and ſtill has all the eſſential Properties of the humane Nature: One that not only has the ſame Nature with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be judged; but one that loved them, many of them perſonally, with a real ſtrong Affection.</p>
            <p>The Saints will be peculiarly happy in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of GOD in <hi>their own Nature.</hi> A great Part of the rational Creature's Happineſs conſiſts in <hi>Society</hi> that is <hi>ſuitable.</hi> Some have thought <q>this is ſo eſſential to Happineſs, that a Plurality of Perſons in GOD might be inferred from this Conſideration alone; That to have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in mutual Knowledge, Love and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the very Eſſence of Felicity, and that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006193_0009_102807E4D742B258"/>
a Being in all Reſpects perfectly ſingle and alone, without any more Perſons than one ſubſiſting in his Eſſence, cannot be completely happy.</q>—</p>
            <p>In order to Society's being <hi>ſuitable,</hi> it muſt be between Parties that have the ſame Nature: So that tho' <hi>Adam,</hi> when he was firſt made might have Communion with GOD, and with the holy Angels, and had a World of Creatures round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him at his Command; yet he was ſaid to be <hi>alone,</hi> and it was <hi>not good</hi> for him to be ſo alone, and therefore GOD made him one of the ſame Nature to be an <hi>Help-meet</hi> for him. And when his Companion was brought to him, he takes particular Notice of it, that ſhe was <hi>Bone of his Bone,</hi> and taken out of the <hi>Man,</hi> one of the ſame Nature with himſelf.</p>
            <p>GOD having a Deſign to make Creatures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding happy, probably far more ſo than the Angels, the happieſt Creatures he at firſt made; was pleaſed, in order to this, to permit them to fall into the Depth of Miſery (which was a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance greatly tending to inhance their Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) and then to advance them, not only to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Angels, of a Nature different from their own, and to Communion with Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, of a Nature infinitely above them; but to Communion with and Enjoyment of a <hi>Perſon</hi> that had really in Him all the Glory and Excellency and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006193_0010_102807E685290B80"/>
All-ſufficiency of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> (for He is really and truly GOD) and alſo all the Suitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Agreeableneſs of the <hi>Human Nature</hi> in the utmoſt Perfection; and that in as ſtrict and cloſe a <hi>Union</hi> with him, as 'tis poſſible for diſtinct Perſons to be joined in, one to another, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the Perſons of the bleſſed Trinity them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. So that, as far as we can learn, the Elect of Mankind are to be the happieſt of all created Perſons, and the happieſt of all created Beings, except the humane Nature of CHRIST; who <hi>in all Things must have the Preheminence,</hi> and who is not a created Perſon, but one of the two Natures (as was ſaid) in the uncreated Perſon of the eternal Son of GOD.</p>
            <p>Though the humane Nature of CHRIST be now in a glorified State, and his preſent Happineſs is great, far beyond our Conceptions; yet it ſeems, that it muſt needs be far ſhort of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which he will enjoy when he ſhall have the <hi>whole Body</hi> of his beloved Elect with him in Glory. According to our Way of Thinking, it cannot but be an Alloy to his Felicity, to think that ſo many Thouſands of the Members of his myſtical Body, more dear to him than the Eyes of his natural Body, are ſtill left in ſuch a diſmal State of Sin and Sorrow, and are to continue ſo long in ſuch a Condition; yea, that ſome of his Elect
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006193_0010_102807E685290B80"/>
are at preſent in a State of Enmity againſt him, and under the abſolute Tyranny of Sin and Satan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — If it be ſaid, That he knows it's beſt it ſhould be ſo, 'tis agreeable to his Father's Will, and moſt for his Glory, and will finally iſſue in the beſt Good of all his Choſen; It may be replied, That he had the ſame Proſpect of Things by <hi>Faith,</hi> when he was in his Agony in the Garden, and on the Croſs: He knew that all was for the beſt, infinitely ſo; yet he was far from being then in the actual Enjoyment of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Happineſs; ſo far, that all his own Faith, which was ſinleſs and perfect, and the Aſſiſtance of an Angel ſtrengthening of him, was but juſt ſufficient to preſerve him from ſinking under the amazing Weight that then lay upon him. And though his preſent exceeding great Glory, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a clear Proſpect of what he, and all his, are ſhortly to enjoy together in Perfection, and for ever, is abundantly more than enough to over-ballance every leſs comfortable View and Proſpect of Things, which he has more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before him; yet one would be apt to think a finite humane Nature muſt needs be far leſs happy in the moſt realizing <hi>Belief</hi> of Things <hi>to come,</hi> than in the <hi>preſent Enjoyment</hi> of them. It is ſpoken of as neceſſary in order to the Perfection of Happineſs, that what is <hi>in Part</hi> ſhould be <hi>done
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006193_0011_102807E81E7447A8"/>
away,</hi> that what is <hi>perfect</hi> may come; and that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> ſhould give Place to the perfect Reſt of <hi>Love</hi> in actual Fruition.</p>
            <p>It may be Matter of Doubt, whether any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Nature, even that of the Man CHRIST JESUS himſelf is capable of enjoying ſo much Happineſs at any <hi>one</hi> ſet Time, as it may be by a <hi>Progreſſion,</hi> or going forward; and whether it be not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable Property of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> to enjoy ſo much Felicity <hi>at once,</hi> that there can be <hi>no Addition</hi> made to it: And if ſo, Whether there is not Reaſon to believe, GOD will add this one Property more to the unſpeakable Happineſs of the humane Nature of CHRIST, that it ſhall be <hi>eternally Progreſſive,</hi> or growing and increaſing forever; and that this will be granted to the Members, as well as the Head. Surely the bleſſed GOD is infinitely far from grudging to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature of his own Son, and the Objects of his ſpecial Love, any Qualification in their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that ſhall render it <hi>more deſireable:</hi> Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering, that he deſigns his own Glory in the Creature's Happineſs, and that they are naturally and ſtrongly inclined to give him all the Praiſe of it forever; and that he himſelf (as 'tis infinite Reaſon) will be never the leſs peerleſs and unrivalled in his own boundleſs Happineſs, how far ſo ever any of his Creatures ſhall advance in
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006193_0011_102807E81E7447A8"/>
their's. For let Creatures be advancing never ſo faſt and never ſo far in Happineſs, ſuppoſing that of all the Saints and Angels in Heaven were to be doubled to each particular Perſon every Minute to Eternity, yet this will never bring them one Hair's Breadth nearer in Degree to the Felicity of the bleſſed GOD: For Infinity has no Degrees. All Additions to what is Finite brings it no nearer to what is Infinite, than it was at firſt.</p>
            <p>If it be aſked, why it was neceſſary that the <hi>Two Natures</hi> in the Mediator ſhould make but <hi>One Perſon?</hi> It is anſwered, That no other Being, but ſuch a one, could perform what was to be done for the Elect's Salvation. For if you could ſuppoſe a Being conſiſting of two Perſons, one humane, the other Divine, (as the Godhead ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in three divine Perſons,) ſuch a ſuppoſed Being could not have been a ſuitable Mediator. For tho' the humane Perſon could have done and ſuffered what was proper, yet it would have been only of a finite Value, and ſo could not have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Needs of Sinners, who were infinitely indebted to Divine Juſtice; and what the Divine Perſon could have done, would not have been ſuitable, it being in another Nature than that of the Sinner's, and ſuch a Divine Perſon could not have ſuffered at all.— But now, in the Perſon of CHRIST there is a humane Nature that is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006193_0012_102807EBB5A61D98"/>
of Doing and Suffering as much and more than any humane Perſon, ſuppoſing him perfect, could do, and all that is ſo done and ſuffered is really and properly the Act of a Perſon infinite and divine, and ſo of infinite Value; and that divine Perſon under no natural Obligations to do or ſuffer any Thing of this, and ſo it might be imputed to the Perſons who needed it for their Juſtification and Salvation.</p>

inviolable Truth, <hi/> they are all only the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the manifold Love of GOD. Sin it ſelf the worſt of Evils, and Hell the next worſt; the one was permitted, and the other was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the more clear and full Diſplay of the Love of GOD forever and ever. 'Tis mere pure unmixed Love that damns Angels and Men: Love to Juſtice and Holineſs; Love to GOD'S own Elect, whoſe Injuries he avenges, and whoſe eternal Perſeverance in Holineſs and Happineſs, as well as their high Degrees of Gratitude, may be more promoted by the Conſideration of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery that Sin has brought upon their Fellow-Creatures, than Men in their preſent imperfect State are capable of conceiving. And what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Worlds of rational Creatures are to take everlaſting Warning by the forlorn State of the greateſt Part of the Inhabitants of this little Spot of Clay, is known only to the Maker of them; at leaſt, whoever knows, 'tis a Secret to us who are forbidden to be wiſe above what is written.

Of the former, <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Perſon ſpeaking in the Words above written was as eminent an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006193_0013_102807EE690678D0"/>
as almoſt any we read of in Scripture; and perhaps no Inſtance in profane Hiſtory does in any Meaſure equal it: Very few if any among mere Men deſerved better from the Hands of his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Creatures than he from his Childhood up, and few received worſe. He was dutiful to his Parents, faithful, loving, obliging, and officious to his Brethren, and pious to his GOD from his very Childhood: And when he came to ſuſtain new Relations and Circumſtances vaſtly different, yea quite contrary to what he had been in before, yet ſtill he exemplified in the whole of his Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour the ſame Spirit of Wiſdom and Grace that he had ſhewn before. But how was this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Perſon treated? He was envied, hated, mocked, ſold for a Slave for Life, and very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly eſcaped being murdered by his obliged Brethren: He was reproved by his fond Father, when perhaps he did not deſerve it; He was falſely accuſed after he had been wickedly tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his firſt enamoured and then enraged Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; He was ſuſpected, caſt off, and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Maſter, whoſe Conſcience as well as his own had given Teſtimony to his univerſal Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, the remarkable Preſence of GOD with him, and His extraordinary Bleſſing upon all his Affairs for <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Sake. And whatever Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Favour, Liberty and Truſt he had during
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006193_0014_102807F2B7B959B0"/>
his Confinement, yet it ſeems for ſome Part, and perhaps the greateſt Part of the Time, (which was ſeveral Years,) he was laid in Affliction and Iron, yea the Iron did eat into his Soul: And after he was as it were tantalized with ſome Hope of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance by the Intereſt at Court, he might in all Reaſon expect the Juſtice and Gratitude of the chief Butler would incline him to make for him, this Hope deferred made his Heart ſick for two Years more. What the Diſtreſſes of his Heart, and what the more inviſible Aſſaults and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his grand Adverſary were all this while, is not recorded; but beſure his greateſt and beſt Friend overuled and ordered it all, and yet — <hi>GOD meant it unto Good. — Joſeph</hi> himſelf tells us ſo, and he was the greateſt Sufferer, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you will ſuppoſe his tender Father (with whom you will eaſily conceive he bitterly ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathized) might poſſibly endure as much as he. His hard-hearted Brethren beſure by all that is revealed, were very little affected, they ſat down to eat and drink in the midſt of their poor Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Diſtreſs; and if they did not riſe up to Play like the idolatrous <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> yet they did that which was worſe: All their Concern was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive a Device to cover their own Guilt, and to deceive, not to comfort, their poor Father, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they pretended. I ſay <hi>Joſeph</hi> himſelf who
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006193_0014_102807F2B7B959B0"/>
had the greateſt Shew of Reaſon to complain of Severity, as the beſt of Men under extraordinary Afflictions have ſometimes done, yet confeſſes as in the Words once and again repeated, <hi>GOD meant it unto Good:</hi>— He meant it for Good to <hi>Joſeph</hi> himſelf; to his mourning diſponding and almoſt diſpairing Father; to his cruel Brethren; to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and Neighbour Nations; to the Church of the Jews; to the whole Catholick Church; to the World of Mankind; and to the holy Angels: All this may be eaſily gathered from Revelation; and what other Worlds do, and ſhall reap Benefit by this myſterious Diſpenſation of Providence is not for us to conjecture, we muſt leave it to GOD and Time or at leaſt Eternity to diſcover.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>GOD meant it for Good to</hi> Joſeph <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> It was to humble him and prove him, and do him good in his latter End.— He was by this Means early and effectually taken off from the Vanities and Follies which Youth are expoſed to, and moſt of them forever undone by. For tho' his Circumſtances in <hi>Egypt</hi> at firſt were ſuch as abundantly ſupplied him with all the Delights of Senſe, being ſoon made a Steward in the Houſe of a rich Gentleman, yet it is plain enough that he was in a wonderful Degree cold and dead to thoſe youthful Luſts that ſuch a Condition might
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006193_0015_102807F5A1D748C8"/>
have expoſed him unto. His early Piety was much improved and advanced doubtleſs by a Courſe of ſore Affliction, and we have no Reaſon to think he was denied thoſe inward Comforts and Refreſhments which a gracious GOD is wont to allow to his afflicted Children. It was true then, as well as it has been often found by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſince, that <hi>Tribulation worketh Patience, Patience Experience, and Experience Hope, and Hope maketh not aſhamed, becauſe the Love of GOD is ſhed abroad in the Heart.</hi> As his Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions abounded, we may well ſuppoſe his Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in CHRIST, in the promiſed MESSIAH, in whom he believed, abounded alſo.—He was hereby prepared for great future Honour and Advancement, to be made the ſecond Man in one of the greateſt Kingdoms then in the World, even Ruler over all the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to bind their Princes at his Pleaſure, and to teach their Senators Wiſdom. And his Afflictions were ordered for his Humiliation, and the Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Corruptions; without which Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his Proſperity in all likelihood would have deſtroyed him, he would have been lifted up with Pride, and fallen into the Condemnation of the Devil. So his living firſt in a Courtier's Family, and afterwards converſing ſo long and ſo familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with two great Men his Fellow-Priſoners, was
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006193_0015_102807F5A1D748C8"/>
wiſely ordered (as in the Caſe of <hi>David, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> and others) for his great Improvement in the Knowledge of State-Affairs, and ſo fitting him for the Poſt he was deſigned for. And he being an Interpreter of Dreams, and having his own always in his Mind, and ſo being apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in ſome Degree what was before him; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs made the beſt Improvement he could of all the Advantages he had put into his Hands to qualify himſelf for his future Advancement, and his being uſeful and ſerviceable therein: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus in one Reſpect and another, prepared for his Enlargement and Exaltation; it was indeed <hi>good</hi> unto him, and really a Step towards the Crown of Glory reſerved for him in the Heavens, and that extraordinary Recompence of Reward, that far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory, which his uncommon Sufferings and ſpecial Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices done for the Church of GOD and the World, and the eminent Degrees of Grace exerciſed therein had wrought for him by working him up to a ſuitable Frame and Temper to receive and poſſeſs the ſame. This was the Good that GOD meant to <hi>Joſeph:</hi> to ſay nothing particularly of the unſpeakable Comfort and Satisfaction he had in manifeſting himſelf to his Brethren, in ſending ſuch joyful Tydings to his dear Father; together with a plentiful Supply for his preſent pinching
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006193_0016_102807F8285F1540"/>
Neceſſity, in receiving him into his Arms when he came into <hi>Egypt,</hi> in requiting him for his ſeventeen Years tender Care over him in his Childhood and Youth, by nouriſhing him for the like Number of Years in his decrepid old Age; in rewarding Good for Evil to his penitent Brethren; (a godlike Pleaſure!) in being a Father to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> and his People, and a ſort of Saviour and common Benefactor to the World round about him; and which was the greateſt Honour and Pleaſure of all, (it may be) knowing himſelf to be herein a great and remarkable Type of CHRIST, who is the Saviour of all Men, eſpecially of them that believe: or if he had not ſo clear and diſtinct a Knowledge how all the Steps of his Humiliation and Exaltation, his rough Carriage to his Brethren at firſt, and his kind Treatment of them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and being a common Deliverer, were to ſignify glorious ſpiritual good Things to come in the Fulneſs of Time; yet he has a perfect Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of theſe Things in the heavenly World, which is the beſt of all: — He was alſo a large Sharer in the Good GOD meant more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>To his Father</hi> Jacob. He had ſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in his Haſte, <hi>All theſe Things are against me,</hi> and threatened that he would go down to the Grave mourning for his Son; but all thoſe
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006193_0016_102807F8285F1540"/>
Things were made to work together for his Good. His darling Son, whom it is to be feared he had too much ſet his Affection upon, was taken away to make Room for his GOD to ſit unrival'd on the Throne of his Heart; and reſerved (againſt he was prepared for ſo great a Favour) to be the greateſt Comfort and Bleſſing that ever a Son was to a Father. Inſtead of going to the Grave mourning for his Son, he was to enjoy him in the moſt happy Circumſtances for many Years, to ſee his Children and Children's Children, and to bleſs them and the reſt of his numerous and proſperous Offſpring by the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, wherewith he was filled in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Manner on his dying Bed: and by the ſame Spirit alſo he was to ſee the Day of CHRIST'S Appearance, and be glad; and in the midſt of theſe glorious Views to expire in the Embraces of his beloved <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and with his Hands cloſing his Eyes, and to enter into the full Poſſeſſion of that Salvation which his Soul waited for; while his ſurviving Son was embalming his Body and celebrating his Funeral in a princely Manner, and conveying his precious Duſt into the Land of Promiſe, the Type of Heaven, where it is to reſt with thoſe of <hi>Abraham, Sarah, Iſaac, Rebecca, &amp;c,</hi> who were laid to ſleep before, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> and the reſt of his Sons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who were to come

after, when they had finiſhed their Courſe, which was at preſent thro' a Scene of great Proſperity, to reſt I ſay till the Reſurrection of the Juſt, when they are all to be raiſed up in Glory. And they will then have a full and clear and raviſhing View of GOD's wiſe and gracious Deſigns in all his Diſpenſations, and this dark Providence in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: <hi>they all,</hi> I ſay, for</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) GOD meant it for Good to <hi>Joſeph's Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> alſo. They meant it for evil: But GOD'S Tho'ts were not as their Thoughts, nor his Ways as their Ways; No, widely, infinitely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; as high as the Heavens are above the Earth, ſo were his Tho'ts above their Tho'ts; as contrary as Heaven is to Hell, ſo were his Ways to their Ways. Some think they were good Men at the Time that they treated their pious loving Brother ſo treacherouſly and barbarouſly, and that they lay under the Guilt of that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Crime for twenty Years together. On what they build their large Charity I know not. Such a Superſtructure had need have a ſolid Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But whatever their <hi>State</hi> was at that Time, it is certain they were got into a very bad <hi>Frame.</hi> Any Man would have been tempted (that had ſeen what Pride and Envy, Malice and Revenge, unnatural Cruelty and diabolical Subtilty they were then a practicing) to have ſaid unto them,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:006193_0017_102807FBCCCB73A0"/>
               <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil, and his Works ye will do.</hi> Yet GOD meant it for good, even unto <hi>Them:</hi> For their <hi>temporal Good</hi> we are very ſure: This was a neceſſary Means of ſaving their Lives when in extream Danger of Famiſhing, they and their Families, and of changing their outward Circumſtances much for the better; even from the Condition of poor wandering Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds in the Land of Promiſe, (where they had no Place of their own ſo much as to ſet their Foot on, except the Poſſeſſion of a Burying-Place) into that of a comfortable Settlement in the beſt Spot of Ground in all the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to be employed in Places of Truſt and Profit as Herdſmen to the King of that Country, under the Care and Nurture of a Brother, great and powerful like a King, and kind and tender as a Father or Mother. And 'tis generally concluded this was not the beſt of it neither: 'Tis thought they had Repentance given them for their high Crimes and Miſdemeanours, and Remiſſion of their Sins. And perhaps while the Lord of the Land was humbling them and diſtreſſing them, and afterwards forgiving, comforting, feaſting them, and providing Inheritances for them, acting in all under a divine Impulſe, and as a Type of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, the Saints once humbled but now exalted Brother; He
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:006193_0018_102807FF9A9826B8"/>
(who was the principal Perſon offended and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed in all their ill Treatment of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and who loved them notwithſtanding infinitely better than their natural Brother, loved them with an everlaſting Love) was now drawing them with his loving Kindneſs, and by his Spirit acting over upon their Hearts and Conſciences, what the Type was doing outwardly and viſibly. Who can tell, but the LORD was now repreſenting Himſelf to them as an offended, angry, holy, Sin-revenging Judge, and bringing their Sins to Remembrance, and ſetting them in Order before them? They ſeem to intimate as much, <hi>The Lord hath found out the Iniquity of thy Servants; we are verily Guilty, &amp;c.</hi> And when <hi>Joſeph</hi> put them in Priſon, who knows but they had then a lively Senſe, how they deſerved to be laid in Chains of Darkneſs in the Dungeon of Hell for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever? And when their Money was returned once and again in their Sacks-Mouth, at which they were ſo terrified; Who can tell but GOD might be flinging their Self-righteous Prayers and Tears and Vows which they poured out before him, as Dung in their Faces? And when they were ſufficiently humbled under the preparatory Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Holy Ghoſt, which laſted for ſeveral Weeks, it may be, together; while they were held in Suſpence how they ſhould be at laſt dealt with
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:006193_0018_102807FF9A9826B8"/>
by the Governour of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who then to their Surprize and Aſtoniſhment ſaid unto them, <hi>I am</hi> Joſeph <hi>your Brother, whom you ſold into</hi> Egypt; might not the Governor of the Univerſe, who has all Power in Heaven and Earth committed into his Hands, diſcover himſelf to them as their reconciled Friend and Brother, fill them with Joy and Peace in Believing, Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory, and give them a good Hope through Grace of an Intereſt in the Inheritance incorruptible, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for them? And when afterwards not only they, but all the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were obliged to go to <hi>Joſeph</hi> for the Supply of their Wants; Who dare deny that the Holy Spirit might in his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Way of Working, teach them ſavingly the Doctrine of the Mediation of CHRIST; how He is the Head of all Influences to the Church; how it hath pleaſed the Father that in Him all Fulneſs ſhould dwell; and how of his Fulneſs all Believers receive and Grace for Grace, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Such Things as theſe are implied when it is ſuppoſed that theſe Patriarchs were true Saints; for all that are truly taught of GOD in all Ages do experience theſe Things, as to the Subſtance; and even the leſſer Circumſtances of the Experiences of Old-Teſtament and New-Teſtament Believers, may be more alike than Chriſtians are now generally

            <p n="4">(4.) <hi>GOD meant it for Good to the</hi> Egyptians <hi>and the</hi> Neighbour Nations. For had it not been for this, <hi>Egypt</hi> would have been deſtroyed; <hi>and the Famine was ſore in all Lands,</hi> who alſo came to <hi>Egypt</hi> to buy Corn. And how uſeful ſuch a Body of Herdſmen coming into a Country where that Art had been but little improved, might be, and how far by their Inſtructions and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples they might be Inſtrumental of bringing many of them to the Knowledge of the only true GOD, and Faith in the MESSIAH to come; we are left at Uncertainties: But certain we are from abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Scripture-Evidence</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) That <hi>GOD meant it for Good to the Church of the</hi> Jews. For the whole Body of them was comprehended in that Handful of People that then went down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> as it had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the ſmaller Families of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac.</hi> The Church was now, as well as at many other Times, in imminent Danger; but GOD ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, <hi>Deſtroy it not, for a Bleſſing is in it:</hi> A Bleſſing indeed, the Spring and Sum of all Bleſſings, even the MESSIAH, He of whom it is propheſied and promiſed that <hi>in Him all the Families of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed:</hi> And ſo</p>

               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:006193_0019_10280802A8A72290"/>(6.) <hi>GOD meant it for Good to the whole</hi> Catholick Church, <hi>to the Body of the Elect in all Ages, and all Nations from the Beginning to the End of the World.</hi> The Saviour and ſo the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the whole Number of GOD'S choſen, was bound up in that Family of <hi>Jacob:</hi> If they had periſhed, the whole Project of Man's Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt have utterly failed and fallen to the Ground: If the Line of CHRIST could have been cut off before he came into the World, and ſo his Birth, Life, Death, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, have been prevented; not one Soul could ever have been ſaved: Yea, thoſe that had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready admitted into Heaven muſt have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled and ſent down to ſuffer the Vengeance of eternal Fire; for divine Juſtice muſt be ſatisfied, and if the Surety had fail'd, the principal Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors muſt have been ſiezed again, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Law muſt have been anſwered, for <hi>not one Jot nor Tittle of the Law ſhall paſs till all be fulfilled.</hi> But this was utterly impoſſible, and therefore ſo it was that <hi>Iſrael</hi> (in the Loins of ſome of whom CHRIST now was) ſhould be cut off by Famine or any other Way: And did GOD in very Deed mean this by the ſtrange Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of his Providence toward <hi>Joſeph?</hi> Well may it then be ſaid, <hi>GOD meant it unto Good,</hi> For, who can tell? who can conceive,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:006193_0020_102808060004AB50"/>
how great that Good is that is laid up for GOD'S Choſen, the <hi>Called according to his Purpoſe? Eye has not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor hath entred into the Heart of Man, what GOD has laid up and prepared for thoſe that love him;</hi> and yet in the ſame Place it is ſaid, <hi>He hath revealed the ſame to his People by his Spirit.</hi> This Good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all Good that can poſſibly be deſired; yea, it is GOD himſelf the Fountain and Author of all. The Happineſs of the Bleſſed in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is the ſame as the Happineſs of GOD, as far as a Creature is capable of partaking of the ſame. GOD has no other Happineſs, that we can conceive of, but to know and love, enjoy and glorify himſelf; and this is Happineſs: <hi>This Honour have all the Saints,</hi> in their Meaſure; they are as full of it as they can hold. And then, this Good is everlaſting, without any Intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without any End. And if what many holy as well as learned Divines have thought to be true, <hi>viz,</hi> That the Happineſs of Heaven is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive; this adds infinitely to every other Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration we can make uſe of to raiſe our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions concerning the Greatneſs of it, even that of Eternity it ſelf. For, the leaſt Degree of Happineſs to increaſe forever and ever, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more deſirable than the greateſt fixed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Happineſs of the ſame Kind that can be
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006193_0020_102808060004AB50"/>
conceived of: for the leaſt Meaſure will, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually increaſing, come to be equal to the greateſt that is fixed, ſuppoſe it were that of all the Hoſts of Heaven put together; and then after it is arrived to that Meaſure, it has as long to remain increaſing and growing, as when it firſt began. —But however this Matter be, there is enough revealed of the Good contained in this Salvation, this Saviour, to draw forth the utmoſt Deſires and Endeavours of the largeſt Soul, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any more Suppoſitions that are not ſo plainly ſounded in the Word of GOD. This Good GOD meant to the Elect, in the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we have been ſpeaking of. And there was moreover,</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) <hi>A Deſign of good to</hi> all Mankind. For CHRIST, who as was ſaid is included in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation then granted to the Church, is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of all Men, tho' eſpecially of them that believe. Never was there one of the Humane Race, but what received ſome Benefit by the Mediation of JESUS CHRIST. The Continuance of Life, if but for an Hour, under the Poſſibility of Salvation, and all the Comforts of Life which Men in general enjoy, and the ſpecial Privileges for the obtaining Grace and Salvation which ſome are favor'd with, are the Purchaſe of the Blood of CHRIST. The bare Offer of Salvation in the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:006193_0021_1028080A1DDA1700"/>
Goſpel is a great Favour, as all they will find to their eternal Coſt, who do not accept of it, and we find GOD every where ſpeaks of it as ſuch; tho' Men's Hearts reaſon to the contrary from the ſecret Purpoſes and Decrees of GOD, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which they ſay, it will be worſe with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates than if they never had thoſe Priviledges: But ſuch Perſons know not what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm; by the ſame Rule that they thus under-value this greateſt of all common Mercies, they may with-hold their Gratitude for every Favour they receive both from GOD and Man; for it is certain, they will turn to the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of the Miſery of all that finally periſh. Now this capital Mercy, the general Offer of Salvation, has been more than once beſtowed on the World of Mankind. It was ſo in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe revealed in the Garden; it was ſo in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Time; and after CHRIST'S Reſurrection the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were ſent to preach the Goſpel to all the World; and it is from the Negligence of Men, and not any Deficiency in the Providence of GOD, that the whole World is not now goſpelized. And wherever the Goſpel is preached, it is mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Will of Man, and nothing elſe that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the ſaving Efficacy of it; tho' it is only the Power of GOD that can ſubdue and conquer that Will of Man. Nor is this Good confined to the

Inhabitants of this lower World only, But</p>
            <p n="8">(8.) <hi>GOD meant it for Good to the</hi> Angels of Heaven <hi>alſo.</hi> They are <hi>miniſtring Spirits ſent forth to miniſter to thoſe who are the Heirs of Salvation.</hi> They have a tender Concern for the good of Mankind, eſpecialiy the Elect. They rejoice in the Converſion of every Soul, and in every Providence whereby the Glory of GOD and the good of Men is promoted; and eſpecially in ſuch remarkable Providences whereby the Glory of GOD is <hi>ſo greatly</hi> promoted and the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſpiritual and eternal Good of <hi>ſo many</hi> Men is advanced. And 'tis good for them thus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, 'tis a Part of their Happineſs.— It has been all along hinted, and is neceſſarily implied, that GOD means his own Glory in the whole of this; which is the greateſt Good of all, and which he cannot but have in View as his laſt End in all his Diſpenſations towards all his Creatures, in all Worlds, in Time and to Eternity. Beſides the Manifeſtation of the Glory of all GOD'S Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, in his bringing the Saviour into the World and accompliſhing the great Work of the Elect's Salvation in general; In this Diſpenſation towards <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Family (wherein the Salvation of Men was ſaid to be ſo nearly concerned) there is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered Abundance of the Wiſdom, Power, Holineſs and Juſtice of GOD, and his tender Care
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:006193_0022_1028080BB9AE4BE0"/>
of his Children; yea of his general Goodneſs towards thoſe of Mankind that are <hi>Aliens to the Common-wealth of Iſrael and without GOD in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, If GOD meant all this for Good, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly every one that hears or reads this Paſſage of holy Scripture, ſhould fall in with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of GOD, and endeavour to get what Good they can out of it. It ſeems more eſpecially to direct it's Voice to ſuch as are under any Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Providence peculiarly dark and difficult: They may be ſure, (however Things may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to <hi>them,</hi>) GOD means it all for Good. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if they belong to GOD, they may reſt ſatisfied, not only that GOD aims at thoſe great good Ends, his own Glory and the Benefit of his Church in general; but at <hi>their</hi> beſt Good in particular. <hi>All the Paths of the Lord are Mercy and Truth</hi> to ſuch as they are. And he has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf by Promiſe, that <hi>all Things ſhall work together for their Good.</hi> And he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been faithful and true to his Word, and has never once diſappointed ſuch as have put their Truſt in him. And whatever dark and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging Thoughts they have in the Time of their Difficulties, yet in the Iſſue they have been bro't to acknowledge, not only the Sovereignty, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Holineſs of GOD, but even his Love
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:006193_0022_1028080BB9AE4BE0"/>
and Faithfulneſs towards them therein; of which there are many Examples in the Word of GOD, and in other Church-Hiſtories.</p>
            <p>How happy are they who are in ſuch a State, that they may be ſure the great GOD means them Good in all his Diſpenſations. He never was, nor can be fruſtrated and diſappointed in any of his Deſigns. Thoſe whoſe Good he aims at, may be infallibly certain, that Good ſhall come unto them. It cannot poſſibly be otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p>How ſolicitous ſhould every one be to get into ſuch a Condition, and to make it ſure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they are ſo! No Man that has the due Exerciſe of his rational Powers and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Being and Attributes of GOD and a Judgment to come, would be able to reſt a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Uncertainty about what the Thoughts of the great and terrible GOD are concerning him in all his Diſpenſations towards him, whether mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful or afflictive: He may believe that GOD <hi>means all for Good;</hi> but that Good, for ought he knows, may be the Glory of his own Power and Juſtice and Wrath in his eternal Deſtruction; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo his making known the Riches of Mercy, on the Veſſels of Mercy, which he had afore prepared unto Glory.</p>

Grace deſtroy or wholly hide the particular natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Temper of a Perſon, but only govern and regulate the ſame according to the Word and Will of GOD. When Grace is perfected in Glory there may poſſibly be the ſame Variety of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that there is now, and each perhaps have their ſeveral Uſe in that World, where will be diſcovered more than ever has been before or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, the manifold Wiſdom of GOD in the Works of Nature, as well as Grace. It is beyond all Doubt, that the Grace of GOD in holy Men here exerts and ſhews it ſelf according to their vaſtly different natural Tempers and Diſpoſitions. The ſame Degree of Grace appears and acts quite otherwiſe in one good Man than it does in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and conſequently they are fitted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared thereby, for ſeveral diſtinct Places and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in the Church of GOD.

And ſo we might go on.—<hi>Solomon</hi> the Penman of this divine <hi>Song of Love</hi> was (to ſay nothing of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Temper in other Reſpects) of a ſoft and loving
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:006193_0024_1028080F03C299C8"/>
Diſpoſition; and being filled with the Grace of GOD, his Love flowed out in an extraordinary Manner towards the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Bridegroom of the Church, and he was thereby the better prepared under the Inſpiration of the Divine Spirit to write on that glorious Subject. He was now alſo in the Vigor of Youth, and in the Ardor of the Love of his Eſpouſals to CHRIST, who had his firſt Affections before they were polluted, as they were too much afterwards by meaner Objects; for 'tis tho't when he wrote this Poem he was but about nineteen Years of Age.— 'Tis called the <hi>Song of Songs,</hi> as being the moſt excellent of all the many hundreds he wrote, and poſſibly the moſt excellent that was or will be written from the Beginning to the End of Time. It has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the moſt lively Saints in their moſt lively Frames, have had a peculiar Reliſh for this Portion of holy Scripture: Even ſuch as have not underſtood, or at leaſt have not been able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their Knowledge of much of the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this holy Allegory, yet have been delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Reading, Hearing or Singing of it.

            <p>'Tis thought that there is ſcarce any of all the different Frames of Spirit both good and bad that a Believer is in but is ſuited and expreſſed in ſome Part or other of this Song. And 'tis ſurprizing to ſee what a vaſt variety of ſpiritual and heavenly Matter ſome Expoſitors of eminent Experience in the divine Life have found in this Poem. It was the Saying of a good Woman, after ſhe had been laid on a Bed of Sickneſs; That it ſeem'd to her, GOD had by that Affliction led her aſide as it were out of the Hurries of the World to converſe more freely with her than he had done for ſome Time; and particularly he then ſhewed her by his Holy Spirit ſo many excellent Goſpel-Truths in this Book of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> and made them ſo plain to her that it ſeemed as impoſſible to her that ever ſhe ſhould read there again and not ſeem, as it would be to go at Noon-Day into a Garden full of Flowers, and over-look them all; but for all when ſhe got out into the World again, and the Duſt of it began to get into her Eyes, ſhe found by ſad Experience it was poſſible for her to read this Song of Love, and ſee little more in it, and be little more affected with it than with a common Ballad.— The Spouſe of CHRIST,

who is the Party ſpeaking in this Verſe, ſeems to be in one of her beſt Frames; in that Temper of Soul which has been often called a Being in the Mount with GOD: She was now in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſenſible Preſence of her Beloved, whom ſhe here ſtiles <hi>the King,</hi> though ſhe often ſpeaks of him under a more familiar Title; as particularly in the very next Verſe, where ſhe calls him her <hi>Beloved:</hi> 'Tis perhaps to teach Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers that how condeſcending ſoever their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Bridegroom is, and whatever Freedom and Familiarity he is pleaſed to admit them to, yet they are ſtill to remember that he is <hi>the King.</hi> And as there is a wonderful Mixture of infinite Majeſty and Authority with the moſt conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending Love and Sweetneſs in him; ſo that to anſwer this there ſhould be an holy awful Fear and Reverence, as well as a conjugal Affection and humble Boldneſs and child-like Freedom in her. — <hi>The King</hi> — The Bridegroom of the Church is a glorious King. — He has all thoſe royal Qualifications and Endowments that are neceſſary to fit him for that high Office.

<pb n="46" facs="unknown:006193_0026_1028081715E58F70"/>
then does it require to govern and order the whole Body of the Elect, conſiſting of ſo many Millions in all Ages; and not only to rule the outward Man in their Behaviour one towards another, but to regulate all the various Thoughts and Paſſions of the Soul, with reſpect both to GOD and Man? He muſt make Laws to govern them, and then govern them according to thoſe Laws; even the very Thoughts and Intentions of their Hearts. He finds them in the utmoſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of a willful Rebellion, with their Hearts full of reigning Enmity againſt him, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, but freely under the Tyranny of Sin and Satan: What Wiſdom is there neceſſary to manage them, and bring them into Order and Subjection when they are in ſo forlorn a State? And then he has not only his Church to manage and order, but the whole World, yea other Worlds to order and govern for their Good: The Angels of Heaven, as miniſtring Spirits, muſt be guided by Him; all the wicked Men on Earth, and all the Devils in Hell muſt be under his Direction and Reſtraint, ſo as to do no real Damage, but a great deal of Good to the Church, though they mean not ſo, neither doth their Heart think ſo. There muſt not one Thing be ſuffered to be done, not one Word be ſpoken, not one Thought conceived, but ſhall be over-ruled for the Glory of GOD and
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:006193_0026_1028081715E58F70"/>
the Good of the Elect. And his Wiſdom is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for all this. He is the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of GOD. He can manage all the great Affairs of his vaſt Dominions in all Worlds without any Difficulty at all. He has all Things every where in Time and to Eternity before him at once: and takes as exact a View of every Perſon, and all their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, and every the leaſt Motion of their Hearts, as if he had but one particular Action of one ſingle Perſon to obſerve: And as he ſees every Perſon and Thing, ſo he knows what is beſt to be done in every Caſe, be it never ſo perplexed and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult: He has had a thouſand Caſes before him that would have perplexed and nonpluſſed all the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Wiſdom of Heaven and Earth for ever: Nay, there is no one Believer in the preſent State of Sin and Darkneſs, but what has Perplexities in his Caſe every Day and Hour, whether he be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſenſible of it or no, which the wiſeſt Angel is not able infallibly to direct him in. — But this King is wiſe.—It would be endleſs to enlarge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every particular Qualification of this Royal Bridegroom, they are infinite in Number, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in Perfection, and can't be conceived of, much leſs expreſſed by any but an infinite Mind. —Only to hint briefly at a few Things.— He has the <hi>Authority</hi> of a King. He has it by Birth, for he is the only Son of the King eternal, immortal,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:006193_0027_1028081B8ED1ABB0"/>
inviſible. He has it by Divine Conſtitution and Appointment, GOD has ſet him as King on his holy Hill of <hi>Zion:</hi> He has it by Conqueſt, he ſubdues Rebels, and makes them his Subjects: He has it by Merit, and has done more than enough to deſerve his Royal Dignity: He has it by free Choice and Election, his People being made willing in the Day of his Power, do chooſe him for their King for ever to rule in them, and reign over them; they by Faith ſet him upon the Throne of their Hearts, and ſet the Royal Crown upon his Head in the Day of his Eſpouſals, in the Day of the Gladneſs of his Heart.— He has the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Influence</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſuch a King: He has ſuch Majeſty, a when he is pleaſed to diſplay it, over-awes all Men and Angels, and Devils, and makes every Knee to bow before him, and every Tongue to confeſs that He is Lord to the Praiſe and Glory of GOD the Father. — He has not only Authority, but Power to execute that Authority, ſo as to have his Will accompliſhed in every particular Inſtance throughout the Univerſe. — He has the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> of a King: 'Tis propheſied of Him, a <hi>King ſhall reign in Righteouſneſs,</hi>—His Laws are holy, juſt and good, and they are all executed in Righteouſneſs: He ſhall judge the World in Righteouſneſs. Rewards and Puniſhments will be
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:006193_0027_1028081B8ED1ABB0"/>
exactly diſtributed according to Men's Works, whether they have been good, or whether they have been evil, agreeable to the unnerring Rule of the Law and Goſpel.— He has the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> that becomes ſuch a King. His Name is Love: And he rules all by Love. His Laws are all contrived, as far as we can ſee, as much for the Good of his Subjects, as if he had no Eye or Regard to any Thing elſe in making them; and they all ſee it to be ſo when their Eyes are opened, ſo that they would not have one of them repealed or altered if they might. He ſhews his Love and Goodneſs in the whole Courſe of his Managements. He treats all his faithful Subjects as ſo many intimate Friends: They are all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites: Yea, as to his Subjects among Men, he adopts them all to be his Children; yea, marries them, and takes them into all the near and dear Relations to himſelf, that it is poſſible for them to ſuſtain; yea, ſuch as none but infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom could have found out, or made poſſible.— He condeſcends to all Manner of kind Offices for the Good of his beloved Subject: Nay, to ſay all in a Word, he laid aſide his Royal celeſtial Robes, took their Nature on him, when they were in a State of Sin and Rebellion; obeyed his Father's Law, ſuffered his infinite Wrath in all the amazing Effects of it; and even now in his
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:006193_0028_1028081D568482D8"/>
glorified Eſtate, He is doing the Office of an <hi>Advocate</hi> for them, and is a <hi>Priest upon his Throne,</hi> making continual Interceſſion for them. He ſends out his Ambaſſadors to beſeech Rebels to be reconciled; yea, ſends his Spirit to ſubdue their Hearts, and give them a loyal Spirit to walk in his Statutes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, to ſay no more, he makes it his own Happineſs to make them happy, and to rejoice with them in their Happineſs for ever.— He has the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> of a King. Lying Lips do by no means become a Prince. If the Word of a King may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon, all his Authority is gone at once. This King is Truth itſelf: He is the <hi>Amen:</hi> His <hi>Name</hi> is <hi>Faithful</hi> and <hi>True:</hi> And as his Name is ſo is He. His Titles are none of them empty (as 'tis often among Men) but all filled up with Subſtance and Reality. He always fulfils all his Promiſes and all his Threatnings, according to the true Intent and Meaning of them, to a Tittle: It will be ſaid forever with Reſpect to both, Not one Word hath failed. All the Damned in Hell, all the Saints in Heaven will be eternal Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Truth and Faithfulneſs of this King. —And as He has all manner of Royal Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Endowments requiſite in Himſelf, ſo He is an <hi>over-flowing Fountain,</hi> communicating as there is Occaſion to others. <hi>By Him Kings

reign, and Princes decree Juſtice,</hi> &amp;c: Yea, He makes all his Subjects Kings, and endows them with all that Wiſdom and Grace they need, to qualify them for that high Character and Station.— But broken Hints are all that muſt be expected.—</p>
            <p>This is <hi>the King</hi> that <hi>ſitteth at his Table.</hi> — This may ſignify the <hi>friendly Communion</hi> and <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip</hi> CHRIST has with his People.— It denotes <hi>Friendſhip:</hi> Enemies don't uſe to ſit and eat and drink at the ſame Table; nay, 'tis made uſe of often as a Token of Reconciliation between thoſe who have been at Variance, when they ſit and eat or drink together; beſure it is ſo here.— There was an awful Diſtance betwixt CHRIST and his Spouſe: She was an Enemy in her Mind, thro' wicked Works; but ſhe is now reconciled, and he holds Communion with her in Teſtimony of it. He uſes this as an Argument with Sinners to be reconciled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> — <hi>If any Man hear my Voice, and open the Door, I will come into him, and ſup with him.</hi>— It betokens <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Familiarity.</hi> If a great Perſon invites himſelf to the Table of one of meaner Rank, or invites him to his, it is taken as a Favour, and it is expected that he will be free when he comes there. It is ſo in this Caſe. There are Times when the Lord JESUS manifeſts himſelf to his People: He converſes freely with them; He opens his very Heart
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:006193_0029_102808200DB99490"/>
to them, and lets them into the moſt ſecret Receſſes of his Soul; He lets them know what his Thoughts were concerning them before the Foundation of the World; what paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Father and Him, with Reſpect to their Salvation, in the Days of Eternity, <hi/> And what his preſent Thoughts are concerning them, and how he ſtands affected towards them; what Love glows in his Heart, what his gracious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and Purpoſes are, with Reſpect to Time and Eternity. And his Ear is open to hear what his Spouſe has to ſay to him: She may at ſuch Seaſons pour out her whole Soul before him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſom her very Heart; and the more free, full and unreſerved ſhe is, ſo much the better, always provided, ſhe maintains a due Senſe of the infinite Diſtance there is betwixt the King and herſelf, and how utterly unworthy ſhe is of the Favour he now ſhews her:—Now ſhe may make known her Requeſts to him; He does in Effect ſay to her as <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> to <hi>Eſther, What is thy Petition? and it ſhall be granted thee; What is thy Request, and it ſhall be performed?</hi> Not to the Half of an earthly Kingdom; but to the whole of an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one.— At a Table, eſpecially at a King's Table, there is the beſt of Entertainment, and Abundance of it; not only for Neceſſity, but for Delight: 'Tis ſo here, in a tranſcendent
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:006193_0029_102808200DB99490"/>
Manner.— The Spouſe is hungry, and hardly beſtead, in a pining, famiſhing Condition, has not ſo much as a Sufficiency of Huſks to fill her Belly with; ſhe is ready to die with Thirſt, and juſt giving up the Ghoſt, parched with earneſt unſatiable Deſires, parched and burnt up as it were with a Senſe of the burning Wrath of GOD in her Soul, and can't come at ſo much as one Drop of Water to cool her Tongue: But here at this Table ſhe finds Relief; here's Bread for Hunger, Bread enough, and to ſpare; Here's Water enough for her Thirſt, Water enough, even a never-failing Fountain of it: Yea, Here are all Manner of rich and royal Dainties and Varieties: Here's Angel's Food; yea better Food than Angels were ever feaſted with, the Fleſh of the SON OF GOD, which is Meat indeed; the Bread of Life which came down from Heaven, and giveth Life, eternal Life to the Soul: Here's not only Water to quench the Thirſt, and preſerve from immediate Death; but Wine, royal Wine in Abundance, to raiſe and exhilerate the Spirits, and cauſe the Lips even of thoſe that are aſleep to ſpeak.—</p>
            <p>'Tis <hi>his</hi> Table, not <hi>her</hi>'s. She attributes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to herſelf: She was as poor as Penury it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhe had no Place fit to entertain the King in; nothing to entertain him with: But He, of
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:006193_0030_102808231004C4E0"/>
his royal Bounty and free Love, has provided all. This is the Caſe of a Believer: He muſt of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity receive all from CHRIST; This is the Spirit of every Believer, to aſcribe all to Him; <hi>Not unto us, not unto us, but to thy Name give Glory.</hi> The Spouſe of CHRIST is free upon all Occaſions to acknowledge that ſhe was ſo far from making any Proviſion to entertain him at a Table of her own, that when he came to her Door, and ſtood knocking there, ſhe bolted and barred it againſt him; yea, tho' he ſtood knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and waiting with his heavenly Proviſions to feaſt her with, ſhe would not let him in, till He of his rich, free, ſovereign Grace put in his golden Key, and turned back the Bolt, opened the Door, ſpread the Table, and ſupp'd with her, and ſhe with, him; — And then it is, even <hi>while the King ſitteth at his Table,</hi> ſays ſhe, that <hi>my Spike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard ſendeth forth the Smell thereof.</hi>— Spikenard is a ſweetly-ſmelling Herb; an Ointment made of it, we read, is very precious, and poſſibly that is meant here: The Meaning of this may be, that when Believers enjoy the ſpecial ſenſible Preſence of the Lord JESUS with them in holy Ordinances, this draws forth the Grace that is in them into lively Exerciſe:—This is the Deſign of CHRIST'S gracious Viſits, and this is the natural Effect of them. 'Tis the Deſign of them. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:006193_0030_102808231004C4E0"/>
more pleaſing to him in the World, than to obſerve the lively Working of his People's Graces: 'Tis his Love makes it ſo: He loved her with a Love of Benevolence or good Will, from everlaſting, and this Love has been exerting itſelf in a wonderful Manner in Time; but he has no Return. Tho' he wiſhes well to her, and is continually laying out himſelf for her, yet while ſhe is in her natural State, he can take no Delight in her: She is a vile Creature, every way diſagreeable, and infinitely odious and abominable to his holy Nature, and ſo ſhe muſt continue totally, as to her State, till he is pleaſed to make her a gracious Viſit by his Holy Spirit; and even after ſhe is in Part ſanctified, ſhe will remain very much ſo, as to her Frame, till he is pleaſed to make her renewed Viſits, and ſit at his own Table, which he has furniſhed for himſelf and her in the Apartment of her Heart: This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is his Deſign. And then the ſenſible Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of CHRIST has a natural Tendency to draw out Grace: This may appear by Inſtancing a little in ſome Particulars.— The ſenſible Preſence of CHRIST draws out <hi>Faith:</hi> Here is the Object of her Soul's Confidence and Truſt juſt before her Eyes; She ſees Him in his All ſufficiency and Suitableneſs, and can't but reach out after him; She hears the gracious Words that proceed out of
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:006193_0031_102808252BDAC6B0"/>
his Mouth, and ſhe can't help believing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on them: His very Looks ſpeak his Sincerity: His Mouth is moſt ſweet; ſhe is ſure within herſelf thoſe Lilly Honey-dropping Lips can't poſſibly have any Guile in them: Nay, He ſo opens himſelf to her that ſhe does, as it were, ſee into his very Heart, and compares the Copy of his gracious Words with the Original in his Breaſt: The Rock of Ages is now, as it were, at her very Elbow; and ſhe can't but reſt her weary Soul upon him, eſpecially when he kindly invites her ſo to do: The Son of Man, the Antitype of the Brazen Serpent, is lifted up juſt before her Eyes; and ſhe can't help looking on him, and ſo receiving his healing Influences: — In a Word, He is now actually accompliſhing ſome of his ſweet Promiſes to her; and this mightily ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens her Faith, as to the Fulfilment of the reſt. My bleſſed Bridegroom, ſays ſhe, told me, He would <hi>come into me, and ſup with me, and I with him;</hi> and he is as good as his Word: Here he is, I ſee him, I eat and drink with him, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> — The ſame Mouth has ſaid, <hi>I will never fail thee, nor forſake thee: I will be with thee in ſix Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and in ſeven: I will guide thee by Counſel, and afterwards bring thee to Glory,</hi>  and I will never doubt nor diſtruſt any more. —</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:006193_0031_102808252BDAC6B0"/>So her <hi>Love</hi> is alſo drawn out into lively Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe. Her Eye affects her Heart: The Sun of Righteouſneſs does now as it were ſhine full upon her, ſhines through and through her, and is ſo near that it ſets her very Heart all on a light Fire, and like the Diſciples it burns within her. [This Inſtance of his Love to her calls to her Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance all former Inſtances, and his ancient loving Kindneſs, and Love begets Love.] She ſees his lovely Face; ſhe hears his ſweet Voice, and feels his dear Embraces, and this quite overcomes her. The Load-ſtone the nearer it is, the Stronger it draws. The nearer a heavy Body to its Centre, the ſwifter is it's Motion; ſo it is here.</p>
            <p>The ſenſible Preſence of CHRIST promotes <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>holy Mourning</hi> under a Senſe of Sin. The Soul ſays with <hi>Job, I have heard of thee by the hearing of the Ear; but now mine Eye ſeeth Thee, wherefore I abhor my ſelf and repent in Duſt and Aſhes.</hi> When JESUS turned and looked on <hi>Peter,</hi> he went out and wept bitterly. O the Soul now bluſhes inwardly, and covers it's Face, and in the deepeſt Self-Abaſement and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſays within it ſelf, "Is this the bleſſed SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, whom I have ſo much, ſo often, ſo long affronted and abuſed? Is this he that I ſuffered to ſtand knocking and calling and waiting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Doors of my Soul, till his Head was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:006193_0032_10280827B233F1A8"/>
with the Dew, and his Locks with the Drops of the Night? O I bluſh and am aſhamed to lift up my Face to thee, O my GOD. Is this the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Perſon whom I have grieved and wounded by my Pride, my Worldlineſs, my horrid Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and Hard-heartedneſs and Unbelief? Break, break, my Heart, Flow down, mine Eyes with Rivers of Tears for treating my dear SAVIOUR as I have done!"</p>
            <p>This ſenſible Preſence of CHRIST, draws forth <hi>holy Reſolutions</hi> againſt Sin, and <hi>holy Purpoſes</hi> to cleave to CHRIST for the Time to come in Love and new Obediences.— She now feels a holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge working in her Heart: "Is this the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, ſays ſhe, that my Sins have crucified afreſh, and put to open ſhame before the World! O they ſhall die for it; they ſhall die the ſame curſed Death that my dear Redeemer did, <hi>Away with them, Crucify them! Crucify them!</hi> I will purſue them and ſearch them thro' all the various Windings and ſecret Receſſes of my Heart, till I have found, them out, and bro't them forth and ſlain them before him: I will never ſleep any Day of my Life henceforward, till I have cauſed ſome or other of my vile Luſts to fall; I will waſh my Feet in the Blood of theſe wicked <hi>Canaanites</hi> every Night before I ſleep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>" Again, ſays the Spouſe, "Is this my GOD, from whom I have
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:006193_0032_10280827B233F1A8"/>
ſo often, and ſo far, and ſo wickedly departed; and is he again returned; and does he ſit with me, and allow me to ſit with him at his Table, and feaſt me with his Love? O I'll cleave to him as long as I live: <hi>I charge you, O ye Daughters of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>do nothing,</hi> tempt me to do nothing that ſhall grieve him away or provoke him to depart! Shall I ever again leave the ſweet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of my dear <hi>Jeſus</hi> to go and commit Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with the World, the Fleſh and the Devil? GOD forbid!" The Soul is now ſtudying what it ſhall render to the LORD for all his Benefits. "How ſhall I expreſs my Gratitude for what the Lord has done for my Soul! O I will proclaim his loving Kindneſs, and make Earth and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ring and echo one to another, with the high Praiſes of my GOD. I will, by the Help of his Grace, lay out my ſelf in his Service! Every Power and Faculty of my Soul, every Limb and Senſe of my Body, ſhall be employed to their utmoſt Capacity in the Service, and for the Glory of him that has done and ſuffered ſo much for me, and is now kindly viſiting me again. O my deareſt Lord, here I give my ſelf to thee, I offer my ſelf as a living Sacrifice; O that it might be holy and acceptable to GOD, and I'm ſure 'tis but a reaſonable Service"! —The Spouſe now ſitting with the King at his Table, and <hi>beholding with
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:006193_0033_10280829877A3AF8"/>
open Face, as in a Glaſs the Glory of</hi> her <hi>Lord, is changed into the ſame Image from Glory to Glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> The Sun of Righteouſneſs as was ſaid, drawing ſo very near and ſhining ſo intenſely hot, the Heart is melted and flows into the Mold prepared for it in GOD'S Word. It receives the Impreſſion of the divine Image in Knowledge, Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs. In a Word, The Soul now ſeeing the Amiableneſs and Excellency of Holineſs, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified in the bright and perfect Pattern now ſhining before her, in her SAVIOUR ſitting with her at his own Table, falls in love with it; and ardently wiſhes and longs to be more and more conformed thereto, in Heart, Lip and Life. O ſhe thinks, "Is there a Poſſibility, a Probability, yea, an abſolute Certainty, that if I ſeek it with my whole Heart, I may attain to a Conformity unto this glorious Exemplar that now ſhines before me? Then I will ſeek it Night and Day, I will <hi>look to</hi> JESUS <hi>the Author and Finiſher of Faith, till of his Fulneſs I receive and Grace for Grace:</hi> I will never reſt till I find and feel the ſame Mind and Spirit dwelling in me, that dwelt in CHRIST JESUS; till I am enabled by his Grace ſo to walk, even as he walked. And though I know I muſt of neceſſity fall ſhort in imitating every Letter of the fair Copy that is ſet before me, yet I will
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:006193_0033_10280829877A3AF8"/>
be aiming and ſtriving to do as well as I can; I will get my many Blots waſhed out by the Blood of CHRIST, and endeavour to mend my Hand every Day." — Thus the Spikenard ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth the Smell thereof, and every Room where the Spouſe comes, is filled with the Savour of the Oyntment.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="unknown:006193_0035_10280831F8987AC8"/>
and his Tongue always as the Pen of a ready Writer, to utter the Things which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually making concerning this <hi>King of Glory.</hi> He was a Man of uncommon Parts and Learning, a great Moraliſt, a ſtrict Phariſee, and of great Fame among his own Country-Men; but his high Eſteem of, and his ardent Affection to a glorious CHRIST ſwallowed up all. He accounted every Thing elſe but <hi>Dung</hi> and <hi>Drofs, for the Excellency of the Knowledge of CHRIST JESUS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Copulative <hi>And,</hi> in the Words before us, point us back to the preceeding Context. He had, in the Beginning of this Chapter, entered upon a Sentence, which he does not finiſh, till he comes to the next Chapter. He was going to ſay, <hi>I</hi> Paul <hi>a Priſoner of Jeſus Christ, beſeech you,</hi>  but having mentioned the precious Name of his dear JESUS, which was always to him as Ointment poured forth, the bright Images came thronging ſo thick and faſt into his Mind, that he is loſt (as it were) in a holy Maze and divine Confuſion of Thought, and does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himſelf again, till he had ſweetly wandered the Length of above twenty Verſes, ſpeaking of the Things concerning his beloved Saviour. —</p>
            <p>And, by the Way, this Manner of Preaching and Writing which this Prince of Authors and Preachers does often run into, even though under
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:006193_0035_10280831F8987AC8"/>
immediate infallible Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, does excuſe (if not juſtify and commend) the Practice of ſome fervent Preachers in their <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions</hi> and <hi>Excurſions;</hi> by ſome of which they may poſſibly do more Good, than by their more premeditated and methodical Performances. If the main End be anſwered; if CHRIST be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Souls convinced, converted and ſaved, all's well; for all is well that ends well. But to return from this Excurſion. —</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle had been telling the <hi>Epheſians</hi> in the preceeding Verſes, what his <hi>Wiſhes</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> for them were, when in his Cloſet and on his Knees, pouring out his Soul before the Lord. He was now under Confinement, and it ſeems it was ſome how or other on <hi>their Account:</hi> and though he was exceeding joyful in all his Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, experiencing (as thouſands of others have done) moſt of his bleſſed Maſter's ſenſible and comforting Preſence, when he was ſuffering moſt for his Sake; yet he was concerned for <hi>them,</hi> leſt (as he expreſſes himſelf in another Caſe) they ſhould be <hi>ſwallowed up of over-much Grief,</hi> leſt they ſhould faint at <hi>his Tribulations,</hi> (which he tells them <hi>Verſe</hi> 13. was <hi>their Glory;</hi> 'twas an Honour to them that their dear ſpiritual Father ſhould be counted worthy to ſuffer ſuch Things for the Name of CHRIST:) he therefore aſks of
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:006193_0036_1028083515326C10"/>
the great Phyſician, that which he knew by long Experience would be a reviving Cordial to their Spirits; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>he would grant them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Riches of his Glory, to be ſtrengthned with Might by his Spirit in the inner Man, that Chriſt might dwell in their Hearts by Faith; that they being rooted and grounded in Love, might comprehend with all Saints, what is the Breadth, and Length, and Depth, and Height,</hi>— AND TO KNOW THE LOVE OF CHRIST WHICH PAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SETH KNOWLEDGE.—</p>
            <p>But is not this a Contradiction in Terms? How could they <hi>know</hi> that which could <hi>not</hi> be known? Does the Apoſtle pray for Impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? So it ſeems. And indeed this Writer takes Delight to expreſs himſelf in an uncommon and ſurprizing Manner; for his Ideas and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of Things were ſo extraordinary, that the uſual Forms of Speech would by no Means expreſs them to the Life. He ſpake as no mere Man ever ſpake, becauſe he thought, perhaps, as no other beſides himſelf ever tho't. And after all, his Words fell exceeding ſhort of expreſſing his own high Conceptions to the Apprehenſion of others; and yet it muſt be confeſſed that the Things themſelves were infinitely more above his Ideas, than <hi>theſe</hi> were above thoſe of common Men.— However, the Phraſe here may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:006193_0036_1028083515326C10"/>
admit of ſome intelligible Explication, ſo as to clear it of that Abſurdity, that ſeems to appear in it upon the firſt reading. — The Love of CHRIST, being a ſpiritual and divine Myſtery, does indeed paſs the Knowledge of all natural Men; they can have no true Idea of it; and yet it is made Known to every, even the weakeſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever by the Teachings of the Spirit of GOD. —The Love of CHRIST paſſeth all the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that any of the Saints have attained to; and yet they may ſtill know more and more of it every Day they live, and by every Ordinance they attend.— The Love of CHRIST paſſeth all the Knowledge that any have attained, or can attain to, in the preſent State; and yet far more of it may be and will be known in the other World, that World of perfect Light and Knowledge.— Yea, may it not be added, that the Love of CHRIST paſſeth all the Knowledge that Angels and Men will attain for ever; and yet they may know more and more of it forever. In a Word, the Love of CHRIST is truely &amp; properly bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and infinite; and the Nature of the humane Mind is ſuch, that as far as we can judge of our own Powers, it will be forever capable of ſtill new and freſh Diſcoveries. And not only may it be ſaid, that the Soul can never know ſo much, but it may know more; but alſo, the more it
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:006193_0037_102808369BA8BFE0"/>
knows, the more capable it is of knowing: As the Circles that are made by caſting a heavy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into the Water, not only go farther and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but ſtill grow larger and larger: Or as a Snow-Ball not only increaſes as it rolls, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes much faſter the farther it goes: Or, to uſe a Scripture Compariſon, as a Grain of Wheat, when ſown produces Thirty, Sixty or an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Fold, this ſown again produces a vaſtly greater Quantity and ſo on — Thus, poſſibly, it may be in this Caſe: Believers may not only in this World, which the Apoſtle ſeems more immediately to mean, but forever, to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Happineſs, be knowing more &amp; more of the Love of CHRIST which paſſeth Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.—</p>
            <p>But, <hi>What is this Love of CHRIST?</hi> The Anſwer to this Queſtion would lead us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a large Field, larger than the Univerſe, large as Eternity, yea large as the Immenſity of GOD Himſelf; for, as was ſaid, it is infinite.— 'Tis not only the Love of a Creature in the higheſt Degree of Perfection, and far beyond any other Inſtance of created Love, as the <hi>humane</hi> Nature of CHRIST is the Subject of it; but it is the Love of him that is truely and properly GOD; and ſo is no other than GOD himſelf, even the very Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature unfolding and diſplaying it ſelf in
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:006193_0037_102808369BA8BFE0"/>
a Way of Mercy and Grace towards the Objects of this Love. —</p>
            <p>All that can now be offered here will be at beſt, but ſome imperfect Hints that may ſerve to bring to the Remembrance of ſome Perſons a few of thoſe many Things they have heard on this Subject more largely, frequently and affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated of than any other; and poſſibly, as much and often ſpoken to, as in any other Place whatever, throughout the Land. —</p>
            <p>The Love of CHRIST as <hi>Man</hi> was perfect in it's Kind; there was no Defect in any Reſpect, or at any Time whatſoever. It was always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed towards ſuch Objects, in ſuch a Degree, on ſuch Occaſions, from ſuch Motives and in ſuch a Manner, as a perfect humane Love ſhould be. It anſwered the perfect Law of GOD, under which he was made exactly, in every Particular, continually. His Love was indeed the fulfilling of the Law. The piercing Eye of omniſcient Juſtice it ſelf could find no manner of Deficiency in it. — The Man CHRIST JESUS lov'd GOD his heavenly Father with all his Heart, and with all his Soul, and with all his Mind, and with all his Strength. He was as much concerned for his Honour and Glory; He took as much Delight in Communion with him; He mourn'd as much for the Diſhonour done to
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:006193_0038_1028083952AEDA28"/>
his Name, by the Sins of Men and Devils; was as ready, chearful, conſtant and perſevering in doing his Will and ſuffering whatever GOD was pleaſed to lay upon him (even to the laying down his very Life at his Command) as was poſſible. — There was no Intermiſſion, no Remiſſion or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of the moſt intenſe Degree of Love, in any of theſe Reſpects. And tho' his Body was ſometimes weary, and his Animal Spirits exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, ſo that he needed Refreſhment by Sleep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as other Men do;) yet his Soul was always lively, always flaming in Love to GOD more than any of the Seraphims that are round about the Throne of GOD. His very Dreams, we may be ſure, when his bodily Senſes were locked up in a State of Inactivity, were nothing but holy and heavenly Meditations and Viſions, of what was paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or to come, without the leaſt Degree of Vanity or ſinful Imperfection; ſtill nothing but the pleaſing or ſorrowful Workings of perfect Love, according to the reſpective Objects of his innocent Fancy and Imagination.</p>
            <p>He loved the Creatures, juſt as it was fit and becoming he ſhould do, and loved them all juſt enough and idolized none of them. He loved the holy Angels full as much as they deſerved. And with reſpect to Mankind, he always came up to the perfect Rule, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:006193_0038_1028083952AEDA28"/>
as thy ſelf.</hi> And he loved not in Word and in Tongue only, but indeed and in Truth. He loved all Mankind univerſally with a Love of Benevolence or Good-Will. Loved even his Enemies, the worſt of 'em: He pitied them, he wept over them, he prayed for them, even when they were actually murdering of him. <hi>Father, forgive them,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>they know not what they do.</hi> He loved ſome with a peculiar &amp; diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love. He loved his earthly Parents with a filial Affection and was ſubject to them, tho' ſtill in ſubordination to GOD. A remarkable Inſtance of his tender Concern for his Mother, was the Care he took of her in his dying Agonies; when one would have thought it impoſſible for him to take Notice of any Creature, being overwhelmed with a Senſe of the innumerable Millions of the Sins of the Elect imputed to him, and the Wrath of an infinite GOD flaming againſt him for the ſame. He loved his Kinſmen according to the Fleſh with an Affection exactly and perfectly ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to every Relation. In a Word, the whole Courſe of his Life, from his early Childhood to his dying Day, was nothing but one perpetual Scene of Love. He never gave the leaſt juſt Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Offence in Word or Deed. He always rejoiced with thoſe that did rejoice, and wept with thoſe that wept, as there was Occaſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="72" facs="unknown:006193_0039_1028083B81970B20"/>
He went about doing good, and was always ready to every good Work. And he ſuffered as well as acted from a Principle of pure Love to Man, as well as GOD. Was he <hi>a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief?</hi> Did he <hi>endure the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of Sinners againſt himſelf?</hi> Did he <hi>not hide his Face from Shame and Spitting?</hi> Did he <hi>bear the Sins of many in his own Body on the Tree,</hi> after he had ſweat Blood in the Garden? In a Word, Did he <hi>pour out his Soul unto Death,</hi> and endure the hidings of his Father's Face, yea the very Pangs of Damnation? It was all from mere, pure, unmixed Love. Yea, when he ſometimes did, as he could on proper Occaſions, expreſs his Anger and Indignation; it was nothing but pure Love in another Form and Shape as it were, even Love kindled into Zeal againſt Men for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring GOD, and ſo wounding and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own Souls; as a tender Mother is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with her dear Child for cutting it's own Fingers, or needleſly expoſing it's Life &amp; Limbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as he ſhew'd all the Inſtances of a kind and tender human Affection his Life-Time, more eſpecially towards his Diſciples, whom he always treated, not as Servants, tho' he were their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Lord, but as Friends, communicating his Secrets to them, bearing with their many ſinful

Weakneſſes and Infirmities, and putting the beſt Conſtruction on them, the Caſe would admit, and making greater Allowances than they could expect, and than any beſides himſelf would have done, and condeſcending to miniſter to them, even in the very meaneſt Offices, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> in which it would be endleſs to particularlize; ſo he retains the ſame humane Love, even ſince his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Aſcenſion, the Inſtances of which are known to every one that reads his Teſtament with Care and Obſervation. It muſt be acknowledged, that in ſome of the Particulars before-mentioned, there were Effects of Love beyond what was merely Humane, yea beyond all Examples of created Affection: For the Love of CHRIST was alſo</p>
            <p>A <hi>Divine</hi> Love. And if in giving a few brief Hints of ſome of the Properties and Effects of CHRIST'S Love, as it is the Love of a GOD, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould be ſaid that may more properly belong to a created Affection, it may be no great Matter; for he is GOD and Man in one Perſon, tho' there be two diſtinct Natures. And the inſpired Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters themſelves ſeem not to be at all ſcrupulous in diſtinguiſhing between the humane and divine Acts and Properties of the Perſon of the SON OF GOD. They tell us of the Blood of GOD, and of the Son of Man's being in Heaven, while CHRIST'S Soul &amp; Body was on Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:006193_0040_1028083E6AC31908"/>To ſay nothing of the mutual Love of the Father and Son, nor of the Love of the Son of GOD to the elect Angels, to whom he is in ſome Reſpects an Head; nor of his general Love of Beneficence to all Mankind, and his univerſal Goodneſs to all the Creatures, every one of which from the higheſt Angel in Heaven to the leaſt Worm or Flie on Earth, or the worſt Devil or damned Ghoſt in Hell, either has experienced, or does experience ſome Effects of the common Love of CHRIST; what follows is only, or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally what relates to his own <hi>choſen People,</hi> the <hi>Bride,</hi> the <hi>Lamb</hi>'s <hi>Wife.</hi> And his Love to them is,</p>
            <p>An <hi>everlaſting</hi> Love, that is, it had no Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and it will have no End.</p>
            <p>He loved them in the Days of Eternity. There never was any Period, when he did not love them. He loved them as ſoon as he loved his Father. He loved them as ſoon as he loved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>It is an endleſs Love. It will continue to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity in the Acts and Exerciſe, in the Fruits and Effects of it. <hi>The Mountains ſhall depart, and the Hills ſhall be removed, but</hi> his <hi>Loving-Kindneſs will</hi> he <hi>not take away from</hi> his Choſen. <hi>Having loved his own, he loved them to the End;</hi> yea he loves them without End.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:006193_0040_1028083E6AC31908"/>'Tis a <hi>free</hi> Love. He loved them becauſe he would love them. He loved them when they were Nothing, yea when he foreſaw they would make themſelves infinitely worſe than Nothing. He loved them when they were actually all over filthy and abominable, when they were full of Wounds and Bruiſes and putrifing Sores, caſt out in their Blood to the loathing of their Perſons, none Eye to pity them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He loved them when they were condemned Traitors and Rebels, and doomed to ſuffer the Vengeance of eternal Fire. He loved them, when he knew they were full of Enmity againſt him, and could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure him, and were not only every Thing elſe that was bad, and deſtitute of every Thing that was good to recommend them to his Love; but proud like the Devil, ſcorning the Offer of his Love, as if it were quite beneath them, to take any Notice of him. As if they ſat as a Queen, or Princeſs, and he were a vile Beggar making Suit to them, that were not worthy to carry their Shoes after them; when he at the ſame Time is conſcious to himſelf, that he is infinitely worthy of the higheſt Regards of Men and Angels; and at the ſame Inſtant that he makes Offer of Love to them in their forlorn Circumſtances, he is adored by Millions of Angels, any one of which could and would, were it not for the Love CHRIST

bears to theſe vile Creatures, and if permitted or commiſſioned, tear them in ten thouſand Pieces, or tie them Hand and Foot and caſt them into eternal Burnings for the horrid Affronts they offer to <hi>their</hi> deareſt Lord. And as they have nothing perſonally to recommend them, but infinitely the Reverſe, ſo they have (or at leaſt when he ſet his Love upon 'em had) no Friend to recommend them, or ſpeak a Word in their Favour; but it was of his own mere Motion, and free good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. They ſtood in no Relation, that ſhould lay him under the leaſt Obligations to them. They were his Creatures indeed, but had brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into ſuch a Condition, that he that made them might juſtly have no Mercy on them, and he that formed them, might, in all Reaſon, ſhew 'em no Favour. And his Love was alſo perfectly free, as to any mercenary Views he could have. He knew full well, that they would never be able to make him any Return for all his Love.—Yes, He does foreſee that they will love him, and thank and praiſe him, and ſtir up others to aſſiſt them in doing ſo, that they will give themſelves to him, and devote all they are, all they have and all they can do to his Service in Time, and to Eternity, and that they will make all Heaven ring with his Praiſes for ever and ever, that they will love him in Perfection, and ſerve him without ceaſing Day

and Night, as long as he and they have a Being; but all this he knows will be the Fruit of his own Grace, and the Purchaſe of his own Blood, and that the worſt damned Sinner in Hell would have done the very ſame, had he been pleaſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the ſame Grace upon them, and his Elect will ſee and acknowledge this for ever; as alſo that after they were made the Subjects of his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace, and knew themſelves to be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his electing Love, yet they were guilty of abundance of Pride, Covetouſneſs, Ingratitude, Unbelief, and innumerable other Sins, whereby they were a continual Exerciſe to his Patience, and vexed and grieved his Holy Spirit, ſome of 'em forty Years long, ſome more, ſome leſs. Yea, he knew that the Sins of his own Elect, after Converſion would be in ſome Inſtances and in ſome Reſpects at leaſt more heinous than the Sins of Reprobates, yea than thoſe of the very Devils of Hell; as being committed againſt ſuch Love, as neither of them, no nor the Angels of Heaven were ever the Objects of: For it is</p>
            <p>A <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> Love. The comparatively few, (tho' collectively conſidered they are an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great Multitude which no Man can num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) that are the Objects of this Love, are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from all other Beings in the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of GOD. They are diſtinguiſhed from fallen
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:006193_0042_102808444AAC5C60"/>
Angels, whoſe Sins, as was ſaid, are in ſundry Reſpects leſs aggravated than their's: Diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Multitudes of fallen Men, who never were the ſpecial Objects of Divine Love, and who were, many of them, far leſs guilty in the Sight of GOD than many of thoſe who are thus beloved. And they are diſtinguiſhed from the elect Angels themſelves: They are brought into a nearer and dearer Relation to CHRIST, and of Conſequence exalted to higher Honour than any Angel in Heaven. 'Tis certain, they are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as miniſtring Spirits ſent forth to miniſter to thoſe who are the Heirs of Salvation in their preſent State of Sin and Imperfection; and it ſeems to be repreſented in Scripture, as if they would continue ſo to miniſter, even after the Saints are entered into Poſſeſſion of their Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in Glory. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.4, We read of the four and twenty Elders ſitting on Seats round about the Throne; this may intimate the near Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion the Saints are to have with GOD: Again <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.11, We read that all the Angels <hi>ſtood</hi> round about the Throne, and about the Elders. 'Tis certain all the Angels in Heaven never coſt the SON OF GOD ſo dear as each Soul of his Elect among Men did: For</p>
            <p>It was a moſt <hi>expenſive</hi> Love that was exerciſed towards them. It coſt him the veiling his divine

Glory in Fleſh, and a Service of hard Labour and Suffering for between thirty and forty Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and at laſt a ſhameful, painful and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Death, of which ſomething has been ſaid already. It was indeed at infinite Coſt that he purchaſed his beloved Spouſe from the Hands of Divine Juſtice into which ſhe was fallen for a Debt of Ten Thouſand Talents, and had not one Farthing to pay: And 'twas at infinite Expence that he redeemed the forfeited Inheritance; yet he went on with his gracious Deſign: For</p>
            <p>His Love is <hi>unchangeable.</hi> Many Waters can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not quench it, neither can the Floods drown it, nor abate in the leaſt Degree the Intenſeneſs of it's Heat. It was Love without Meaſure from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and it will continue ſo for ever. It never alters in the leaſt. It is the very ſame, in every Reſpect, under all the different Frames and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances his beloved is in, throughout all Time, and to Eternity. It was the ſame when <hi>Adam</hi> was rejoicing in Paradiſe, as it was when he was nothing, or a Handful of dry Duſt; the ſame after his fearful and aggravated Fall, that it was before; the ſame when Sinners are in an Eſtate of Rebellion and Enmity, as it is after they are converted, and in part ſanctified, and filled with Love to him, and godly Sorrow for their paſt Villany, and Gratitude and Praiſe for his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:006193_0043_10280847C1D05B00"/>
Love; all this does not increaſe his Affection in the leaſt Degree, for it was infinite before: And when afterwards they are forgetful of his Loving-Kindneſs, and grow cold in their Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſlack in their Duty to him, yea go a whoring after other Lovers, tho' he ſees all this, is preſent and looks on, and has them in his very Arms, when they turn away from him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſpiritual Adultery; it is very grievous to him indeed, and well it may, but it does not alienate his Heart from them.—All his Revenge is only in his Tears! He may hide his Face from her for a Moment, and chaſten her ſeverely for a Time; but 'tis all the Effect of the ſame unalterable Love. His Language to her ſtill is, <hi>With everlaſting Kindneſs will I have Mercy on thee, ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer; nay, I have ſworn that I will not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.</hi>—And when he ſhall have them with him in Heaven in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Holineſs and Happineſs and Glory, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned and beautified every Way as becomes the Royal Bride of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and he rejoices over her with Singing, and reſts in his Love; it is but the ſame Love ſtill which he had from everlaſting. He had the ſame Satisfaction in his own infinite Mind in the Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect (if we may ſo diſtinguiſh) that he has in the actual and eternal Enjoyment. Thus his Love is
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:006193_0043_10280847C1D05B00"/>
unchangeable, as it is in his Heart, tho' the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of it are various according to the vaſtly different State and Circumſtances of the Object: It being</p>
            <p>A <hi>wiſe, judicious</hi> Love; and not a fond and fooliſh Affection, which is always expreſſing it ſelf according to the preſent Feeling of the Lover, without a due Regard to the future and beſt Good of the Perſons beloved, rather than the preſent Pleaſure and Gratification of both. For want of this Wiſdom and Judgment in the Exerciſe of Affection, multitudes among the Children of Men have been ruined; <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas, Abſalom, Amnon</hi> and <hi>Adonijah</hi> for Inſtance, and Millions more. But CHRIST'S Love is wiſe. He never ruined any of the Objects of his Love by imprudent Management. He always does that which is moſt for the ſpiritual and eternal Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his Beloved. And accordingly, <hi>whom he loves, he rebukes and chaſtens, and ſcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth. If his Children forſake his Law and walk not in his Judgments, if they break his Statutes and keep not his Commandments; then will he viſit their Tranſgreſſions with a Rod, and their Iniquities with Stripes, tho' he will not utterly take his loving Kindneſs from them, nor ſuffer his Faithfulneſs to fail.</hi> He looks for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſees what the Conſequences of Things
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:006193_0044_1028084DAA8548D0"/>
will be Years and Ages hence, yea for ever and ever; and has infinitely more Regard to what his Elect will think of him and his Love far in Eternity, than what their preſent Senſe and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion is. Tho' he does not <hi>willingly grieve nor afflict the Children of Men,</hi> much leſs his own Spouſe, whom he loves as Himſelf, yea better than his own Eyes or Life; yet for the ſake of her real and eternal Advantage, he can bear to ſee her in all Manner of Sorrow and Affliction, outward and inward, for ſuch a Space of Time as he ſees beſt. He had rather ſhe ſhould weep now than howl for ever. He had rather ſhe ſhould cry out of broken Bones now, than be broken on the Wheel of his Father's Wrath to Eternity. He had rather ſhake her over Hell-Flames, tho' ſhe ſhrieks and ſhivers, and is ready to die with Fear, than to let her fall in and lie there, World without End. Such Treatment makes her cling the faſter to him and hang about his Neck, and take heed how ſhe runs away next Time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>— It was ſaid that the Love of CHRIST is not a <hi>changeable</hi> Love: but it is</p>
            <p>A <hi>manifold</hi> Love. There is an endleſs beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Variety in the Acts and Exerciſes of it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the various Relations he is pleaſed to take upon him towards his choſen. They are all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up with Love. Love exerts and diſplays it
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:006193_0044_1028084DAA8548D0"/>
ſelf in every one of them. Is he a King, a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a Brother, a Bridegroom, a Friend, a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, a Head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to his People? He is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely the moſt kind and tender in every one of thoſe Relations, that ever was, or can be.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the many and glorious <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi> of the Love of CHRIST. But how is this Love to be <hi>known</hi> by Believers? What is that <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the Love of CHRIST, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſought of the Lord for his beloved <hi>Epheſians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doubtleſs he deſired they ſhould grow more and more in the <hi>doctrinal</hi> Knowledge of this Love. And therefore, as he prays for it, ſo he uſes Means to promote it. He is large and particular, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct &amp; clear &amp; plain in his Writings, to inſtruct 'em in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of CHRIST'S Love, and the various Properties and Effects of it, and the Influence it ought to have on their Hearts and Lives. This <hi>doctrinal</hi> Knowledge is neceſſary in order to a <hi>ſaving</hi> Knowledge. For we don't know that GOD does ordinarily communicate any Thing to the <hi>Heart,</hi> but what is firſt in the <hi>Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is</p>
            <p>An <hi>experimental</hi> &amp; <hi>ſaving</hi> Knowledge, which the Apoſtle principally intends. It needs no Proof that he deſigned this; or if he did, the Manner in which he brings it in, makes it very evident, that this was his Meaning. It is a <hi>Grant</hi> according
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:006193_0045_1028084F342FA268"/>
to the <hi>Riches of Glory:</hi> It is accompanied with, or rather is the Effect of their being <hi>ſtrengthned with Strength in the inner Man by the Spirit:</hi> 'Tis the Conſequence of CHRIST'S <hi>dwelling in their Hearts by Faith,</hi> and their being <hi>rooted and grounded in Love;</hi> It is a Privilege peculiar to the <hi>Saints,</hi> and common to them all: It is the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of CHRIST'S Love in all the Dimenſions of it, <hi>Breadth, Length, Depth</hi> and <hi>Heighth:</hi> It is that which was to <hi>comfort</hi> them under their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; and finally, it is that which was to <hi>fill them with all the Fulneſs of GOD:</hi> And all this ſurely can never be aſcribed to a mere <hi>doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinal</hi> Knowledge.—</p>
            <p>It is granted <hi>according to the Riches of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of the Giver. It is a rich Gift indeed, and ſuch as does exceedingly ſhew forth the glorious Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Liberality of him that beſtows it. There is nothing that he gives to Men, ſeparate from this, that is equal to it. It makes a vaſt Addition to the Happineſs of the Angels of Heaven. This Diſcovery of the Love of CHRIST to fallen Men draws forth new Deſires in, and gives new Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications to, thoſe bleſſed Spirits. <hi>Theſe Things the Angels deſire to look into.</hi> The glorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of GOD appear in quite a new Light to them, as they are diſplayed in this Love of CHRIST.
<q>
                  <l>The Firſt Arch-Angel never ſaw</l>
                  <l>So much of GOD before.</l>

               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:006193_0045_1028084F342FA268"/>
It is not revealed that GOD had any other Way to make known his rich and glorious Grace to ſuch a Degree, as by making known to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures this <hi>Love of CHRIST which paſſeth Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Knowledge is the <hi>Operation</hi> of the HOLY SPIRIT, who was promiſed to lead CHRIST'S Diſciples into all Truth. It is a Work of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power; it is done by a ſtrong Hand. In order to the Soul's receiving of it, ſhe muſt be <hi>ſtrengthened with Might in the inner Man.</hi> Her Powers were weakened by the Fall, ſo that they are not able to receive this Divine Light. She is <hi>without Strength.</hi> This Light, if it could ſhine into the Soul in her natural State, would dazzle, over-power, confound and deſtroy it's Faculties. And therefore the SPIRIT OF GOD gives a new Underſtanding, capable of receiving this <hi>Knowledge of the Love of CHRIST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This diſtinguiſhes it from that <hi>common</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which may be taught by <hi>Man,</hi> and which the Soul is capable of receiving in the ſame Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as ſhe does other Myſteries of Art and Nature. Or, if there be ſome common Illumination of the Holy Spirit neceſſary in order to attaining that Knowledge, which ſome natural Men have, whereby they may know more about the Love of CHRIST, and be more affected with it, than
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:006193_0046_102808525F7D10D0"/>
they could otherwiſe have been, and than other Perſons are; yet they have no ſuch Renewing of the Underſtanding as the Saints experience. Their Knowledge is the ſame in Kind, though it differs in Degree, from what it was before. As a Man that is born blind may know much of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy of Light and Colours by humane Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and be greatly aſſiſted and ſucceeded in his Studies on that Subject, by the common Influences of the Spirit of CHRIST, <hi>in whom are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge</hi> of every Kind; ſo that he ſhall be able to ſpeak of theſe Things for the Inſtruction of others, and for the Glory of the GOD of Nature: Yet, after all, he has no ſuch Idea of Light and Colours in his own Mind as every Man that ſees has; but may be farther from it than he was at firſt, as he himſelf may ſee, when his Eyes come to be opened, tho' he could not be ſenſible of it before. He has formed all his Ideas of Light and Colours agreeable to Notions he had received into his Mind by his Hearing, Smelling, Taſting or Feeling; and whenever he thinks or ſpeaks of Light and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, he does it as of ſomething that he has heard, ſmelt, taſted or felt; and the oftner and the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he thinks and ſpeaks of them, tho' he does it in the ſame Words that other Men do, yet his wrong Notions are but the more confirmed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:006193_0046_102808525F7D10D0"/>
And ſo, when he hears of any glorious Sight that is ſeen in the Heavens, or elſewhere, with which others are much affected; why, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately forms an Idea in his Mind of ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Sound, or Savour, or palpable Subſtance, and is affected with it too, after his own Way; but ſtill all his Conceptions are quite wrong, and as far from the Truth, as Darkneſs is from Light, or Taſtes from Colours. So it is with the <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Man:</hi> He hears, and reads, and talks about the <hi>Love of CHRIST, which paſſeth Knowledge;</hi> and may be therein aſſiſted by the Spirit of GOD, and have ſome affecting Senſe and Apprehenſion of it, <hi>in his Way;</hi> which may be ſomewhat uſeful, in ſome Reſpect, to himſelf, and of ſaving Benefit to ſome others, poſſibly: but he has no true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of CHRIST, or his Love, but is farther and farther from any ſuch Thing, the longer he continues in his preſent Notions of Things. All the Progreſs he makes, be it never ſo great, is in a wrong Way; every Step he takes muſt be trod back again, and all his Notions and Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions muſt be unlearnt, 'till he comes to be quite a <hi>Fool,</hi> if ever he be right; and the ſooner, and the faſter he goes back, and gets out of Conceit of his Attainments in Knowledge and Practice, the better. And then,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="unknown:006193_0047_10280857103523B0"/>Thoſe that have this <hi>ſaving</hi> Knowledge of the Love of CHRIST have <hi>him dwelling in their Hearts by Faith.</hi> The Soul has ſeen CHRIST, and been enamoured with him. She has been convinced of her own hopeleſs and helpleſs Condition by Nature, and of his All-ſufficiency and Suitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſees him freely offering himſelf to her in the Goſpel. And hereupon <hi>the Heart opens</hi> to CHRIST; and he makes his glorious and ſolemn Entry into the Soul, turns out Sin and Satan, ſeats himſelf on the Throne of the Heart; and ſays, <hi>This is my Reſt forever, here will I dwell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have deſired it.</hi> This is Love indeed! And now the Soul begins to <hi>know the Love of CHRIST, which paſſeth Knowledge.</hi> Now ſhe cries out with Admiration, Joy and Thankfulneſs, "Is it indeed ſo? Has the King of Glory in very Deed open'd the everlaſting Doors of my Soul? Has he purified my Heart by Faith, from all thoſe filthy Luſts that polluted it? Has he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared it, as a Palace, tor himſelf to dwell in? And do I ſee him, yea, feel him ſeated here? Nay, does he ſpread a Table before me in the Preſence of my Enemies, and feaſt me with Royal Dainties? O <hi>this is the Love of CHRIST</hi> indeed, <hi>which paſſeth Knowledge!</hi>"</p>
            <p>The Soul is alſo now <hi>rooted and grounded in Love.</hi> She feels her Heart drawn out in Affection

to her Saviour, and to all that bear his Image. <hi>He</hi> is the Chiefeſt of ten thouſand, even <hi>altogether Lovely</hi> to her; and <hi>they</hi> are the <hi>excellent of the Earth,</hi> in whom is all her Delight. Now her <hi>Heart burns within her!</hi> Now her moſt ardent Deſires are drawn out! O, how ſhall ſhe come to enjoy more and more of CHRIST, and his Love? How ſhall ſhe be conformed more and more to him? How ſhall ſhe ſpread his Fame, and be any way inſtrumental of diffuſing the Savour of his good Oyntments, that the Virgins alſo may love him? How ſhall ſhe ſecure his gracious Preſence with her? What ſhall ſhe do, that ſhe may keep the Houſe of her Heart ſweet and neat and clean as a fit Manſion for her Beloved? How ſhall ſhe do to prevent the Re-entry of thoſe Goats and Swine, thoſe unclean Luſts and Devils, that heretofore had the Poſſeſſion of her Heart? She's full of <hi>Love.</hi> And ſhe is now <hi>rooted</hi> &amp; <hi>grounded</hi> in this Love. It grows more and more ſtrong and firm; and ſhe reſts in her Love to him, as he does in his to her: The more ſhe ſees of her Beloved, and the more ſhe is acquainted with him, the better ſhe likes him. She likes her Choice too well to change, if ſhe might. Her Love, tho' but a ſmall Plant at firſt, takes Root downward, and bears Fruit upward; it flouriſhes like the Palm-Tree, or like a Cedar in <hi>Lebanon.</hi> And herein
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:006193_0048_102808595D476068"/>
alſo ſhe ſees ſomething more of the Love of CHRIST that paſſeth Knowledge. Surely, She thinks, if I love CHRIST, 'tis becauſe <hi>he firſt loved</hi> me. Here's a ſurprizing, aſtoniſhing Change wrought in me! This is not the natural Frame and Temper of my Heart; far from it! I was an utter Stranger to ſuch Feelings as theſe. I conceited once, I loved CHRIST and thought I knew ſomething of his Love, and had always done ſo; but I found I was deceived. I had embraced an Image formed in my own Brain and Fancy, inſtead of a glorious CHRIST ſeen by Faith. The good Spirit was pleaſed to convince me of my Error, and to ſhew me, that I had no true Love to him; but was under the Power of Prejudice and Enmity againſt him. It <hi>was</hi> the Language of my Heart, <hi>I can ſee no Form nor Comelineſs in him, why I ſhould deſire Him;</hi> neither <hi>will I have this Man to reign over me.</hi> But it is quite otherwiſe with me <hi>now.</hi> I'm fallen deeply in Love with him. I deſire nothing in the World ſo much as to know more and more of him, and be more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to him in Heart, Lip and Life; and that he ſhould rule in me and reign over me for ever. Verily, This muſt be the Effect of that Love of CHRIST to me that paſſeth Knowledge!</p>
            <p>And now ſhe begins to conſider the ſeveral <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions</hi> of this Love, and to take a Proſpect of it every Way, as ſhe is able.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="unknown:006193_0048_102808595D476068"/>'Tis <hi>broad</hi> as Heaven and Earth; it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the whole Body of the Elect in all Nations and Ages. It's broad enough to cover a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Sins, each of them wide as the Sea; yea, Sins numberleſs &amp; infinite in their Aggravations.</p>
            <p>It's <hi>Length</hi> is infinite. It reaches from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to Everlaſting. Look which way you will, you can ſee no End or Beginning to it. You are always at the Middle of this infinite Line, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways will be. Yea, GOD himſelf always was ſo, and always will be ſo. He himſelf remembers <hi>no Beginning</hi> of the Love of CHRIST; for it never had any. He himſelf can ſee <hi>no End</hi> to it, for it never will have any. Herein, as well as in every other Reſpect, the Love of CHRIST differs from all created Love: For his is without any Limit at all. The Love of Angels and Saints will be endleſs, it will never come to any Period; but it had a Beginning. If it proceed never ſo far, yet you may always look back to a Time when there was none at all; for they themſelves were once Nothing. Yea, with Reſpect to Men, it will always be true, that there was once En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity inſtead of Love. The Creature's Love, as to the Length of its Duration, will always be ſhort at one End. Yea, it will never be actually infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. It will never be ſaid, Now it has endured for ever. Tho' it will be for ever mending as to
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:006193_0049_1028085C59980C38"/>
that Defect, if it may be called ſo; for it will be growing longer and longer to Eternity. [And here, by the Way, perhaps, a common Form of Speech might be amended, When inſtead of <hi>To Eternity,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Throughout</hi> Eternity, or <hi>Throughout</hi> the endleſs Ages of Eternity. It may be queried, Whether ſuch Expreſſions are not plain Contradictions, and whether the Scripture is not a Stranger to them.] But CHRIST'S Love (as was ſaid) is properly infinite in Duration. There never was a Time, when himſelf, or his Love was not, or when he had Enmity to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect inſtead of Love.— His Love has endured eternally already. Eternity to come will make no Addition, with reſpect to Eternity paſt, as we diſtinguiſh. With GOD there is no ſuch Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That which we call Time, and Eternity paſt, and Eternity to come, are all preſent to him at once.</p>

            <p>Hence it is ſaid, "From Everlaſting to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting thou <hi>art</hi> GOD": Not Thou <hi>haſt been</hi> from Everlaſting, and Thou <hi>wilt be</hi> to Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

               <pb n="93" facs="unknown:006193_0049_1028085C59980C38"/>The Saints ſee ſomething of the <hi>Depth</hi> of the Love of CHRIST. 'Tis <hi>deeper than Hell: what can we do</hi> at fathoming of it? 'Tis a bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Ocean. It drowns the largeſt Mountains of the moſt heinous Sin, as well as the leaſt Sand; if any of thoſe vaſt Mountains may be called Sands in Compariſon of others. When Sinners were ſunk down to the very Depth of <hi>Hell,</hi> as to their Frame and as to their Deſert; this Love ſunk down lower, and was <hi>beneath them.</hi> Yea, this Love in ſome Senſe, extends ſo as to take in Hell it ſelf. Tho' there are no Objects of his Love there; yet he himſelf is there, by his eſſential Preſence, and infinitely beyond it: And he is <hi>Love,</hi> wherever he is. And his Love could ſwallow up Hell, and turn it into a Heaven of Holineſs and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a Moment, if the Will of GOD were ſo. So deep is this Love, that though it will be the Buſineſs and Bleſſedneſs of Saints and Angels to be diving into it for ever and ever, yet they will never come any nearer to the Bottom of it: For, as was ſaid, it is bottomleſs.</p>
            <p>Believers apprehend ſomething of the <hi>Height</hi> of this Love of CHRIST; tho' 'tis <hi>high as Heaven, what can we know?</hi> 'Tis Topleſs, as well as Bottomleſs.

You, high as the Moſt High himſelf; for 'tis the Love of the MOST-HIGH. In a Word, this Love is every Way boundleſs &amp; infinite. 'Tis the Love of an immenſe Being, and it is itſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and abſolutety immenſe. GOD fills an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Space, an infinite Duration, and infinite Perfection of every Kind; and of equal Extent is the Love of CHRIST, who is GOD. To illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate this a little farther, with Alluſion to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's Way of Speaking in the Context: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an Angel to fly with the inconceivable Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Thought, either backward or forward, upward or downward, to the Right Hand or to the Left, take which Way he will, and let him keep on ſtrait forward for ever and ever; yet will he never get one Hair's-breadth from the very Center of this Love; for 'tis all Center. The Middle is every where. The Circumference or outmoſt Bounds are no where. Yea, may we not venture to ſay, that GOD himſelf and his own infinite Mind is filled with the Love of CHRIST; <hi>For he was daily his Delight, before the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World.</hi> The Love of CHRIST affords his Father an infinite and adequate Satisfaction. In Him his Soul delighteth, nor has, he any greater Delight. In Him he is ever well-pleaſed, nor has he any greater Pleaſure. Well may it then be ſaid, That the Saints who are filled with this

Love, are <hi>filled with all the Fulneſs of GOD!</hi> If this <hi>Love</hi> dwells in them, then <hi>God</hi> dwells in them and they in GOD; as the beloved Diſciple, who lay in CHRIST'S Boſom and knew much of his Heart, expreſſes it, <hi>Filled with all the Fulneſs of God!</hi> 'Tis a bold Expreſſion, but 'tis an inſpired one; and but parallel with ſome other Scripture Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and particularly that of the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> but now mentioned. It muſt needs imply ſomething very great and glorious. There's no ſuch Thing ſaid of the <hi>Angels</hi> of Heaven; for to which of them ſaid he at any Time, Ye ſhall be filled with all the Fulneſs of GOD? Certainly, it muſt imply, that the happy Subjects of this Priviledge me greatly <hi>enlarged</hi> us to then <hi>Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</hi> How capacious muſt that Creature be, that is to take in <hi>all the Fulneſs of GOD!</hi> — It muſt imply, that this Capacity, great as it is, ſhall be gloriouſly <hi>filled;</hi> for what ſo great and glorious as GOD, the <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of GOD, <hi>all</hi> the Fulneſs of GOD! Every Thing ſeems to conſpire to confirm the Suppoſition, that Man, poor fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, ſinful miſerable Man, is to be exalted to the greateſt Degree of Happineſs, that any more Creature is capable of. The bleſſed GOD is ſo far from grudging his Creatures any Happineſs, that he never thinks them happy enough (even ſome of the moſt vile, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               <salute>MY DEAR BROTHER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is an Exerciſe to me to think of the Troubles and Difficulties, which you and my dear Siſter and the little ones are like to meet with in this Time of the Rumour of War: But I muſt confeſs, that is not my greateſt Concern for you and them. No, ſince I hope, (through the infinite rich, free Grace of GOD to the vileſt of Creatures) I have had my Eyes opened to ſee ſomething of the Greatneſs and Certainty of the Things of another World; It ſeems to me, its not ſo much Matter what becomes of me or my friends in this World, provided it may be well with us for ever. O Brother, I cannot expreſs to you how little, nothing, leſs than nothing and Vanity every Thing here looks, when I ſtand as it were on the Brink of Time, and by Faith look into the vaſt Ocean of Eternity. Eternity! O that great Word FOR-EVER, quite ſwallows me up and drowns my Thoughts: I am loſt in Amazement and Aſtoniſhment. What if you or I, or our dear Yoke-Fellows, or Children ſhould be carried into Captivity,

and there ſuffer Hunger and Cold and Nakedneſs, and ſerve our Enemies in the Want of all Things, for many Years, and then be tied to Trees and roaſted alive, as ſome better than we have been ſerved? We ſhall ſcarce feel it at all, if we have the gracious Preſence of GOD with us, and a lively Senſe of the Love of CHRIST; we ſhall ſing and rejoice and praiſe GOD in the midſt of all, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> did, in the Priſon, with their Feet made faſt in the Stocks, and the Martyrs at the Stake. As our Sufferings abound, we have Reaſon to think our Conſolations in CHRIST would abound alſo. And then all thoſe <hi>light Afflictions, which are but for a Moment, would work for us a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory. The Sufferings of this preſent Time are not worthy to be compared with the Glory that ſhall be revealed in us.</hi> But on the other Hand, <hi>What will it profit us to gain the whole World, and loſe our own Souls?</hi> Theſe were to me once only bear Words, and empty Sounds, and as a Tale that is told; but I have ſince ſeen them to be the greateſt Realities. I hope you have alſo had ſomething of the ſame Diſcovery. I was glad when I ſaw you laſt, to hear you ſpeak ſo ſenſibly of ſpiritual Things. I was rejoiced to hear, that you ſpent one whole Night in Diſcourſe with ſuch a live Chriſtian as Mr. <hi>S:</hi> for I concluded that your Talk muſt be about heavenly Things. But, O my dear Brother, you muſt forgive your loving Siſter if I am jealous over you with a godly Jealouſy. When I conſider, that <hi>many are called, but few are choſen,</hi> that <hi>many ſhall ſeek to enter in at the ſtreight Gate, and not be able;</hi> how far a Man may go, and yet, thro' one Temptation or another, fall ſhort at laſt; that ſome are not far from the Kingdom of GOD,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:006193_0053_1028086A4EA06280"/>
and yet never come thither; I am diſtreſſed for you, left all your Convictions ſhould come to nothing. I tremble for fear you ſhould be taken up with the Cares and Troubles of this preſent evil World, ſo as to neglect the one Thing needful. O conſider you cannot ſerve two Maſters, GOD and <hi>Mammon.</hi> If ever you eſcape that dreadful Hell, and obtain that bleſſed Inheritance among the Saints in Light; you muſt make a Buſineſs of Religion, you muſt be in earneſt, and <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtreight Gate; for many ſhall ſeek to enter in, and not be able.</hi> You may think a great deal about your Soul and Eternity; you may be glad to enquire of good People, <hi>What</hi> you <hi>ſhall do to inherit Eternal Life;</hi> you may hear the Word with Joy and much Affection, and do many Things; yea live in all good Conſcience, as you may think, and yet lack <hi>one</hi> Thing. And therefore I muſt entreat and beſeech you, as ever you expect to ſee the Face of GOD with Comfort another Day, that you will never reſt till you are ſure you have experienced a ſaving Change on your Soul. O cry to GOD Day and Night, that he would be pleaſed to ſhew you Things really as they are, and enable you to hate and abhor and forſake all Sin, and <hi>fly for Refuge to lay hold on the Hope ſet before you;</hi> that he would make a ſaving Diſcovery of CHRIST to you, and enable you to receive him as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Goſpel. And if you ſhould knock and ſeek and ſtrive for a while and find no Peace or Comfort, but rather more Terror, or, which is worſe, feel nothing but Deadneſs, Coldneſs and Senſeleſsneſs of Spirit, and in every Reſpect ſeem to grow worſe and worſe, and find Satan more buſy with his Temptations than ever; yet be not diſcouraged by any Means, but hold on ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:006193_0053_1028086A4EA06280"/>
and ſtriving to the laſt Gaſp: <hi>In due Time you ſhall reap, if you faint not.</hi> There's no thinking of looking bark: There's nothing but Death and Damnation there. The Avenger of Blood is cloſe at your Heels. Flee! Flee! for your Life, or you are a dead Man, a damned Man: But before you is a bleſſed City of Refuge, and the dear compaſſionate JESUS pitying you, and praying for you, and with his Arms wide open to receive you, as he has done many of late. O preſs forward and get in, before the Door is ſhut; for then it will be too late for ever.</p>
            <p>My dear Brother, entreat me not to leave you; I muſt cry after you to come to JESUS, come to the Marriage, yet there is Room. I hope, through mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous Grace, your poor unworthy Siſter, and many of your Relations will be admitted to ſit down with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Kingdom of GOD. And can I bear to think my dear Brother ſhould be caſt out, bound Hand and Foot, and caſt into a Lake of Fire, everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels? But how will <hi>you</hi> bear it? How can <hi>your</hi> Heart endure? How can <hi>your</hi> Hands be ſtrong? — But I forget that I am ſpeaking to a Brother, older, and for ought I know, every Way better than my ſelf. If you have had your Eyes opened, you will not wonder, nor be offended with me for being ſo plain and earneſt with you: And if you are yet out of CHRIST, it is impoſſible I ſhould be too earneſt. After all that I or any Man, or Angel, can ſay of the Danger of a Chriſtleſs Eſtate, the Evil of Sin, the Dreadfulneſs of Hell-Torments, the Beauty and Excellency and All-ſufficiency of CHRIST, the Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Child of GOD, the Glory of Heaven,  the Things themſelves will be far above the higheſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions that can be us'd about them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="unknown:006193_0054_1028086E6CCAA4F0"/>O my dear Brother, I am full of this Matter; the Spirit within me conſtraineth me to ſpeak. I can hardly help beginning again. I long that all my dear Friends, and my dear Brother <hi>S,</hi> in particular ſhould come and ſee what there is in CHRIST. O that you could know, what I poor Creature have known, of the Sweetneſs of Communion with GOD! All the Enjoyments of this World are meer Traſh and Huſks and Dogs Meat to it. I have enjoyed more ſolid Satisfaction in one Hour's Communion with GOD, and the raviſhing Senſe of the Love of CHRIST, than all the Comforts of this Life are worth, to be enjoyed for an Age as long as <hi>Methuſalem.</hi> I have been ſo filled with ſpiritual Enjoyments, that I could have no Manner of Reliſh for any Thing elſe: Riches, Honours, Pleaſures ſeemed like <hi>Droſs and Dung</hi> to me, <hi>in Compariſon of the Excellency of the Knowledge and Love of CHRIST JESUS my Lord.</hi> O ſweet! Sweet! Sweet! Beyond all Expreſſion and Compariſon. <hi>Eight</hi> Days and Nights have I lain overwhelmed with Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory, and have not ſlept one Wink, that I was ſenſible of, Day or Night. Still, ſtill, the Joy of the Lord poured in upon me like a Flood, till Nature was quite overpowered, and Reaſon was in great Meaſure drowned: And no wonder; I rather admire that my poor feeble Frame could bear up ſo long as it did under the Preſſure of ſuch a Weight of Glory. I muſt confeſs, I have too much loſt a Senſe of theſe Things; but I firmly believe they came from GOD as a free Gift to one of the leaſt of Mortals and vileſt of Sinners, even your poor Siſter <hi>T.</hi> And I expect a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival again in GOD'S Time, and far more abundant Communication; if not in this World, yet when I
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:006193_0054_1028086E6CCAA4F0"/>
come to be with CHRIST, which is beſt of all. Then, O then, I expect to have my Capacity enlarged, ſo as to drink in whole Rivers, Seas, Oceans of the Love of CHRIST for ever. — And my dear Brother, won't you go along with me? There's enough for you and me, and ten thouſand Miſſion more ſuch; and you are ſincerely and earneſtly invited to come and drink abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly of the Wine of Conſolation. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come; and whoſoever will, let him take of the Water of Life freely.</hi> O, my dear Brother, take and drink and live for ever. What I ſay to you, I ſay to my dear Siſter and Couſine. I hope the young ones will be early Seekers and ſure Finders of CHRIST, as I truſt, thro' free Mercy, the moſt of my Children have been; tho' I have Reaſon to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> over my own and their Declenſions. I leave you with a merciful GOD, hoping he will do more for you than I can aſk or think; and deſire your earneſt Prayers for us all, and particularly for</p>
