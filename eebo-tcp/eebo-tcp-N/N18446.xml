            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The <hi>SECRETARY</hi> of <hi>STATE,</hi> to whom was referred, by the <hi>HOUSE</hi> of <hi>REPRESENTATIVES</hi> of the United States, the petition of <hi>Jacob Iſaacks,</hi> of Newport, in Rhode-Iſland, has examined into the truth and importance of the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations therein ſet forth, and makes thereon the following REPORT.</head>
            <p>THE petitioner ſets forth, that, by various experiments, with conſiderable labor and expence, he has diſcovered a method of converting ſalt-water into freſh, in the proportion of 8 pints out of 10, by a proceſs ſo ſimple that it may be performed on board of veſſels at ſea by the common iron cabouſe with ſmall alterations, by the ſame fire, and in the ſame time, which it uſed for cooking the ſhip's proviſions; and offers to convey to the government of the United States a faithful account of his art, or ſecret, to be uſed by or within the United States, on their giving to him a reward ſuitable to the importance of the diſcovery, and, in the opinion of government, adequate to his expences, and the time he has devoted to the bringing it into effect.</p>
            <p>In order to aſcertain the merit of the petitioner's diſcovery, it becomes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to examine the advances already made in the art of converting ſalt-water into freſh.</p>
            <p>Lord Bacon, to whom the world is indebted for the firſt germs of ſo many branches of ſcience, had obſerved, that, with a heat ſufficient for diſtillation, ſalt will not riſe in vapour, and that ſalt-water diſtilled, is freſh. And it would ſeem that all mankind might have obſerved, that the earth is ſupplied with freſh-water chiefly by exhalation from the ſea, which is in fact an inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible diſtillation effected by the heat of the ſun. Yet this, though the moſt obvious, was not the firſt idea in the eſſays for converting ſalt-water into freſh. Filtration was tried in vain, and congelation could be reſorted to only in the coldeſt regions and ſeaſons. In all the earlier trials by diſtillation, ſome mixture was thought neceſſary to aid the operation by a partial precipitation of the ſalt, and other foreign matters contained in ſea-water. Of this kind were the methods of Sir Richard Hawkins, in the 16th century, of Glauber, Hauton and Liſter, in the 17th, and of Hales, Appleby, Butler, Chapman, Hoffman and Dove, in the 18th: nor was there any thing in theſe methods worthy noting on the preſent occaſion, except the very ſimple ſtill contrived ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore by Capt. Chapman, and made from ſuch materials as are to be found on board every ſhip, great or ſmall. This was a common pot with a wooden lid of the uſual form, in the center of which a hole was bored to receive per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly a ſhort wooden tube, made with an inch and half auger, which perpendicular tube received at it's top, and at an acute angle, another tube of wood alſo, which deſcended till it joined a third, of pewter, made by rolling up a diſh, and paſſing it obliquely through a caſk of cold water. With this ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple machine he obtained two quarts of freſh-water an hour, and obſerved, that the expence of fuel would be very trifling, if the ſtill was contrived to ſtand on the fire along with the ſhip's boiler.</p>
            <p>In 1762, Dr. Lind propoſing to make experiments of ſeveral different mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, firſt diſtilled rain-water, which he ſuppoſed would be the pureſt, and then ſea-water, without any mixture, which he expected would be the leaſt pure, in order to arrange between theſe two ſuppoſed extremes the degree of merit of the ſeveral ingredients he meant to try. "To his great ſurpriſe," as he confeſſes, the ſea-water diſtilled without any mixture, was as pure as the rain-water. He purſued the diſcovery and eſtabliſhed the fact, that a pure and potable freſh-water may be obtained from ſalt-water by ſimple diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation without the aid of any mixture for fining or precipitating it's foreign contents. In 1767, he propoſed an extempore ſtill, which, in fact, was Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's, only ſubſtituting a gun-barrel inſtead of Chapman's pewter tube, and the hand-pump of the ſhip to be cut in two obliquely, and joined again at an acute angle, inſtead of Chapman's wooden tubes bored expreſs; or, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the wooden lid and upright tube, he propoſed a tea-kettle (without It's lid or handle) to be turned bottom upwards over the mouth of the pot, by way of ſtill-head, and a wooden tube leading from the ſpout to a gun-barrel paſſing through a caſk of water, the whole luted with equal parts of chalk and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> moiſtened with ſalt-water.</p>
            <p>With this apparatus of a pot, tea-kettle and gun-barrel, the Dolphin, a 20 gun ſhip, in her voyage round the world, in 1768, from 56 gallons of ſea-water, and with 9lb. of wood and 69lb. of pit-coal, made 42 gallons of good freſh water at the rate of 8 gallons an hour. The Dorſetſhire, in her paſſage from Gibraltar to Mahon, in 1769, made 19 quarts of pure water in 4 hours with 10lb. of wood: And the Slambal, in 1773, between Bombay and Bengal, with a hand-pump, gun-barrel and a pot, of 6 gallons of ſea-water made 10 quarts of freſh water in 3 hours.</p>
            <p>In 1771, Dr. Irvin, putting together Lind's idea of diſtilling without a mixture, Chapman's ſtill, and Dr. Franklin's method of cooling by evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, obtained a premium of 5000l. from the Britiſh parliament. He wet his tube conſtantly with a mop inſtead of paſſing it through a caſk of water: He enlarged its bore alſo in order to give a freer paſſage to the vapour, and thereby encreaſe its quantity by leſſening the reſiſtance or preſſure on the evaporating ſurface: this laſt improvement was his own, it doubtleſs contributed to the ſucceſs of his models; and we may ſuppoſe the enlargement of the tube to be uſeful to that point at which the central parts of the vapour, paſſing through it, would begin to eſcape condenſation. Lord Mulgrave uſed his method in his voyage towards the North Pole in 1773, making from 34 to 40 gallons of freſh water a day, without any great addition of fuel, as he ſays.</p>
            <p>M. de Bougainville in his voyage round the world, uſed, very ſucceſsfully, a ſtill which had been contrived in 1763, by Poyſſonier, ſo as to guard againſt the water being thrown over from the boiler into the pipe by the agitation of the ſhip. In this one ſingularity, was, that the furnace or fire box was in the middle of the boiler, ſo that the water ſurrounded it in contact. This ſtill, however, was expenſive and occupied much room.</p>
            <p>Such were the advances already made in the art of obtaining freſh from ſalt water, when Mr. Iſaacks, the petitioner, ſuggeſted his diſcovery.</p>
            <p>As the merit of this could be aſcertained by experiment only, the Secretary of State aſked the favor of Mr. Rittenhouſe, Preſident of the American Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Society, of Dr. Wiſtar, profeſſor of chemiſtry in the college of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, and Dr. Hutchinſon, profeſſor of chemiſtry in the univerſity of Pennſylvania, to be preſent at the experiments. Mr. Iſaacks fixed the pot of a ſmall cabouſe, with a tin cap and ſtrait tube of tin paſſing obliquely through a caſk of cold water; he made uſe of a mixture, the compoſition of which he did not explain, and from 24 pints of ſea water, taken up about 3 miles out of the Capes of Delaware at flood tide, he diſtilled 22 pints of freſh water in 4 hours, with 20lb. of ſeaſoned pine, which was a little wetted by having lain in the rain.</p>
            <p>In a 2d experiment of the 21ſt of March, performed in a furnace and five gallon ſtill at the college, from 32 pints of ſea water he drew 31 pints of freſh water in 7 h. 24 min. with 51lb. of hickory which had been cut about ſix months. In order to decide whether Mr. Iſaacks's mixture contributed in any and what degree to the ſucceſs of the operation, it was thought proper to repeat his experiment under the ſame circumſtances exactly, except the omiſſion of the mixture. Accordingly on the next day the ſame quantity of ſea water was put into the ſame ſtill, the ſame furnace was uſed, and fuel from the ſame par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel. It yielded, as his had done, 31 pints of freſh water in 11 min. more of time and with 10lb. leſs of wood.</p>
            <p>On the 24th of March Mr. Iſaacks performed a 3d experiment. For this, a common iron pot of 3 ½ gallons was fixed in brick work, and the flue from the hearth wound once round the pot ſpirally, and then paſſed off up a chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The cap was of tin, and a ſtrait tin tube of about two inches diameter, paſſing obliquely through a barrel of water, ſerved inſtead of a worm. From 16 pints of ſea water he drew off 15 pints of freſh water in 2 h. 55 min. with 3lb. of dry hickory and 8lb. of ſeaſoned pine. This experiment was alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the next day, with the ſame apparatus and fuel from the ſame parcel, but without the mixture. Sixteen pints of ſea water yielded in like manner 15 pints of freſh, in 1 min. more of time and with half a pound leſs of wood. On the whole, it was evident that Mr. Iſaacks's mixture produced no advantage, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the proceſs or reſult of the diſtillation.</p>
            <p>The diſtilled water in all theſe inſtances was found on experiment to be as pure as the beſt pump water of the city. Its taſte indeed was not as agreeable, but it was not ſuch as to produce any diſguſt. In fact, we drink in common life, in many places, and under many circumſtances, and almoſt always at ſea, a worſe taſted, and probably a leſs wholeſome water.</p>
            <p>The obtaining freſh from ſalt water, was for ages conſidered as an important deſideratum for the uſe of navigators. The proceſs for doing this by ſimple diſtillation is ſo efficacious, the erecting an extempore ſtill with ſuch utenſils as are found on board of every ſhip is ſo practicable, as to authorize the aſſertion, that this deſideratum is ſatisfied to a very uſeful degree. But though this has been done for upwards of 30 years, though its reality has been eſtabliſhed by the actual experience of ſeveral veſſels which have had recourſe to it, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fact nor the proceſs is known to the maſs of ſeamen, to whom it would be the moſt uſeful, and for whom it was principally wanted. The Secretary of State is therefore of opinion, that ſince the ſubject has now been brought under obſervation; it ſhould be made the occaſion of diſſeminating its know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge generally and effectually among the ſeafaring citizens of the United States. The following is one of the many methods which might be propoſed for doing this. Let the clearance for every veſſel ſailing from the ports of the United States, be printed on a paper, on the back whereof ſhall be a printed account of the eſſays which have been made for obtaining freſh from ſalt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, mentioning ſhortly thoſe which have been unſucceſsful, and more fully thoſe which have ſucceeded; deſcribing the methods which have been found to anſwer for conſtructing extempore ſtills of ſuch implements as are generally on board of every veſſel, with a recommendation, in all caſes where they ſhall have occaſion to reſort to this expedient for obtaining water, to publiſh the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of their trial in ſome gazette on their return to the United States, or to communicate it for publication to the office of the Secretary of State, in order that others may, by their ſucceſs, be encouraged to make ſimilar trials, and be benefitted by any improvements or new ideas which may occur to them in practice.</p>
