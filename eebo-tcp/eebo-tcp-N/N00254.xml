            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Concerning the Reasons inducing to the <hi>Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of these <hi>Sermons, </hi> besides the desires of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny among your selves (who have readily undertaken for the charge of this <hi>Impression</hi>) and of others also, in remote corners of this wilderness (whose judgement I value) that have importuned me to write on some of these Subjects: together with the gracious suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess which God was pleased to give unto sundry of them when first Preached; I must confess, that the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Subjects themselves here treated upon, was principal in moving me thereunto.

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in overmuch inculcating that great duty of <hi>PRATER,</hi> in the constant, and conscionable practice whereof, so much of Religion doth consist. And I must say, that if any amongst you shall omit what God requires of you in that respect, either in your Families or in your Closets both the words that have been spoken to you in the Congregation, full many a time, and this Publication also, will witness against you at the last day And as for
<pb facs="unknown:000322_0005_0FA4AF8189EA5480"/>
that Sacred Ordinance of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> there are some truly godly ones, that upon one pretence or other, wrong the Name of Christ, and their own Souls also, by living in the neglect of so great an Institution. And there are more that don't endeavour to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for it. Yea, it is to be feared that amongst those that do come <hi>unto,</hi> there are many who eat and drink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily <hi>at</hi> the Lords Table. Partly for that they do not so clearly understand, the Nature, Meaning, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Design of those Holy Mysteries, as ought to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But chiefly for want of that <hi>Habitual,</hi> or (if not so) <hi>Actual</hi> preparation which is necessary when persons draw so near unto God, as in that solemn and sacred Ordinance, they do. So that insisting on such a Subject may not seem unprofitable, or unseasonable. I know that many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Ministers of Christ, have written thereon, as of late, Mr. <hi>Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> notwithstanding the accuracy attending the Sermons of some in these dayes) I acknowledge my self to be an Admirer of the Solidity, and Spiritual Wisdome appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Books of those that lived in the Age before us. But there are not many of you, that have the Treatises mentioned in your Hands or Houses.

As for the other <hi>Subjects</hi> here discoursed on, they have been rarely (some of them not at all, so far as I have understood) handled by others in their Sermons; and yet I am mistaken, if there be not special cause to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist thereon in this place, and at this time.</p>
            <p>I shall not in this <hi>Epistle,</hi> leave any words of more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Advice with you, having done that already, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <hi>Dedication</hi> to your selves, written ten years ago, when I did not think of living until this day. All that I have to add at present, is to encourage you in well-doing. And if I (who, you will all say, have not been wont to flatter you) take notice of some vertues, wherein the the Lord hath caused you to excel, and shine as lights un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, <hi>I</hi> trust <hi>I</hi> shall therein, follow the holy Example of the Lord Jesus Christ, who doth not only reprove the failings, but take notice of the Graces in His Churches, before all the world. Let me then say, that there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things wherein you have (through the Grace of Christ) been exemplary, and wherein the Lord hath owned you, unto mine, and other mens admiration. Let God in Christ Jesus alone have all the glory!</p>
            <p>One thing wherein you have set a good Example, is, in that four years ago, you set apart a day for no other cause but only that so you might, by Fasting and Prayer, cry unto the Lord, for converting Grace to be poured down upon the souls of our poor Children. You were told for your encouragement (in the Sermon which was then Preached) that within the space of seven years before that near upon fourscore persons had presented themselves, and declared before the Church what God had done for their Souls. Let me now add, that since your agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to keep that day of Fasting and Prayer, there have appeared upwards of seventy more (the most of them of the Rising Generation) who have publickly expressed the Experiences which they have had of the work of God upon them, in convincing them of their misery by nature, and in helping them to come unto Jesus Christ, and to close with him according to the terms of the Gospel. And besides all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se, there is a considerable number of young persons, belonging to this Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, with whom <hi>I</hi> have had occasion, personally to treat, and concerning whom <hi>I</hi> am perswaded God hath
<pb facs="unknown:000322_0007_0FA4AF8326AACDC0"/>
begun a good work in them, and will finish it until the day of Christ. This is a great answer of Prayer! And many among your selves have been so much affected with it, as to importune me that there might be a Day set apart publickly to praise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Lord for the great things that he hath done for us, and for our Children. Some peculiar considerations, have made me less willing to comply with your desires in that matter. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, I thought it my duty, in all humility, thus publickly to take notice of the Grace of God towards us, that so His Name may have the glory of it, both whilest I am alive, and after I am dead: And that your selves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may be encouraged to pray; yea, to set dayes apart, to Fast and Pray, until the Spirit from on High <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e poured down upon the Souls of Children.</p>
            <p>Another thing, wherein the Lord hath enabled you to set a good Example, is, in that you were (though not the first, yet) among the first, that did above two years ago, solemnly renew their Covenant, to walk with God as the Gospel requireth. And as you did then visibly, and unanimously own the Lord, so hath he since the same day, visibly owned you, more then formerly, not only in giving you to see some special answers of Prayer; But in that God hath since that time, within the compass of less then two years, added to your number above three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score Souls. O that God would help us ever to keep Covenant with him; that so he may not be provoked to do us hurt, after he hath done us good.</p>
            <p>I must also mention one thing more, wherein you have been exemplary, and that is, your love, and respect to those who have been over you in the Lord. I many times think, there is not a Congregation in <hi>New-England</hi>

               </hi> these <hi>Sermons</hi> (which were all Preached since that) or any other endeavours of mine, have been blessed for spiritual good to any of you, <hi>I</hi> hope you shall not repent of those Prayers, either now or at the last day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> may truly say that concerning you, which <hi>I</hi> know not whether any other Minister in the Land can say of his People (tis possible some of them may say as much, though <hi>I</hi> am sure all cannot) <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That <hi>I</hi> have not (to my remembrance) for these many years, made any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal to you, but the generality of you have readily (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept only in one thing) hearkened unto me. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of which, hath not been, that <hi>I</hi> have been sparing to put you upon things, which <hi>I</hi> believed would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in the sight of God; nor hath it been for any wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that <hi>I</hi> have more then any living, and therefore it must needs proceed from that gracious inclination, wherewith the <hi>L</hi>ord hath endowed you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi>ndeed, there is one thing, that <hi>I</hi> have often urged upon you, but could not obtain your consent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with me. <hi>I</hi> have often times desired you to look after some settled and constant help for me, in the work of the Ministry, and have proposed several to you for that end; but you did not see cause to comply with my Motion therein: but instead of that, you have set your eyes and hearts upon one, whom <hi>I,</hi> tis true, (only from relative considerations) was very backward to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unto his improvement, in the same Congregation with my self: Yet have <hi>I</hi> no reason to find fault with you in this matter; but rather to thank you for your love,
<pb facs="unknown:000322_0009_0FA4AF85EB8BA0F8"/>
since the person whom you have urgently, and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously desired is my <hi>Son,</hi> who hath laboured in the work of the Gospel among you these two years. I would pray you not to take it ill, that I have been so slow in concurring with your desires respecting such an one, considering that my averseness (which many of you seemed to be troubled at) proceeded not from want of love to your selves, who have so many waves obliged me, that I cannot think my Son, or any thing that is mine, too good or too dear for you; and therefore upon the continued unanimity of your call, I have been passive therein. And I am really sensible of your affection ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested towards my self in the great love, and respect you have shewed to one so (no man in this world more) nearly related to me.</p>
            <p>When I was, the last year, upon the doleful breach made on the <hi>Colledge,</hi> by the death of <hi>New-Englands SAMUEL,</hi> solicited to remove from you, in order to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that which is indeed a <hi>great Service</hi> (but I cannot say, a greater then what God hath here advantaged me with, if I have an heart to improve my opportunities where I am) in another place, the sense of the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, I have received from you, hath made such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression upon my Spirit, as that I never had the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to leave you, without your own free consent thereunto.</p>
            <p>If I knew how to requite your love, I would do it! I have no other way to manifest my longings after you all, but by Prayers day and night for you, and by <hi>Writing</hi> as well as by publick Ministrations, and personal instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (so far as time and strength will permit) to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour that I may promote the spiritual, and eternal welfare of you and yours.

There are two Doctrines which the Prophet doth here instruct men in. One is concerning the difference between Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and Wicked men, the happiness of the one, and the misery of the other, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. The other Doctrine is that which the Psalm begins with, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That they are blessed Men whose sins are forgiven, <hi>ver.</hi> 1,2. And it is worthy our obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that <hi>David</hi> having propounded this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, he doth explain, confirm, and apply it. 1. This Doctrine is explained by shewing who they are that have their sins forgiven, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> They that make a sincere confession of them, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>In whose spirit there is no guile.</hi> h. e. one that is sincere and plain hearted in confessing his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

               </gap> in the heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so when they make a free and full confession of it before the Lord, and before men too, as God shall call thereunto, thats a good evidence of sincerity, even of one in whose spirit there is no reigning guile. 2. This Doctrine is confirmed by Instancing and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>Davids</hi> own experience. <hi>He</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that whilst he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 3,4,5. <hi>A</hi>nd elsewhere we read, that when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> made an humble, penitent acknowledgement of his vils, the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> told him, that God had put away his sin, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12,13. 3. <hi>H</hi>e ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth application of the Doctrine thus explained and confirmed, by an useful inference therefrom, in the 6. <hi>verse.</hi> The Use which he makes of it, is plainly this, That Men should be much in Prayer to God, and that every godly man will be so.<hi>For this</hi> (saith <hi>David) h. e.</hi> because of this: since it is so, that they are blessed whose sins are forgiven, and since it is so, that I upon a sincere confession of my sin, have found pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy with the Lord, every godly man will from my experience be encouraged to pray unto him.</p>
            <p>In the Words before us, we have,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Duty which should be done, <abbr>

            </p>
            <p>There are especially two Doctrines which these words afford unto us,</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:000322_0015_0FA4AF8B26C2C678"/>
Doct. 1. That to be much in Prayer unto God, is, as the duty of every Man, so the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of every Godly Man.</p>
            <p>Doct 2. That Men ought not only to Pray unto God for pardon and Salvation, but they should be sure to do this, in the time wherein He may be found.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In order to the further prosecuting and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Doctrine, there are three things to be enquired into. 1. What Prayer is? 2. Who are concerned in the performance of this Duty? 3 The Reasons why every Godly M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Q.</hi> 1. <hi>What is Prayer? Ans.</hi> Prayer is a making known the desires of our hearts before God, in the Name of Jesus Christ, concerning things agreeable unto his will.</p>

omnipotent as well as omnipresent. Therefore He whose Name alone is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> is the only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Prayer.</p>
            <p>Prop. 3. <hi>Prayer is to be presented before God, in the alone Name of Jesus Christ.</hi> Men having sinned, they must not have to do with God, but in and through the Mediator. As <hi>Joseph</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43. 5. <hi>You shall not see my face except your Brother be with you;</hi> so doth the Lord say unto sinners, you shall not see my face except you come in the Name of Jesus Christ. Both prayers and praises, both petitions and thanksgivings for mercy, are to be offered unto God in the Name of his Son Jesus Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13, 15. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 13. 14. For it is through him, that we find any acceptance with the holy and glorious God. If our persons are accepted or if our prayers and services are so, it is upon Christs account, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 5. Now there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things implyed in praying, through the Name of Christ.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That in Prayer we are to look immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Christ, and so unto God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 4. <hi>The smoke of the Incense which came with the prayers of Saints, ascended up before God out of the Angels hands. T</hi>he Lord Jesus Christ is the Angel of the everlasting Covenant; we are to put our prayers into his hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that so they may become as Incense before the Lord. Of old if a man had a Sacrifice to offer, he might not bring it to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000322_0020_0FA4AF906871F930"/>
God immediately, but by the Priest. <hi>Lev.</hi> 17.3.4. Thus must we come unto God by Jesus Christ, bringing our Spiritual Sacrifices unto him, that he may present them to the Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. Christ the Mediator, is the next object of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship, God the ultimate object thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When in Prayer, we act Faith upon the merit and mediation of the Lord Jesus, then do we pray in his Name. The Lords Servants of old, were to pray, looking towards the <hi>Temple</hi> or <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 47, 48<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Psal.</hi> 138. 2. <hi>Jon.</hi> 2.4. because that was a type of Christ; so that by looking thereunto, they testified their hopes of acceptance through his merit and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation. We must bear wholly upon Christs Interest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for access and success before the throne of Grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In these dayes of the <hi>New-Testament,</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Christs Name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> implieth a seeking for mercy on account of the satisfaction which Christ hath already made unto divine Justice. Christ told his Disciples they had as yet asked nothing in his Name, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.24. that is to say on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his death and satisfaction thereby made unto divine Justice. For the Saints of God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes expected answers of Prayer on Christs account, and so prayed in his Name before he came into the world.

mercy was prayed and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oped for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of that which Christ should do hereafter, whenas in the times of the Gospel we pray for audience on the account of what Christ hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done. This is implied in praying in his Name.</p>
            <p>And thus to do is essential unto prayer: yea, thus doth every one that is godly pray. As for <hi>Pagans</hi> that pray unto God without any Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour; and <hi>Papists</hi> that pray unto him through other Mediators besides Christ; that make Saints and Angels their Mediators, thereby turning Christ out of his office, so far as is in in them to do; their prayers are as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o prayers: yea when they offer Incense it is an abomination to the Lord.</p>
            <p>Prop. 4. <hi>As for the matter of prayer, it is to be for things agreeable to the Will of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 14. The holy Incense appointed under the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which signified Prayer, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 11.) was to be made exactly according to divine prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Exod,</hi> 30. 34, 35. so must prayer be, as to the matter of it. Whatever is promised in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, is fit matter for prayer: even temporal blessings, so far as the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to bestow them, but especially spiritual and eternal blessings, (they being the chief things spoken of in the Covenant) are to be prayed for. And above all, we are to pray that God may have glory, and that the Kingdome and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000322_0022_0FA4AF92149C3AD8"/>
of the Lord Jesus Christ may be advanced. All this we see in that <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Platform</hi> of <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> (commonly called the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi>) which the Lord Christ hath given to his Disciples for their direction and imitation. To present un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful desires before God. is a great transgression of the Rule of prayer. It is to offer a dead pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted thing upon the Lords <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ltar:</hi> yet we find that sometimes godly men have offended this way. So did the Sons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> when imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Christ would have a pompous temporal dominion, they prayed for great enjoyments in the world. What warrant had they from any word of God, to come before the Lord with such a request as that was? so when persons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der deep affliction do out of the impatiency of their Spirits, pray and wish for Death, thats an unlawful desire: thus did godly <hi>Job,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times miss it in his prayers, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6, 7, 8. <hi>O</hi> (saith he) <hi>that I might have my request! and that God would grant me this thing that I long for, even that it would please God to destroy me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off.</hi> So <hi>Jonah,</hi> He was afraid that some would look upon him as a false Prophet; and rather then undergo a little disgrace from men; in a sullen pang of discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, he beseecheth God to take away his life from him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 3. God delights not in such requests as these are. They are not as <hi>Incense before him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:000322_0023_0FA4AF92B100FBA0"/>
Thus have we done with the first thing propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be spoken unto, namely, what prayer is!</p>
            <p>We came to the second enquiry, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
               <hi>Who are concerned in the performance of this duty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> To pray unto the Lord is <hi>every mans du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> though to pray aright, is only the godly mans practice, yet it is that which all men are bound unto, as appears:</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that Prayer is a part of Natural, Moral Worship. There are two sorts of Worship due to God, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> Natural and Instituted worship. As for Instituted worship, it depends wholly upon the will of God, and therefore only some men, and in some ages are obliged to attend thereto, according as God shall please to reveal of his will unto them. Natural worship is that which if a man doth understand any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature of the blessed and glorious God, he cannot but know that such worship is due unto him. Hence all men, and that in all ages are concerned therein. And of this sort is prayer: hence not only Men but holy Angels pray unto the Lord. Yea the Saints in glory pray, and will do so, for ever. They praise God,&amp; thats one sort of prayer, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 11, 13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Prayer is a duty required in the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment: although the publick stated dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the duty is enjoyned in the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, nevertheless, when in the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment it is said, <hi>thou shalt have the Lord to be
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000322_0024_0FA4AF93794BD4D8"/>
thy God,</hi> part of the meaning is, thou shalt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him, and pray to him. As all men are bound by vertue of that Commandment to love the Lord, and to fear him, so are they no less bound to pray unto him; that being one way whereby they express both their love unto, and their fear of his great Name.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we consider the several sorts of men that are in the World, we shall see that Prayer is every mans duty. All men are divided into these two sorts, godly and ungodly; regenerate and unregenerate. Both these ought to pray unto the Lord. As for godly men, the Text speaks expresly. And the Lord Jesus Christ taught his Disciples both that they ought, and how they ought to pray. And as for unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men, they are not exempted from their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation unto this duty, though they be unable to perform it aright. The unconverted are bound to pray that converting grace may be given to them. Christ tells the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> whilst unconverted, that she should ask for living water, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 10. Those that have not as yet a new heart, are bid to pray that the Lord would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow it on them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 37. such as never yet found God, but are out of his favor, are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to seek his face and favour, <hi>Isai.</hi> 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. 6, 7. The whole Nation of the <hi>Jews.</hi> (wherein were few godly men comparatively) are commanded to pray in the most solemn manner, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000322_0025_0FA4AF9428D723A0"/>
Magus</hi> when in the gall of bitterness and under the bond of iniquity, was by the Apostle called upon to pray for the par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on of his sins, <hi>Act</hi> 8. 22. Are not ungodly men bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? Where the Gospel is Preached, they are so, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 30. And therefore to pray: For confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sin, and begging for mercy, is one thing in Repentance and in Prayer. <hi>A</hi>nd the Lord out of his infinite goodness, doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times so far hear unregenerate men praying and crying unto him, as to deliver them from tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral judgements, thereby to encourage them to seek unto him for greater mercies: as we see in <hi>Rehoboam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> in <hi>Ahab,</hi> and in the <hi>Ninivites.</hi> If prayer were not their duty, the Lord would not so far manifest respect to them, as to bestow a temporal Reward, or remove temporal judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from them upon their praying to him. It is objected by some, that the prayers of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, are an abomination, and how then is prayer their duty? ought they to do that which is an abomination? <hi>Ans.</hi> It is indeed most true, that a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit. All the actions of ungodly men are abominable in the Lords sight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as proceeding from them, who are his enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 14. but will any man therefore say, that such men must be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether idle, and attend no duty, neither of their general, nor of their particular callings. The plowing of the wicked is sin. Must he now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in the Lords sight, as his praying. For without Faith it is impossible to please God. Must he then neither read nor hear the Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God forbid that Men should to wrest the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unto their own destruction. The reason why the prayers of an ungodly man are an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, is not because prayer is not his duty, but because he doth not so perform that his duty as he should do.</p>
            <p>We come now unto the third thing proposed to be enquired into, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the <hi>Reasons</hi> why every godly man doth and will pray.</p>
            <p>Reas. 1. <hi>Because godly men have the spirit of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 24. <hi>Hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the spirit which he hath given us.</hi> Every true Believer hath received the spirit: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>If any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</hi> The Soul of a godly man is become the everlasting habitation of the spirit of God. Now the holy Spirit, when he dwells in the heart, doth incline unto prayer, he causeth the grate the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of prayer to be in the Soul. Hence is that expression in the <hi>Scripture, of a spirit of prayer, Zech.</hi> 12. 10. when a man hath an habitual incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation unto prayer, wrought in his heart by the holy Spirit of God; then hath he the spirit of prayer. And the holy Spirit doth enable every
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000322_0027_0FA4AF98ECD02B00"/>
one is godly to pray. He helps them with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and helpeth them by stirring up affections, and fervency therein: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. <hi>Likewise the Spirit helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the spirit it self maketh intercession for us with Gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nings which cannot be uttered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reas. 2. <hi>Every godly man is sensible of his wants and miseries.</hi> They that feel their wants will cry for relief: so do all that are godly. Therefore are they called <hi>the Humble, Psal.</hi> 10. 17. The humble man is sensible of his own emptiness and nothingness, and that he needs continual supplies of Grace from God by Jesus Christ. The more grace every man hath, the more doth he feel his want of grace, and that sets him a praying for it. He that hath the grace of knowledge is sensible of his ignorance, and therefore prayes for more wisdome, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 5. He that hath the grace of Faith is sensible of his unbelief, and therefore prayeth against it: <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 24. The Apostles having faith, were sensible that they stood in need of more, and of much Faith, and that made them pray, <hi>Lord, increase our Faith, Luk.</hi> 17. 5. he that hath the grace of Repentance, is sensible of the hardness of his own heart, and therefore prayeth against it, <hi>Isai,</hi> 63. 17.</p>
            <p>Reas 3. <hi>Every Godly man hath Faith.</hi> The Godly man, and the true Believer on Christ are the same. Now by his Faith, he doth see and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000322_0028_0FA4AF9AA393A698"/>
apprehend these things which set him a praying. He seeth that in God which doth encourage him to pray unto him. By Faith be seeth that the Lord is able to supply all the necessities of his poor creatures, and to help them whatever their distresses may be, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 12. Also by his Faith he seeth that God is willing as well as able to save those that seek unto him. That he is a God full of mercy, ready to forgive those that unfeignedly repent of their sins, and that's a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous encouragement unto Prayer, as is in the Context intimated. I confessed my sin (saith <hi>David</hi>) and then the Lord forgave mine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and therefore every godly man that shall hear of this, will be encouraged to pray unto so gracious a God. He that doth not believe will not pray <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. But he that doth believe will pray, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116 10. <hi>I believed, therefore have I spoken.</hi> He believed that God would save him, and that caused him to speak and pour out his heart in Prayer before the Lord.</p>
            <p>Reas. 4. <hi>Every godly man doth love the Lord, Jam.</hi> 2. 5. Hence he delights in communion with him. A man will be free to unbosome himself, and to open his heart unto a dear and faithful friend, whom he loveth and delights in. Thus the Saints of God love him dearly, and therefore they cannot live without Prayer unto him. If they be kept from communion with God in that way, though but for a few hours, they think the time
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000322_0029_0FA4AF9AF5636778"/>
long until they can have an opportunity of holy converse with him again. <hi>David</hi> loved the Lord; therefore would he call upon him as long as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The Host of Heaven doth worship him, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.6. <hi>The multitude of the Heavenly Host are praising God, saying. Glory to God in the highest,</hi> Luk. 2. 13, 14. Is it not our honour and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that whilst on Earth, we may be imployed in the same work with the Angels of Heaven, and Saints in glory? Moreover, hereby God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, when his Servants and Suppliants come and present humble Petitions before the Lord that sits upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:000322_0036_0FA4AFA1017EACD8"/>
Consider 4. <hi>That men (especially they that are godly) have great encouragement to be act his work;</hi> to be much in the practice of this great duty. There is great reason for them to hope that they shall not lose their labour. <hi>H</hi>e hath not said to the seed of <hi>Jacob, Seek ye me in vain.</hi> Many things might be mentioned here, the conidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof is a marvellous encouragement and inducement unto prayer: <hi>e<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> g.</hi> The gracious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the blessed God. When poor Creatures cry unto him, he will hear: for he is gracious. <hi>H</hi>e is infinitely gracious and thence ready to forgive those that have been the greatest rebels against him, if they confess their iniquity, and humbly pray &amp; seek unto him for mercy <hi>Benha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dads</hi> servants were encouraged in their supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because they had heard, that the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> were merciful Kings. We know that the God and King of <hi>H</hi>eaven is a merciful God, and shall we not then pray unto him? <hi>H</hi>e is a sin-par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning God, and that consideration should move us unto Prayer. It is the very motive which the Psalmist in this Context maketh use of, to excite every one that is godly to pray. So in <hi>Psal.</hi> 86. 4,5. <hi>Unto thee O Lord do I lift up my Soul, for thou art ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all them that call upon thee, give car O Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Prayer.</hi> As for the Apostate Angels, they do not pray unto God, because he never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed his mercy to them, they have no hopes
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000322_0037_0FA4AFA1AF3D7D98"/>
of a pardon if they should pray for it, never so earnestly; but it is otherwise with the Children of men. The Lord from Heaven declareth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that though their sins have been never so many, and never so great if they do in a way of Repentance seek unto him he will abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardon them. <hi>Isai.</hi> 55. 67.</p>
            <p>Again, that consideration of a Mediator for sinners; (that the Son of God is become their Mediator) is a glorious encouragement unto Prayer. To this purpose doth the Apostle speak 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. <hi>with ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Let prayers be made for all men, for there is one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.</hi> There is a Mediator (saith he) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or all sorts of men, and therefore pray for all sorts of men. And this consideration is else-where improved by the same Apostle as an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement unto prayer In <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Seeing, that we have a great High Priest, that is passed into the Heavens. Jesus the Son of God;</hi> it is added in <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Let us therefore come boldly to the Throne of grace.</hi> Since we have such an one as the Son of God to be our Mediator in Heaven, therefore let us with humble boldness ply the Throne of grace continually. Christ the Mediator hath sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied divine justice for the sins of Believers: And he doth intercede with God for them, that their Souls may be saved, and their Prayers heard. While the Priest executing his Office did burn Incense, being entred into the Temple
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000322_0038_0FA4AFA2B823A0B8"/>
of the Lord, the people were praying without, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.9, 10. Thus while Believers are praying on Earth, Christ is interceding in <hi>H</hi>eaven for them. Moreover, as for godly men, they are the Favourites of <hi>H</hi>eaven, therefore they should be much in Prayer. <hi>The Lords ear is open to their cry, Psal.</hi> 34 15. even as the ears of a Prince are open to the requests of his special Favourites, The godly man hath the King of <hi>H</hi>eavens <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>Cousid. 5. <hi>The Lords Servants, have ever found him to be a Prayer hearing God.</hi> Psal. 65. 2. <hi>O thou that hearest Prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.</hi> All flesh, Believers, in all ages have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the truth of this.

Thus <hi>Daniel</hi> found it, that whiles he was speaking and praying, and presenting his Supplication before the Lord his God; an Angel was sent from <hi>H</hi>eaven, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him, that from the beginning of his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, he was accepted. <hi>Chap</hi> 9.20. 23.

And humane as well as divine Story abounds with instances to this purpose, as I have elsewhere noted. And may not we our selves set our Seals to this truth?
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000322_0040_0FA4AFA633DDD500"/>
where is <hi>the godly man,</hi> but may do so? May we not say after <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 35.3. <hi>God answered me in the day of my distress?</hi> and after <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam.22.7. <hi>In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my God, and he did hear my voice out of his Temple, &amp; my cry did enter into his Ears.</hi> And as for those publick solemn Prayers which have been poured out before the Lord, have not our eyes seen, that it hath not been in vain. In times of Drought, we have sought the Lord; and he hath sometimes sent a plentiful Rain, on the very day when his People were earnestly praying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him for that mercy. In the late War with the <hi>Heathen</hi> amongst whom we live, what great things hath the Lord done for us, in answer to Prayer? That mortal Contagion wherewith so many Families were afflicted but two years ago, Prayer hath prevailed with the Lord to remove it, and to heal this Land. Let us then resolve with <hi>David;</hi> (surely every godly praying soul hath cause to say, as he did,) <hi>Psa.</hi> 116.1,2. <hi>I love the Lord because he has heard my voice and my sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, because he hath enclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I shall live.</hi>

Thus do we read concerning <hi>Jacob,</hi> that by his <hi>strength he had power with God;</hi> yea, <hi>when he wept and made supplication to him, he had power over the Angel and prevailed,</hi>

            <p>Consider, 7. <hi>The present times.</hi> The day we live in, is such as calleth upon every one that is godly to pray. Never more need of prayer then at this time. I may say this day as one of the Martyrs said, when he was going to die. <hi>Pray, pray, pray, never more need then now.</hi> Clouds and Thunders, Storms and Tempests, are ready to crack and break upon a sinful and miserable world, and will you not pray? shall we be worse then the old ungodly world? When they saw that the flood was indeed a coming did they not pray think you? Behold! we may see it at this day. <hi>The floods of great waters,</hi> are coming
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000322_0045_0FA4AFA9E8A55D70"/>
and hastening upon the world; yea, upon this generation; and shall we not pray? did not they cry <hi>An Ark an Ark!</hi> that we perish not in the flood? and wilt not thou then cry, a <hi>Christ, a Christ!</hi> to save my poor soul, that I perish not in the deep and dark waters of infinite wrath. Other considerations have been mentioned to quicken and encourage the godly, but this should <hi>Awaken</hi> the ungodly unto prayer also.</p>
            <p>Quest <hi>What shall be done that so the Lord may accept of us, if we pray unto him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. If a man would have his prayers finde audience and acceptance in Heaven, then <hi>he must look to his state.</hi> God doth not respect first the prayer, and then the person, but first the person and then the prayer. He that is as to his state a true Believer, and so in Christ, his prayers are acceptable before the Lord. Why did <hi>Abels</hi> offering find acceptance with the Lord, rather then <hi>Cains?</hi> it was because <hi>Abel</hi> had Faith, but <hi>Cain</hi> had none, and without that, it is impossible to please God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. If a man be as to his spiritual state a truly <hi>godly man,</hi> then God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his prayer, as my Text doth intimate. If he be <hi>sincere,</hi> then he may be sure that God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect his prayer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of Faith.</hi> If there be a true, <hi>i. e.</hi> a sincere heart in the sight of God, a man may draw near to him in prayer, with the assurance of Faith for gracious accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000322_0046_0FA4AFAAAFB69D68"/>
God heareth not sinners: but sincere worshippers, and such as do his will, them he heareth. <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.31. If there be no sin which a man doth love of live in, then his Prayers are pleasing and precious before the Lord, otherwise they are not so: therefore <hi>David</hi> speaketh as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 66.20. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He that would have his prayers acceptable, <hi>must look to his walking.</hi> He must be careful to walk closely with God; and take heed of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by giving way to sin, left the Lord turn a deaf ear upon all his prayers. After that <hi>Saul</hi> had sinned, and departed from God, his enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries after the Lord were not regarded, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.6. <hi>When Saul enquired of the Lord, the Lord answered him not.</hi> And not only a <hi>Saul,</hi> but one that is as to his state a godly man, may by his loose and careless walking, provoke the Lord to frown upon his prayers. Hence the Church complains, that as a just fruit of their transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing against the Lord, <hi>He had covered himself with a cloud that their prayer should not pass through, Lam.</hi> 3.42,44. God clouds his face from his own Children, that they see no answer to their prayers, and many times some Sin o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

a day do they enjoy that have the Gospel and the means of grace vouchsafed to them. <hi>If thou hadst known in this thy day the things that belong unto thy peace,</hi> Luk. 19. 42. Whilst Christ and his Messengers were treating with them, about the great and everlasting concernments of their souls, that was <hi>their day.</hi> This finding time is <hi>the accepted time, and the day of Salvation,</hi> 2 Cor.6.2. Now when the Gospel is Preached, thats a day for men to look after their Salvation, and a time wherein God will accept of them if they pray unto him, as they should do. It is a fit season for men to be at work whilest the light shineth upon them. So should we be at work about our Salvation, whilst we have the light of the Gospel afforded unto us for that end. The Gospel is compared unto light, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Walk as Children of the light.</hi> h. c. as becometh the Gospel. Hence Christ said to the <hi>Jews,</hi> Joh. 12 35. <hi>Yet a little while is the Light with you, walk whilest you have the light, left darkness come upon you;</hi> intimating not only that the Lord himself would depart from them, but that the Gospel, and means of grace should be removed from that people. The light of the Gospel sheweth men the way to find the Lord. Yea, the Lord is near then. He cometh in the Gospel and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers himself to them, saying, <hi>Behold me! behold me!</hi> if they will but turn their eyes and look after him. Wherefore the A postle tells the <hi>Ephesians</hi>

that Christ <hi>came,</hi> (i.e. in the chariot of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel) <hi>and preached peace to them,</hi> Eph. 2.17. This then, is the time to find the Lord in. To this purpose doth the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> speak (Chap. 55. 6.) saying, <hi>Seek the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near:</hi> q. d. Now is the time when the Lord is rear unto you: even now whilest God is sending his Messengers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and exhort you; now the Lord is near to you, therefore now is a finding time, and should be a praying time. The Lord is then at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry door: <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Behold I stand of the door and knock.</hi> While the Sermon is Preaching Christ is standing at the door of thy heart, knocking there; so that there is a blessed oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to find him, and to enjoy him for ever.</p>

4. <hi>The time of prosperity.</hi> Even before the floods of great water come: The miserable <hi>Jews</hi> are ruined <hi>because they knew not the time of their visitation.</hi> Luk. 19 44. As long as the offers of Grace lasted; and whilest they enjoyed dayes of external peace, that was the time of their visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and the day for them to have known the things of their peace. Had they prayed then, as they should have done, they might have been happy for ever. Men will be most likely to be sincere in their praying to God, if they do so in the time of their prosperity, and therefore most like to find him then. There are some, that when trouble is upon them, they will pour out a Prayer, yet the Lord accepts not of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do it not with a sincere heart. <hi>Hos.</hi> 7.14. <hi>They have not cried unto me with their hearts, they howled upon their beds, they assemble themselves for Corn and Wine, &amp; they rebell against me.</hi> When Drought, and Caterpillars, and Famine was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they would pray; and if the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were removed, they would sin, and rebell as bad as ever; so that their Souls were not right in the sight of God, and therefore he did not accept of them, but compares their Prayers to <hi>Howlings,</hi> thereby to signifie how odious and abominable they were in the ears of the Holy God of Truth. Wherefore, the Lord calls upon men, that if they would find mercy, or prevent misery from coming upon themselves they
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:000322_0057_0FA4AFBAB0623718"/>
pray unto him, before the day of adversity come upon them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.16. <hi>Give glory to the Lord your God before he cause darkness before your feet stumble upon the dark Mountains.</hi> As yet (saith the Prophet you have a day of prosperity, pray before that Sun be set upon you. Give glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God by confessing your sins, and humble seeking his face and favour, before your enemies come, and drive you away before them over the dark mountains of <hi>Israel,</hi> into a long-lasting Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.

            <p n="5">5. <hi>The time wherein the Lord is threatning to bring heavy judgements upon men, is a finding, and should be a praying time.</hi> The time that is between the Sentence and the Execution.

Therefore the great design of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets was to call upon the People to seek unto the Lord for mercy before his judgements came down from Heaven upon them, <hi>Hos.</hi> 10.12. <hi>It is time to seek the Lord.</hi> This was the great voice of the Prophets, Since God is threatning to bring such and such judgements, <hi>it is high time for you to seek the Lord;</hi> that threatned evils may be diverted, and the mercy of Heaven obtained.</p>

instances in the Scripture, of many, that have prayed unto God in the time of their youth, &amp; he hath been found of them. And there is not so much as one Example to be produced in all the book of God, concerning one that did in the dayes of his youth, set himself to seek the Lord, that did not find acceptance with him.

Alas for such poor creatures, their case is lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table! And are there not many, who regard not the offers of Christ in the Gospel? How often would the Lord Jesus have saved them, but they would not be saved by him? how many Sermons have been lost upon them? thou hast heard it may be a thousand Sermons, and all in vain? this is a lamentable sign, that the Lord intends to cast thee off for ever; yea, that thou art nigh unto cursing, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.29,30. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 7 8.

The Lord gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth warning by Judgements in other lands, the report whereof we hear. When God did cut off the Narions, and make their Towns deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, he said of <hi>Jerusalem, Surely thou wilt fear me, and receive instruction,</hi> Zeph. 3.6,7.

God hath an holy hand in such Rumors; and he would have men make this use of it, to pray unto him that such judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be prevented: And the Lord hath given warning by many sudden deaths of late. how many have there been within this twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneth, that when God sent the Messenger of Heath unto them, they had not so much as an

Are there not young men that seldome pray to God? This is for a Lamentation. For it is possible that the Time of your youth will be your only finding time.

As for those that live under the Gospel, (though we may not limit God, who calls home his Elect, some at one age, and some at another, yet) commonly at is so; that if they do not find God in youth, they never find him. Think sadly of it, in the fear of God; you that are thirty, it may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years old, and yet in a natural estate to this day. And do not many neglect <hi>the present op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity</hi> of seeking the face of God in Jesus Christ? like <hi>Felix,</hi> who said to the Apostle, <hi>Go thy way for this time, when I have a convenient sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, I will call for thee,</hi> Act 24.25.

               <q>

            <p>IN this Chapter, we have an account of the great acceptance which <hi>Cornelius</hi> his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers found with God; together with the gracious effects following thereupon. In the two first verses <hi>Cornelius</hi> is described. 1. From the City where he dwelt. <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
               <hi>Cesarea</hi> 2. From his Calling, he was a Souldier; and no common Soldier, but a <hi>Centurion.</hi> 3. From the Nation which he did belong unto; he was an <hi>Italian,</hi> a Commander belonging to the <hi>Italian</hi> Band. And indeed <hi>Cornelius</hi> is a <hi>Romane</hi> Name. 4 He is described from his Religion, in this verse, he was <hi>a devout man,</hi> h. e. He was though a <hi>Romane,</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:000322_0068_0FA4AFC546DD5300"/>
and so a <hi>Gentile</hi> by nature, yet no meer Heathen in respect of his Religion, but a <hi>Proselyte.</hi> Else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where <hi>proselyte's</hi> are stiled <hi>Devout Persons,</hi> Act. 17. 4. We read of <hi>Devout Greeks,</hi> that is such as were <hi>Proselytes</hi> to the <hi>Jewish Religion.</hi> Hence also, <hi>Cornelius</hi> is described to be one that feared God, <hi>h. e.</hi> that did worship the only true God. Thus <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 26. <hi>Children of the stock of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and whosoever amongst you feareth God;</hi> meaning such as though they were not (as the <hi>Jews</hi> are) descended from <hi>Abraham,</hi> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less worshipped the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> did: These Fearers of God are in verse 43. called <hi>Religious Proselytes.</hi> There were two sorts of <hi>Proselytes</hi> amongst the <hi>Jews</hi> of old.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some that were styled <hi>Proselytes of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> those were circumcised, and also admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all priviledges in the Church of <hi>Israel;</hi> no difference being made either as to Civil or Church communion between them, and those that were natural <hi>Israelites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Those that were stiled <hi>Proselytes of the Gate.</hi> These did own the God of <hi>Israel</hi> to be the only true God; and hoped for Salvation by the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah;</hi> and did endeavour to frame their lives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the holy Rules of the Moral Law; <hi>Cornelius</hi> was a <hi>Proselyte</hi> of this, and not of the former sort. And hence <hi>Peter</hi> was unwilling to converse with him, until such time as God by a vision commanded him so to do. The truth of
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:000322_0069_0FA4AFC5B5995FE0"/>
               <hi>Cornelius</hi> his Religion is in this verse intimated by two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that he was careful, not only to pray unto God himself alone, but that his Family should do so too. He did worship <hi>God with all his House,</hi> h. e. with his whole Family. The house is frequently in the Scripture put for the Family, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 30.30. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In that he did thus <hi>alway.</hi> He did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray with his Family once or so, but <hi>alwayes?</hi> That is to say, alway in the due and stated sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for that duty: the meaning is not as though <hi>Cornelius</hi> did spend his time in nothing else but Prayer and Religious Exercises, but that he was constant in his Attendance unto that duty, in the seasons apponted for that end.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine which the Words do therefore afford unto us, is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the true Fearers of God will be constant in the practice of that duty of Family Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to the clearing of this Truth, there are three things to be enquired into.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How it doth appear that Family Prayer is a duty?</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is implied in being constant therein, or in doing thus alway?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Reasons why they that truly fear God do thus practise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:000322_0070_0FA4AFC7428A67E8"/>
Q. 1. <hi>Ho doth it appear that Family Prayer is a Duty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. <hi>The Scripture doth enjoyn this.</hi> God in his word, commands men <hi>to pray with all Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Eph.</hi> 6. 18. Not only Prayer in closets, and in solemn Assemblies, but in Families, is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under that expression of A <hi>ll Prayer.</hi> Nor can a man be said to pray with all prayer, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he doth practice publick, secret and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prayer. And in the Scripture, Husbands and Wives are required to live lovingly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>that their prayers be not hindred.</hi> 1. Pet. 3. 7. what prayers? surely Family Prayers. They that are contending and quarrelling one with another, are very unfit to go to prayer together: Therefore Husband and Wife should live in love that so they may not be indisposed to pray together in their Family. Again, the Scripture declareth, that Men should take care that their Families as well as themselves serve God. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are to bring up their Children, in the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and admonition of the Lord, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 4. which they cannot do except they pray with them, and by example as well as precept, let them see that God ought to be worshipped and prayed unto. Thus <hi>Joshua</hi> was resolved to do, <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. Joshua</hi> did exhort the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> that they should all of them <hi>in their Houses</hi> serve God, which doth imply Prayer unto
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:000322_0071_0FA4AFC7E50F07B0"/>
him; inasmuch as prayerless Families can not be said, to be God-serving, God-fearing Families.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As there are Scripture Precepts requiring this duty, so <hi>there are Scripture Examples, which God hath caused to be recorded in his Word, for our instruction and imitation.</hi> We find that the Lord Christ, who hath left himself for an example in this as well as in other things, for us to follow; did pray with his Family, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.18. <hi>As he was alone praying, his Disciples</hi> (who were his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) <hi>were with him.</hi> And when Christ did keep the Passover with his domestick Disciples alone, it is certain that he prayed with them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 18. <hi>&amp;c. David</hi> also, was wont to worship God with his Family. And was resolved to continue in that practice all his dayes. Hence he could say, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 101. 2. <hi>I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.</hi> And we read concerning him, that after he had been attending the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God in publick, <hi>he returned to bless his house,</hi> 1 Chron. 16.43. so that he did not think it enough to worship God in a publick solemn As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly amongst his People, but when he cometh home, he prayeth with his Family, that the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God might be there.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Of old there were not only Publick, but Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Family-Sacrifices. Jonathan</hi> relates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>David,</hi> that he said to him, <hi>our Family hath a Sacrifice in the City, and my Brother com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to be there,</hi> 1 Sam. 20. 29. which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:000322_0072_0FA4AFC9B712E468"/>
were not without Family Prayers. And although Sacrifices in a legal, literal sense are ceased, in these dayes of the Gospel; Christ by that one offering of himself, having put an end thereto yet spiritual Sacrifices must be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up still, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Ye are a spiritual house; an holy Priesthood, to offer up spiritual Sacrifices, acceptable unto God by Jesus Christ.</hi> When Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians offer up prayers and praises unto the Lord, these are spiritual Sacrifices, acceptable unto God through Jesus Christ. And indeed every Believer is a spiritual Priest. Jesus Christ <hi>hath made us Priests unto God and his Father,</hi> Rev. 1. 6. And inasmuch as he is a Priest in his own Family, therefore he ought to offer up spiritual Sacrifices there. Every Master of a Family is a Prophet in his own Family, because he ought to instruct them in the things of God: and a King there, inasmuch as he ought to govern his Family accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of the word of God, and a Priest also, for that he ought to offer up Spiritual Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices therein.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The very light of nature teacheth men that Family Prayer is a duty.</hi> Hence the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that had no Scripture to direct them, yet have made conscience of Family worship. They had their <hi>Penates,</hi> houshold gods, whom they did adore. Yea, <hi>Mahometans</hi> at this day, worship their God not only in publick Assemblies, but in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. So that men who call themselves Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and yet acknowledge no God in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:000322_0073_0FA4AFCB48EC6898"/>
are in that thing worse then Infidels. Many Heathen People, nay <hi>Turks</hi> will at the day of Judgement rise up against such pretended Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; and condemn them.</p>
            <p>Q. 2. <hi>What is implied in a mans Praying</hi> [alway] <hi>with his Family?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This Praying <hi>alway</hi> implieth <hi>frequency</hi> in that duty. Family Prayer should be attended daily. In that sense the Phrase is sometimes used in the Scripture. As when it is said, that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibosheth</hi> did eat (<hi>continually,</hi> or as the Hebrew word <hi>Tamid</hi> signifieth) <hi>alway</hi> at the Kings Table; the meaning is, that it was his daily cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome so to do. Thus <hi>Cornelius</hi> with his house prayed alway; Family prayer was daily obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in that house. Families need daily supplies of mercy. And there are Family occasions to be attended every day, which Masters in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are concerned to look up to God, that his blessing may be thereon: And there are daily mercies which they ought to bless God for. Yea, it is good to practise this duty more than once every day, <hi>h. e.</hi> in the morning and in the evening <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. It is a good thing to praise the Lord, and shew forth his loving kindness in the morning, and every evening, <hi>Psal.</hi> 92. 1, 2. The continual offering under the Law was that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by prayer was typified: and that was to be both at morning and at the even, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.38. <hi>Num.</hi> 28.3,4. So should it be as to Family Prayer.
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:000322_0074_0FA4AFCBB0ADB738"/>
And therefore is is very observable, that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle</hi> speaking to Masters in Families, useth that expression, <hi>continue in prayer,</hi> Col.4.2. In which words he doth evidently allude unto the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual offering under the Law, which was to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended daily, both at morning and at even; you (saith he) that are Masters of Families, forget not the continual offering of Prayer, which you ought to present before the Lord. It is as if he had said, pray constantly morning and evening in your Families. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This expression implieth perseverance.</hi> Men should not only begin to practise this duty, but they ought to hold on therein, all their dayes, Christ hath taught us, <hi>that men ought alway to pray and not to faint,</hi> Luk. 18. 1. And we are bid to <hi>pray without ceasing,</hi> 1 Thess. 5. 18. As there ought to be perseverance in attending unto the publick Worship of God, on the times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that end; as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> professeth that he had taken up a resolution <hi>to Praise God all the dayes of his life in the house of the Lord,</hi> Isai. 38. 20. So should men praise the Lord, and pray to him, all the dayes of their lives in their own houses. There ought to be <hi>perseverance in all prayer,</hi> and therefore Christians are to continue all their dayes in the practise of private or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, as well as in publick and in closet prayer: So may they be said to do as <hi>Cornelius</hi> did, even to pray alway, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:000322_0075_0FA4AFCC72AB86F0"/>
Q. 3. <hi>Whence is it that the true Fearers of God do thus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because they that truly fear God respect the honour of his Name. They cannot but desire that God might be honoured every where, and more especially in their own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. Now prayer honours God. Hence is that expression, <hi>Mat</hi> 15 8. <hi>they honour me with their lips:</hi> when men pray unto God with their lips, they honour him therewith: and when they pray with their hearts, as well as their lips, they honour him with both. As when they neglect this so great a duty, they withhold that honour from God, which is due unto him from his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Isai.</hi> 43.23. <hi>thou hast not honoured me with thy Sacrifices</hi> So doth the Lord say to Masters of Families, that pray not with their houses, thou hast not honoured me with thy prayers. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for those that call upon his Name, their prayers and praises glorifie him. When men own the Lord to be the God of their Families they put honour upon him. And so it is when Family worship is duely upheld.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. They that truely fear God, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous that the interest of Religion should be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held and promoted. One that is truely Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious himself can not but desire that others may be so too. <hi>Paul</hi> being himself a real Christian, earnestly wished that others were in that respect as he was. When <hi>Agrippa</hi> said to him; <hi>thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:000322_0076_0FA4AFCD2AF4FE78"/>
perswadest me to be a Christian,</hi> he replied, <hi>I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost and altogether such as I am, except these Bonds,</hi> Act, 26. 28, 29. so it is (and cannot but be) where there is true grace. Especially they are desirous that those who are related to them; and are of the same Family with them, may be acquainted with the good wayes of the Lord. Therefore they will make Conscience, not only to pray for them, but to pray with them; since thereby Religion and the Fear of God will be promoted. And to have Religion in Families is the way to have it elsewhere. Families are the Nurseries of all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties. If Religion should not be upheld there, it would fall to the ground every where.</p>
            <p>Use 1. <hi>For Reprehension.</hi> And there are many that fall under just and sad Reproof from this Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It condemns those that live in the total neglect of this duty of Family prayer. And what is like to come on prayerless Families at lasts Let Prayerless Fathers, and prayerless Masters hear the word of the Lord, &amp; tremble at it O that you would consider, how you expose not only your selves but Families, to the vengeance of Heaven. How often have you been put in mind of that awful Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the Heathen that know thee not.</hi> what's 
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:000322_0077_0FA4AFCEA64C5DF8"/>
that to us? some one will be ready to say; we are no Heathen, we are all Christians: but mark what follows: <hi>and upon the Families that call not upon thy Name.</hi> Not only prosessed <hi>Heathen,</hi> but Families that live like Heathen with out any pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the cury of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And O how sad will it be when God shall require the blood of the Souls of Children at the hands of their prayerless <hi>F</hi>athers; and the blood of the souls of servants at the hands of their prayerless Masters. Think with your selves what answer you will make before Jesus Christ the Son of God at the last and great day. If thy Children shall be thine accusers before the Lord then; if any of them shall stand before the Lord Jesus in the day when he shall judge the World, and say, Lord, there is the man that was my <hi>F</hi>ather, I never heard him pray in all my life, and that made me live in the neglect of God also; or if thy Servants shall any of them say, Lord, there is the man that was my Master, I lived in his house so many moneths <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

What, for men that call themselves Christians, to have no pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in their families? for men that live under the light of the Gospel, to live without Prayer in their families! for men that live in <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that have lived in <hi>Boston;</hi> not so much as to pray in their families! Such have known to do good, and yet have not done it; therefore sin and guilt and wrath most fearful doth abide them. <hi>A</hi>nd this word reacheth Masters of Vessels, that never pray with their Ships Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who are their <hi>F</hi>amily, with whom they ought to worship God continually.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This reproveth those that do not pray in their <hi>F</hi>amilies <hi>Allway.</hi> There are some that pray in their families: but when is it? once in a week perhaps. It may be on the Sabbath day, they will pray in their families; and serve God therein no more all the dayes of the week after. Is this to pray <hi>alway</hi> when there are such wide and woful gaps in prayer? It is thy duty <hi>to serve God all the dayes of thy life,</hi> Luk. 1. 75. dost thou serve God all thy dayes, when thou dost serve him, and pray to him, but one day in seven
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:000322_0079_0FA4AFCF69501C60"/>
God will not be put off so. When once thou shalt see the day where in thy family shall stand in no need of Gods blessing; neglect Prayer in thy family for that day; but till then willingly omit it not under any pretence whatsoever.</p>
            <p>And are there not some, that time was when they would worship God with their families; but they are fallen away, and have cast off the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice that is good? O foolish creatures, you did run well, but who hath driven you back? Remember the word that was spoken by the Lord Jesus, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.62. <hi>No man having put his hand to the Plough, and looking back, is fit for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</hi> Didst thou begin to pray with thy family? This was to set thy hand to the Lords plough: wo to thee if thou drawest it back again.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This reproveth those who do that in fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies which is quite contrary unto praying and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>God</hi> therein. <hi>A</hi>re there not families in this place, wherein there is Drinking to excess, <hi>Gaming,</hi> Wantonness, uncleanness? Indeed, when such deeds of darkness are brought to slight, they are put to shame amongst us; and it is a great mercy to the Land, that open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaness and wickedness is punished, but the Lord seeth what is done in private Houses.

But especially spiritual blessings, are wont to follow upon the sincere attendance unto this duty. If there be a praying Father, it is to be hoped that there will be praying Children: and if there be a praying Master, it is to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped there will be praying Servants.

            <p>I shall only answer two or three Objections in a few words, and conclude.</p>
            <p>Object. 1. Some one may say, <hi>I have not time to pray in my Family.</hi> My business and worldly occasions are such as I cannot attend Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> No man shall fare the worse as to his outward estate, because he doth make consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to set some time apart daily to serve God; no mans Family shall be the poorer, but rather the richer for that. O that you would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and consider more on that Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Seckye first the Kingdome of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.</hi> And it is certain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> better to want time for otherthings, then to take no time to pray in Yea, a man should rather deny himself a little of his natural rest and sleep, then to live an ungodly, prayerless life. Nor is it needful, or indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, that Family duties should be ordinarily long and tedious; and therefore the objection
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:000322_0082_0FA4AFD1AC3BCE88"/>
is a vain excuse. There are other in the world, that have as much business upon their hands as thou hast, who nevertheless can find time to pray in their closets and in their families too. Had not <hi>David</hi> as little time to spare, and as much business to attend as any man can ordinarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto; yet he <hi>alwayes</hi> found time to pray in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

Canst thou find time for vain discourse, and yet not find time for prayer? and canst thou then think that God will ever find a time to save thy poor soul? deceive not thy self, thou must be another man, or that time will never come.</p>
            <p>Object. 2. <hi>I am ashamed to pray in my Family?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> What a shamed to own God, and the Lord Jesus Christ I dost thou not know that that the way for a man to lose his Soul for ever? see else what the Lord Jesus hath spoken, <hi>Mark</hi> 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Object. 3. <hi>I would pray in my Family, but I cannot, I have not the gift of utterance and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. <hi>It is better for thee to make use of a form then not to pray at all.</hi> I confess, I look upon it as sinful to make use of those <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi> which are taken out of the <hi>Popes Mass-Book,</hi> because in so doing men put too much honour upon an Idol. It is also true that the imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Forms of Prayer is unwarrantable; yet all use of Forms is not prohibited in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, witness the <hi>Form of Blessing</hi> therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. Learned and Judicious Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> doth from <hi>Lu.</hi> 24. 35. conjecture, that ordinarily Christ used the same words in his Blessing at Meal times, with his Domestick Disciples. Now there is no man of ordinary understanding, but he may attain unto a Form of Prayer; and he had better make use of that, then to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any worship of God at all in his Family. But I am far from perswading you to take up with Forms. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Practise,</hi> and that will make you able. As in other things practice maketh men ready and able; so it is in respect of the gift of prayer. 
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:000322_0084_0FA4AFD5655A4568"/>
Some that when they began first to Pray, were able to make but poor work of it, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent practice have attained unto an excellent gift in Prayer. And there are some who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain they cannot Pray, whenas it is because they do not practise. If they would set upon practice, God would be with them. And O that I could prevail with those of you, that make this Objection against praying in your Families; to go home and make trial. I am perswaded that if you would but try, and set upon the practice of Family Prayer in earnest, the Lord God would be with you.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Labour for the true fear of God in your hearts.</hi> No Man that truely fears God, but he can Pray in some measure, as you heard from <hi>Psal.</hi> 32.6. <hi>Every one that is godly shall Pray.</hi> Grace will make a man sensible of his Spiritual wants, and that will set him a praying. They that see themselves perishing will cry to God for Salvation. So is it with the Godly man. Yea, where there is true grace, there will be family Prayer. The Lord saith <hi>He will pour upon the Inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace,</hi> and then <hi>Families, Families,</hi> would pray and mourn apart, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Be much in Secret Prayer:</hi> go into thy Closet, there beg for grace, yea, pray for the 
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:000322_0085_0FA4AFD72B976898"/>
spirit of Prayer. That the Lord would be Pleased to give his Holy Spirit unto you, and thereby enable you to pray. And by praying in thy Closet, thou wilt be made able to pray with thy Family. So mayest thou become like to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who seared God with all his house and prayed alway.</p>

            <p>THe Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in this verse doth intimate two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1 His own sincerity in serving God. He freely confesseth himself to be the Lords Servant <hi>God whom I serve.</hi> And there are two expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, both which may denote his sincertity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. One, is that of his serving God <hi>from his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Fathers.</hi> He served the same God, and after the same manner that his fore-fathers had done. As for his immediate fore-fathers they were <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pharisees;</hi> and time was when he had served God as they had taught him: but those words may have respect to more remote Fathers,

               <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> The holy Patriarchs, <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. Another expression denoting the Apostles sincerity, is, that of his serving God <hi>with a pure Conscience,</hi> which implieth that he was ever careful to act according to the light of his conscience; so indeed he was before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version unto Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 1. It implieth also, that his heart was purified by faith in the Lord Jesus. For only they have a pure conscience in the sight of God, who are purged from the guilt of sin, in the blood of Christ. It impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth moreover an holy conversation; a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect both to first and second Table duties: Mens Consciences are wont to be according to their actions: evil actions will pollute the Conscience: yea, the expression imports inward as well as outward serving God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Apostle in this verse, intimateth his love and affection unto <hi>Timothy.</hi> Both in that he did give thanks to God for him. So the verse begins, <hi>I thank God,</hi> namely for <hi>Timothy,</hi> partly in that <hi>Timothy</hi> had such a great respect for <hi>paul;</hi> and it is matter of thankfulness unto God, when he giveth a man a great interest in the hearts of others who fear the Lord, though in gifts his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors. He saith in the next verse, <hi>I am mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of thy tears.</hi> Probably in those words, he may have respect unto the tears which <hi>Timothy</hi> shed, at his parting with the Apostle, when he removed from <hi>Ephesus:</hi> and he did bless God
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:000322_0088_0FA4AFDA645B4428"/>
for the grace which he saw in <hi>Timothy;</hi> that there was <hi>Faith unfeigned in him, which dwelt first in his Grandmother Lois, and in his Mother E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nice</hi> verse 5. We should bless God for the grace we see in others, and especially in young men. <hi>Paul</hi> was now aged, and hastening out of the world; but he thanked God, when he saw that <hi>Timothy</hi> a young man did inherit the graces of his godly predecessors. And he must needs rejoyce the more to see how Religion and the fear of God was propagated from generation to generation, even to the third generation.</p>
            <p>Again, he testified his affection towards <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> by being abundant in prayer for him. We find that this <hi>A</hi>postle doth begin another Epistle after the same manner signifying his affection to those he wrote unto, by declaring how he did give thanks and pray on their behalf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.8,0. The Prayers here referred unto, must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be understood of his secret Prayers. For we cannot in reason suppose that he did alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Timothy</hi> in publick, but in his secret ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to the Throne of Grace; which shews that he was constant and conscionable in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of that sort of Prayer,</p>

There are three things that may here be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How it doth appear that the sincere Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, will make conscience of practising that duty of Secret Prayer?</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is implied in this expression of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day and night without ceasing?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Reasons why man, especially sincer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Christians should practice this duty?</p>
            <p>Q. 1. <hi>How doth it appear that the sincere Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God will make consciencc of Practising that duty of Secret Prayer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ans. 1. <hi>The many Instances recorded in the Scripture, concerning the faithful Servants of God, who have conscientiously practised this duty, are an evidence of the truth of this Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the great and essential duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all that truly fear God, Practise alike: as the Apostle doth here intimate, when he saith, <hi>I serve God from my fore-fathers:</hi> A true Servant of God, will follow the pious example of those that have gone before him walking in the same way of holiness, which they have done, <hi>Prov.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12.. Now concerning this duty of secret Prayer, we find many Examples (both in the Old Testament, and in the New) of the Lords Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who have thus practised; and that as to all sorts of men, Superiors, inferiors, Fathers, Children, Masters, Servants, who have had the fear of God planted in their hearts, thus did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:000322_0090_0FA4AFDB6B4DA5C8"/>
Gen.</hi> 18. 23. and <hi>Eliezer, Abrahams</hi> godly Servant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 12. And <hi>Isaac</hi> his gracious Son; It is noted of him, <hi>ver.</hi> 63. <hi>That he went one to meditate;</hi> or (as the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> word <hi>Lasuach</hi> may be read,) <hi>to pray.</hi> The word signifieth hoth to pray and to meditate, and it is no improbable but that <hi>Isaac</hi> did at that time, nothing but what was his daily custom to do, even retire himself from all company, for secret prayer and meditation. And the like we read concerning <hi>Jacob,</hi> that he did wrestle with the Lord in secret Prayer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 24. They are not the spiritual seed of <hi>Jacob</hi> that never do thus. I might mention <hi>Hezekiah, Damid, Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, Peter,</hi> and many other holy Servants of God, of whom we read in the Scripture, that they did practise this duty. Yea, we have the greatest example that ever was, set before us for our imitation in this particular, that is Christs own example; of whom it is said, that He <hi>departed into a solitary place and there prayed,</hi> Mark 1.35. <hi>That He went apart to pray,</hi> Mat. 14. 23. <hi>That he withdrew himself and prayed,</hi> Luk.5. 16. And as the Lord Jesus Christ said, respecting another duty, <hi>I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done,</hi> Joh. 13. 15. so doth he say as to this duty of Secret Prayer: I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you an example, and caused it to be entred upon everlasting Record, that so you that are my Disciples may in this follow me; and truly 
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:000322_0091_0FA4AFDC59DC0A78"/>
the sincere Disciples of Christ, will make consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>so to walk <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> walked,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 6. They will strive to write after the blessed Copy, which their Master Christ hath set before them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The truth is further evident, in that every sincere Servant of God doth make Conscience of obeying all his Commandments,</hi> Psal. 119. 6. <hi>Then shall I not be ashamed when I have respect unto all thy precepts.</hi> Now the Lord hath commanded men that they should worship him, not only in publick, and in Families, but in secret also, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Pray with all Prayer:</hi> we have formerly shewed, that secret prayer is in that precept en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, as well as publick and family Prayer. And when the Lord in his word faith to men, <hi>Commune with your hearts,</hi> Psal. 4. 4. those two great duties, wherein much of Religion doth consist, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>Thats one difference between an Hypocrite and a sincere child of God.

In secret places, he can speak his whole heart; and pour out his soul into the bosome of God, and of Jesus Christ</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> 2. <hi>What is implied in this expressions, of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day and night without ceasing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It implieth <hi>constancy</hi> in the Practice of this duty. Thus when it is said, <hi>Pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceasing.</hi> 1 Thess 5.17. <hi>i. e.</hi> don't begin to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise the duty, and afterwards leave off; but hold out all your dayes therein. It is the same with that, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>Praying with all perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> So that Phrase of <hi>night and day,</hi> intends the same thing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7 15. <hi>They serve him day and night in his Temple,</hi> h. e. continually and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermission. Thus <hi>Isai.</hi> 62.6. <hi>The watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Jerusalem shall not hold their peace day nor night,</hi> h.e. they shall hold on in their duty. Time you know is divided into day and night. If then a man shall continue to serve God, both by night and by day, then he doth serve him alwayes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It implieth <hi>Frequency.</hi> Those words <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:000322_0094_0FA4AFE12CD12500"/>
ceasing,</hi> some read <hi>without intermission:</hi> Not but that the duty of Prayer may and must be intermitted, as to actual performance, that so other duties as to our general or particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling may be attended, but the spirit of the duty should not be intermitted, Christians must be careful that they never lose that: There ought to be an habitual inclination, and readiness to attend the duty of prayer, whenever called thereunto: Also, there should be a <hi>frequency</hi> therein, as to actual performance. And when it is said, that a man should pray in secret, <hi>day and night,</hi> that implieth, that he should do so very often, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 2. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 10. Indeed, secret Prayer should be every mans daily practice. Therefore when Christ bid his Disciples pray in secret, he bids them say, <hi>Give us this day,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> 6.6, 11. from whence we may infer that secret Prayer should be a Christians daily practice. It is not determined in the Scripture, how often every man must pray in secret: Only that he ought to do thus <hi>daily.</hi> We find that <hi>Daniels</hi> constant course was to pray by himself three times every day, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 10. And <hi>David</hi> saith, that he did praise God <hi>seven times a day,</hi> h. e. often times, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 164. And there is great reason that men should offer prayers and praises before God in secret, at least once every day, and once every night; so may they be said to pray without ceasing night and day.</p>
            <p>We come now to enquire into the reasons of this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="unknown:000322_0095_0FA4AFE2A03F37F0"/>
Reas. 1. <hi>From the consideration of the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence of God.</hi> He seeth and bears what is done not only in publick Assemblies, and in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, but in closets, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 24. <hi>Can any side himself in secret places, that I shall not see him, saith the Lord do not I fill Heaven and Earth?</hi> This reason is urged as an Argument for secret Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, even because our Heavenly Father <hi>seeth in secret,</hi> Mat 6. 6. If men do not practise this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it argueth great Athelsme and that they do not really, and with their whole hearts, believe the omnipresence of God; so by the practice hereof, they testifie that they have the sene of this Truth upon their hearts; therefore should they pray in secret.</p>
            <p>Reas 2. <hi>Because there are many requests fit and necessary to be mentioned before the Lord in secret, that may not be expressed before other,</hi> e. g. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests concerning a mans particular wants, which may press him, and oppress him: and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ecret sins which he hath been guilty of before the Lord. It God by his providence hath kept a mans sins from the knowledge of the world he would sin grievously in divulging his own secret sins, and yet as ever he doth desire the pardon of them, or the salvation of his soul, he must confess and bewail them before God in in secret places: in which respect, secret prayer is necessary. Again, a child of God may be molested with the prevalency of some particular corruption or temptation, which it is no meet to 
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:000322_0096_0FA4AFE2EE9990C0"/>
speak of before others yet it concerns him to cry unto God day &amp; right for power against it. There are also requests which may respect particular persons, whose cases and circumstances may be such as others should not know of; upon which account also prayer in secret is necessary. There are some that a man may have special reason to pray for them in his secret addresses to the Throne of grace; as <hi>Paul</hi> for <hi>Timothy.</hi> There are also some that we ought to pray against them, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> special and implacable Enemies of the Lords name &amp; People, whom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Reaf. 3. <hi>Equity requireth this from the Lords Servants.</hi> He brings them into his chambers, <hi>Cant.</hi> 14. <hi>The King has brought me into his Chambers.</hi> Therefore they ought to bring him into their chambers.

them in his house, even in the Pallace Royal of Heaven, there to praise his Name for ever more. Therefore in the mean time they should praise him, and pray unto him day and night in their Chambers here. The Lord said unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Zechariah. If thou wilt keep my charge, I will give thee places to walk amongst these that stand by.</hi> Zech. 3. 7. Intimating that the faithful Servants of God, shall one day walk in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries of Heaven, amongst the Holy Angels hat are there. It is but reason then, that they should bring the Lord into their Closets here upon earth.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>To them that neglect Secret Prayer.</hi> Are there not many whose Consciences are smiting them whilest the Word of the Lord is speaking to them.

            <p n="2">2. When they imitate his graces, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Spirit, and follow his Example. Not that all Baptised persons do thus really; but they are all under the deepest and most sacred and solemn obligation so to do. They profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly put on Christ. They are under engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by their Baptisme to look after Salvation from Christ, and to obey him in all things, to follow him as the Captain of their Salvation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> which may therefore he insisted on from these Words is;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Baptisme doth bring those that are Baptised under Sacred, and most Awful Obligations to the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two things that may be enquired into for the clearing of this Doctrine:</p>
            <p n="1">1. How in doth appear that Baptised persons
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:000322_0108_0FA4AFEE2972C760"/>
are under sacred and awful Obligations to the Lord?</p>
            <p n="2">2. What those Obligations are; or, what things Baptisme doth oblige the Subjects of it unto?</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How doth is appear that Baptised persons are under Obligations to the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ans. 1. <hi>The truth of this Doctrine is evident, in that Baptisme is a sign and seal of that Covenant which God hath through Jesus Christ, graciously established with the children of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hath seemed good to the wisdome of God, to appoint some visible signs, to be for tokens and intimations of the Covenant which is between himself and his people. When he made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> he did institute that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Circumcision, to be for a sign of the Covenant? <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 11. Hence we read of <hi>the Covenant of Circumcision,</hi> Act. 7.8. because the Subjects of that Ordinance, did by their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission thereunto; declare and testifie that they became the words Covenant servants. The New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Testament hath only two Seals or Sacraments annexed to it; the first of which is Baptisme. Hence the Apostle in 1 <hi>Pot.</hi> 3, 21. speaking of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> he speaketh also of the <hi>Answer of a good Conscience,</hi> which expression alludeth unto <hi>Stipulation</hi> or <hi>Covenanting with God,</hi> implying that in Baptisme, men do come under a sacred Obligation to be the Lords. When it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:000322_0109_0FA4AFEEEE0CECD8"/>
to a man, wilt thou promise to be the servant of God, and of Jesus Christ? if he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will be so and doth make this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise in sincerity, thats the <hi>answer of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience,</hi> and then his <hi>Baptisme doth</hi> (as a sign and seal of the Covenant) <hi>save him.</hi> The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant alone binds unto duty: but when sealed, that addeth to the Obligation. The bond is made the stronger thereby.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Baptisme is an holy Priviledge.</hi> That which only some have a right unto; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> Those that are amongst the number of the Lords visible people. Baptisme doth of right belong unto all and only such. To Christs Disciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 1. To Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or such as do visibly belong unto Jesus Christ, as his sheep, or as his lambs, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. It is the mark and livery whereby Christs Servants are distinguished from those that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship other Gods. We know that amongst men, the Servants belonging <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> great personages, use to wear such a <hi>Livery, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> a Master. And the Lord Christ hath commanded that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme shall be the <hi>Livery,</hi> whereby his Servants shall be distinguished from others in the world. Now priviledges are alwayes attended with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations unto duty. Inasmuch then, as Baptism is an holy priviledge, it leaveth a drop Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the souls of those who are made the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it, that they approve themselves in all respects as becometh the Lords Servants to do.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="99" facs="unknown:000322_0110_0FA4AFEFEA9682F8"/>
3. <hi>Glorious things are signified and sealed by Baptisme.</hi> e.g. Union with Christ. As that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression in the Text, of being <hi>Baptized into Christ</hi> doth import, our <hi>incorporation into Christs mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body,</hi> is signified by <hi>Baptisme.</hi> There is an <hi>external Union</hi> with Christ, which all the Lords visible Covenant people are concerned in. Hence we read of <hi>branches in him,</hi> which do not beat fruit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Men and women who are Members of the visible, but not of the invisible Church and body of Christ, are such; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> external union and relation unto the Lord Christ is by Baptisme sealed unto all who are by divine institution the subjects of that ordinance. There is also, a real saving union with him, which is sealed to the true believer in Baptisme. As sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he hath been Baptised, so certain is it, that he is become one with Christ. Also, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Christ in respect of his death and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, is thereby signified and sealed, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle sheweth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3,4. <hi>Know ye not that so many of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, as were baptised into Jesus Christ, were baptised into his death, therefore we are buried with him, by baptisme into death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead, by the glory of the Father, even so we should walk in newness of life.</hi> When water is put upon the person Baptised, thats a sign of his communion with Christ in respect of His death and burial, and when he is brought from under the water again, thats a sign of his Communion with Christ in respect of
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:000322_0111_0FA4AFF0649A4510"/>
his Resurrection. And hence, Baptisme doth signifie un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o Believers that Communion which they have with Christ in respect of all the saving benefits procured by his death, and by his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Baptisme doth save us, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ;</hi> it is unto us a Sacrament, signifying that we are saved through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. <hi>Justification</hi> by the righteousness of Christ is held forth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. And so indeed <hi>Circumcision</hi> did declare what Justification was to be obtained through Faith in the Righteousness of Christ. For which cause the Scripture saith that it was a <hi>Seal of the Righteousness of Faith,</hi> Rom. 4. 11. The remission of sins is signified by baptisme, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. Therefore <hi>Ananias</hi> said unto <hi>Paul Arise, and be baptised, and wash away thy sins</hi> Act. 22. 16. Baptisme doth intimate, that the guilt of sin is washed away by the blood of Jesus Christ. Sanctification is likewise signified thereby. It is therefore said that the Lord did <hi>sanctifie and cleanse his Church with the washing of water,</hi> Eph. 5. 26. When the body is subjected unto water in Baptisme, those <hi>pure waters</hi> of the Spirit of Grace, wherewith the souls of Gods Elect are sprinkled and washed from the filth of sin, are thereby signified. Yea, and <hi>Glorification</hi> is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by assured unto the true Believer in Christ, that he is admitted into the number of Gods adopted Children; and therefore is become an <hi>Heir</hi> of that Kingdome which doth belong unto the
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:000322_0112_0FA4AFF50681FC30"/>
children of God. <hi>A</hi>ll these mysteries are signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and sealed unto sincere Christians <hi>positively</hi> by their Baptisme; and unto all that are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>conditionally,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in case they do repent and believe. Now if such glorious things are signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and sealed by Baptisme, the Souls of men must needs be brought under a deep, and holy Obligation unto the Lord thereby.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The dreadful Name of God, is put upon those that are Baptised.</hi> Therefore they are said to be Baptised, not only <hi>in,</hi> but (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> To onoma) <hi>into</hi> the Name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. because the Name of the only true God, who is Father Son, and Spirit; is put upon them. Which expression, doth imply, that baptised persons are adopted into Gods Family; and that therefore they are bound to walk worthy of that great and holy Name which is put upon them. Men are also baptised <hi>into</hi> the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 8 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. 5. according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> stile, to be <hi>Baptised into the Name</hi> of another, is to become wholly devoted unto his service; and to yield ones self in all things to his direction. Thus Baptised persons, are devoted and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the peculiar service of God, and of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, who is become <hi>their Lord;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are under engagement to acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves accordingly. The consecration of God being upon them, they must needs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

great Obligations unto Duty.</p>
            <p>We come therefore unto the second enquiry, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> 
               <hi>What things Baptisme doth oblige the Subjects of it unto?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ans. 1. <hi>Baptisme doth oblige unto Faith in God, and in Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The subjects of it, are bound to believe in that only true God, into whose alone Name they have been baptised. It doth oblige not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Historical Faith, or to believe that every word of God is true; but unto a Faith of adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and dependance upon God for life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and this as to every one of the persons in the Sacred Trinity, according to their distinct personal Relations. We are (as a judicious and excellent Preacher well expresseth) obliged by our Baptisme to depend upon God the father, as the Fountain of all our good, and alsufficient happiness, and to rest upon the Son of God, as our Redeemer, expecting life and salvation through his merit and mediation, and to believe in God the Holy Ghost, as our Sanctifier, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter and Guide in the way to Glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>All Baptised Persons are obliged by their Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme, to make an open Profession of the Name of God in Christ, though exposed to never such hazards and outward miseries on account thereof.</hi> It obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth us, not to be ashamed of our Religion, and holy profession; but to be willing that the whole world should see and know, that we are the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:000322_0114_0FA4AFF74EEF5570"/>
of the only true God, and of his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. It is noted concerning the Lords <hi>Sealed ones,</hi> that they had the <hi>Fathers Name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their Foreheads,</hi> Rev. 14. 1. Those are thereby intended, who make a bold and open profession of the Name, and pure Worship of God, during the reign of Antichrist; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their being exposed to dangers and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings on that account. It is not enough for men to believe that there is one God distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into three persons; or that Jesus Christ is the Son of God; but they must openly confess the Name of this God in Christ, owning themselves to be his Servants, whatever the event of such a profession, as to sufferings in the world, may be. Now by Baptisme men do thus. Hence it is said, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>He that believeth and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised shall be saved,</hi> h. e. he that doth both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and sincerely believe on Christ, and that shall by his submitting to Baptisme, declare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the World, that he is a Believer on Christ, is one unto whom the Gospel doth promise Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And indeed, in those times of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if a man did subject himself to that <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Christ, it was a great sign of his being a true Believer, inasmuch as he did thereby expose himself to all sorts of dangers and miseries from the world, for Christs sake. For then, if a man did consent to be Baptised into the Name of Christ; immediately his Estate, Liberty, Life,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:000322_0115_0FA4AFF839D12D90"/>
and all was in danger to be taken from him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Baptised persons, are bound to renounce, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own, and forsake those things which would keep them from serving God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> e. g. They are under solemn engagement to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all <hi>Idols;</hi> to serve them no longer; for thats inconsistent with being the Lords servant. The Gentiles before their Conversion, did ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice unto them which by nature are no Gods, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4 8. but when they had submitted unto Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme, they were under the strongest obligation that could be, never to serve <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ols</hi> any more nor to worship any one, besides that God who is Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Spirit. And they are bound to forsake <hi>the service of sin,</hi> and not to live under the domination thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2,3. <hi>Shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? so many of us as were baptised,</hi> &amp;c. The Apostle doth not affirm, that it is <hi>impossible</hi> for men that are in respect of their Baptisme professedly dead unto sin, to live therein; but that it is very <hi>unsuitable</hi> for them so to do; and that they are under the greatest and most sacred obligations to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And hence another Apostle speaketh, as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>He hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.</hi> Which words may well allude unto <hi>baptisme,</hi> importing that men by subjecting thereunto, profess and engage unto God, that they will forsake their sins &amp; former evil wayes, and walk no more therein, Also the baptised
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:000322_0116_0FA4AFF8A75755B8"/>
person doth renounce the <hi>World,</hi> so far as it stands in opposition to <hi>Christ.</hi> He is under in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement not to be (in spiritual respects and as to matters of Faith and Soul concernments) the servant of any man in the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7 23. And therefore he may not call himself after the name of this or that <hi>Sect master,</hi> as <hi>Papists</hi> are wont to do, who call themselves, <hi>Scotists,</hi> or <hi>Thomists,</hi> or <hi>Dominicans,</hi> or <hi>Franciscans,</hi> &amp;c. This is directly against the Scripture, and against that obligation which Baptisme brings men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by reason whereof <hi>baptised persons,</hi> are, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Name of Christ, to call themselves <hi>Christians.</hi> Had the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>Paulites,</hi> or <hi>Petrites,</hi> or <hi>Apollonists,</hi> after the Names of those famous Ministers of Christ, they had greatly sinned against their baptisme, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13. Yea, and the baptised person is bound to forsake all vain, worldly Compassions, so far as society with them, is an hindrance to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God. And to renounce the things of the world also, <hi>se.</hi> when they stand in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to, or competition with the things of Christ. If a man after he is baptised shall set his heart inordinately upon Earthly vanities, he breaketh his baptismal vow and covenant with God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.24.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Baptised ones, are under obligation to approve themselves, holy persons.</hi> They are bound to live a sanctified life. If they have been washed with
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:000322_0117_0FA4AFF9D7CD79B0"/>
holy water of Baptisme, that signifieth to them that now they must approve themselves, as those that have the consecration of God upon them ought to do, in all holy conversation and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 26. They are now bound to live, as becomes the Servants of such an <hi>Holy Lord,</hi> as God is, and as Christ is, for to do. There are two things in Sanctification; unto both which Baptisme doth in the most solemn manner oblige those that are the Subjects of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To mortifie sin. The baptized person hath vowed the death of sin, and that he will never be reconciled to that Enemy, but will maintain war with the <hi>Amalikites</hi> for ever. As Christ hath died for sin, so the person that is baptised into his Name, is under a most sacred Obligation, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be continually dying to sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another thing in Sanctification, is <hi>Vivificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or the living a new life to the honour of God. Thus the baptized person, is under the most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn engagement unto new obedience, to <hi>walk in newness of life.</hi> As Christ rose out of his Grave, and liveth for ever to the glory of the Father, so baptised persons are under engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to rise more and more out of the grave of sin, and to live such a life as that God may have glory from them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4,5. In Baptisme, there is an intimation, that the subjects of it, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly and visibly new creatures; and that
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:000322_0118_0FA4AFFB4C6310F8"/>
therefore they are bound to live like new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. Hence in the primitive times, <hi>baptised persons</hi> had the name of <hi>Regenerate ones</hi> given to them, because they were under obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to live to themselves, or to the world, but unto God and unto Jesus Christ. They are bound to live a new and another kind of life, then that which unregenerate sinners are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. Hence is that expression in the Scripture of <hi>baptizing unto Repentance,</hi> Mat. 3. 11 because the subjects of that ordinance are bound to repent, <hi>h. e.</hi> to forsake the wayes of sin, and to walk in the contrary wayes of holiness.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Baptised persons are under obligation to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all the holy Institutions of the Lord Jesus.</hi> As the subjects of circumcision, were bound to observe all Mosaical Laws and Ceremonies, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. So are baptised ones to attend unto all the Institutions of Christ. When the Lord saith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Ministers, <hi>Baptise</hi> persons, <hi>teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I command you,</hi> Mat. 28.19,20. That plainly sheweth, that such are by virtue of their baptisme, under a religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, to observe whatever the Lord hath commanded. Yea, and that expression of being <hi>baptised into his Name,</hi> doth imply no less. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatever hath the Name of Christ upon it, is to be duely respected, and so have all his insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. And if any of these be rejected or neglected, the Name and Authority of Christ, is
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:000322_0119_0FA4AFFBCAFABEC8"/>
so far disowned, which is a direct violation of that which baptisme requireth.</p>
            <p n="6">6. B <hi>aptisme doth oblige Christians unto unity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves.</hi> It is a Seal of that spiritual union which believers have, both with Christ, and also through Christ, one with another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>We are all baptised into one body.</hi> It doth declare the Subjects of it, to be servants belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the same Master: and that therefore they ought to be at unity amongst themselves. Hence the Apostle useth that Argument to perswade Christians to endeavour to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace, because there is <hi>one baptisme,</hi> Eph. 4. 5. They are all baptised into one and the same Name, dedicated and devoted to be the Servants of one and the same Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. Therefore bound to be and continue one amongst themselves; and to beware how they make a Schisme in the body, or amongst the members of Christ.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Baptisme doth oblige men unto constancy in the way of obedience.</hi> It is an everlasting bond. <hi>A mark of the Lord,</hi> which leaveth an eternal obligation unto duty upon the Souls of men. The Covenant is perpetual, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 5. <hi>Let us joyn our selves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant, which shall not be forgotten.</hi> The Covenant is everlasting, <hi>Isai.</hi> 24.5. <hi>They have broken the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant,</hi> i. e. that Covenant which ought never to have been broken by them.
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:000322_0120_0FA4AFFC84835D70"/>
Therefore Baptisme confirming the Covenant, carrieth with it the force of an everlasting obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. The person that is baptised, is bound to serve God not for a while only, but for ever. He is bound to hold fast the profession of his Faith without wavering. He is bound to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise (as well as to profess) the thing that good is, all his dayes. He is bound to continue in his observing of divine Institutions, he is under ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to be constant in his love to Saints, and to the Truths, and Worship, and Ordinances of God, even to the end of his dayes.</p>
            <p>Use. 1. <hi>Here is matter of Conviction and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening unto those that rest in external baptisme, without coming up to that which they are obliged unto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alas! there are many that do thus: yea, as for the generality of baptised persons, this is sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true concerning them. How few are there, that ever had serious thoughts with themselves, about this matter? If they and their Children may be baptised, they look no further, as if that were all that the Lord requireth of them. And hence it is, that many who are unholy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, having no right to baptisme in sight of God nor of men, neither for themselves nor for their Children, are very desirous to have that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance administred to them; it is partly for that they suppose <hi>the reproach of Egypt will then be
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:000322_0121_0FA4AFFDAF768EF8"/>
rolled away from them:</hi> it being esteemed a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable thing to be un-baptised, where the name of a Christian is in credit with the world, but chiefly, because they are not aware of that <hi>dreadful Obligation</hi> which their Souls are brought under by baptisme; and the astonishing curse of Heaven, that will at last most certainly come up on them, if they violate their <hi>baptismal Vow</hi> and <hi>Engagement</hi> unto the Lord.</p>
            <p>I desire and solemnly charge such persons as in the fear of God, to consider of two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That external baptisme alone will not save them.</hi> Will you say of your baptisme, as the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> said of the Ark? <hi>It shall save us,</hi> 1 Sam. 4. 3. O deceive not your own Souls. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle having said, <hi>baptisme now saveth us,</hi> that no one might mistake his meaning, he adds, <hi>not the putting away the filth of the flesh,</hi> not (saith he) a meet external washing of the body, but there must be <hi>the answer of a good Conscience,</hi> you must make Conscience, to answer the Obligation, which baptisme hath brought you under, or it will be no sign of Salvation to your Souls, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>3. 21. you shall be as far off from Salvation as if you had never been baptised, if you rest there 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 19. <hi>Circumcision is nothing but the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Commandments of God.</hi> So baptisme is nothing if there be not that care to keep the Commandments of God, which baptisme obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth unto. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 25. <hi>For Circumcision verily
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:000322_0122_0FA4AFFE0363B0E8"/>
profiteth if thou keep the Law, but if thou be a breaker of the Law, thy Circumcision is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision.</hi> So I say, thy baptisme will profit thee, if thou dost remember the awful obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which thy Soul is brought under thereby; but if thou shalt be unmindful of thy engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be the Lords, thy baptisme is made no baptisme, as to any spiritual and eternal benefit, to be from thence expected. Is it not said, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> that they were <hi>all baptised in the Cloud,</hi> and yet with many of them God was not well pleased, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2, 5. Outward baptisme alone, will make no man, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, nor child, acceptable unto God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Baptisme will be so far from saving, as that it will tend to the aggravation of their eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation at the last day, that do not remember how they have thereby been ingaged to be the Lords.</hi>

Consider, they are blessed that do thus. They that answer the obligation which by being made subject unto such an Ordinance of Christ, they are brought under, shall have all the grace and good which is signified thereby, most certainly performed to them. All that is contained in that comprehensive word, <hi>Salvation,</hi> shall be vouchsafed to them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 24. As sure as they have been baptised, so surely shall they be saved with an everlasting Salvation.

            <p>Q. <hi>How should Baptisme be improved? unto what ends should we make use of our Christian Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> In general unto all those ends which the Lord hath appointed it for. We are to improve our Baptisme for our help and furtherance in those things, which that Ordinance doth put us in mind of. Concerning the obligations, which Christians are brought under thereby, we have already spoken. Let me here add.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That Baptisme should be improved unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Humillation in the Lords sight.</hi> For it puts us in mind of our natural defilement by sin. That our Souls need to be washed, in the Blood,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:000322_0125_0FA4B00056343440"/>
and by the Spirit of Christ. And when we see Baptisme administred unto any; we should hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and with an holy shame reflect upon our selves, in that we have lived no more according to that <hi>baptismal Engagement</hi> to be the Lords, and his only, which we should most frequently remember and consider, that so we might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be restrained from sin, and quickened unto duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Baptisme should be improved unto thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and admiration at the grace of God in Christ Jesus.</hi> How wonderful, is that Grace, that such as we are, should be of the Lords Family? That the mark appertaining to his sheep should be set upon us; and that out Children with us, have been solemnly owned as visibly belonging to God and to Jesus Christ, having the <hi>mark of his lambs</hi> on them! That Christ should put in for our Children in the first place, and by commanding his mark to be set upon them, bring them under engagement to be the Lords, before ever the Devil hath had any opportunity to tempt them unto sin. O we should admire this Grace of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>We should improve our baptisme as an help a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Temptation.</hi> If tempted unto any wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, we should remember that we are <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into Christ,</hi> and therefore may not sin against him. I have read of a godly person, that when tempted unto that which was evil in the fight of
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:000322_0126_0FA4B001D9874B28"/>
God, would reply and repel the Temptation, by saying, <hi>Nay, Satan, I may not, I dare not do this thing, because I have been baptised into the Name of Christ.</hi> If we be at any time tempted to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of Gods mercy; we should then think of our baptisme. <hi>Luther</hi> saith, that when he was molested with temptations of that nature, he used to consider with himself <hi>Baptizatus sum &amp; credo in crucifixum,</hi> I am baptised, and I believe in him that was crucified, so would the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vanish. In drowning times, when our souls are ready to sink under discouragements, we should remember and improve our baptisme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that thereby our rising from under the waters of affliction, (as well as the Resurrection of our bodies out of the grave) is signified and sealed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 20, 21. Therefore:</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Baptisme should be improved as an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto Faith and Prayer.</hi> Believers should from the consideration thereof, take heart; and not only pray, but Believe sin to death; and that they shall be made more and more holy, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to live to God, inasmuch as Communion with Christ, in respect of his death and resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, hath been sealed and confirmed to them in baptisme. Go before the Lord in secret, and say, Lord, hath not Christ dyed that so his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants might die to sin: and is he not risen, that they might live unto God? Hath not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him in respect of the benefits procured
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:000322_0127_0FA4B002721D6C08"/>
by his death and resurrection been sealed by my baptisme? O then, let we become more and more dead unto sin, but alive unto God, through Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>And baptisme, should be improved as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement unto Parents to believe as well as Pray for their Children, that God will circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their hearts, making them partakers of the washing of Regeneration that as water hath been poured on their bodies in the Name of Christ so converting grace shall be poured down from Heaven upon their Souls. And Children who have been <hi>baptised into Christ,</hi> should from that consideration, be encouraged to pray for Grace. Children hearken to this word. O let not your <hi>baptisme</hi> ly by you, as a useless thing: <hi>Go</hi> to the Lord, and say, Lord, thou art a God in Covenant with my Father, and with my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with me also; hast not thou promised to give a new heart to the house of Israel; and to sprinkle thy Holy Spirit on them? Am not I of the house of <hi>Israel?</hi> hath not this promise been sealed to me in my <hi>Baptisme?</hi> O then give me a new heart. And if you thus seek unto him earnestly and sincerely; <hi>the Lord will be found of you.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. Bread and Wine are the outward Elements which by the sacred appointment of the Lord Jesus Christ are to be made use of, in that holy institution of his; as is expresly declared in this Context. So in the Gospel we read how Christ blessed Bread, &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 26. And the Cup, <hi>ver.</hi> 27, 28. <hi>this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

charged his Disciples to seed upon in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, thereby his <hi>Body</hi> is signified, so did the Lord himself declare at the time when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded this service to be religiously attended. <hi>This is my Body</hi> h. e. it is so Sacramentally. It is necessary that we should know and believe, that the words are figurative and not to be taken in a proper sense; as if the Bread were Christs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Body, or as if Bread were real Flesh, which is impossible. Figures are frequently used in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental phrases in the Scripture; the sign being called by the Name of the thing signified thereby. It is said of Circumcision <hi>this is my Covenant,</hi> h.e. a sign thereof, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. And the Lamb is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Lords Passeover,</hi>

As for the <hi>Wine.</hi> which the Lord Christ hath charged his Disciples to drink of in remembrance of him, his <hi>blood</hi> is signified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. And there is, it many respects an apt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance between the sign and the thing signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; more especially as to the Wine made in the Land of Canaan, which is called the <hi>blood of the Grape.</hi> Deut. 32. 14. because of its red colour, resembling blood.</p>
            <p>And the Lord Jesus Christ, hath shewed his
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:000322_0132_0FA4B009850E1140"/>

               </gap>sing such common Elements, which may easily be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, so far as the necessity of such an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance doth require. Had the Lord appointed a rare and sumptuous Feast to be frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, unto the honour of his Name; and as a memorial &amp; means of Communion with himself many of his poor Members must needs have gone without it; but it is not so now. &amp; there is an apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in these Elements, to signifie that which they are intended for. <hi>Bread,</hi> which doth strengthen and nourish the body, doth aptly set forth that spiritual nourishment which we have from Christ. And Wine which doth refresh the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men, if fitly made use of, to put in mind, of that refreshing which the Souls of Believers find in the blood of Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Those Sacramental Actions, which the Lord hath commanded his Servants to observe, in partaking at his Table, have also a spiritual significancy with them. These are implied in the Text, being comprehended under this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, <hi>Do this,</hi> h. e. as you must make use of such Elements, so of such Sacramental Actions, as are of the Lords Institution. There is not any Action relating to this Ordinance, but hath a spiritual mystery in it. The Sacramental acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are. 1. Taking. 2. Blessing. 3. Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 4. Giving. 5. Receiving. 6. Eating and Drinking.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="122" facs="unknown:000322_0133_0FA4B00B5437EB28"/>
1. <hi>Taking,</hi> as here <hi>ver.</hi> 23. Christ <hi>took</hi> bread, and he <hi>took</hi> the cup. That Sacramental action, signifieth to us, that the Son of God hath taken our nature into personal union with himself, <hi>Heb</hi> 2.14. It puts us in mind of that great mystery of godliness God manifest in the flesh. Even the incarnation of the Son of God, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Union of the Humane Nature with the Divine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Blessing,</hi> Mat. 26.26. <hi>Jesus took bread and blessed it.</hi> He also blessed the Cup. Therefore the Apostle speaketh, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The Cup of blessing which we bless.</hi> Thereby the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of the Elements, is intimated. They are to be solemnly set apart, from a common unto a sacred and Religious use. Thus hath Christ been consecrated and set a part unto the work and office of a Mediator, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.28. God hath set him apart thereunto, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4.3. And Christ hath set himself apart for that service. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he speaketh, as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 19. <hi>For their sakes I sanctifie my self.</hi> As a Sacrifice was set apart from a common use; and consecrated to the Lords use; so did Christ sanctifie himself; and became a sacrifice unto divine Justice, for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples sake.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Breaking the bread.</hi> Mark 14 22. Jesus took bread and blessed it, <hi>and brake it.</hi> Hence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaketh, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>the bread which we breake is it not the Communion of the body of

Christ.</hi> The Antichristian Church (and some others also) do greatly sin against the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ, in omitting that rise of <hi>breaking the bread,</hi> in this Ordinance. For it is so essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial unto the regular administration of it, as that the whole ordinance is sometimes in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, denominated from that action, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.42. Thereby is signified, that Christ hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> been broken for the sins of his people; the Lord therefore said. This is my body which was <hi>broken for you.</hi> He was wounded for out trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, and bruised for our iniquities, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Lord to bruise him and to put him to grief, <hi>

               </gap>0. He was bruised to death upon the Cross<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, and his very Soul was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the sense of the wrath of God, due for the sins of his people: therefore did he say, <hi>my Soul is sorrowful unto the death.</hi> The breaking of the bread in the Sacrament puts us in mind of those sufferings which the Body (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature) of Christ was subject unto.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Giving,</hi> That Sacramental action is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the Evangelists, though it be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by the <hi>Apostle</hi> in this Context. Christ <hi>gave</hi> the blessed bread, and the blessed cup to his Disciples. Thereby is signified, the Lords gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himself to and for his Church. So it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed and explained, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 19. <hi>He gave to them Saying, this is my body which is given for you,</hi> Also this <hi>giving</hi> declareth that God hath given
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:000322_0135_0FA4B00C321A1490"/>
Christ to and for his people. In and by this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, the Lord speaketh unto the Believer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner; Thou feest bread provided for thee, even so have I provided a Saviour for thy Soul. Behold! I have sent Christ to thee, saith the Lord. Take my Son for thy Saviour. I give him freely to thee. Take Christ for thy own, and let thy Soul now take everlasting hold on him. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Receiving,</hi> is another Sacramental Action. Christ said <hi>Take,</hi> this is my body. And this <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> is implied in the Text, when it is said, <hi>this do,</hi> part of the meaning is, receive the Bread and receive the Cup, as Christ hath commanded, And thereby our receiving of Christ is signified: that we are to <hi>take</hi> him, for our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; yea, and to be renewing our closure with him by Faith, that so our Souls may <hi>take</hi> yet stronger hold of him. At the moment when the hand taketh the bread, the heart should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain receive Christ. <hi>And</hi> this Ordinance doth signifie to the worthy receiver, that as surely as he doth <hi>take bread</hi> into his hand and mouth, so certainly doth he take Christ into his Soul, to become one with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Eating and Drinking are also Sacramental Actions to be attended at the Lords Table.</hi> Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>that bread,</hi> signifieth our feeding upon a crucified Christ, by Faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 54. <hi>Whose eateth my flesh hath eternal life.</hi> Those words of
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:000322_0136_0FA4B00CF02CA058"/>
Christ were spoken before the Lords Supper was Instituted, and therefore must not be restrained unto Sacramental eating. A man may feed upon Christ Sacramentally, and yet not have eternal life; but if when he feeds upon Christ Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, he doth at the same time feed upon him spiritually by Faith, <hi>he hath eternal life.</hi> And not only eating of the bread but drinking of the cup is a Sacramental action.</p>
            <p>The Papists have slain and murdered thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands for maintaining this Truth, and hearing witness against their Sacriledge in depriving the Lords People of the cup; but it is admirable to consider, that the Lord Christ, when he Instituted this Ordinance, did expresly say, Drink ye <hi>all</hi> of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 27. The Lord did not say, when he give the bread, Eat ye <hi>all</hi> of it, (though he intended that all should eat) but drink ye <hi>all;</hi> because the Spirit of Christ did foresee; that some would arise in after times denying the cup to <hi>all</hi> Partakers. Hereby is signified, that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers do by Faith drink down the blood of Christ, whereby their Souls are cleansed from the guilt of sin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 10. <hi>The cup of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing which we bless, is it not the Communion of the blood of Christ?</hi> Is not our Communion wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Christ in respect of the saving benefits purchased by his blood, signified and confirmed when we drink of that blessed cup? it is so. And that <hi>we all drink</hi> of the same holy Spirit. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:000322_0137_0FA4B00DD3098518"/>
hath respect unto that drinking at the Lords Table, which is of divine Institution when he saith, <hi>We have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13. Intimating that our Communion with Christ in respect of his holy Spirit, is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, when we all partake of the same blessed cup. Thus we see, that the Lords Supper is a Sacrament.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is a Sacrament of the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Covenant which God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> graciously made with Believers on Christ, is hereby confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. The wisdome of God hath seen meet to appoint signes and seals for the confirmation of the Covenant that is between himself, and the children of men. Under the first Covenant that of works, made with <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, there were Sacraments appointed for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it. The <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> was a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto <hi>Adam,</hi> signifying to him, he should have life, if he kept the Covenant; and <hi>the True of Knowledge of good and evil,</hi> did seal death unto him in case he should break that Covenant. <hi>A</hi>nd the Covenant of Grace, hath under all its vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manners of Administration had Seals and Sacraments annexed to it. <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of old were <hi>Sacramental signs</hi> for confirming the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Exod</hi> 24 8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 5. <hi>My saints that have made a Covenant with me by Sacrifice.</hi> So was Circumcision, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.8. And after that the

               <hi>Passeover,</hi> in the room whereof the <hi>Lords Slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> is Instituted. Therefore Christ did institute this Ordinance, at the time of the <hi>Passeover,</hi> yea and at the <hi>last Passeover,</hi> which was celebrated by him; thereby signifying that this Ordinance of the Lords Supper, was to succeed and come in the room of that of the <hi>Passeover.</hi> By this then the Covenant between God and his People is in the most solemn manner confirmed and assented unto. It is so on our part. When we come to this Ordinance we do as it were take <hi>an Oath of Fidelity</hi> unto God, and to the Lord Jesus Christ, which indeed is the meaning of the word <hi>Sacrament.</hi> It is orginally a <hi>Military</hi> word. <hi>A</hi>mong the <hi>Romans, Souldiers</hi> did take an Oath of Fidelity to their <hi>General;</hi> which <hi>Oath</hi> they called the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> With them have you ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the <hi>Sacrament?</hi> was as much as to say, have you taken the Oath of <hi>Fidelity</hi> to your <hi>General?</hi> Such as had taken that Oath, were said to be <hi>Militi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Sacrati:</hi> they were under solemn engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be loyal to their General, and to persist in his service to the death. Thus, when we come to the Lords Supper, we do thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess and promise, to endeavour in all things to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our selves the faithful servants of God, and to follow the Lord Jesus the Captain of our Salvation, and to oppose his Enemies (Sin, Satan, and the World) unto the death. The Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, doth confirm the Covenant on his part. He
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:000322_0139_0FA4B00F318C8260"/>
saith from Heaven, to the worthy Receiver, I am &amp; will be thy God for ever, and thy guide unto the death. God saith, I am thy Father, Christ saith, am thy Redeemer, the Holy Spirit saith, I am thy Sanctifier, and will be thy everlasting Comforter. Thus the Covenant is mutually confirmed.</p>
            <p>Hence 2. The Believers Right unto, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in those Blessings which only the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant makes mention of, is signified and sealed in this Ordinance. Christ with his saving benefits is a new covenant blessing. The first covenant said nothing of a Saviour: it is the covenant of Grace only, that revealeth him to the miserable children of men. <hi>A</hi>nd Indeed Christ is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the new covenant: Hence is he called the <hi>Covenant,</hi> Isaf. 4 5.6. not only in that he is the great <hi>Patentee</hi> in that <hi>Royal Character</hi> of the new covenant; the original Grant is to him; but also, because he is the sum and substance thereof. Have <hi>Christ,</hi> and have <hi>All, Col.</hi> 3. 11. But now Christ is exhibited in this Ordinance of the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;</hi> and the Believers right unto and everlasting interest in the Lord Jesus, is sealed and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to him, when he doth partake therein. The Lord saith to him, as truly As thou dost take the holy bread in thy hands and eat it, the blessed cup and drink of it, so truly is Christ with all his merits righteousness and salvation thine. Eat him and thou shalt live by him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 57. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:000322_0140_0FA4B01006C13B98"/>
mission of sins, is a new covenant blessing, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 31,34. And it is exhibited and sealed to the <hi>worthy Receiver,</hi> in and by this Ordinance, Therefore when Christ did first <hi>Institute it,</hi> some of the words which he spake were these, <hi>This is my blood of the New-Testament, which is shed for many for the Remission of sins,</hi> Mat. 26. 28. As verily as a man doth receive the bread and the cup, (if he be a worthy Communicant) so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily doth the Lord say to him from Heaven, all thy sins are forgiven, though they have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great they are all washed away in the blood of Christ. I have pardoned them all saith the Lord. When a Believer hath been at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; he hath the pardon of all his Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions confirmed to him under the Seal of Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Covenant of Grace as under its last and best way of Administration, is confirmed by this Ordinance of the Lords Supper. It doth declare, that all the good promised in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is already obtained for the Believer. Hence the <hi>Covenant,</hi> in the dayes of the Gospel is called the <hi>New-Testament,</hi> because it is now under its <hi>last</hi> and so <hi>newest</hi> way of administration. Having been ratified by the death and blood of Christ the Testator, no more alterations can be made in it. Hence is that expression <hi>of the blood of the everlasting Covenant,</hi> Heb. 13. 20. The Covenant of Grace, not only as to the substance of it (for
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:000322_0141_0FA4B0118D0D9D20"/>
so it was alwayes) but as to its way and manner of administration, is become everlasting, and unchangeable, because confirmed by the blood of Christ. So then, in <hi>doing this</hi> we commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the work of Redemption as a accomplished and finished. The Sacraments of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, signified that Redemption was to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained only by Jesus Christ; the Passeover, and all the Sacrifices declared no less, but that this <hi>Redemption was future.</hi> When as the <hi>Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> holds forth the coming of Christ to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the work of Redemption, as a thing past and done. It sheweth that Christ is come, and that he hath paid the price of our Redemption; that his blood is shed, <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 24. This is my <hi>blood of the New-Testament</hi> which <hi>[is] shed for many.</hi> Christs blood was not actually shed, at the time when those words were spoken, yet inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the design of this ordinance is to signifie that Christ hath already shed his blood, it is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the <hi>present Tense.</hi> By <hi>doing this,</hi> we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that we do believe that Christ who is now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed alive, and behold he liveth for ever more, <hi>was dead,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. <hi>As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup. ye shew the Lords death until he come.</hi> And the Lord Jesus Christ saith, to the worthy Receiver, I have died for thee, I have satisfied the Justice of God for thy sins, I have ransomed thy life and soul from everlasting destruct on.</p>

3. The Lords Supper is not only a Sacrament of the New-Testament (as hath been evinced) but <hi>the last Sacrament thereof,</hi> There are only two Sacraments of the New-Testament, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme and the Lords Supper: We read in the Gospel, that when Christ was crucified, <hi>one of the Souldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with came thereout blood and water,</hi> Joh. 19. 34. so there is the Sacrament of <hi>Water</hi> and of <hi>Blood.</hi> Thus some interpret that difficult Scripture, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>There are three that bear witness on Earth, the Spirit, Water,</hi> i. e. <hi>Baptisme, and Blood,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Lords Supper, and these three agree in one.</hi> The Lord by his spirit in his word also, by the Sacraments of the New-Testament, declareth and testifieth that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, there are those three witnesses which agree in one as concurring in their Testimony concerning Christs person and coming. Baptisme is an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Sacrament as well as the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but <hi>that</hi> is the first, and <hi>this</hi> the last Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Gospel. And thence none ought to partake thereof, but such as have been first Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. As in respect of the Sacraments of the <hi>Old-Testament,</hi> none but such as were circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed might be admitted to the Passeover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. thus we read concerning the three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand converts, they were first Baptised, and then received into fellowship, <hi>in breaking of bread,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41,42. Hence also the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is a
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:000322_0143_0FA4B012E80B6B48"/>
very solemn Ordinance, and ought to be much regarded by those that would approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves like Christians. It is the <hi>last</hi> Sacrament that ever was instituted, or that ever shall be, whilest the World endureth. It was Instituted at the <hi>last Supper</hi> that ever Christ did eat with his Disciples, just before his death; for the next day his blood was shed upon the <hi>Cross;</hi> so that the Lord Christ hath bequeathed this Ordinance, as a dying Legacy and Memorial unto his Church. Therefore it ought to be observed with great Religion.</p>
            <p>Having shewed what the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is; and spoken many things with as much succinctness as we could, concerning the nature, and proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of this holy Institution of the Lord Jesus; we proceed unto the second Enquiry, <abbr>

Except men have experienced a work of Regeneration in their souls, they are not meet subjects of this

holy Ordinance. It is therefore mentioned as a great evil, and that which is against the express and solemn charge of the Lord: when unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate persons are entertained in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ords san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, to participate in those holy enjoyments, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.7.9. <hi>Ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, when ye offer my bread and the blood. No stranger uncircumcised in heart, shall enter into my sanctuary.</hi> They whose natures were never changed by converting grace are <hi>the uncircumcised in heart;</hi> and therefore if they eat of <hi>Holy bread,</hi> or drink of <hi>Holy blood,</hi> they profane it. Christ inviteth none to eat and drink at his table, but such as are his Friends, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Eat O Friends, drink O Beloved.</hi> Now men and women whilest in a natural and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted estate, are not his Friends, but in a state of enmity against him. We read concerning the Prodigal, that he was made alive before he was brought to feed upon that which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared at his Fathers table, <hi>Luk</hi> 15. 24, 25. So should <hi>Christians</hi> have a principle of spiritual life in their souls be ore they come to the Lords Table. Men do not invite dead, but living per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to come and sup with them. And shall we think that the Lord Jesus will or can approve of dead Guests at <hi>his Supper?</hi> they ought to have Grace whereby they may be able to feed upon <hi>Christ</hi> in the Sacrament. If the question were, <hi>Whom ought the Church to admit unto such a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="unknown:000322_0145_0FA4B016A66233D0"/>
the Answer must be those that are visibly godly; and whom in charity we are bound to think, that they are able to discern the Lords bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red upon Christ for the nourishment of their Souls: men cannot see the hearts or make an infallible judgement who are fit for such Communion in the sight of God; and therefore must acts according to what is visible and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, proceeding by the Rules of <hi>Rational cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:</hi> but when the Question is, <hi>who ought to come?</hi> the Answer is, <hi>None but such as are truly Godly.</hi> And if any shall venture upon the Lords Table whilest in their sins, or in a slate of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie at the peril of their souls shall it be. It is noted in the parable concerning the Supper, that when the King came in to see the Guests, and saw a man which had not on a Wedding Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he said to him, <hi>Friend, how c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To speak a little more fully and particularly here, in order to profitable partaking at the Lords Table, it is requisite that they who come and sit down there should be qualified.</p>
            <p n="1">1. With Faith. The Rule which the Apostle giveth, is, <hi>Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 28. therefore if he be destitute of that which
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:000322_0146_0FA4B017E77E32F0"/>
is the matter of self-examination, or the thing which he is to examine about, he should not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to eat of that bread, or to drink of that c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p. Now the principal thing which a man should examine himself about, is, <hi>whether he hath Faith or us.</hi> There must be an hungring after Christ; The soul must stand affected towards Christ, as an hungry man doth towards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ood. Hungrings after Christ, are the work of Faith, in the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving soul. Without this the Ordinance will be unprofitable. It is said, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6 63. <hi>It is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing.</hi> So outward eating profiteth nothing, except there be a spiritual eating by Faith. Except when the body feeds upon the outward Elements, the soul doth at the same time feed upon Christ by Faith, participating at the Lords Supper will not be for the better, but for the worse.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is necessary that comers unto the Lords Table, should have the grace of Knowledge. They must in some measure know and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand all the great saving Truths of the Gospel, the belief whereof is necessary in order to the obtaining eternal life. There is a knowledge which is only a common grace of the holy Spirit. They that know that there is a God, and that Christ is the Son of God, and that he must be submitted unto as Lord and Saviour, have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced a common work of Gods Spirit inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them. No man can say that Jesus is the
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:000322_0147_0FA4B0195A871F58"/>
Lord, but by the Holy Ghost, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 12. 3. This knowledge is indeed <hi>necessary,</hi> in order to a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy partaking at the Lords Table, but it is not <hi>sufficient.</hi> There is moreover, a saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which is a special grace of the holy Spirit, peculiar to the Elect of God, <hi>h. e.</hi> when a man knoweth the truths of the Gospel, so as to feel the transforming sanctifying power of them in his own Soul, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. This we fitly call the <hi>grace of knowledge;</hi> and the Scripture calls i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Grace,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 18. <hi>gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> (as in the next words the Apostle addeth) <hi>in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</hi> There is then the grace of sanctified knowledge. And that is requisite, in order to a profitable partaking at the Lords Table. If a man hath not knowledge <hi>to discern the Lords bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> he will eat and drink damnation to himself, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. He must be able to put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>Sacramental Bread,</hi> and <hi>common Bread;</hi> and must be instructed in the nature and end of such an Institution. Also, he must know and be sensible of this, that in partaking of the Lords Table, men have to do with a Christ, that was dead and crucified for the sins of his people, and must have his heart affected accordingly. This is implied in <hi>discerning the Lords body.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man is able to discern Christ in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not only Doctrinally, but Spiritually, he
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:000322_0148_0FA4B019D6B06920"/>
is not duely qualified to partake thereof. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. They that come to this Ordinance should bring holy affections along with them, <hi>e. g.</hi> they ought to come with <hi>godly sorrow</hi> for sin. The Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were to <hi>eat the Passeover,</hi> with <hi>better herbs,</hi> Exod. 12.8. so they that partake of the Gospel <hi>Passeover,</hi> should have a deep sense of the bitterness of sin, seeding upon the bitter herbs of sorrow for sin, which hath caused the blood of Christ to be <hi>shed,</hi> his body to be broken, and his Soul to be poured out. Also, the grace, the sanctified affliction of <hi>Love,</hi> is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in order to a profitable partaking at the Lords Table. There must be love to Christ, love to his Ordinances, love to his Saints: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, those that are of the same particular Church, and sit down together at the same Table of the Lord, had need look well to themselves in this respect. Hence, when Christ preached his <hi>Sacrament Sermon,</hi> he insisted much on the doctrine of Christian love, by many and mighty Arguments, pressing his Disciples to love one another. When the <hi>Jews</hi> kept the <hi>Passeover,</hi> they might not save any Leaven in their Houses: a dreadful curse fell upon the man, that should knowingly suffer Leaven to be in his house at such a time. So when Christians celebrate the Lords Supper, if the Leaven of sinful prejudices one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another, be not duely purged out of their
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:000322_0149_0FA4B01AB800C6D8"/>
hearts, they expose themselves unto the holy wrath of a jealous God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Let us keep the Feast, not with old heaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</hi> If Christians be not careful about this matter, the Lord will not own and accept of them, when they come before him. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 23, 24. Nay, their partaking at this Table, will be as no partaking at all. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle therefore writing to the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> saith, that inasmuch as there were divisions amongst them when they came together, they <hi>did not eat the Lords Supper,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 18, 20. meaning that they did not eat the Lords Supper as they should do. The <hi>Sch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Yea more mens partaking hereof, will do them hurt and not good, if the grace of love be wanting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>We come now to enquire into the Reasons of this Doctrine: <hi>Why should</hi> Believers do <hi>this?</hi>

               <hi>Ans. Reas.</hi> 1. Because this Ordinance being Christs Institution; the observation of it, tends to the honour of his Name.

Men have no power to appoint Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It belongs to him to appoint the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sign who can give the inward grace that is signified thereby and that the Lord alone can do, Now being a Divine Institution, the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it doth, (as all Divine Institutions do) tend to the honour of the Name of him who hath said <hi>Do this.</hi> Hereby the Lords Name and memory is upheld amongst his People in the World; and therefore the next words are, <hi>in

            <p>The very Names, which the Scripture descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth it by, declare this. As that of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> mentioned in this Context, <hi>ver.</hi> 20., They that <hi>Sup</hi> together hold Communion one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: yea, intimacy of Communion is deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by that expression, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20.

               <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is appointed for that end.

As new born Babes grow when they have good and wholsome Milk to nourish them, so do regenerate Souls grow by frequent feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the sincere Milk of the Word of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. The same is in a most peculiar manner true, with respect unto this Ordinance of the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> No man ever did partake of it as he should do, but he had the more Grace for it; more of the Spirit of the Lord Jesus given to him, more strength in his Soul, more power to resist and overcome temptation. They that have Grace; yea, they that have most Grace, need a great deal more still, therefore should Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>do this,</hi> that so they may have yet more Grace.</p>

            <p>The Lord Christ, saith expresly <hi>do this,</hi> but there are many in the World, who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Christians, and know what Christ hath given in charge to his Disciples, concerning this thing; and yet they never did it in all their lives.

But if thou wilt disobey the Commandment of the Lord Jesus, by refusing to make use of Bread and Wine for a Religious and, notwithstanding his most solemn charge, requiring thee to <hi>do this:</hi> how canst thou expect that God will bless thee. Little do men think how they provoke the Lord by a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and continued neglect of so great and sacred an Institution.

Jesus, thou art bound to observe all things, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he hath commanded, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. And therefore by neglecting to prepare thy self for, and so to come unto this Ordinance, thou li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest in the continual breach of thy vow made to God in Baptisme; and will not the Lord find a time to make thee know thy breach of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? Remember what you have heard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that awful Obligation, which Baptisme brings the Souls of men and women under. Doth it not strike terror into thy Conscience, in that thou hast lived so many years unmindful of the Vows of God, which thy soul hath entred into? Men by sins of Omission, may provoke the Lord exceedingly. So it will appear at the last day, when the Son of God will judge and Sentence them to death, not only because they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted evil, but because they have neglected to do good. Yea, Omissions, not only of <hi>Moral Duties,</hi> such as Prayer, hearing the Word, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, &amp;c. but of <hi>Instituted Worship,</hi> are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times the reason why the Lord doth manifest his great displeasure against those who are in Covenant with him. Think on that Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Let us Sacrifice to the Lord our God:</hi> (and Sacrificing was a duty not of Moral, but of Instituted Worship) <hi>left he fall upon us with Pestilence or with the Sword.</hi> Hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

one thing that hath provoked him so to do; in that there are such multitudes or men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who content themselves to live without any commemoration of the Sacrifice of the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Testamen, according to <hi>divine Institution?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it verily, for it is a Truth, that godly men and women may by omissions of this nature, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lord, to bring great afflictions upon themselves and Families. <hi>W</hi>hen <hi>Jacob</hi> negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to build an Altar unto God, did not the Lord follow him, with distressing sorrows in his Family,

And yet wilt thou not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all that hath been spoken to thee from the Word of God about this matter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thy self to live from year to year, not only without Baptisme for thy children but without the Lords Supper for the good of thine own Soul? beware thou, lest some killing Judgement from the Lord, do ere long come upon thee or thine, for this sin. Or, (which would be sad indeed) how if God should be provoked to take away his Ordinances, not only from you, but from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also for your sake, because you have disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded and despised such mercies? Know also, that by not observing the Lords Supper, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guilty of breaking <hi>the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> by which men are required, not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>all humane Inventions,</hi> in the Worship of God;
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:000322_0157_0FA4AF0BC0DD15A8"/>
but also to observe all <hi>Divine Institutions.</hi> And the Lord, is a jealous God in visiting for the breaches of that Commandment. It is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for any to be found guilty thereof, but most of all for a place or people so circumstanced as we are. It was in a more peculiar manner, with respect unto <hi>the second Commandment,</hi> that our Fathers came into this Wilderness. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Children that have been born and brought up in the Churches in <hi>New England,</hi> shall live in the neglect of Divine Institutions, their sin is highly aggravated, and the jealousie of God will smoke against them. One thing more, let me add here; As for such as care not, whither they enjoy this Ordinance of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> or no; how unlike are they unto those blessed Martyrs of Jesus, who lived above an hundred years ago, and laid down their lives, that so they might hear witness to the truth of Christ, respecting this <hi>Institution</hi> of his? And (as one well speaks) if God should be provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to suffer Popery once more to prevail, that men must either observe this Ordinance, in such a way as the Pope Commands, and so be damned for their Idolatry: or else suffer death, for their opposing Antichrist, they will then have sad reflections in their own Consciences, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their neglect in this matter. But some one will be ready to say. <hi>I am not fit to partake of the Lords Supper, else I would come?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="unknown:000322_0158_0FA4AF0BE0E23E50"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. If thou art in thy sins, thou art not a sit Guest to sit down at the Lords Table. If thou art a profane person, thou hast nothing to do, to meddle with the Seal of Gods holy Covenant <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 16. or, if thou art in a natural uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Estate, this Ordinance belongs not to thee; you have heard, <hi>that holy things are for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly persons.</hi> If men with profane hands or hearts shall eat thereof, they endanger their Souls. There is an awful Scripture to this purpose, <hi>L V.</hi> 720. <hi>The soul that eats of the flesh of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Peace-offerings,</hi> (and so doth be do that partaketh at the Lords Table) <hi>having his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If thou art not fit to have communion with Christ at his Table here, thou are not fit for Communion with him in Heaven. If indeed thou art in a <hi>state of Unfitness</hi> for the <hi>Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> thy case is lamentable. What, to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel for so long a time, and yet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in a Christless estate? how canst thou sleep one night in thy present condition, if thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est that to be thy case? for if death should find thee out of Christ, it had been better for thee, that thou hadst never been born.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A man may be a fit subject to partake at the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and yet himself not know that he is so. True Believers, are many times full of doubts and fears concerning their spiritual e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states. A child of light, may walk in darkness
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:000322_0159_0FA4AF0C9BF568E0"/>

And in that case it concerns men both diligently to try themselves and also to put themselves upon the trial of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whether they be not duely qualified to partake of the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> It is not necessary that a man or woman should have Assurance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to this Ordinance since parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereof is a blessed means for the ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ining of Assurance. How many Believers are there, that never had Assurance until they came to the Lords Table, and then God manifested himself to them, shedding abroad his love into their hearts by the Holy Ghost, wailest they have been there?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 2. If to observe this Ordinance be an indispensible duty, we are then to be <hi>Exhorted,</hi> that we <hi>do this,</hi> even as the Lord commands both with respect unto the matter, and the manner of the duty.</p>
            <p>Consider 1. <hi>The good and benefit which will follow, if we do this, after such a manner as ought to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a signal excellency, in this Ordinance, as the time when it was Instituted by Christ, doth evince; it was <hi>in the night when he was betrayed;</hi> at the time when he had all the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to encounter with. Therefore surely there is some peculiar excellency in this Ordinance and great benefit will redound to the Souls of those
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:000322_0160_0FA4AF0D28E2A108"/>
that partake of it aright. Sometimes Believers do fersibly experience good thereby at the very time of Receiving; even inward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

In this Ordinance of the Gospel (in a more especial manner) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, <hi>beholding as in a Glasse the glory of the Lord are changed into the same Image, from glory to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. even from one degree of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous grace unto another. For the Holy Spirit to come as a <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> is more desirable then for him to come as a <hi>Comforter.</hi> but he many times cometh as both, to the souls of his Servants, when they sanctifie his Name by appreaching to his Table with due preparation of heart. Or, if the benefit of the Ordinance be not, (as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is not) perceived at the time of the Administration, yet afterwards, it will appear.</p>
            <p>Consider 2. <hi>The great evil, that is in eating and drinking unworthily at the Lords Table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is <hi>evil of sin</hi> therein. Yea, two of the most fearful sins that can be thought of, do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy partakers become guilty of in the sight of God. One is, that sin of <hi>taking the Lords
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:000322_0161_0FA4AF0EC019C990"/>
Name in vain:</hi> a sin which leaveth a deep stain, and guilt upon the Soul, therefore in the third Commandment, the Lord saith that he will not hold him guiltless that shall take his Name in vain, implying that such sinners are guilty crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures indeed before the Lord. The Lords Name is in a peculiar manner upon this Ordinance of his; and therefore they that profane it, are fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully guilty in his sight. And another sin which they stand charged with, is, that of <hi>Murder,</hi> and the most guilty Murder that ever was, or can be; I <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>Whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</hi> It is a dreadful thing for a man to have the guilt of blood lying upon his Soul, though it should be the blood of the meanest person in the world; but what then is it to be <hi>guilty of the blood of the Lord;</hi> To be guilty of Murdering and Shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the blood of the Son of God, and the Lord of glory. He that offers contempt to the Kings seal, is justly charged with Treason; so is he that doth profane that which is the sign of the body and blood of Christ, justly charged with Murder, forasmuch as by such a practice, he doth justifie those that have killed the Prince of life. And therefore great <hi>evil of punishment,</hi> will (without Repentance) most certainly follow, I <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 29. <hi>He that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himself.</hi> There is a

               </gap>, in respect of outward Judgements which befell them <hi>ver.</hi> 30. <hi>for this cause,</hi> namely because of their unworthy unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared coming to the Table of the Lord, <hi>many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably (as some conceive) God sent the Plague amongst the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> for this very sin, in that though they did partake of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> they did it not with that seriousness and preparation which the Rule requireth.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ting plagues are the fruit of this iniquity. The Lord Jesus (who holds the stars in his right hand) doth sometimes suddenly remove the lights which be hath set up in his Candlesticks so as that there shall be no steward of God to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense the Mysteries of the Kingdome, because men by coming to his Ordinances with a careless and common frame of Spirit have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him so to deal with them. Yea, this sin hath been the procuring cause of many of those overturning judgements which have befallen the Churches of God in the World. It was a weigthy and a solemn word, which the Godly, Learned <hi>Paraus</hi> spake to a Generation of loose Protestants in <hi>Heidelberg, I wonder not</hi> (saith he) <hi>at the War in</hi> Germany, <hi>when I consider the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament

profanations which you are guilty of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Consider 3. <hi>That true Believers may be guilty in this matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They may eat and drink unworthily at the Lords Table. For there is not only an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness in respect of <hi>state,</hi> which hypocrites and unregenerate persons are subject unto; but an unworthiness in respect of <hi>actual indisposition,</hi> and present unpreparedness, for such an holy and near approach before the Lord. A sincere Servant of God, that maketh Conscience to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his heart to seek the Lord; sometimes <hi>is not cleansed, according to the purification</hi> which is required of those that enter into <hi>the Sanctuary,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 30. 19. And on that account, they may be exposed unto severe outward Judgements. So did the <hi>Corinthians</hi> find it. Such of them as shall not be condemned to the second death, with the Reprobate World at the last day, were judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and chastened of the Lord, in respect of great outward Afflictions; yea, death as to their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies because they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> exercised with it ward as well as outward troubles; with miserable dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in their own Souls concerning their spiritual and eternal estates. Did they come with hearts duely prepared into the Lords Sanctuary, <hi>great Joy</hi> would follow, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.26.</p>

               <pb n="153" facs="unknown:000322_0164_0FA4AF10F5C51B30"/>
For Direction here:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Let Christians watch against those things, which of given way unto, will render this Ordinance unprofitable to their Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>e. g. Watch against worldly-engagements and entanglements. These cause the Word to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unfruitful, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 22. And Sacraments to become unprofitable. When Christians let loose their hearts upon the World, the life of Religion is lost; and they become <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ormal flight and unprofitable in their attendance upon the most solemn duties. <hi>Watch</hi> also againt scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous sins. For these will make a man utterly unfit for the present, to approach unto the holy Table of the Lord. Underth Law, if any one hapned to touch a dead body, and so to become ceremonially unclean, he might not at that time, eat the Passeover; but was to forbear until the next Moneth, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 6, 10. 11. So if a man hath fallen into a scandalous sin, whereby he is become morally unclean he ought not to <hi>eat the Lords Supper</hi> until such time as he hath renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Repentance and made his peace with God. Moreover, Christians are to <hi>watch</hi> against lesser evils. Yea, against such things as unregenerate men seldome take notice of. It may be, there have been proud thoughts stirring in thy heard; or it may be thy Spirit hath been distempered
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:000322_0165_0FA4AF11A669FC00"/>
with passion in the week past; and if thou hast not taken notice of it, to be humbled for it, the Lord may be provoked to withdraw his presence and blessing from his own Ordinances; and then thy Soul will not be bettered thereby.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Every time that a Christian cometh to the Lords Supper, he ought to practise that great duty of Self-examination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this that Scripture is plain 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11128. <hi>Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</hi> And this a man ought to do, not only once, before his first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Ordinance, but constantly as oft as he shall eat that Bread or drink that Cup. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaketh to those that had been at the Lords Supper many a time, whom nevertheless he calls upon, to practise this duty of Self-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, as they should have opportunity for Sacramental eating and drinking. A Christian, every time that he is to come to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, should examine himself concerning his own spiritual estate, whether he be in Christ or no. He should examine whether he hath true Faith, having received Christ in his person as the only desirable one, and in all his Offices, as Prophet, Priest, and King, and whether he hath true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and hath turned from all sin, unto God, with his whole heart. And whether he hath a sincere love to God, and to Jesus Christ, and to
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:000322_0166_0FA4AF1272B2E1C0"/>
his Saints, and to his holy waves. He should examine himself concerning his growth in grace. Am I more humble more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oly, more weaned from the World, more meek and self-denying, then I was, when I first believed? yea, moreover, he should examine himself concerning his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent actual fitness to sit down and partake at the Lords Table. What sinful failing he hath been guilty of, since he was last at a Sacrament, and whether his heart be now in a spiritual frame, fit for so near an approach unto the Holy God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Exercise Grace in the time of Receiving.</p>
            <p>A man that is asleep is a living man, yet he is not sit to eat and drink until he be awake, so must true Believers stir up and awake their Graces, or they are not fit to eat and drink at the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Sometimes the godly do (in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure) lose the benefit of this Ordinance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do not exercisegrace at the time of Receiving as they ought to do. Therefore he sure then to exercise Faith. As thou dost receive the Bread, and receive the Cup, let thy Soul at the same moment, put forth a renewed act of Faith in closing with, and taking hold on the Lord Jesus Christ: By an act of Faith appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Christ to thy self; and his blood with the merit and efficacy of it to <hi>thy</hi> Soul in particular, believing that <hi>thy</hi> Sins shall be pardoned, and the Plagues of <hi>thy</hi> heart mortified thereby. Also, the Grace of Repentance should be exercised at
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:000322_0167_0FA4AF1328C88958"/>
the time of Receiving. Whenever we look upon a Crucified Saviour, our hearts within us, should mourn and bleed, because our sins have pierced him. <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. And indeed, if it be not so, we <hi>discern not the Lords Body.</hi> The <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> came with a light frame of Spirit to the Lords Supper; therefore are they charged with not discerning the Lords Body. Had they been aware of a broken and a bleeding Christ before them; another manner of spirit would have been seen in them. If a Child be vain and merry when his Father lieth dead in the room before him, we say, he <hi>discerneth</hi> not, what an object is before him. So if men do not bring a broken heart, to a broken Christ; it is a sign that they discern not the Lords Body. Tears of Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Repentance, become Christians when parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Let us remember to be exceeding thankful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord appointed an hymn of praise to be sung when he did institute this Ordinance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing us that we should bless God for this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and for the glorious things which are held forth thereby. For in the Lords Supper, we have the most lively representation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the love of Christ that can be. We may therein see and feel what Christ hath done for us, and how he hath loved us. As the Apostle speaketh 1 <hi>Joh.</hi>

heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life.</hi> So is it in the Sacrament, the Lord puts eternal life into our hands there, and lets us look upon Jesus Christ, who is in that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the Gospel evidently set forth and crucified before our eyes; there we see him upon the Crosse, bleeding and dying for <hi>our</hi> sins, and to save <hi>our</hi> Souls. And the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, deals with us, as with Children, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he setteth us at his Table, and seeds us with Royal and Heavenly Dainties. Shall the Lord of Hosts, bring us into the holy Mountain of his Church, and there make a Feast for us, of fat things full of Marrow and of Wines on the lees well refined; and shall not our Souls be thankful to him, and bless his Name for ever? In this Ordinance, Believers have intimacy of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and with Jesus Christ.

            <p>The words at present to be insisted on, fall under the second Reason, whereby the Psalmist endeavours to evince his integrity.</p>

Q. 1. <hi>What is implied in sitting with vain Persons?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> We must know 1. <hi>Negatively,</hi> That the words do not intimate, as if all communion with ungodly men were unlawful. For, occasionlly to shew kindness and civil respect unto such is lawful, yea, and in some cases a duty. We are so <hi>shew all gentleness towards all men,</hi> Tit. 3. 2. Acts of charity, are to be extended towards all Corts of men. Though we are especially to do good to the household of Faith, yet not to them only, but as we have opportunity, to the others also. Which is implied in that precept <hi>Honour all men.</hi> And the Apostle Exhorts Christians to <hi>add Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Brotherly kindness,</hi> The Object of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is more general and extensive, then that of Brotherly kindness. We are so extend acts of charity not only to such as are Brethren, but to Enemies. Yea, and some Religious communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be held with those that are vain <hi>Persons.</hi> Though we are to exclude them from partaking in <hi>Instituted,</hi> yet not from joyning with us in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Moral Worship.</hi> We may suffer them, to joy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> us in hearing the Word. We may pray with those that are vain and carnal. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> prayed with all these that failed in the Vessel with him, being in number two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and three score and sixteen Souls, and yet but few of them that had any true Religion or fear of God in their hearts, <hi>Act.</hi> 27. 35. 37. so
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:000322_0174_0FA4AF1D07503CF8"/>
that all Communion with vain persons is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden nor implied in declining to <hi>fit with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To speak positively in Answer to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry before us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Sitting with Vain Persons, implieth unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Communion with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes Communion with such is necessary. A man may be providentially compelled unto it. So was <hi>Joseph</hi> when in the Land of <hi>Egypt:</hi> and <hi>David</hi> whilest amongst the <hi>Philistims;</hi> yea, and in <hi>Sauls</hi> Court, where it may be, there was not one godly man, besides himself and <hi>Jonathan. Nehemiah</hi> when he lived amongst the <hi>Persians Daniel</hi> and the three <hi>Worthies</hi> with him, when they lived in the Court of <hi>Babylon,</hi> were provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially put upon Communion with vain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as to civil Conversation, though they would not communicate with them in their false-worship, or vain Religion. Likewise, a mans particular calling may necessitate him sometimes to converse with vain persons. Therefore the Scripture doth allow more Communion and civil converse with Idolaters and prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, then with those that are under <hi>Church cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> for suandalous evils; because if Christians should be forbidden all society or commerce with worldly and wicked men, they must go out of the world. I <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 9, 10, 11. And not only the concerns of a Christians particular Calling, may
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:000322_0175_0FA4AF1DB5348F48"/>
necessitate him to be in company with vain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. But the necessity of such persons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves may call for it. They may stand in need of relief and charity as to their bodies, or of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction for their souls, in which cases, and for which ends, it is very lawful to be in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. But when no necessity, neither of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence nor of precept doth call to be with them, the case is otherwise: we ought then to decline their company. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Sitting with vain persons implieth Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When a man declineth familiar society with all ungodly men, then he may be said, <hi>not to sit with vain persons.</hi> Thus it was with <hi>David,</hi> he would not make such his Familiars, or compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Therefore in another place, he saith, <hi>I am accompanion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy Percepts,</hi> Psal. 1 19. 63. Not <hi>vain Persons,</hi> but the fearers of God, were the men that he would be familiar with. And when the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> saith, <hi>I sat not in the assembly of the mockers,</hi> chap. 15. ver. 17. his meaning is, that he had not familiarity with such as those were. If a Professor of Religion, shall make a vain person the man of his counsil, or enter into adeague of special friendship, with such an one, he doth exceedingly sin against God. It is noted in the Scripture, as <hi>Jehoshaphats</hi> great failing, that he was too intimate with <hi>Ahab,</hi> for which the
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:000322_0176_0FA4AF1E93392480"/>
Prophet <hi>Jekn,</hi> did faithfully reprove him, And the Lord did sorely afflict him for it, by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence so ordering, as that <hi>Jehoshaphats</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e was endangered, because he had <hi>sat</hi> with so vain and vile a person as <hi>Akab.</hi> more then he should have done; &amp; besides that, the Lord to shew his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, let loose many Enemies upon him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he and the whole Kingdome was brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to distress. And when he became guilty of the same error again by <hi>joyning himself with Ahaziah the King of Israel, who did very wickedly. Eliezer</hi> prophesied against him, that blasting strokes of God would follow him, for that very sin; and so it came to pass, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 36, 37. To be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally civil and courteous unto a wicked man may be both lawful and laudible, but to be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with him, or to make a companion of him, is alwayes sinful, and good is never wont to come of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Sitting with vain persons implieth delight in their Company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The sincerest man in the world, may be forced into the company of vile and vitious persons, but he taketh little delight in being amongst them. He is out of his Element when in such Company, as not being amongst those with whom his delight is. They will discover such a Spirit, speak such words, do such actions as are very displeasing to a gracious Soul; therefore if he could help it, he would not be much amongst
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:000322_0177_0FA4AF1FA76C21F0"/>
them. <hi>Lot was vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked, for that Righteous man dwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soul from day to day, with their unlawful deeds</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 7, 8. We ought not to love such with a <hi>Love</hi> of complacency or <hi>Delight.</hi> Therefore when <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> did <hi>seem</hi> to delight in wicked <hi>Ahabs</hi> company, is was said to him, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>shouldst thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. 19. 2. Indeed a <hi>love of pity,</hi> is to be manifested towards such persons. When here was a civil moral man, but one still in his natural unconverted estate, that came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Christ, and kneeled down before him, with that Question, <hi>What shall I do that I may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit eternal life,</hi> withal professing, that he had from his youth been very careful to observe the Commandments of God; it is said, that Jesus <hi>beholding him loved him,</hi> M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r. 10 21. <hi>h. e.</hi> he pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied him, Bowels of love in the compassionate heart of Jesus, were moved towards him, to see a man that should perform such duties, and take such pains to obtain eternal life, and yet lose his Soul for ever, because he was not built upon a right Foundation. But although, a love of pity is to be exercised towards such yet not a love of delight in communion with them. They were other kind of persons, whom <hi>David</hi> took <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> to be among, <hi>Psal.</hi> 126. 3. <hi>The Saints that are in the Earth in whom is all my delight.</hi> His
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:000322_0178_0FA4AF2001055E28"/>
delight was in the communion of Saints, and not in followship with sinners. And thats a good sign of sincerity, when there is an unfeigned love to the Brethren, as on the other hand, it is a bad sign, when a man loveth to fit and discourse with vain persons, and never thinks the time long enough whilest he is in their company.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>When a man doth joyn counsil with vain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, so as to approve of their wayes, and partake with them in their evil deeds, then he may be said to set with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To fit with them, is to do as they do, to hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ken to their advice, and to follow their example. Thus the expression is elsewhere used in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 1 <hi>Blessed is the man that walks not in the counsil of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor fitteth in the sent of the scornful,</hi> the meaning is, that the man is blessed who doth not hearken to them, nor follow their example. And <hi>David</hi> declareth his resolution not to joyn in counsil with sinners, or to do as they would have him, when he saith, <hi>I will not fit with the wicked,</hi> Psal. 26. 5. And hence this <hi>fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> with vain persons, is in the next words, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by that of <hi>going in</hi> with dissemblers. Now to <hi>enter in</hi> with another, is to tread in his steps, and to follow his example.

There are some that are full of unprofitable words. All their discourses are frothy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savoury. You shall never hear a gracious word proceed out of their mouthes or any discourse that shall tend unto spiritual edification. This argueth a vain person. Much more is it true, that those evil communications which corrupt good manners, and which a moral and modest Heathen would be ashamed of, profane and filthy speeches, argue a vain and a vile person.

               <hi>What fruit haa you in those things whereof you are now ashamed?</hi> Sin is good for nothing neither for body, nor soul, nor name, nor estate, but baneful unto those that shall practise it, in all these respects. Vain persons may flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their iniquity, foolishly imagining, that they shall enjoy pleasures, or worldly gain by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king sinful and indirect courses to obtain their desires; but in the conclusion, they will meet with a miserable frustration; seeing they have embraced a shadow instead of substance. He that gains by practising iniquity, when he shall compare his losses with his gains, will certainly find he hath lost, that which is ten thousand times better then all that he hath gained. It may be he hath gained a little of the World, but he hath lost his precious Soul, which is more worth then all this World. It may be he hath gained the love and good will of a vain Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but he hath lost the favour of God, in whose favour there is life, and whose loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness is better then the life it self.

            <p>To enquire into the Reasons of this <hi>Doctrine, whence is it that a sincere godly man, will not sit with vain persons?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ans. Reas. 1. <hi>Because godly men have their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures changed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have another <hi>nature</hi> in them, then what once they had, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Te are made partakers of the divine nature.</hi> Every man until his Soul is renewed by the power and grace of the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Spirit of God, hath only a corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in him, but the godly man is become the subject of a divine and holy nature. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is said to have a <hi>new heart</hi> given to him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. And to have <hi>a new spirit put within him,</hi> ibid. And to be made <hi>a new Creature,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. To be <hi>new born</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. True <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,</hi> implieth not only a marvellous change, as to a mans outward actions, causing him to walk in new wayes, which once he was a stranger unto, but as to his nature, and inward dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and inclinations. Therefore the work of <hi>Conversion</hi> is oft in the Scripture set forth by such things as intimate a change of nature, <hi>e. g.</hi> by that of making <hi>a wilderness to become a fruitful field,</hi> Isai, 32. 15: The nature of the soyle is changed, when of barren it doth become fruitful; so is it with the truly converted man. And for the same reason it is said, that <hi>instead of the thorn shall come up the fin-tree, and instead of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Yea, then the Lion shall eat straw li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e the Ox. (as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaketh) and the Wolf is become like a Lamb, <hi>Isai.</hi> 11. 6, 7. Now the nature being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, there must needs follow a change as to the company which such persons will delight to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociate themselves with. Every creature chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to be with those that are of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and kind. Doves will be with Doves, and not amongst Ravens; sheep will be with sheep, and not amongst swine. So will sincere godly men (who are in the Scripture in respect of the innocency of their nature compared to Doves, and to sheep) chuse to be with such as are god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not with the wicked, who are resembled unto Ravens and Swine. Inasmuch as a sincere Convert, hath his nature changed, the inward desires and delights of his heart are not as once they were. He delights both in those <hi>things,</hi> and in those <hi>persons</hi> which once he had no delight in. As for an unregenerate man, his heart doth not cordially close with one that hath much of the Image of God upon him. <hi>The righteous is an abomination to the wicked.</hi> But when grace hath changed his nature, then the more godly any are, the more doth he love and delight in them. And having experienced a change of nature, his
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:000322_0186_0FA4AF26E950ACE8"/>
heart is taken off from those evils which are most natural unto men; and this sin of affecting vain company is so.</p>
            <p>Real. 2. <hi>Sincere Godly men have had experience of, and found blessed sweetness in another, and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kind of fellowship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thence, they cannot relish communion with vain persons. One that hath tasted the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that is in holy fellowship, cannot but distast and dislike sinful fellowship. And this is true concerning the sincere professor of Religion. He hath had experience of the communion of Saints, and hath found that to be edifying to his Soul Yea, he knoweth what it is, to have Communion with God and with Jesus Christ, through the Spirit, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Truly our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.</hi> And therefore he cannot but disrelish <hi>the worlds fellowship.</hi> The Servant of God pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth communion with him. His heart finds won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful contentment therein; he saith, <hi>It is good for me to be here.</hi> And when he has experienced soul ravishing communion with God and with Jesus Christ, he cannot but say to the workers of Iniquity (as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Psal.</hi> 6. 8. ) <hi>Depart from me,</hi> I desire your fellowship no more. He hath found such sweetness in holy communion with the blessed God, as that he cannot approve of any thing that would break or hinder communion with him. But fellowship with <hi>vain persons</hi> will
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:000322_0187_0FA4AF27B9C058F8"/>
do so. <hi>A</hi> godly man shall find by experience; that if his heart be brought into never so holy and spiritual a frame a little occasional commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with <hi>vain persons.</hi> will put it out of frame again. Therefore he is not willing to <hi>sit</hi> with such as those are.</p>

It was foretold by the Prophets in the Old Testament; that in the times of the Gospel there should be a change as to the Day to be observed for solemn Worship.

observe the first Day of the week, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1. <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> and other ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, shew that in the Primitive Times, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans kept the first day of the Week as their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; and so hath it been in the Christian Church in all ages thereof. The work of Redemption is greater then that of Creation. Upon which account, if the <hi>seventh day</hi> was set apart to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate the work of Creation, it is not to be wondred at, if the Lord Christ hath appointed <hi>the first day of the Week</hi> to be kept holy unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in commemoration of the work of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Evangelist declareth for that end it was the Disciples at <hi>Iro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s,</hi> met together on the day mentioned. It was not for Civil but for Religious Ends and Purposes, nor indeed may Christians (excepting when present and indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table necessity, shall call for a dispensation) meet together on that day of the week, to attend any other work, but such as are of an holy nature. One thing then which these Disciples came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for, was, <hi>to break, Bread,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to eat the Lords Supper. The breaking of the Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bread, is a Sacramental Action, whereby the sufferings of Christ are signified; and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> put for that whole Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which is appointed to shew forth the Lords Death until he come. Moreover, these Disciples at <hi>Troas,</hi> met upon the Lords Day,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:000322_0204_0FA4AF39A406FDF0"/>
that so they might hear the Word Preached, us well as partake at the Table of the Lord. And because the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> was the next day to depart from them, and it may be never more to speak unto them, in the Name of the Lord; he continued long in his Sermon, even until mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is noted the particular place where these Christians met, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>There were many lights in the upper Chamber, where they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>red together.</hi> Christians had not in those dayes, the liberty of publick Meeting houses, because the higher Powers then were enemies to the Truth. Therefore the Disciples were glad to meet in private Houses, there to solemnize the Worship of God, according to his own holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. And because of their Persecutors, they did assemble themselves together in the night time, when others were asleep, and would be less apt to observe them. And there were many lights in the room, that so if their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries should happen to come upon them, they might have no occasion from the time of their being assembled together, to reproach them, as if they met to practise the deeds of darkness. Notwithstanding this circumspection, we find in the <hi>Apologies</hi> of some of the Amtients, that the Enemies of the Church, did take occasion to traduce &amp; slander them, as if they did <hi>convene</hi> for wicked ends and purposes: but when they did
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:000322_0205_0FA4AF3ADAC89528"/>
manage matters, with such Christian Prudence as these Disciples did, there was no occasion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; only maliciously taken.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Here is recorded a <hi>Remarkable providence</hi> which hapned on the day, and in the place men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, wherein a certain young man, named <hi>Entychus,</hi> was concerned. To declare which, is the scope of this verse, wherein we have expressed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The evil which <hi>Entychus,</hi> was guilty of, in brief, <hi>he slept at a Sermon.</hi> Yea, and he did not only flamber but gave way unto Temptation, so far, as to fall into a <hi>deep sleep.</hi>
            </p>

He was suddenly surprized with sleep; and he was in danger of being surprized with a sudden sleep of death, for it. And this is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Scripture, that so others; yea all Christians in after Generations, who should hear of it, might beware of doing as <hi>Eutychus</hi> did, that they might take heed of sleeping, when they should be hearkening to that word, which
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:000322_0206_0FA4AF3AEC367370"/>
is spoken of them, in the Name of the Lord.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which may therefore at present be insisted on, is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Sleeping at Sermons is a Great and Dangerous Evil.</hi>

            <p>Q. <hi>How doth it appear, that sleeping at Sermoni is a great Evil?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ans. 1. <hi>In that there is sin therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sin is the greatest of Evils. Nor ought any sin to be accounted a little evil. But when men sleep at Sermons, they sin against God: for such a practice is contrary unto Scripture Precept. If men will do as the Scripture requireth, when the word of God is spoken, they must <hi>attend and incline their Ears unto what is said,</hi> Prov. 4. 20. Yea, they ought to <hi>give earnest heed</hi> thereunto, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1. They then, who instead of heeding and hearkening unto what is spoken, shall sleep away the Sermon; transgress against the Rules of Scripture. And we read of those in Scripture who have hearkened to the Word of God with great attention, whose commendable example is Recorded for our Imitation. When <hi>

               </gap> sleeping at Sermons, which was the thing that the Lord intended, when he permitted Satan so far to prevail as he did; But the Devil had another end; he knoweth that when the Word of God is faithfully dispensed, in case men attend unto what is spoken, good is like to come unto their Souls thereby; and thats the thing that the Devil is afraid of; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he useth all means he can possibly, to cause the good seed of the Word which is sown, to become unfruitful. And one unhappy way, whereby he doth accomplish it, is by causing them to <hi>sleep at Sermons.</hi> Hence in the Parable concerning the Sower, it is said, of the Seed
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:000322_0209_0FA4AF41726EB888"/>

               </gap> of the Air? you have it expounded in <hi>ver.</hi> 15. where it is said, <hi>Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the Word that was sown.</hi> How doth Satan rob men of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, which they might receive by the Word of God? he hath divers cunning and cursed <hi>Artifices,</hi> whereby he can accomplish his design. One (and he hath none greater or more effectual) is to prejudice the minds of men against the Truth, or against the Dispensers of it. God complains of the false Prophets (who were the Devils Factors) that they did <hi>steal the Lords words every one from his Neighbour,</hi> Jer. 23. 30. because they laboured to prejudice their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours against the true and faithful Prophets of God, and so robbed their Souls of that precious treasure and benefit which the word would have afforded to them. It is never so, but Satan hath a deep hand therein. And another Artifice which he useth, to deprive men of that good, which they might receive by hearing the Word is, that he causeth them to <hi>sleep at Sermons.</hi> And from thence it cometh to pass, that men are most sleepy at <hi>Sermon time.</hi> Before the Sermon began, they were not drowsie, and after the Sermon is ended, they are not so; but just at that season, when they are called to attend unto the word of God, they are apt to drowse and sleep. This is
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:000322_0210_0FA4AF41BAC18CB8"/>
as Satan would have it. He had rather have men wakeful at any time, than at <hi>Sermon time.</hi> And as for the <hi>internal cause,</hi> of mens sleeping at Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; it is from that <hi>Infirmity</hi> which they are subject unto, and miserably attended with. In some, it proceeds much from <hi>Natural</hi> Infirmity. Some are naturally of more wakeful, and others of more sleepy tempers and dispositions. And old age doth naturally incline men unto infirmity in this as well as in many other respects. But especially, this evil proceeds from that sinful and <hi>moral</hi> Infirmity, which men are wofully subject unto. Hence it was, that the Disciples slept when they should have been fervently praying to God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.40,41. <hi>Jesus cometh to the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and findeth them asleep, and saith to Peter, what, could you not watch with me one hour. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</hi> There was in the Disciples of Christ, <hi>spirit</hi> as well as <hi>flesh;</hi> so far as they were made spiritual, they were willing to have watched with Christ; and had newly manifested their willingness, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing their readiness to die for his sake; but because of a carnal unregenerate part, which as that time prevailed, they, slept when Christ bid them watch. It was because of their <hi>Flesh,</hi> their infirmity both natural and moral, that they slept when they should have been watching and praying, and the same is true, if men sleep when they should be watching and hearing. Had not
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:000322_0211_0FA4AF427AC00618"/>
men sin and corruption in their hearts, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that they would not sleep at Sermons.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There are evil effects which follow upon mens sleeping when they should be hearkening to the Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We shall shew this in some Particulars, all which tend to evince the truth of the <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. One evil effect which follows upon sleeping at Sermons is, <hi>That Mens hearing the Word, is thereby <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> unacceptable to the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great thing which should be aimed at in every duty, is that we may find acceptance with God, in what we do. And therefore to look well to the <hi>manner</hi> of performance. For that is necessary in order to the obtaining of divine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 18. <hi>Take heed how you hear.</hi> It is not enough for men to pray, or to come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hear the word preached, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but every one had need consider, after what manner do I pray, after what manner do I hear? If they take not heed how they hear, so as to approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to God in respect of the manner as well as the matter of duty, they will not find acceptance with him, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>If you offer the blind for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is it not evil: offer it now to thy Governour, will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person?</hi> Thus when a man doth offer a sleeping prayer before the Lord, or a sleeping attendance upon duty in respect of hearing the Word, <hi>Is it not evil?</hi> doth he not offer the blind? will the Lord
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:000322_0212_0FA4AF4369093FC0"/>
accept of it, or be pleased with such services wherein there is no life of devotion? His hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be so far from pleasing God, as that it will become a provocation, if he doth willingly set himself to sleep at Sermon time. If an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prince, should send his <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> to treat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> any about matters of high concernment, and they should manifest no more regard unto what is said, then to fall asleep, whilest the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage is in delivering; would it not provoke? The Ministers of God are in Scripture stiled his <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 20. <hi>We are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God aid beseech you by us, we pray you in Christs stead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Ambassadors for Christ, are sent to treat with men about matters of the greatest concernment that possibly can be; yea, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose unto them in the Name of that God whose they are, and whom they serve, terms of Peace, and Reconciliation; and they do it in <hi>Sermons,</hi> in that way, they treat with men about the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting concernments of their precious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls. Now to sleep at the very time when these Messages are delivered, is so far pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically to contemn the Word, and must needs be displeasing unto him whose word it is, and in whose name delivered.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another evil which doth follow upon sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Sermons, is, <hi>That it doth cause the Word Preached to become unprofitable, nay, hurtful to the souls of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="unknown:000322_0213_0FA4AF44E0EE7B20"/>
It is a sad thing, when Men shall receive the <hi>Grace,</hi> (i. e. the Word of God,) <hi>in vain,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 1. yet so do they do, who indulge themselves in sleeping at Sermons. If it be so, as the Apostle speaketh in another case, <hi>then is our preaching vain,</hi> Suppose the Truths delivered be never so preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if people are asleep, it is to them, as if no Word were spoken, excepting that they must give a dreadful account for that which they might have heard for their Souls good; but would not when called of God thereunto. A Minister of Christ had as good speak to the Seats, and Pillars, and Walls of the House, as to men that are (like him whom my Text speaketh of) <hi>in a profound sleep.</hi> Nay, there is danger that the Word will then (through their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault) become hurtful to their Souls. It was said to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Epistle Chap. 11. ver.17 <hi>You come together not for the better, but for the worse</hi> If Christians come together, to eat the Lords Supper, but mind not after what manner, their coming together is for the worse. And if they come together under pretence of hearing the Word preached, but set themselves to sleep, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of reverend attention unto what is spoken, they come together for the worse. It were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not to come, then to come only to sleep, As the Apostle there speaketh, <hi>ver.</hi> 22, <hi>Have ye not Houses to eat and drink in, or despise ye the Church of God,</hi> So I say, have you not Houses to sleep
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:000322_0214_0FA4AF459FEECA18"/>
in, that you must come and openly despise an Ordinance of God?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another evil effect of sleeping at Sermons, is, that <hi>it maketh men leave a guilty Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sin doth so, especially known sin, and in a most peculiar manner breaches of the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, the Lord having said, that <hi>he will not hold those guiltless that take his Name in vain;</hi> but all this is true of those that sleep at Sermons. Hence except their hearts are strangely obdura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the wayes of sin, they feel checks of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science for this evil. Men have that in their own breasts which tells them that they should not do so, when they give way to temptation, and fall a sleep under that solemn dispensation of the Word of God, spoken to them in his Name. And when the Lord awakens Conscience, there are great troubles of spirit for this sin. It hath been so with some of the Elect of God at their first Conversion. God hath made it a sad and a terrible thought unto them, to consider, how many Sermons they have lost, and sinned, and slept away; how they have turned a deaf car upon the Messages which the Lord hath seat from Heaven to them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Men are hereby exposed unto Judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Guilt binds the sinner over unto the righteous judgement of God. Temporal Judgements are many times inflicted for this sin, and that not only on the profane ungodly world, but on the
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:000322_0215_0FA4AF4639F5E7E8"/>
Lords own servants. As this instance in my Text doth make to appear. Indeed we read of but one godly man in the Scripture, (<abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychus</hi> the man whom my Text mentions) that did sleep at a Sermon, and what a memorable and awful death had he like to have suffered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of this his sin? and yet a great deal more might be said to excuse him, then most of those that use to <hi>sleep at Sermons,</hi> can plead for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. For <hi>Pauls</hi> Sermon, at that time was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long; and it was not in the day but in the night; yea, at midnight, when men are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more inclined to sleep; yet when <hi>Eutychus</hi> thus circumstanced, gave way to temptation, so as to fall asleep, when he should have been hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening to the word of God, he must be smitten with a sudden and a deadly blow; that as <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> said, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.43. <hi>I did but taste a little Honey, and lo, I must die.</hi> So this man, did but take a little sleep, a short nap whilest the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was Preaching, and lo! he must die for it. And as for those that have been notorious <hi>sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at Sermons,</hi> indulging themselves in that ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, God oftentimes cuts them off, by sudden and awful strokes of his hand. Yea, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual judgements are the bitter fruit of this sin. For this cause, the Lord in righteous Judgement doth blast his word to the Souls of men, that they are never converted nor saved thereby, but they become like unto <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Marishes and
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:000322_0216_0FA4AF473959EA50"/>
Miry places, they <hi>are given unto salt and shall not be healed,</hi> Ezek. 47.11. They are smitten with that curse of spiritual and perpetual barrenness of soul. When men are so profane as to set themselves to sleep at Sermons, the Holy God is so provoked at them for the contempt of his Word, as to resolve and swear against them, that they shall never be converted, or receive any saving benefit thereby. <hi>A</hi>nd when this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh a general prevailing iniquity amongst a professing people, the Lord is sometimes provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to take away his Word from them. He calls home his <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> and brings a Famine of his word. When mercies slighted, God knoweth how to raise the price of them, and to make men know the worth of them, by the want thereof. When the <hi>Jews</hi> were grown weary of Sabbaths and of Sermons, which were <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched</hi> to them, both on the weekly Sabbath, and at their New Moons, that which followed, was, the Lord <hi>sent upon them a Famine, not a famine of bread,</hi> (but more dreadful even a spiritual fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine) <hi>of hearing the Word of the Lord,</hi> Amos 8.5.11. The Lord may well say, if you have no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto my word, then to sit &amp; sleep under it; you shall hear Sermons few enough, until you have learned to hear with better attention; and know that inasmuch as you have slept Sermons away, you have also sinned them away.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Sleeping at Sermons is an evil sign,</hi>

               </gap> those things, which they ought to remember, whenever they come to hear the Word of God dispensed in his Name. Its a sign that they do not consider of the dreadful place and presence which they are in. We may say of a solemn Church-Assemby as <hi>Jacob</hi> speaketh concerning that place where the Lord appeared to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 17. <hi>He was afraid, and said, how dreadful is this place, this is none other but the House of God.</hi> There is a special presence of God in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Assemblies, which maketh such places to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and therefore dreadful. Its true, that in these dayes, one house is as holy as another. But it is also true, that in whatever house God is worshipped, during the time of worship, there is a special presence of the Lord there, and therefore during the time of worship, the place in holy. Hence reverence in Behaviour is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of men whilest in such places. It was said to <hi>Moses, Put off thy shoes from off thy feet,</hi> h. e. shew reverence as to thy outward behaviour, (for putting off the shoe was, and is at this day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Eastern Nations, like putting off the hat with us) <hi>for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground;</hi> namely, because of a special pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God which was in that place at that
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:000322_0218_0FA4AF489980DEA0"/>

So there is in Church Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: if men are so irreverend there as to fall asleep, and it may be to put themselves into sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing postures, it is a sign that they consider not this. The presence of Holy Angels is awful. Yet such a presence, there, in Church Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. Hence the <hi>House of God</hi> is said to be <hi>the Gate of Heaven,</hi> Gen 28. 17. In old time, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces kept their Courts in the Gates of the City, and there they had their Ministers and Servants to attend them. Thus the Lord doth as it were sit upon his Throne, in Church Assemblies, and there are Holy <hi>A</hi>ngels attending him in those <hi>Gates of Heaven.</hi> The <hi>A</hi>postle therefore Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts men and women to behave themselves with all due reverence and circumspection, in the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn worship of God, <hi>because of the Angels,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 10. <hi>A</hi>ngels come down from <hi>H</hi>eaven, into our solemn <hi>A</hi>ssemblies, and observe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how Ministers Preach, but how People hear; who attends, and who doth not attend, who sleeps and who keeps awake. When People sleep at Sermons, it is a sign that they consider not of this as they ought to do. Yea, it is a sign that they consider not with whom they have to do in Sermons. It is said, that <hi>the Word of God it quick and powerful, and that all things are naked unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do, H</hi>eb. 4.12,13. so that in hearing the Word, men <hi>have to do</hi> with the <hi>A</hi>ll seeing God. If they sleep
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:000322_0219_0FA4AF4929B5CF88"/>
under it, thats a sign they remember not this. Did any of you hear an Farthly Monarch speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you, the consideration of the greatness and authority of the Speaker would keep you awake. <hi>A</hi>nd would men sleep, if they knew that the Majesty of <hi>H</hi>eaven is speaking to them?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>When Men sleep at Sermons, it is a sign that they have not that love to, and delight in the Word of God, which they ought to have.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is noted of the Primitive Christians that they received his word <hi>gladly, Act.</hi> 2.41. There is not so much of that spirit as should be in those that sleep when they should hear. This argueth that men do not (with <hi>David</hi>) prize the word above all riches, and that it is not the delight and the rejoycing of their hearts. They can keep awake easily enough, when they hear that which they love and delight to hear. <hi>A</hi> vain and wicked creature, if he hears frothy and foolish Discourse, is not sleepy nor weary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his carnal, unsanctified heart delights therein. Let the same person hear Sermons, or any serious and profitable matter discoursed of, and hees quickly asleep. This is a sure and a sad sign, that he taketh but little delight therein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="unknown:000322_0220_0FA4AF49F0B661F8"/>
We come now to Apply this Truth:</p>
            <p>And the first <hi>Use</hi> may be by way of Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Information.</p>
            <p>Instr. 1. <hi>We may here take notice that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man is wofully corrupted and deprived,</hi> else they would not be so apt to sleep when the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Truths of God are dispensed in his Name, Yea, and men are more apt to sleep then, than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> another time. Some woful Creatures, have been so wicked as to profess they have gone to hear Sermons on purpose, that so they might sleep, finding themselves at such times much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that way. This argueth as Satans malice, so the great corruption and depravation of the nature of men, whence it is that they are incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto evil, and indisposed to the thing that good is. Yea, some will sit and sleep under the best Preaching in the World. When <hi>Paul</hi> was alive, there was not a better Preacher upon the Earth then he. <hi>Austin</hi> had three wishes: one was, that (if the Lord has seen meet) he might see Christ in the flesh: his second wish was, that he might have seen <hi>Paul in the Pulpit;</hi> but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding <hi>Pauls</hi> being so excellent a Preacher, there were some that could sit and sleep under his Ministry. When Soul-melting Sermons are Preached about Christ the Saviour, about the pardon of sin, about the glory of Heaven, there we some that will sleep under them, When
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:000322_0221_0FA4AF4AAD11E338"/>
soul awakening Sermons are Preached, enough to make rocks to rend and to bleed; when the word falls down from <hi>H</hi>eaven like Thunder, the voice of the Lord therein being very powerful and full of Majesty, able to break the Cedars of <hi>Labanon,</hi> and to make the wilderness to shake; yet some will sit and sleep under it; such is the woful corruption and desperate hardness of the hearts of the Children of men.</p>
            <p>Instr. 2. <hi>Hence see, that there is great danger in those things which men are apt to look upon as little sins yea as no sins at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for sleeping at Sermons, some look upon it as no sin; others account it a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a sin not worth taking notice of or the troubling themselves about. But my Text sheweth that danger and death is in it. We have solemn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in the Scripture, concerning those that have lost their lives, because they have been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of such miscarriages, as carnal reason will say are but little sins. When there was a man that gathered a few sticks upon the Sabbath day, he was put to death for it; and yet men would be apt to think his sin was not (though indeed it was) very great. Men account i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to add something of their own to the worship of God: but when <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Ahibu</hi> did so, <hi>there went out fire from the Lord,</hi> and consumed them to death. When <hi>Uzzah</hi> a good man;
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:000322_0222_0FA4AF4C3250B108"/>
did with a pious intention, touch the Ark, (which he being no Priest should not have done) <hi>God smote him for his Error, that he dyed by the Ark of God.</hi> Behold! the severity of God, and let us tremble at it. Common sins, which almost eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is guilty of, are accounted small iniquities; but there is exceeding danger in following a multitude to do evil. Sins of Omission are esteemed small, but mens Souls may be thrown into the fire and burned for ever, not only for bearing evil fruit, but because they do not bring forth good fruit, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 10. At the last day the Son of God will pronounce a Sentence of eternal death upon thousands of Millions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have omitted these and those duties which he required and expected from them. Sinful words are looked upon as small evils by many. How common is it for persons to say, <hi>What shall we be made offenders for a word?</hi> abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that Scripture which reproveth those that make others offenders for speaking good and faithful words. But doth not the Scripture say, <hi>by thy words thou shalt be condemned, Mat.</hi> 12.37. Corrupt communications, obscene discourses, unclean lascivious speeches, discover the persons that delight in them to be amongst the number of those that shall (without Repentance) be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned at the day of <hi>Judgement,</hi> yet there are some that make light of them. Thus concerning those words which some call <hi>Petty Oathes;</hi> some
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:000322_0223_0FA4AF4CF8593F48"/>
are so profanely ignorant as to think, that they may Swe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> by <hi>their Faith and Truth,</hi> and that there is no great hurt or danger in it. But there is danger of no less then Damnation for these seemingly little sins, if men shall a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>low themselves therein, notwithstanding the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God to the contrary. See the word of the Lord to this purpose, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>But above all things Swear not,</hi> (i. e. vainly, or except duely called therunto) <hi>neither by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, neither by the Earth, neither by any other Oath,</hi> therefore not by your Faith or Troth, <hi>lost you fall into condemnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, sinful thoughts are esteemed small evils, but I must tell you, that vain thoughts, and much more vile unclean thoughts, if indulged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in, may hinder the Salvation of a mans Soul. Witness that Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. <hi>O Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayist be saved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> so that there is more then a little danger, in those evils, which men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count little sins.</p>
            <p>Inst. 3. <hi>If sleeping at Sermons be such an evil as hath been evinced, there is then cause to fear, that the Lord hath been contending with his People in this Land, by awful Judgements, partly on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The late Synod, who convened on purpose, to
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:000322_0224_0FA4AF4DAA1DD470"/>
enquire into the causes of the Lords controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie with <hi>New-England,</hi> have mentioned this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst many other provoking evils. And there is great reason to think, that, that holy God who will not hold the takers of his Name in vain guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, hath been not a little displeased for this sin, Inasmuch as it is a common evil. I doubt it may be said, that there are many such offenders in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every Congregation throughout the Land. I must confess to my exceeding joy, that there are as few <hi>sleepers at Sermons,</hi> in this Congregation, as in any that I have observed in the Countrey; yet there are some and too many. It is a sin, which Professors and Church-members (as well as others) are guilty of; and 'tis past doubt, that it hath been for their sins in a more peculiar manner, even for the provoking of his Sons, and of his Daughters; that God hath sent the Sword, Fire, and Death amongst us. This is a sin, which is not punished by men, but therefore the Lord himself will visit for it. And truly some of those awful Judgements, which we have sadly experienced, seem to have a special respect unto this sin. Those fearful and amazing voices in the Heavens, even Thundrings and Lightnings, which have caused many amongst us to be horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly afraid; and some have (like <hi>Eutychus</hi>) been taken up dead, the Thunder of God having kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them in a moment; hath not the Lord sent them usually upon the very day when Sermons
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:000322_0225_0FA4AF50C2121338"/>
are wont to be Preached, or upon the next day thereto; as if the Lord should say, if you will slight and sleep at my word, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> make you to hear that which shall awake you with a witness. And doth not God threaten with a Famine of his word? How many bereaved Congregations are there? and some that have been a long time without the Ministerial dispensation of the Word and Sacraments. Well may it be so, if People when they enjoyed a faithful Ministry, shewed no more respect and reverence towards God speaking to them therein, then to sit and sleep under it.</p>
            <p>Instr. 4. <hi>If sleeping at Sermons be a great evil, then their iniquity is exceeding great in the sight of God, who do that in Sermon time, which is worse then sleeping.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>e. g. To <hi>Play</hi> at Sermon time, as wicked chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who have no grace nor fear of God in their hearts, will sometimes do. If you do thus on the Sabbath day, you break the third and the fourth Commandment both at once, and then <hi>how guilty! how guilty!</hi> are you in the sight of the holy Lord God, who is in this dreadful place, but you are not aware of it. So for persons to sit <hi>Laughing</hi> in the presence of God, when his Word is spoken to them in his Name, their sin and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faness is exceeding great before the Lord. What dost thou think will become of thy immortal
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:000322_0226_0FA4AF52613DFE98"/>
soul? dost thou think that God will have mercy on thee. Repent of this thy wickedness, or I do most solemnly declare unto thee in his Name, God will not have mercy on thee. He that made thee, will show thee no favour. The Lord saith, he will look unto those that are of a conceive Spirit, <hi>who tremble at his Ward,</hi> Isai. 66. 2. Thou then, that are so far from trembling at the Word of the Lord, as to <hi>Laugh</hi> when it is spoken to thee; the infinite Majesty, who hath Heaven for his Throne, and the Earth for his Foot-stool, will not look upon thee; he abhort to see or to look upon such a prophane wretch as thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>: But inasmuch as thou dost laugh at his Word now, repent speedily, or the time draweth on, when distress and anguish will take hold on thy Soul, and then God will laugh at thy calamity, and moth when thy fear cometh. And therefore hear and fear now, and do no more so wickedly. Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 26. <hi>Wo to you that laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep.</hi> So I say, wo to you that laugh at Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons now, for you shall mourn, and never laugh more. When wilt thou say? even when thy soul shall be with <hi>Dives;</hi> crying out, world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end. <hi>I am tormented in this flame.</hi> And O think how the Devils will taunt &amp; mock at thee, and say, why don't you laugh now? Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you heard such a Minister of God Breach, he brought you the glad tidings of eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:000322_0227_0FA4AF5493158F20"/>
vation, and the sad news of everlasting destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but you laughed when you heard him speaking after the most solemn and earnest man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; is it a laughing matter now think you? were they not the great Truths of God, that were spoken in his Name? Then will tears of Blood trickle down thy dry and damned cheeks for ever and ever, because <hi>thou</hi> mayest not be so happy as to hear one Sermon, or to have one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of Grace more, throughout the never-ending dayes of Eternity.</p>
            <p>Use 2. If sleeping at Sermon be so great an evil as hath been said, then let those that have been guilty, of this evil, <hi>be exhorted to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for what's past, and to beware of it for time to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Consider 1. <hi>Men must give an account another day for every Sermon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be true, (as it cannot but be true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the mouth of him who is Truth it self hath spoken it) <hi>that of every idle word which man shall speak, they must give account thereof at the day of Judgement,</hi> Mat. 12. 36. Certainly they must give an account concerning every Sermon which they heart. Sleeping at a Sermon is a greater sin, thou speaking an idle word. Therefore if men must be called to an account for idle words, much more for this. All those <hi>Talents,</hi> which the Lord doth intrust any with, they must be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:000322_0228_0FA4AF56241A6E80"/>
for them another day: Now Gospel Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, are amongst the most precious Talents, which any in this World have conferred on them. But what a sad account will be given concerning those Sermons which have been slept away? As light as thou makest of it now, it may be Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will roar for it upon a Death bed. Not many years ago, there was a young man, than being wont to come to hear the Word in this Congregation, when he was upon his sick-bed, which proved his death-bed, he desired to speak with me, and when I came to him, he had this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, <hi>O Sir, sometimes whilest Sermons have been Preaching: I have set my self to sleep on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and do you think it is possible, that one that hath done so, should ever find mercy with God.</hi> And if this be a trouble on a death-bed, will not the thought of it, be a terror at the last and great day? verily there is many a Soul, that will find this to be a dismal thought at the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when he shall remember so many Sermons I might have heard for my everlasting benefit, but I slighted and slept them away.</p>
            <p>Therefore,</p>
            <p>Consider 2. <hi>That if men allow themselves in this evil, their souls are in danger to perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Its true, that a godly man may be subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this, as well as unto other infirmities; but he doth nor allow himself therein. If he be incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to sleep, when he should be hearing the
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:000322_0229_0FA4AF56ABF20FA0"/>
Word, he mourns under it, as his burden. If indeed thou hast grace in thy soul, then in case thy head hath been heavy at Sermon-time, thy heart will be heavy for it afterwards. But when persons indulge themselves in this iniquity, when they compose and settle themselves to sleep, their state is dangerous, and their souls like to perish. Their spot is not the spot of Gods Children. How was the Lord provoked at them who despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Manna.</hi> And their sins is no less who offer contempt to the <hi>Manna</hi> of the Gospel; as <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sleepers,</hi> who indulge themselves in this their iniquity, do.</p>
            <p>Some it may be will say, but <hi>how shall we help it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. As helps against this evil, there are some things that men should remember to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve before they come to hear the Word. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of excessive toiling and moiling in the World, because that doth incline to sleepiness. And remember to be temperate in all things. When men overcharge themselves with meat and drink, and then come to hear the Word Preached, no wonder if they fall asleep, when they should be hearing for their Souls benefit. And if you find your selves inclined to this evil, remember so pray much against it before you come to hear. I doubt common <hi>sleepers at Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> remember not this. Did they pray ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:000322_0230_0FA4AF5774B99AB8"/>
against this infirmity the Lord would give them power and victory over it. You must be watchful in order unto prayer, and you must pray that you may become watchful.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>At the time of Hearing, some things are to be done as helps against this Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Strive against it when first you begin to drowse, shake off a sleepy frame. <hi>Stir up your selves</hi> to hear the Word, as well as to call upon the Name of God, <hi>Isai.</hi> 64.7. If sitting be an occasion of sleeping, rather stand up, then sit and sleep and sin. And keep alive those thoughts in your hearts, which will be a means to prevent sleeping. <hi>e. g.</hi> The awful thoughts of the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial presence of God. When <hi>Jacob</hi> slept as in his Journey towards <hi>Padan Aran,</hi> Gen. 28. 16. <hi>he awaked out of his sleep and said, surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not:</hi> it is as if he had said, had I been aware that God was in this place I would not have composed my self to sleep in his presence. <hi>Jacob</hi> had more grace, then to set himself to sleep in the special presence of God. Surely, if men did know that God is in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Assemblies, they would not set themselves to sleep there. Remember when you hear Sermons Preached, that God himself is speaking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the Word of God, which you hear, not as the word of men, but as the word of God, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.13. I remember I have read concerning that great Emperor <hi>Constanti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Men would be more like to stand trembling, then to sit sleeping, if they did believe and think of this, Again, if thou dost find thy self inclined to sleep under the hearing of the Word, think how Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is busie about thee, thou mayst be sure he is near at hand, if thou growest sleepy as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and wilt thou give way to his Temptations? Yea, think with thy self, if I should sleep now, I should sin; There was a man that could say, he had not slept a wink at a Sermon, for more then twenty years together, and could give this Reason of it, <hi>Because</hi> (said he) <hi>if I begin to be sleepy, that thought cometh into my heart, if I should now sleep, I should sin against God, and that I dare not do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh consider what hath been spoken. And learn to hear the Word of God, with utmost at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of mind, and intention of heart. So <hi>your souls shall live.</hi>
