            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. That Jeſus was the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that was promiſed by <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; the Prophets, whom the People of the Jews had been long in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he was the Son of the Living God. Some have acknowledged Him to be the Chriſt, that have not acknowledged Him to be the Son of the Living God: But if He be One He muſt be the other; and <hi>Peter</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth both.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>verſe,</hi> we have the beginning of
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001584_0004_0FB3D640D3333CC8"/>Chriſts anſwer to <hi>Peter,</hi> Where firſt, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth him bleſſed. Sometimes men are called bleſſed, becauſe ſome ſpecial bleſſing is beſtowed on them, or ſhall be beſtowed upon them. Pſal. 41.1. <hi>Bleſſed is he that conſidereth the Poor.</hi> Pſal. 84.4. <hi>Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe.</hi> Sometimes they are called bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe they are heirs of bleſſedneſs; Matt. 25.34. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father inherit the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> was a bleſſed man. Secondly, The reaſon why Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces him Bleſſed, from the way wherein this was revealed to him. (1.) Negatively, <hi>Not by fleſh and blood;</hi> by fleſh and blood we are to underſtand Mortal man. Gal. 1.16. <hi>I conferred not with fleſh &amp; blood.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.50. <hi>Fleſh &amp; blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God. Peter</hi> was told of this firſt by man. Joh. 1.40, 41. <hi>Andrew</hi> ſaith to him, <hi>We have found the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as;</hi> but the meaning is, it was not only revealed by fleſh and blood. (2.) Poſitively, <hi>But my Father that is in Heaven.</hi> This is not to be underſtood of the conviction by Miracles, for many ſaw Chriſt's Miracles that were not happy, but of the conviction by the Spirit of God. God who dwelleth in Heaven had taught him this.</p>

               <q>Thoſe Men are bleſſed, to whom the Divinity of Jeſus of Nazereth is revealed, not by fleſh and blood, but by the Father that is in Heaven.</q>
               <p>The Divinity of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is abundantly taught in the Old Teſtament: That the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath begotten Him, <hi>Pſal</hi> 27. That he is <hi>Davids</hi> Lord, <hi>Pſal</hi> 110.1. That He is the Mighty God, and the Everlaſting Father, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9 6. That He is Jehovah our Righteouſneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3 36. That His goings forth have been from of old, from Everlaſting, <hi>Mic.</hi> 5.2. That He was the Man that was Gods Fellow, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.7. And this is abundantly declared in the New Teſtament, That Jeſus of Nazereth is the Son of God: He Himſelf gave witneſs to it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.37. And He accepted of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion from others: from <hi>Nathanael, Joh.</hi> 1.49, 50. from <hi>Peter</hi> in the Text; from <hi>Thomas, Joh.</hi> 20 28, 29. And it is abundantly witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto by inſpired men: ſo by <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. ſo by the Apoſtles in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: this we all acknowledge. But there be a Number of men to whom this is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001584_0006_0FB3D643D2778618"/>by the Father that is in Heaven, and thoſe are bleſſed men. They are of divers quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and degrees; but what-ever their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be, what-ever their calamities, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, their temptations, their iniquities be, they are bleſſed Men. If this has been revealed by God to them, they ſhall partake in Glory at the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt. If God have revealed the glory of Chriſt to them, Glory ſhall be revealed in them, if they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of this light they ſhall partake of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Saints in light.</p>
               <p>Three <hi>Propoſitions</hi> are here to be ſpoken to.</p>
               <p>PROP. I. <hi>It is a difficult thing to be indeed convinced that Jeſus of Nazereth is God.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> deny this, and ſo do the <hi>Socinians</hi> in the ſenſe that the Scriptures teach it. It is eaſy to be convinced of ſome truths, becauſe ſenſe and reaſon do teach them: but this is a thing known purely by revelation: Natural reaſon makes no diſcovery of it, and carnal reaſon has many objections againſt it. Men are naturally blind, and the Devil by carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings makes them more blind, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 4.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a ſeeming impoſſibility in it.</hi> There is an infinite diſtance between God and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001584_0007_0FB3D645557C55F0"/>Man, and that they ſhould be United in One is beyond our comprehenſion. That God ſhould be Man and Man ſhould be God, ſeem to imply a contradiction. There is a ſeeming neceſſity that if there be two Natures in Chriſt, there muſt alſo be two Perſons, and that if there be but One Perſon, there is likewiſe but one Nature. It is abſolutely impoſſible that the divine Nature ſhould be an humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or that the humane Nature ſhould be a divine Nature. And it ſeems impoſſible that the ſame Perſon ſhould be both God and Man. Hence there aroſe ſo many Hereſies in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church. The <hi>Manichees</hi> and <hi>Arians</hi> denyed the Divine Nature of Chriſt: ſome of them ſaid, He was a meer Man. The <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionites</hi> denyed the Humane Nature of Chriſt, they ſaid He only appeared in an humane Shape, as in the time of the Old Teſtament: and as the Angels did often appear. The <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychians</hi> denyed Him to be diſtinct God and Man, they confounded the two Natures, ſaid He had one Nature made of a Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane. Many Men have been confounded to conceive, That the Natures are diſtinct and yet the Perſon the ſame. And the <hi>Socinians</hi> at this day, though they acknowledge that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001584_0008_0FB3D646D148BA78"/>Chriſt is God, yet do deny that He is the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and Increated God. <hi>Neſtorius</hi> taught that Chriſt was two Perſons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is ſeeming improbability in it.</hi> If it be granted that 'tis not impoſſible, yet it ſeems improbable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It ſeems improbable that God would ſo condeſcend.</hi> It is condeſcention for God to have any Communion with Men. It was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention for God to appear to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to be familiar with <hi>Moſes.</hi> Man is but a worm, <hi>Job</hi> 25 6. And it muſt needs be great condeſcention for God to be made fleſh; to be manifeſted in fleſh. It would be matter of admiration, if a Prince ſhould Marry a Poor Woman: but this is more, God muſt ſtoop very low to do this: this was too much to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, before it was revealed: It would have been impudence to have asked it of God. The Angels of Heaven did not imagine ſuch a thing, if it had been propoſed to them, they would have thought, that it had been too much. God has ſhewed a great deal of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the holy Angels, but there is nothing parallel to this. It ſeems as if it would be an undervaluing, and forgetting his own Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority. It ſeems very unlikely that He would
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001584_0009_0FB3D6485266C120"/>take upon him a Nature made out of the duſt, that is exalted but one degree above the beaſts. A Nature compaſſed about with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, a Nature inferiour to the Angels, a Nature liable to hunger and thirſt, and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and pain, and death. It ſeems as if it were too much for love to do: That He would diſdain to appear on earth in a mean outward appearance: That it ſhould be ſaid when He appeared in the form of a Servant, That this is God, This is He that you are to Worſhip and Adore.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It ſeems improbable that He ſhould be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſo to advance Jeſus of Nazereth.</hi> It was a great thing that He ſhould advance <hi>David</hi> from being a Shepherd to Rule His People Iſrael: he ſays, <hi>What am I, and what is my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, that thou haſt brought me hitherto?</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18. It is a greater, that God is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to advance any of Mankind to heavenly glory, He puts great honour upon them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. But this is more, that it ſhould be ſaid of a Man, that He is God; that He made Heaven and Earth, that out of the Mouth of Babes and Sucklings God ſhould ordain Strength, that He ſhould advance a Man above Principalites and Powers, and ſay of him, <hi>Let all the Angels
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001584_0010_0FB3D649D193B5C8"/>of God worſhip Him,</hi> and ſay to Him, <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever.</hi> It ſeems to be too much for a Creature to be Perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly United to the Creator. God is angry with us when we Worſhip Wood and Stone, and Silver and Gold; and it ſeems very unlikely that God ſhould bid us Worſhip One that was made out of the duſt, as well as our ſelves. The honour that God puts on many men in the World is very great, but it is amazing that God ſhould put ſo much honour upon a Man, that He ſhould be Perſonally United to the Divine Nature: that the God of Heaven and Earth, whom all the Angels adore, ſhould take the Son of a poor Woman, Married to a Man of mean occupation, into Perſonal Union with Himſelf.</p>
               <p>PROP. II <hi>Yet many Men have ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of it, becauſe it is revealed by Men.</hi> There be Multitudes of Men that make a Profeſſion of his Divinity, that are but carnal men: for they are not obedient to him: <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.46. <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I ſay.</hi> They are zealous in the Profeſſion of his Divinity, they Write in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it, they ſuffer Perſecution for it. If any Man among us ſhould deny it, they would
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001584_0011_0FB3D64B53772780"/>think he were not worthy to live; they have a conſiderable perſwaſion of the Truth of it, but it is becauſe it is revealed by Man.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe it is acknowledged by ſuch a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Men.</hi> They have imbibed this doctrine from their Childhood: and wherever they go they find others are of the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion; they hear that many great Nations do receive it: Wiſe and Learned Men are of that perſwaſion, and they take it for granted that it is ſo, and dare not call the thing into queſtion. As the <hi>Epheſians</hi> were perſwaded that the <hi>Image of Diana fell down from Heaven.</hi> And as the <hi>Turks</hi> are perſwaded that <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> was a great Prophet. And as the carnal Jews were perſwaded that God ſpake by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> ſo theſe men are perſwaded that Jeſus is the Son of God: They think ſurely ſo many wiſe men in former Generations, and in this Generation are not deceived. They don't think it ſtrange that Ignorant Heathens ſhould be deceived, and that the Jews that are under great Prejudices ſhould be deceived. But they dare not harbour a thought, that ſuch good and wiſe and learned Men as make this Profeſſion ſhould be deceived. The reſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Chriſtian World is of great force
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001584_0012_0FB3D64CD51F0B20"/>with them, they ſay it is not to be imagined that ſuch Men would agree in ſuch a Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without ground. If there were but few that owned it, that would be a terrible temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to them, but it would be unreaſonable for them to queſtion that which is ſo generally acknowledged, they ſhould render themſelves abominable, and be contemptible and vile in the Eyes of all about them, and make their lives miſerable, if they ſhould give way to a Scrupulous Spirit about this doctrine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe there are ſo many arguments for it in that book, which Men ſay is the word of God.</hi> There are many reaſons drawn from the Scriptures to prove that Jeſus was the Son of God. It was fore-told, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> muſt come before the Scepter departed from <hi>Judah</hi> That he muſt come while the Second Temple was ſtanding; that he muſt come before <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> Seventy Weeks were run out; and there never was any yet in the World to whom the Characters of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> did in any probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity belong, but only Jeſus of Nazereth. The Miraculous conception of Chriſt is a great evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35. The Voice of God from Heaven was very evidential of His Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. The teſtimony of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001584_0013_0FB3D64E51A05828"/>has a great deal of argument in it. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous works that were wrought by him, and by the Apoſtles in his Name, are very ſpeaking arguments. God bore witneſs to him by divers ſigns and wonders &amp; miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. The Reſurrection of Jeſus on the third day accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Prediction, is a great Witneſs for him. The rejection of the Jews ſoon after their Crucifying him, is a ſtrong confirmation of this doctrine: Theſe things are plainly held forth in the Scripture, and it is generally acknowledged that the Scripture is the word of God. The inlightned part of the World are generally of a mind, that the Scripture was given by inſpiration from God. Men would count them out of their Wits, if they ſhould not own the Scriptures to be the word of God. They think they muſt yield that, not only Orthodox Churches do own it, out the very Papiſts, &amp; many other Hereticks do.

PROP. III. <hi>They are bleſſed to whom this is revealed by the Father.</hi> The World doth admire the felicity of thoſe that are great and noble, but theſe Men that the Father hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Chriſt unto, are indeed bleſſed, theſe are objects of Gods love, theſe are the heirs of the Kingdom of God. Death will put a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to the imaginary happineſs of ſome men: but if men have this revealed to them by the Father, at Death they will enter into happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: for every ſuch man doth believe on Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Some men complain that they cannot come to Chriſt; but theſe men are able to come to Chriſt, and do come to Him. They do fulfill the condition of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Job.</hi> 6.45.</p>
               <p>Argu. 1. <hi>Thoſe to whom this is revealed by the Father, are convinced of the ſufficiency of his Death for Redemption.</hi> When awakned Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are invited unto Chriſt, they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the ſufficiency of the blood of Chriſt, and they are afraid to accept of the Invitation. They conſider that their Sins have been very great, and God is an Holy and a Jealous God: That he hath threatned ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction for Sin, and that the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001584_0015_0FB3D65154779BD8"/>of Jeſus Chriſt were but for a few years, and the extremity of them for a few hours; and don't ſee the redeeming virtue of his blood. They could as quietly depend upon the Sacrifices of <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Oxen,</hi> as the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of CHRIST: They can take more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from the Tears that they ſhed, than the blood that Chriſt has ſhed. But when they are taught of the Father the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt, they are convinced of the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of his Death: when the Father doth teach them the Divinity of Chriſt, then they do indeed ſee his Divine Glory; than they ſay, <hi>God has purchaſed his Church with his own blood,</hi> Act. 20.28. Then they ſay, <hi>The blood of Chriſt who through the Eternal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God, doth purge the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience from dead works,</hi> Heb. 9.14. They have ſuch a ſenſe of the dignity of his Perſon, that they are ſatisfied that his ſufferings are a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient price of Redemption. That though his ſufferings were but for a little time, yet they abundantly anſwer for thoſe Eternal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that they have deſerved. That God has received a full recompence for the wrongs which they have done him: now they cannot count the blood of the Covenant a common
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001584_0016_0FB3D652EC362168"/>thing. They ſay, <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe, being made a curſe for us.</hi> Gal. 3.13. They can have no low thoughts of the Sacrifice of Chriſt; they ſay it was the Mighty God that Suffered, He whoſe goings forth have been from Everlaſting, He whoſe Glory fills Heaven and Earth, He who is the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Fathers Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon.</p>
               <p>Argu. 2. <hi>They are convinced of the Divinity of Goſpel Invitations.</hi> Awakened Sinners are not ſatisfied in the divine authority of the Goſpel call: They know that the Miniſter Invites them, and they know not but that the Goſpel calls are Gods calls, and they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to think that the Goſpel is the Word of God. But when God opens their Eyes and ſhews them the Divinity of Chriſt, He always at the ſame time convinceth them of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority of the Goſpel: When they are taught by the Father that Jeſus is the Son of God, they ſee at the ſame time, that all that doctrine which is taught in the Goſpel is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, they ſee that the ſending of Chriſt into the World, was the Work of God, that the Command to believe, is Gods Command, and the Promiſe made to believing, is Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001584_0017_0FB3D65453105B18"/>and ſo the Word comes with mighty power upon their hearts. 1 Theſ. 2.13. <hi>When we received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of Man, but as it is indeed the word of God, which effectually worketh in you that believe.</hi> Before they were at a loſs whether the Word was the word of God, and they thought in caſe it ſhould be ſo, that God might not intend them, God might be willing to Save others, but not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Save them; but now when God opens the Eyes of Men, they are at no loſs about the Invitation, they hear the Voice of God calling them, and ſo they are not afraid to come to Chriſt. Before they were afraid it would be Preſumption, they feared they ſhould be more bold than welcome, they feared that it would be a provocation for ſuch as they to obtrude themſelves on Chriſt. But when God reveals to them the divine Glory of Jeſus of Nazareth, they are at no loſs about their liberty to come to Chriſt: They ſee their Warrant, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will ſcare them from coming to Chriſt, if their offences had been more, if every Sin were <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <p>USE, I. <hi>Hence it follows, That Men dont know who are bleſſed.</hi> If Riches &amp; Dignities, or Morality, or Baptiſm, or Church fellowſhip would make men bleſſed; we might be able to pronounce many men ſo: But if it depends on the Fathers revealing Chriſt to men, then we are under an uncertainty. Chriſt knew that the Father had revealed him to <hi>Peter,</hi> but we don't know who he hath revealed him unto. It is difficult for ſome good men to know it concerning themſelves, but much more difficult to know it concerning others. We may have grounds of ſtrong perſwaſion concerning ſome; but we muſt not pretend to an infallible knowledge reſpecting any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men.</p>
               <p>Conſider, 1. <hi>If Men profeſs the Divinity of Jeſus Chriſt, we dont know that it hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to them by the Father.</hi> There be a Multitude of People in the World that make a Profeſſion of this, and they do it ſeriouſly and zealouſly; but they be but ſew that have this revealed by the Father. Tradition and rational conviction, are the foundation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mens Profeſſion: for indeed there are but few that are taught of God Matth. 20.16. <hi>Many</hi>

                  <hi>are called and few are choſen.</hi> Chriſt charges ſome that make a Profeſſion, with Spiritual blindneſs. Rev. 3.17. <hi>Thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi> And many men that make a great Profeſſion, are deſtitute of Saving Grace. The fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins had no oyl in their veſſels: Some that have a Name to live are dead. All that are taught by the Father will make a Profeſſion of Chriſt: but there be many that make that Profeſſion, that are not taught by the Father. There is a great difference between the viſible Church and the inviſible. Multitudes will be rejected at the laſt day, that made a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Matth. 7.22, 23. <hi>Many ſhall ſay to me, have we not propheſied in thy Name,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And then I will profeſs unto them, I know you not, ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me ye that work iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If Men tell that they had a very affecting diſcovery of Chriſt, we dont know that it is any more than common Illumination.</hi> Many men have great illuminations that are never Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: Natural Conſcience is capable of a great deal of light; a Natural man may have an affecting diſcovery of hell. <hi>Iſai</hi> 33.14. They ſay, <hi>Who can dwell with devouring fire? who can dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> He may
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001584_0020_0FB3D65A52F8F6D0"/>have an affecting diſcovery of Heaven: So we find when Chriſt had been ſpeaking of the Reſurrection of the juſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.15. One that heard him, ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is he that ſhall eat bread in the Kingdom of God.</hi> So he may have an affecting diſcovery of Chriſt, and of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. They may hear the word &amp; anon with joy receive it, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.20. They may be ſo affected, as to look upon the doctrine of the Goſpel to be a bleſſed doctrine, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.15. They may be inlightned and taſte the good word of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6 4, 5. Common illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, may beget as ſtrong affections as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual illuminations, Men may be much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Chriſt, yet not be convinced of his divine Glory: in the days of his fleſh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had ſuch a perſwaſion as is called faith, yet it was not faith of the right kind. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.23, 24. <hi>Many believed on his Name, but Jeſus did not commit himſelf to them; becauſe he knew all men.</hi> So <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42, 43.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If they tell us that immediately upon that diſcovery they came to Chriſt, we cant tell but that they were miſtaken.</hi> Many men will give that account that upon the coming of ſome Goſpel Promiſe to them, and a diſcovery therein of the Alſufficiency of Chriſt, they
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001584_0021_0FB3D65BD1B81A30"/>caſt themſelves upon him: And generally we have reaſon to believe that they ſpeak the truth in their heart: But how can we tell that they are not miſtaken? for many men take that for coming to Chriſt that is not coming to him. There be images of faith, as well as of other graces Jam 2.14. <hi>What doth it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, if a man ſay he hath faith?</hi> Some hope that Chriſt will Save them, and they call that faith. Some depend partly upon the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and partly upon their own works, and they think they believe in Chriſt. Some men dont rightly underſtand the nature of faith, they have had experience of thoſe work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that they call faith: and ſome dont un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the actings of their own Souls; they can give a right diſcription of faith, but they greatly miſtake in the application of it to themſelves: There was ſomething like faith, and they hope it was faith.</p>

                  <hi>Whether you have been taught the Divinity of Jeſus by the Father that is in Heaven.</hi> You make a Profeſſion of the divinity of Jeſus, but this dont make you bleſſed. There are two

If you be not more happy than many Perſons that make a Profeſſion of Chriſt; if you be not more happy than many Perſons that are zealous in the Profeſſion of Chriſt; if you be not more happy than many Perſons that walk outwardly according to that Profeſſion, you are far enough from bleſſedneſs. You ſay it was by the good Providence of God, that Chriſt was revealed to you. So all things come to paſs by the Providence of God: but this you muſt inquire into, <hi>Whether God by his Spirit hath indeed taught you the Divinity of Jeſus Chriſt!</hi> For if you do not know this, you dont know that you are Godly, you dont know that your Sins are Pardoned, you dont know what will become of you when you die: therefore examine this matter.</p>
               <p>Two things make this Examination diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Some men that have not been taught by the Father, have had great illuminations</hi> Some men have been ſatisfied at the time that the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001584_0023_0FB3D65ED2F39000"/>Sun of Righteouſneſs has riſen upon them with healing in his Wings: But afterwards they have conſidered that <hi>Balaam</hi> had great illuminations; that thoſe who ſay they Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſyed in Chriſts Name, and in his Name had caſt out Devils, and thoſe that cryed, <hi>Hoſanna to the Son of David, Hoſanna in the Higheſt,</hi> muſt needs be much inlightned: They are at a ſtand what to think of themſelves: they are at a loſs what difference there is between their illuminations, and thoſe which ſome car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men have had: it ſeems hard to determine, that the light which they have received, has tranſcended the light that others have had: Others have had great confidence as well as they, others have been greatly affected as well as they, others have eſcaped the Pollutions of the World as well as they: They are at a loſs to find out any thing peculiar and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: They were not troubled with any doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings at firſt, but they forget in time, and cant tell exactly how things were with them; and are afraid that they have had no more than ſome Hypocrites have attained unto.</p>

The light that others have is like that at noon day: The light that ſome men have is very clear, things are made exceeding evident to them. The light is more explicite and diſtinct than in others; they have a larger and fuller diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Glory of Chriſt: yea the light that ſome have is more frequently repeated: They have many times had diſcoveries of Chriſt: And theſe men that have but a ſmall degree of light, are under great diſadvantage, becauſe the light is ſmall, they cannot give ſo diſtinct account of what they ſee; it is not ſo eaſy to diſtinguiſh that light from common light; and beſides they are under great temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to ſuſpect the revelation that is made to them.

1. <hi>Such as have been taught by the Father, have ſeen themſelves utterly blind, juſt before that revelation.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus came into the World, that they which ſee not might ſee, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.39. Every man is blind by Nature, and he ſhews them this blindneſs juſt before he puts this light into them. Some men ſay, They were never at any loſs about the divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Jeſus of Nazareth, they always believed it; they may be aſſured that it hath never been revealed to them by the Father. Some others ſay, They have many times ſeen their blindneſs; truly there be partial convictions of it very frequently, and yet men remain blind. But it is the manner of God juſt before he lets in this heavenly light, to make a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough diſcovery of this natural blindneſs, then he gives light to them that ſat in darkneſs, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.7, 9. He dont convince men of their blindneſs a Twelve month before, and ſuffer them to looſe the ſenſe of it, and then reveal Chriſt to them: but he makes them ſenſible that they are in Egyptian darkneſs, that no teaching, nor arguing, nor conſideration is ſufficient to inlighten them, and in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity God makes the Sun of Righteouſneſs to ariſe on them: and they are delivered out
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001584_0026_0FB3D663AB4141E8"/>of the Kingdom of darkneſs, and tranſlated into the Kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They ſee God teſtifying to the Divinity of Chriſt, in the Old Teſtament.</hi> There be ſeveral characters of the Meſſiah that are applicable to none but Jeſus of Nazareth; and in the New Teſtament it is plainly laid down, that Jeſus is the Son of God. Theſe men have read them hundreds of times, and had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſwaſion of them; but now they ſee God teſtifying to them, their underſtandings are inlightned to ſee ſuch a glory in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that they know it to be the word of God. It can be no other than the word of God. The declaration of the Goſpel comes with a divine authority upon them; they hear the Voice of God in the Goſpel: the word is not an uncertain report, but there goes a glorious light along with it: They dont look upon it to be an imagination, or a conjecture, but the true ſayings of God. They are not in the dark about it, whether the Goſpel be a cunningly deviſed fable, and an humane invention. They are not of a doubtful Mind, but they plainly ſee a divine ſignature, and the character of divine authority in it. They ſee in it the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Grace and Wiſdom, and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001584_0027_0FB3D664D14EADE8"/>Righteouſneſs of God. 1 Theſ. 2.13. <hi>Ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it not as the word of man, but as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the word of God, which worketh effectually in them that believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They do at the ſame time ſee all other things that are neceſſary, in order to their coming to Chriſt.</hi> In order to mens coming to Chriſt, they muſt ſee many other things, they muſt ſee that Jeſus is appointed by God to be a Mediator, that he has born the Puniſhment of our iniquities: That there is Saving virtue in his blood and righteouſneſs, that the Mercy of God is free, that they are invited by God, that God is faithful to fulfill his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the Goſpel. And when the divinity of Chriſt is revealed by the Father, they ſee all theſe things. If all impediments were not removed out of the way, they would not dare to come to Chriſt. Indeed the Soul in its firſt coming to Chriſt hath not the particular diſtinct conſideration of all thoſe things; for the work is wrought at once, as it were in the twinkling of an eye, but there is that light let into the Soul, that a man ſees abundant incouragement to caſt his Soul upon Chriſt; and is ſatisfied in the truth of that Evangelical doctrine, that he has been inſtructed in: He
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001584_0028_0FB3D66651C2D830"/>ſayes, as Joh. 6.68. <hi>Whether ſhall we go? thou haſt the words of Eternal Life.</hi> And if any thing be ſuggeſted to him about the freeneſs of Gods Mercy, about the fidelity of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the univerſality of the Goſpel call, he is prepared to aſſent to theſe things. The word of Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt is cleared up ſo unto him, that all obſticles are taken out of the way, and he can with freedom of Spirit imbrace the call of the Goſpel, and joyfully betake himſelf to Chriſt for refuge.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>This revelation doth immediately made a Spiritual change in the Soul.</hi> Some of theſe men long before the revelation was made to them, carried it orderly, were religiouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, were zealous againſt Sinful ways, had an affection for the People of God, were ſorry for their Sins, ſtrove to do duties for the glory of God, were very watchful againſt temptations, ſometimes had great inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and meltings in Prayer. But upon this revelation, they have quite another Spirit than they had: Now they love God, God has their hearts: they deſire the glory of God. They ſay with <hi>Paul, Now to the King Eternal, Immortal, Inviſible, and only wiſe God, be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory for ever and ever,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.17.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001584_0029_0FB3D667D13AC058"/>Now they have godly ſorrow for their Sins; this diſcovery works a ſpirit of Repentance in them; and they ſay as <hi>Job,</hi> Now we <hi>abhor our ſelves, and repent in duſt and aſhes,</hi> Job 42.6. This diſcovery puts life into them. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.25. <hi>They hear the Voice of the Son of God and live.</hi> And though the old Spirit doth return again, and gather ſtrength, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times much prevail, yet the tokens of this change do abide in them: <hi>The ſpirit is luſting againſt the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.17. And they have a continual warfare; and many times there be ſenſible workings of a Spirit of Grace, they are rejoycing in Chriſt, panting after God, hungring and thirſting after righteouſneſs, loving thoſe that are godly, longing for the inlargement of Chriſts Kingdom, waiting for the breathings of the Spirit, hating all the works of darkneſs.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Be not at reſt till the Divinity of Jeſus be Revealed to you by the Father that is in Heaven.</hi> Some men have lived all their dayes in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they have got literal Knowledge, and they are able to prove the Divinity of Jeſus
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001584_0030_0FB3D669521E1790"/>Chriſt: But they have never been taught it of God, and yet the men are not in pain, or in diſtreſs of Spirit. Some have only now and then a gird of Conſcience, but ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is no great burden to them, their Spirits are taken up about Meat and Drink, and Cloaths, taken up about News, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of outward Afflictions. But one would think you ſhould have no reſt Day or Night, till this Sun of Righteouſneſs riſe on you, with healing in his Wings. One might expect that your hearts ſhould be as heavy as lead: and that you ſhould be crying out with <hi>Bartimeus, Lord, that we may receive our ſight!</hi> It is wonderful ſtupidity, not to regard this miſerable condition that you are in. Give not ſleep to your Eyes, nor ſlumber to your Eye-lids, if it be poſſible till you have this revelation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If you have not this, you will ſurely pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi> Your Salvation dont depend upon the degree of the revelation, but it doth depend upon the revelation. A man may be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of ſome things without any damage. There be ſome other things that if he be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, he is expoſed to ſome inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereby; but if the Divinity of Jeſus be
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001584_0031_0FB3D66AD1A96490"/>not revealed unto you, you will periſh. You think it a dreadful thing to be damned, yet thus it will be with you, if this be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to you. Joh. 8.24. <hi>If you believe not that I am he, you ſhall are in your Sins.</hi> If God dont teach you He will not ſave you. If you have not the light of Grace, you will not have the light of Glory. If God leaves you to darkneſs, you muſt go to outward darkneſs. How is it poſſible for you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on Jeſus Chriſt, if his divine glory have not been revealed to you? Joh. 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father that ſent me, draw him.</hi> Exhortations and Warnings wont prevail without this revelation, you will not dare to come to him. Fleſh and blood can never prevail with you to come to Chriſt. Chriſt was revealed to <hi>Paul</hi> before he was Converted, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15, 16. Men muſt be taught of the Father, before they come to Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.45. If men hear that there is Saving virtue in the blood of Chriſt, that he hath redeemed us from the curſe, that God is willing to beſtow Salvation, upon His ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that Chriſt is the author of Eternal Salvation to all that obey him, that there is enough in Chriſt for the expiation of all their
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001584_0032_0FB3D66C51442A80"/>Sins, if they were ten times as many as they be, they wont really believe it, till the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine glory of Chriſt be revealed to them. When they ſee Him to be God, they will eaſily believe that He has purchaſed the Church with His own blood.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A great deal may be done by you in order to this.</hi> You ſay men are paſſive in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this revelation, not active in working of it. You abſtain from vicious ways, you Read, you come to Meeting, you Pray: God is a free Agent, you cannot force Him, there is no compelling God to make this revelation to you. But yet, you can do a great deal more than you do, in order to this. You can obſtain from ſuch reaſonings and methods wherein you are wont to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den your hearts, you are able to reform your ſelves more thoroughly: You may abſtain from Sins of Ominion, as well as Sins of Commiſſion: You may ponder a great deal more upon your miſery, than you do. You hurry your ſelves in the World, and ſpend a great deal of time in idle Talk; and let your thoughts run upon an hundred
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001584_0033_0FB3D66DD3193C88"/>Vanities, whereas in that time you might be Meditating upon the uncertainty of your Lives, on your Appearance before God, and the Torments of Hell, upon your loſs of Time, the blindneſs of your Minds, the enmity that is in you to that which is good, upon the awful diſpenſations of God to you, that He hath not given you Eyes to ſee, or Ears to hear unto this day. You might be looking <hi>Backward,</hi> and take notice of your Tranſgreſſions, looking <hi>Inward,</hi> and take notice of the Plague of your own hearts, looking <hi>Forward,</hi> and take notice of the <hi>Grave,</hi> and the <hi>Bottomleſs Pit.</hi> You may cry mightily to God. <hi>Paul</hi> when he was blind, Prayed after another manner than he had been wont to do, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.11. Some Pray as if they asked a denial, and deſigned to provoke God to deny them; you can Pray with importunity; and follow God with earneſt Supplications. Many men are ſtriving earneſtly for the World, they are Working, they are Riding, they are Plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they are watching Opportunities; why can you not do ſo for your Souls? If men were ſeeking more earneſtly, they
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001584_0034_0FB3D66F902748D0"/>would have more Succeſs. Matth. 11.12. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</hi>
