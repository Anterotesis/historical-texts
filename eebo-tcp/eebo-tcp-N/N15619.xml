         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>IMPROVEMENT in Elocution, for a ſelect number of ſtudents, at a public ſchool, was one principal deſign of the author, when he began the following piece.—How far he ſucceeded in that deſign, muſt be left to thoſe who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the circumſtances to judge—And how far he may now ſucceed in gaining the approbation of the public, time muſt determine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doubtleſs, thoſe who are profeſſed enemies to the Drama, in whatever garb it may appear, if they pay any attention to this, will wholly condemn it;—and perhaps, thoſe who are friendly to performances of the kind, and judges of their merit, not without reaſon, will do the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Should the moroſe, uncandid Critic, who ſubſiſts on the faults, and follies of others, be at leiſure, and not think this piece be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath his notice, he may on a ſlight examination, find it a very proper, and ſalutary morſel, juſt to alleviate the cravings of his voracious appetite, till he can meet with ſomething more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial to feed upon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The author's moſt ſanguine hopes, have never led him to expect that this performance would eſcape the attack of the Critic, any other way, than by his ſuppoſing it unworthy his notice, and therefore turning his exertions to ſome other perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of more merit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis allowed that the motives of Theatrical performances, ought, by ſtriking repreſentations, to hold up Virtue, or vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous actions, in a beautiful point of light—and, to repreſent Vice in its moſt odious colours, and vicious actions meeting condign puniſhment:—So far as theſe motives, or the effects of them are inverted, 'tis generally allowed that performances of this kind become detrimental. How far this rule is adherea to in the following pages, muſt be determined by the judgment of thoſe who peruſe them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:019922_0003_0FAD44C306145DB0"/>
               <hi>The ſubject is what every perſon, in the United States, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to years of underſtanding, is well acquainted with; and a ſubject, in which every one, in the time the tranſactions referred to took place, thought themſelves deeply intereſted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It will perhaps be ſaid, that a performance of this kind if ever proper and ſuitable, would have been much more ſo, juſt at the cloſe of the war, when theſe matters were freſh in the minds of all; but that now, there is no propriety in it, ſince other matters muſt neceſſarily have occupied the minds of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; while the former, are almoſt obliterated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This objection, if it be one, was a principal motive which induced the author to publiſh the piece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is well known that the eſtimate we ſet on what we poſſeſs, is in a great meaſure proportion'd to the arduous exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have made uſe of in obtaining it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If a man by a perilous undertaking, and the moſt painful ſtruggles, at the riſque of his life and property, has obtained a valuable prize, ſo long at leaſt, as the danger to which he was expoſed, and the earneſt efforts he made in the acquiſition are freſh in his memory, we may be ſure he will carefully preſerve and defend it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ought we not to eſteem moſt ſacredly, that freedom and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence ſecur'd to us by the late important revolution?—Ought we ever to forget thoſe arduous, thoſe bloody ſtruggles we endured in that dangerous conteſt?—a conteſt in which thouſands of our dear friends yielded up their lives on the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine plains. And ſhall we, who are enjoying the bleſſings for which they fought 'till their laſt breath, forget to celebrate thoſe tranſactions?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ought we not, on the other hand, ever to bear them on our minds, and endeavour to impreſs on the minds of the riſing generation, the ineſtimable value of the liberties they poſſeſs, and the dangerous ſtruggles their predeceſſors endured to ſecure to them thoſe invaluable bleſſings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe conſiderations, with that of the improvement of youth
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:019922_0004_0FAD44C444B82CF8"/>
in Elocution, firſt induced the author to chooſe this ſubject, and have now induced him to preſent this little performance to the public.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He is ſenſible that he has not purſued the common mode of procedure in Theatrical performances—nor was that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention:—'Tis hoped however, that the candid will over-look many imperfections, when they conſider the great difficulty of bringing a ſubject ſo copious and extenſive, into the narrow limits neceſſary for a performance of this kind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The real characters here repreſented under fictitious names, are left for the readers to apply.—Many important tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions during the war, are wholly omitted, and only ſome, and thoſe very few of the moſt important, juſt glanced at:—Had this not been the caſe, the piece would have ſwelled far beyond the ſize of a common pamphlet,—which was not intended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To conclude this preface, already much too long;—the piece, ſome what ſingular of its kind, and doubtleſs containing many inaccuracies, is now, with a ſolicitation of candour, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the public, by one who will ever eſteem it his duty, and higheſt happineſs to promote the welfare of his country.</hi>
