            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE SHEPHERD OF SALISBURY PLAIN</head>
                  <head type="sub">PART I.</head>
                  <p>MR. JOHNSON, a very worthy charitable gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, was travelling ſome time ago acroſs one of thoſe vaſt plains which are well known in Wiltſhire. It was a fine ſummer's evening, and he rode ſlowly that he might have leiſure to admire God in the works of his creation; for this gentleman was of opinion, that a walk or a ride was as proper a time as any to think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout good things, for which reaſon, on ſuch occaſions, he ſeldom thought ſo much about his money, or his trade, or public news, as at other times, that he might with more eaſe and ſatisfaction enjoy the pious thoughts which the viſible works of the great Maker of heaven and earth are intended to raiſe in the mind.</p>
                  <p>His attention was all of a ſudden called off by the barking of a ſhepherd's dog, and looking up he ſpied one of thoſe little huts, which are here and there to be ſeen on theſe great Downs; and near it was the ſhepherd himſelf buſily employed with his dog in collecting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his vaſt flock of ſheep. As he drew nearer he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him to be a clean, well looking, poor man, near fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty years of age. His coat, though at firſt it had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably been of one dark colour, had been in along courſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſo often patched with different ſorts of clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:035296_0003_1001BF872A9C5EF8"/>that it was now become hard to ſay which had been the orginal colour. But this, while it gave a plain proof of the ſhepherd's poverty, equally proved the exceeding neatneſs, induſtry and good management of his wife.— His ſtockings no leſs proved her good houſe wifery, for they were entirely covered with darns of different co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured worſted, but had not a hole in them; and his ſhirt, though nearly as coarſe as the ſails of a ſhip, was as white as the drifted ſnow, and nearly mended where time had either made a rent, or worn it thin. This is a rule of judging, by which one ſhall ſeldom be deceived. If I meet with a laborer hedging, ditching, or mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the highways with his ſtockings and ſhirt tight and whole, however mean and bad his other garments are, I have ſeldom failed, on viſiting his cottage, to find that alſo clean and well ordered, and his wife notable, and worthy of encouragement. Whereas a poor woman, who will be lying a-bed, or goſſipping with her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, when ſhe ought to be fitting out her huſband in a cleanly manner, will ſeldom be found to be very good in other reſpects.</p>
                  <p>This was not the caſe with our ſhepherd; and Mr. Johnſon was not more ſtruck with the decency of his mean and frugal dreſs, than with his open honeſt counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which bore ſtrong marks of health, cheerfulneſs, and ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Johnſon, who was on a journey, and ſomewhat fearful from the appearance of the ſky, that rain was at no great diſtance, accoſted the ſhepherd with aſking what ſort of weather he thought it would be on the morrow.—"It will be ſuch weather as pleaſes me," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the ſhepherd. Though the anſwer was delivered in the mildeſt and civileſt tone that could be imagined, the gentleman thought the words themſelves rather rude and ſurly, and aſked him how that could be, "Becauſe," replied the ſhepherd "it will be ſuch weather as ſhall pleaſe God, and whatever pleaſes hun always pleaſes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ic."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="unknown:035296_0004_1001BF8E4FD9FBC0"/>
Mr. Johnſon, who delighted in good men and good things, was very well ſatisfied with his reply: for he juſtly thought, that though an hypocrite may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to appear better than he really is to a ſtranger; and that no one ſhould be too ſoon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>alted, merely for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few good words in his mouth; yet as he knew that "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh," he always accuſtomed himſelf to judge fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorably of thoſe who had a ſerious deportment and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid manner of ſpeaking. "It looks as if it proceeded from a good habit," ſaid he, "and though I may now and then be deceived by it, yet it has not often happened to me to be ſo. Whereas, if a man accoſts me with an idle, diſſolute, vurgar, indecent, or profane expreſſion, I have never been deceived in him, but have generally, on enquiry, found his character to be as bad as his language gave me room to expect."</p>
                  <p>He entered into converſation with the ſhepherd in the following manner. Yours is a troubleſome life, hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt friend, ſaid he. To be ſure, ſir, replied the ſhepherd, it is not a very lazy life; but it is not near ſo toilſome as that which my GREAT MASTER led for my ſake, and he had every ſtate and condition of life at his c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>ce, and choſe a hard one, while I only ſubmit to the lot that is appointed me. You are expoſed to great cold and near, ſaid the gentleman; true, ſir, ſaid the ſhepherd; but then I am not expoſed to great temptations; and ſo throwing one thing againſt another, God is pleaſed to contrive to make things more equal than we poor, ignorant, ſhort-ſighted creatures are apt to think. David was happier when he kept his father's ſheep on ſuch a plain as this, and ſinging ſome of his own pſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>You think then, ſaid the gentleman, that a laborious life is a happy one. I do, ſir, and more ſo eſpecially, as it expoſes a man to fewer ſins. If King Saul had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a poor laborious man to the end of his days, he might have lived happy and honeſt, and died a natural death in his bed at laſt, which you know, ſir, was more than he did. But I ſpeak with reverence, for it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence over-rul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> all that, you know, ſir, and I do not preſume to make compariſons. Beſides, ſir, my employment has been particularly honored—Moſes was a ſhepherd in the plains of Midian. It was to "ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds keeping then flocks by night," that the angels appeared in Bethlehem, to tell the beſt news, the glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt tidings, that ever were revealed to poor ſinful men: often, and often has the thought warmed my poor heart in the coldeſt night, and filled me with more joy and thankfulneſs than the beſt ſupper could have done.</p>
                  <p>Here the ſhepherd ſtopped, for he began to feel that he had made too free, and had talked too long. But Mr. Johnſon was ſo well pleaſed with what he ſaid, and with the cheerful contented manner in which he ſaid it, that he deſired him to go on freely, for that it was a pleaſure to him to meet with a plain man, who, without any kind of learning but what he had got from the Bible, was able to talk ſo well on a ſubject in which all men, high and low, rich and poor, are equally concerned.</p>
                  <p>Indeed I am afraid I make too bold, ſir, for it better becomes me to liſten to ſuch a gentleman as you ſeem to be, than to talk in my poor way; but as I was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſir, I wonder all working men do not derive as great joy and delight as I do from thinking how God has honored po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

I believe there is no day for the laſt thirty years, that I have not peeped at my Bible. If we can't find time to read a chapter, I defy any man to ſay he can't find time to read a verſe; and a ſingle text, ſir, well followed and put in practice every day, would make no bad figure at the year's end; three hundred and ſixty-five texts, without the loſs of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's time, would make a pretty ſtock, a little golden treaſury, as one may ſay, from new-year's day to new-year's day; and if children were brought up to it, they would look for their text as naturally as they do for their breakfaſt. No laboring man, it is true, has ſo much leiſure as a ſhepherd, for while the flock is feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I am obliged to be ſtill, and at ſuch times I can now and then tap a ſhoe for my children or myſelf, which is a great ſaving to us, and while I am doing that I repeat a bit of a chapter, which makes the time paſs pleaſantly in this wild ſolitary place. I can ſay the beſt part of the Bible by heart, I believe I ſhould not ſay the beſt part, for every part is good, but I mean the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>You have had great difficulties then? ſaid Mr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Why, as to that, ſir, not more than neighbors fare, I have but little cauſe to complain, and much to be thankful, but I have had ſome little ſtruggles, as I will leave you to judge.—I have a wife and eight children,

O no, ſir, replied the ſhepherd ſmiling, we have ſeldom ſmoke in the evening, for we have little to cook, and firing is very dear in theſe parts. It is that cottage which you ſee on the left hand of the church, near that little tuft of hawthorns. What, that hovel with only one room above and one below, with ſcarcely any chimney, how is it poſſible you can live there with ſuch a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly! O! it is very poſſible and very certain too, cried the ſhepherd. How many better men have been worſe lodged! how many good chriſtians have periſhed in priſons and dungeons, in compariſon of which my cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is a pal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

My poor wife is a very ſickly woman, or we ſhould always have done tolerably well. There are no gentry in the pariſh, ſo that ſhe has not met with any great aſſiſtance in her ſickneſs. The good curate of the pariſh, who lives in that pretty par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage in the valley, is very willing, but not very able to aſſiſt us on theſe trying occaſions, for he has little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for himſelf and a large family into the bargain.

Only! ſaid the gentleman, that is a heavy burden. Not at all; God fits the back to it.—Tho' my wife is not able to do any out of door work, yet ſhe breeds up our children to ſuch habits of induſtry that our little maids, before they are ſix years old can firſt get a halfpenny, and then a penny a-day by knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. The boys who are too little to do hard work, get a trifle by keeping the birds off the corn; for this the farmers will give them a penny or twopence, and now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So you ſee, ſir, I am not ſo badly off as many are; nay, it it were not that it coſts me ſo much in 'Peteca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's ſtuff for my poor wife, I ſhould reckon myſelf well off.

Mr. Johnſon was much ſtruck with her ſimplicity, but puzzled to know what was the occation of this great joy. On looking at her he perceived a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of coarſe wool, ſome of which had found its way through the holes of her clean, but ſcanty and ragged wooll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035296_0009_1001BFA7E9AD8670"/>day indeed, Molly, but don't you ſee the gentleman? Molly, now made a curtſey down to the very ground; while Mr. Johnſon equired into the cauſe of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſatisfaction which both father and daughter had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, at the unuſual good fortune of the day.</p>
                  <p>Sir, ſaid the ſhepherd, poverty is a great ſharpener of wits.—My wife and I cannot endure to ſee our children (poor as they are) without ſhoes and ſtockings, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on account of the pinching cold which cramps their poor little limbs, but becauſe it degrades and debaſes them; and poor people, who have but little regard to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, will ſeldom be found to have any great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for honeſty and goodneſs; I don't ſay this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the caſe, but I am ſure it is ſo too often. Now ſhoes and ſtockings being very dear, we could never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to get them without a little contrivance. I muſt ſhew you how I manage about the ſhoes, when you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to call at our cottage, ſir; as to ſtockings, this is one way we take to help get them. My young ones who are too little to do much work, ſometimes wander at odd hours over the hills for the chance of finding what little wool the ſheep may drop when they rub them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as they are apt to do, in the buſhes<note n="*" place="bottom">This piece of frugal induſtry is not imaginary, but a real fact, as is the character of the ſhepherd, and his uncommon knowledge of the ſcriptures.</note> Theſe ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered bits of wool the children pick out of the brambles, which, I ſee, have torn ſad holes in Molly's apron to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; they carry this wool home, and when they have got a pretty parcel together, their mother cards it; for ſhe can ſit and card in the chimney corner, when ſhe is not able to waſh, or work about houſe. The biggeſt, girl then ſpins it; it does very well for us, without dye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for poor people muſt not ſtand for the colour of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035296_0010_1001BFACE0960698"/>their ſtockings. After this our little boys knit it for themſelves, while they are employed in keeping crows in the fields, and after they get home at night. As for the knitting the girls and their mother do, that is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſale, which helps to pay our rent.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Johnſon lifted up his eyes in ſilent aſtoniſhment at the ſhifts which honeſt poverty can make rather than beg or ſteal, and was ſurpriſed to think how many ways of ſubſiſting there are which thoſe who live at their eaſe little ſuſpect. He ſecretly reſolved to be more attentive to his own petty expenſes than he had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been, and to be more watchful that nothing was waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his family.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the ſhepherd. Mr. Johnſon told him, that as he muſt needs be at his friend's houſe, who lived many miles off, that night, he could not, as he wiſhed to do, make a viſit to his cottage at preſent.—But I will certainly do it, ſaid he, on my return, for I long to ſee your w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> and her nice little family, and to be an eye-witneſs of her neatneſs and good manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The poor man's tears ſtarted into his eyes on hearing the commendation beſtowed on his wife; and wiping them off with the ſleeve of his coat, for he was not worth a handkerchief in the world, he ſaid—Oh! ſir, you juſt now, I am afraid, called me an humble man, but indeed I am a very proud one. Proud! exclaimed Mr. Johnſon, I hope not—Pride is a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                     </gap> ſin, and as the poor are liable to it as well as the rich, ſo good a man as you ſeem to be, ought to guard againſt it, Sir, ſaid he, you are right but I am not proud of myſelf, God knows, I have nothing to be proud of. I am a poor ſinner, but, indeed, ſir, I am proud of my wife:—She is not only the moſt tidy, notable woman on the Plain, but ſhe is the kindeſt wife and mother, and the moſt contented, thankful chriſtian that I know. Laſt year I thought I ſhould have loſt her in a violent fit of the rheumatiſm, caught by going to work too ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035296_0011_1001BFAF32171308"/>her lying in, I fear; for it is but a bleak coldiſh place, as you may ſee, ſir, in winter, and ſometimes the ſnow lies ſo long under the hill, that I can hardly make myſelf a path to get out and buy a few neceſſaries in the next village; and we are afraid to ſend out the children, for fear they ſhould be loſt when the ſnow is deep. So, as I was ſaying, the poor ſoul was very bad indeed, and for ſeveral weeks loſt the uſe of all her limbs except her hands: a merciful Providence ſpared her the uſe of theſe, ſo that when ſhe could not turn in her bed, ſhe could contrive to patch a rag or two for her family. She was always ſaying, had it not been for the great goodneſs of God, ſhe might have had the palſy inſtead of the rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm, and then ſhe could have done nothing—but nobody had ſo many mercies as ſhe had.</p>
                  <p>I will not tell you what we ſuffered during that bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter weather, ſir, but my wife's faith and patience dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that trying time, were as good a leſſon to me as any ſermon I could hear, and yet Mr. Jenkins gave us very comfortable ones too, that helped to keep up my ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>One Sunday afternoon, when my wife was at the worſt, as I was coming out of church, for I went one part of the day, and my eldeſt daughter the other, ſo my poor wife was never left alone. As I was coming out of church, I ſay, Mr. Jenkins, the miniſter, called out to me, and aſked me how my wife did, ſaying, he had been kept from coming to ſee her by the deep fall of ſnow, and, indeed, from the parſonage-houſe to my hovel it was quite impaſſable. I gave him all the particulars he aſked, and, I am afraid, a good many more, for my heart was quite full. He kindly gave me a ſhilling, and ſaid, he would certainly try to pick out his way and come and ſee her in a day or two.</p>
                  <p>While he was talking to me, a plain farmer-looking gentleman in boots, who ſtood by, liſtening to all I ſaid, but ſeemed to take no notice. It was Mr. Jenkins's wife's father, who was come to paſs the Chriſtmas ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidays
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035296_0012_1001BFB44849F6A8"/>at the parſonage houſe. I had always heard him ſpoken of as a plain frugal man, who lived cloſe himſelf, but was remarked to give away more than any of his ſhow-away neighbors.</p>
                  <p>Well! I went home with great ſpirits at this ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and unexpected ſupply; for we had tapped our laſt ſixpence, and there was little work to be had on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the weather. I told my wife I was not come back empty-handed. No, I dare ſay not, ſays ſhe, you have been ſerving a maſter "who filleth the hungry with good things, though he ſendeth the rich empty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way." True, Mary, ſays I; we ſeldom fail to get good ſpiritual food from Mr. Jenkins, but to-day he has kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupplied our bodily wants. She was more thankful when I ſhowed her the ſhilling, than, I dare ſay, ſome of your great people are when they get a hundred pounds.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Johnſon's heart ſmote him when he heard ſuch a value ſet upon a ſhilling; ſurely, ſaid he to himſelf, I will never waſte another; but he ſaid nothing to die ſhepherd, who thus purſued his ſtory.</p>
                  <p>Next morning before I went out, I ſent part of the money to buy a little ale and brown ſugar to put into her water-gruel, which you know, ſir, made it nice and nouriſhing. I went out to cleave wood in a farm-yard, for there was no ſtanding out on the plain, after ſuch a ſnow as had fallen in the night. I went with a lighter heart than uſual, becauſe I had l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

When I came back at night, my wife fell a crying as ſoon as ſhe ſaw me. This I own I thought but a bad return for the bleſſings ſhe had ſo lately received, and ſo I told her. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſaid ſhe, it is too much, we are too rich, I am now frightened, not leſt we ſhould have no portion in this world, but for fear we ſhould have our whole portion in it. Look here,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035296_0013_1001A30610126528"/>John! So ſaying ſhe uncovered the bed whereon ſhe lay, and ſhewed two warm, thick, new blankets. I could not believe my own eyes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> becauſe when I went out in the morning, I had left her with no other covering than our little old thin blue rug. I was ſtill more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed when ſhe put half a crown into my hand, telling me ſhe had had a viſit from Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Jones, the latter of whom had beſtowed all theſe good things upon us. Thus, ſir, have our lives been crowned with mercies. My wife got about again, and I do believe, under Providence, it was owing to theſe comforts; for the rheumatiſm, ſir, without blankets by night and flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel by day, is but a baddiſh job, eſpecially to people who have little or no fire. She will always be a weakly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but, thank God, her ſoul proſpers, and is in health. But I beg your pardon, ſir, for talking on at this rate.—Not at all, not at all, ſaid Mr. Johnſon, I am much pleaſed with your ſtory, you ſhall certainly ſee me in a few days. Good night. So ſaying, he ſlipped a crown into his hand and rode off. Surely, ſaid the ſhepherd, <hi>goodneſs and mercy have followed me all the days of my life,</hi> as he gave the money to his wife when he got home at night.</p>
                  <p>As to Mr. Johnſon he found abundant matter for his thoughts during the reſt of his journey. On the whole he was more diſpoſed to envy than to pity the ſhepherd. I have ſeldom ſeen, ſaid he, ſo happy a man. It is a ſort of happineſs which the world could not give, and which, I plainly ſee, it has not been able to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. This muſt be the true ſpirit of religion. I ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>THE SHEPHERD OF SALISBURY PLAIN.</head>
                  <head type="sub">PART II.</head>
                  <p>I AM willing to hope that my readers will not be ſorry to hear ſome farther particulars of their old acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance <hi>the Shepherd of Saliſbury Plain.</hi> They will call to mind that at the end of the firſt part, he was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home full of gratitude for the favors he had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Mr. Johnſon, whom we left purſuing his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, after having promiſed to make a viſit to the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd's cottage.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Johnſon, after having paſſed ſome time with his friends, ſat out on his return to Saliſbury, and on the Saturday evening reached a very ſmall inn, a mile or two diſtant from the ſhepherd's village; for he never travelled on a Sunday. He went the next morning to the church neareſt the houſe, where he had paſſed the night; and after taking ſuch refreſhment as he could g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t at that houſe, he walked on to find out the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd's cottage. His reaſon for viſiting him on a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day was chiefly, becauſe he ſuppoſed it to be the only day which the ſhepherd's employment allowed him to paſs at home with his family, and as Mr. Johnſon had been ſtruck with his talk, he thought it would be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unpleaſant nor unprofitable to obſerve how a man, who carried ſuch an appearance of piety, ſpent his Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; for though he was ſo low in the world, this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035296_0016_1001BFD20FA45948"/>was not above entering very cloſely into his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, of which he thought he ſhould be able to form a better judgment, by ſeeing whether his practice at home kept pace with his profeſſions abroad: for it is not ſo much by obſerving how people talk, as how they live, that we ought to judge of their characters.</p>
                  <p>After a pleaſant walk Mr. Johnſon got within ſight of the cottage, to which he was directed by the clump of hawthorns and the broken chimney. He wiſhed to take the family by ſurpriſe; and walking gently up to the houſe he ſtood awhile to liſten. The door being half open, he ſaw the ſhepherd, (who looked ſo reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in his Sunday coat, that he ſhould hardly have known him) his wife, and their numerous young fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, draw round their little table, which was covered with a clean though very coarſe cloth. There ſtood on it a large diſh of potatoes, a brown pitcher, and a piece of coarſe loaf. The wife and children ſtood in ſilent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, while the ſhepherd, with uplifted hands and eyes, devoutly begged the bleſſing of heaven on their homely fare. Mr. Johnſon could not help ſighing to reflect, that he had ſometimes ſeen better dinners eaten with leſs appearance of thankfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>The ſhepherd and his wife then ſat down with great ſeeming cheerfulneſs, but the children ſtood; and while the mother was helping them, little freſh-coloured Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who had picked the wool from the buſhes with ſo much delight, cried out, "Father, I wiſh I was big e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſay grace, I am ſure I ſhould ſay it very heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily to-day, for I was thinking what muſt <hi>poor</hi> people do who have no ſalt to their potatoes, and do but look our diſh is quite full."—"This is the true way of thinking, Molly," ſaid the father, "in whatever concerns bodily wants, and bodily comforts, it is our duty to compare our own lot with the lot of thoſe who are worſe off, and this will keep us thankful. On the other hand, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we are tempted to ſet up our own wiſdom or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035296_0017_1001BFD676BFBF40"/>we muſt compare ourſelves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>ble." Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was now ſo hungry, and found the potatoes ſo good, that ſhe had no time to make any more remarks; but was devouring her dinner very heartily, when the bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the great dog drew her attention from her tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher to the door, and ſpying the ſtranger, ſhe cried out, "Look father, ſee here, if yonder is not the good gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman!" Mr. Johnſon finding himſelf diſcovered, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately walked in, and was heartily welcomed by the honeſt ſhepherd, who told his wife that this was the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to whom they were ſo much obliged.</p>
                  <p>The good woman began, as ſome very neat people are rather too apt to do, with making many apologies that her houſe was not cleaner, and that things was not in fitter order to receive ſuch a gentleman. Mr. Johnſon, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, on looking round, could diſcover nothing but the moſt perfect neatneſs. The trenchers on which they were eating were almoſt as white as their linen; and, notwithſtanding the number and ſmallneſs of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, there was not the leaſt appearance of dirt or litter. The furniture was very ſimple and poor, hardly indeed amounting to bare neceſſaries. It conſiſted of four brown wooden chairs, which, by conſtant rubbing, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as bright as a looking-glaſs; an iron pot and ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; a poor old grate which ſcarcely held a handful of coals, and out of which the little fire that had been in it appeared to have been taken, as ſoon as it had anſwered the end for which it had been lighted, that of boiling their potatoes. Over the chimney ſtood an old faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed broad bright candleſtick, and a ſtill brighter ſpit; it was pretty clear that this laſt was kept rather for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than uſe. An old carved elbow chair, and a cheſt of the ſame date, which ſtood in the corner, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the moſt valuable part of the ſhepherd's goods, having been in his family for three generations. But all theſe were lightly eſteemed by him, in compariſon of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035296_0018_1001BFDA9175C9A0"/>poſſeſſion, which added to the above, made up the whole of what he had inherited from his father; and which laſt he would not have parted with, if no other could have been had, for a king's ranſom: this was a large old Bible, which lay on the wind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>After the firſt ſalutations were over, Mr. Johnſon ſaid, that if they would go on quietly with their dinner he would ſit down. Though a good deal aſhamed, they thought it more reſpectful to obey the gentleman, who having caſt his eye on their ſlender provitions, gently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baked the ſhepherd for not having indulged himſelf, as it was Sunday, with a morſel of bacon to reliſh his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatoes. The ſhepherd ſaid nothing, but poor Mary co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured and hung down her head, ſaying, "indeed, ſir, it is not my fault, I did beg my huſband to allow himſelf a bit of meat to-day out of your honor's bounty; but he was too good to do it, and it is all for my ſake."—The ſhepherd ſeemed unwilling to come to an explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but Mr. Johnſon deſired Mary to go on. So ſhe continued, "you muſt know, ſir, that both of us, next to a ſin, dread a debt, and indeed, in ſome caſes, a debt is a ſin; but with all our care and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ins we have never been able quite to pay off the doctor's bill, for that bad fit of the rheumatiſm which I had laſt winter. Now when you were pleaſed to give my huſband that kind preſent the other day, I heartily deſired him to buy a bit of meat for Sunday, as I ſaid before, that he might have a little ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſhment for himſelf out of your kindneſs.—But anſwered he, Mary, it is never out of my mind long together that we ſtill owe a few ſhillings to the doctor,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035296_0019_1001BFDC173E8FC0"/>(and thank God it is all we did owe in the world.)—Now if I carry him this money directly, it will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew him our honeſty and our good will, but it will be an encouragement to him to come to you another time in caſe you ſhould be taken once more in ſuch a bad ſit; for I muſt own, added my poor huſband, that the thought of your being ſo terribly ill without any help, is the only misfortune that I want courage to face."</p>
                  <p>Here the grateful woman's tears ran down ſo faſt that ſhe could not go on. She wiped them with the corner of her apron, and humbly begged pardon for making ſo free. "Indeed, ſir," ſaid the ſhepherd, "tho' my wife is full as unwilling to be in debt as myſelf, yet I could hardly prevail on her to conſent to my paying this money juſt then, becauſe, ſhe ſaid, it was hard I ſhould not have a taſte of the gentleman's bounty my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But for once, ſir, I would have my own way.—For you muſt know, as I paſs beſt part of my time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, tending my ſheep, 'tis a great point with me, ſir, to get comfortable matter for my own thoughts; ſo that 'tis rather ſelf-intereſt in me to allow myſelf no pleaſures and no practices that won't bear thinking on over and over. For when one is a good deal alone, you know ſir, all one's bad deeds do ſo ruſh in upon one, as I may ſay, and ſo torment one, that there is no true comfort to be had but in keeping clear of wrong doings, and falſe pleaſures; and that I ſuppoſe may be one reaſon why ſo many folks hate to ſtay a bit by themſelves. But as I was ſaying, when I came to think the matter over on the hill yonder, ſaid I to myſelf, a good dinner is a good thing I grant, and yet it will be but cold comfort to me a week after, to be able to ſay—to be ſure I had a nice ſhoulder of mutton laſt Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day for dinner, thanks to the good gentleman, but then I am in debt—I <hi>had</hi> a rare dinner, that's certain, but the pleaſure of that has long been over, and the debt ſtill remains—I have ſpent the crown, and now if my poor wife ſhould be taken in one of thoſe fits again, die
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035296_0020_1001BFE34691B788"/>ſhe muſt, unleſs God work a miracle to prevent it, for I can get no help for her. This thought ſettled all; and I ſet off directly and paid the crown to the doctor with as mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if I was contented at the time, think how much more happy I have been at the remembrance! O ſir, there are no pleaſures worth the name but ſuch as bring no plague or penitence after them."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Johnſon was ſatisfied with the ſhepherd's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and agreed, that though a good dinner was not to be deſpiſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>et it was not worthy to be compared with <hi>a contented mind, which</hi> (as the Bible truly ſays) <hi>is a continual feaſt."</hi> "But come," ſaid the good gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, "what have we got in this brown mug?"—"As good water," ſaid the ſhepherd, "as any in the king's dominions. I have heard of countries beyond ſea in which there is no wholeſome water; nay, I have been myſelf in a great town not far off where they are obliged to buy all the water they get, while a good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſends to my very door a ſpring as clear and fine as Jacob's well. When I am tempted to repine that I have often no other drink, I call to mind, that it was nothing better than a cup of cold water which the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Samaria drew for the greateſt gueſt that ever vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited this world."</p>
                  <p>"Very well," replied Mr. Johnſon; "but as your honeſty has made you prefer a poor meal to being in debt, I will at leaſt ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So ſaying he looked full at the boy, who did not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to ſtir; but caſt an eye at his father to know what he was to do. "Sir," ſaid the ſhepherd, "I hope we ſhall not appear ungrateful if we ſeem to refuſe your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

But, good ſir, it is Sunday, and ſhould any of my family be ſeen at a public houſe on a Sabbath-day, it would be a much greater grief to me than to drink water all my life. I am often talking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe doings to others, and if I ſhould ſay one thing and do another, you can't think what an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage it would give many of my neighbors over me, who would be glad enough to report that they caught the ſhepherd's ſon at the ale-houſe, without explaining how it happened. Chriſtians, you know, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>"Are you not a little too cautious, my honeſt friend?" ſaid Mr. Johnſon. "I humbly aſk your pardon, ſir," replied the ſhepherd, "if I think that is impoſſible. In my poor notion I no more underſtand how a man can be too cautious, than how he can be too ſtrong, or too healthy."</p>
                  <p>"You are right, indeed," ſaid Mr. Johnſon, "as a general principle, but this ſtruck me as a very ſmall thing." "Sir," ſaid the ſhepherd, "I am afraid you will think me very bold, but you encourage me to ſpeak out." "'Tis what I wiſh," ſaid the gentleman.—"Then, ſir," reſumed the ſhepherd, "I doubt if, where there is a temptation to do wrong, any thing can be called ſmall; that is, in ſhort, if there is any ſuch thing as a ſmall wilful ſin. A poor man, like me, is ſeldom called out to do great things, ſo that it is not by a few great deeds his character can be judged by his neighbors, but by the little round of daily cuſtoms he allows himſelf in."—While they were thus talking, the children, who had ſtood very quietly behind, and had not ſtirred a foot, now began to ſcamper about all at once, and in a moment r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n to the window-ſeat to pick up their little old hats. Mr. Johnſon looked ſurprized at this diſturbance; the ſhepherd aſked his pardon, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

He had always taught them to think that nothing was more indecent than to get into church after it was begun; for as the ſervice opened with an exhortation to repentance, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſin, it looked very preſumptuous not to be ready to join in it—it looked as if people did not feel themſelves to be ſinners. And though ſuch as lived at a great diſtan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Mary and her children ſet forward. Mr. Johnſon and the ſhepherd followed, taking care to talk the whole way on ſuch ſubjects as might fit them for the ſolemn duties of the place to which they were going. "I have often been ſorry to obſerve," ſaid Mr. Johnſon, "that many who are reckoned decent, good kind of people, and who would on no account neglect going to church, yet ſeem to care but little in what frame or temper of mind they go thither. They will talk of their worldly concerns till they get within the door, and then take them up again the very minute the ſermon is over, which makes me ready to fear they lay too much ſtreſs on the mere form of going to a place of worſhip. Now, for my part, I always find that it requires a little time to bring my mind into a ſtate fit to do any <hi>common</hi> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs well, much more this great and moſt neceſſary buſineſs of all."

                  <p>After ſervice, Mr. Jenkins, the clergyman, who was well acquanted with the character of Mr. Johnſon, and had a great reſpect for him, accoſted him with much ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility; expreſſing his concern that he could not enjoy juſt now ſo much of his converſation as he wiſhed, as he was obliged to viſit a perſon at a diſtance, but hoped to have a little talk with him before he left the village.—As they walked along together, Mr. Johnſon made ſuch enquiries about the ſhepherd, as ſerved to confirm him in the high opinion he entertained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The ſhepherd, who took it for granted that Mr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was gone to the parſonage, walked home with his wife and children, and was begining in his uſual way to catechiſe and inſtruct his family, when Mr. Johnſon came in, and inſiſted that the ſhepherd ſhould go on with his inſtructions, juſt as if he were not there.—This gentleman, who was very deſirous of being uſeful to his own ſervants and workmen in the way of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious inſtruction, was ſometimes ſorry to find that tho' he took a good deal of pains, they did not now and then quite underſtand him, for though his meaning was very good, the language was not always very plain; and though the <hi>things</hi> he ſaid were not hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, yet the <hi>words</hi> were, eſpecially to ſuch as were very ignorant. And he now began to find out, that if people were ever ſo wiſe and good, yet if they had not a ſimple, agreeable, and familiar way of expreſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſome of their plain hearers would not be much the better for them. For this reaſon he was not above li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035296_0024_1001BFF7674E2DF8"/>learning, and could teach him many things, yet he was not too proud to learn even of ſo poor a man, in any point where he thought the ſhepherd might have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of him.</p>
                  <p>This gentleman was much pleaſed with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and piety he diſcovered in the anſwers of the children; and deſired the ſhepherd to tell him how he contrived to keep a ſenſe of divine things in his own mind and in that of his family with ſo little leiſure and ſo little reading. "O as to that, ſir," ſaid the ſhepherd, "we do not read much except in one book to be ſure; but by hearty prayer for God's bleſſing on the uſe of that book, what little knowledge is needful ſeems to come of courſe, as it were. And my chief ſtudy has been to bring the fruits of the Sunday reading into the week's buſineſs, and to keep up the ſame ſenſe of God in the heart, when the bible is in the cupboard as when it is in the hand. In ſhort to apply what I read in the book, to what I meet with in the field."</p>
                  <p>"I don't quite underſtand you," ſaid Mr. Johnſon, "Sir," replied the ſhepherd, "I have but a poor gift at conveying theſe things to others, though I have much comfort from them in my own mind; but I am ſure that the moſt ignorant and hard working people, who are in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>"You are happy," ſaid Mr. Johnſon, "in this reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red life by which you eſcape the corruptions of the world." "Sir," ſaid the ſhepherd, "I do not eſcape the corruptions of my own evil nature. Even there on that wild ſolitary hill, I can find out that my heart is prone to evil thoughts. I ſuppoſe, ſir, that different ſtates have different temptations. You great folks that live in the world, perhaps are expoſed to ſome, of which ſuch a poor man as I am, know nothing. But to one who leads a lonely life like me, evil thoughts are a chief beſetting ſin; and I can no more withſtand theſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the grace of God, than a rich gentleman can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſnares of evil company, without the ſame grace. And I feel that I ſtand in need of God's help continually, and if he ſhould give me up to my own evil heart I ſhould be loſt."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Johnſon approved of the ſhepherd's ſincerity, for he had always obſerved that where there was no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and no watchfulneſs againſt ſin, there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and he ſaid that the man who did not feel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a ſinner in his opinion, could not be a chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</p>

Juſt as they were in this part of their diſcourſe, Mr. Jenkins, the clergyman came in. After the uſual ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, he ſaid, "Well Shepherd, I wiſh you joy; I know you will be ſorry to gain any advantage by the death of a neighbor; but old Wilſon my clerk, was ſo infirm, and I truſt ſo well prepared, that there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be ſorry for his death. I have been to pray by him, but he died while I ſtaid. I have always intended you ſhould ſucceed to his place; 'tis no great matter, but every little is ſomething."</p>
                  <p>"No great matter, ſir," cried the ſhepherd, "in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is a great thing to me; it will more than pay my rent. Bleſſed be God for all his goodneſs." Mary ſaid nothing, but lifted up her eyes full of tears in ſilent gratitude.</p>
                  <p>"I am glad of this little circumſtance," ſaid Mr. Jenkins, "not only for your ſake, but for the ſake of the office itſelf. I ſo heartily reverence every religious inſtitution, that I would never have even the <hi>Amen</hi> added to the excellent prayers of our church, by vain or profane lips, and if it depended on me, there ſhould be no ſuch thing in the land as an idle, drunken, or irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious pariſh clerk. Sorry I am to ſay, that this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not always ſufficiently attended to, and that I know ſome of a very different character."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Johnſon now inquired of the clergyman, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were many children in the pariſh. "More than you would expect," replied he "from the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſmallneſs of it, but there are ſome little hamlets which you do not ſee." "I think," returned Mr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, "I recollect that in the converſation I had with the ſhepherd on the hill yonder, he told me you had no Sunday ſchool." "I am ſorry to ſay we have none," ſaid the miniſter; "I do what I can to remedy this misfortune by public chatechiſing; but having two or three churches to ſerve, I cannot give ſo much time as I wiſh to private inſtruction; and having a large fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>"There is an excellent inſtitution in London," ſaid Mr. Johnſon, "called the Sunday-School Society, which kindly gives books and other helps, on the application of ſuch pious miniſters as ſtand in need of their aid, and which I am ſure would have aſſiſted you, but I think we ſhall be able to do ſomething ourſelves.—Shepherd," continued he, "if I was a king, and had it in my power to make you a rich and a great man, with a word ſpeaking, I would not do it. Thoſe who are raiſed by ſome ſudden ſtroke, much above the ſtation in which divine Providence had placed them, ſeldom turn out very good, or very happy. I have never had any great things in my power, but as far as I have been able, I have been always glad to aſſiſt the worthy, I have however never attempted or deſired to ſet any poor man much above his natural condition, but it is a pleaſure to me to lend him ſuch aſſiſtance as may make that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more eaſy to himſelf, and to put him in a way which ſhall call him to the performance of more duties than perhaps he could have performed without my help, and of performing them in a better manner.—What rent do you pay for this cottage?"</p>
                  <p>"Fifty ſhillings a year, ſir.</p>
                  <p>"It is in a ſad tattered condition, is there not a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be had in the village?"</p>
                  <p>"That in which the poor clerk lived," ſaid the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman, "is not only more tight and whole, but has two decent chambers, and a very large light kitchen." "That will be very convenient," replied Mr. Johnſon, "pray what is the rent?" "I think," ſaid the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, "poor neighbor Wilſon gave ſomewhat about four pounds a year, or it might be guineas."—"Very well," ſaid Mr. Johnſon, "and what will the clerk's place be worth, think you?" "About three pounds," was the anſwer.</p>

                     <pb n="29" facs="unknown:035296_0028_1001C00D3595B278"/>
"Now," continued Mr. Johnſon, "my plan is, that the ſhepherd ſhould take that houſe immediately; for as the poor man is dead, there will be no need of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till quarter-day, if I make up the difference."—"True, ſir," ſaid Mr. Jenkins, "and I am ſure my wife's father, whom I expect to-morrow, will willingly aſſiſt a little towards buying ſome of the clerk's old goods; and the ſooner they remove the better, for poor Mary caught that bad rheumatiſm by ſleeping under a leaky thatch." The ſhepherd was too much moved to ſpeak, and Mary could hardly ſob out, "Oh, ſir, you are too good, indeed this houſe will do very well," "It may do very well for you and your children Mary," ſaid Mr. Johnſon, gravely, "but it will not do for a ſchool; the kitchen is neither large nor light enough. Shepherd," continued he, "with your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It will not at all interfere with your weekly calling, and it is the only lawful way in which you could turn the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath into a day of ſome little profit to your family, by doing, as I hope, a great deal of good to the ſouls of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The reſt of the week you will work as uſual.—The difference of rent between this houſe and the clerk's I ſhall pay myſelf, for to put you into a better houſe at your own expenſe would be no great act of kindneſs. As for honeſt Mary, who is not fit for hard labor, or any out-of-door work, I propoſe to endow a ſmall week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſchool, of which ſhe ſhall be the miſtreſs, and employ her notable turn to good account, by teaching ten or a dozen of girls to knit, ſew, ſpin, card, or any other uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way of getting their bread; for all this I ſhall only pay her the uſual price, for I am not going to make you rich but uſeful."</p>
                  <p>"Not rich, ſir?" cried the ſhepherd. "How can I ever be thankful enough for ſuch bleſſings? And will my poor Mary have a dry thatch over her head? And

Here he and Mary looked at each other and burſt into tears. The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſaw their diſtreſs, and kindly walked out upon the little green before the door, that theſe honeſt people might give vent to their feelings. As ſoon as they were alone, they crept into one corner of the room, where they thought they could not be ſeen, and fell on their knees, devoutly bleſſing and praiſing God for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Never were heartier prayers preſented, than this grateful couple offered up for their benefactors. The warmth of their gratitude could only be equalled by the earneſtneſs with which they beſought the bleſſing of God on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>TOM WHITE, was one of the beſt drivers of a poſt-chaiſe on the Bath road.—Tom was the ſon of an honeſt laborer at a little village in Wiltſhire: he was an active induſtrious boy, and as ſoon as he was big enough he left his father, who was burthened with a numerous family, and went to live with Farmer Hod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, a ſober worthy man in the ſame village. He drove the waggon all the week, and on Sundays, though he was now grown up, the farmer required him to attend the Sunday ſchool, carried on under the inſpection of Dr. Shepherd, the worthy vicar, and always made him read his Bible in the evening, after he had ſerved his beaſts, and would have turned him out of his ſervice if he had even gone to the alchouſe for his own pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Tom, by earring ſome waggon-loads of faggots to the Bear Inn at Devizes, ſoon made many acquaintan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the ſtable-yard.

                     </gap>t money, and to ſee the world.—
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035296_0031_1001C01AA4C642C8"/>Fooliſh fellow! he never conſidered, that, though it is true, a waggoner works hard all day, yet he gets a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et evening, and undiſturbed reſt at night. However as there muſt he chaiſe-boys as well as plough-boys, there was no great harm in the change. The evil company to which it expoſed him, was the chief miſchief. He left farmer Hodges though not without ſorrow at quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo kind a maſter, and got himſelf hired at the Black Bear.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the temptations to which he was now expoſed, Tom's good education ſtood by him for ſome time. At firſt he was frightened to hear the oaths and wicked words which are too often uttered in a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-yard. However, though he thought it wrong, he had not the courage to reprove it, and the next ſtop to being eaſy at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>eing others ſin, is to ſin ourſelves. By degrees he began to think it manly, and a mark of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in others to ſwear; though the force of good habit was ſo ſtrong, that at firſt when he ſwore himſelf it was with ſear and in a low voice. But he was ſoon laughed out of his ſheepiſhneſs, as they called it; and though he never became ſo prophane and blaſphemous as ſome of his companions, (for he never ſwore in cool blood or in mirth as ſo many do,) yet he would too often uſe a dreadful bad word when he was in a paſſion with his horſes. And here I cannot but drop a hint on the great folly as well as wickedneſs of being in a great rage with poor beaſts, who not having the gift of reaſon, cannot be moved like human creatures, with all the wicked words that are ſaid to them; but who unhappily ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the gift of feeling, ſuffer as much as human crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures can do, at the cruel and unneceſſary beatings given them. He had been bred up to think that drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was a great ſin, for he never ſaw farmer Hodges drunk in his life, and where a farmer is ſober, his men are leſs likely to drink, or if they do, the maſter can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them with the better grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="unknown:035296_0032_1001C01EC5E8CD58"/>
Tom was not naturally fond of drink, yet for the ſake of being thought merry company, and a hearty fellow, he often drank more than he ought. As he had been uſed to go to church twice on a Sunday whole he lived with the farmer, who ſeldom uſed his horſes on that day except to carry his wife to church behind him, Tom felt a little uneaſy when he was ſent the very firſt Sunday a long journey with a great family; for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceal the truth, that too many gentlefolks will travel when there is no neceſſity for it on a Sunday, and when Monday would anſwer the end juſt as well. This is a great grief to all good and ſober people, both rich and poor. However he kept his thoughts to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though he could not now and then help thinking how quietly things were going on at the farmer's, whoſe waggoner on a Sunday led as eaſy a life as if he had been a gentleman. But he ſoon loſt all thoughts of this kind, and did not know a Sunday from a Monday. Tom went on proſperouſly, as it is called, for three or four years, got plenty of money, but ſaved not a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. As ſoon as his horſes were once in the ſtable, whoever would might ſee them fed for Tom.—He had other fiſh to fry.—Fives, cards, cudgel playing, laying wagers, and keeping looſe company, each of which he at firſt diſliked, and then practiſed, ran away with all his money, and all his ſpare time; and though he was generally in the way as ſoon as the horſes were ready, (becauſe if there was no driving there was no pay,) yet he did not care whether the carriage was clean or the horſes looked well, if the harneſs was whole, or the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were ſhod. The certainty that the gains of to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row would make up for the extravagance of to-day, made him quite thoughtleſs and happy, for he was young, active, and healthy, and never foreſaw that a rainy day might come, when he would want what he now ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered away.</p>

Tom's chaiſe had now got up to that of his rival, and they drove along-ſide of each other with great fury and many imprecations. But, in a narrow part, Tom's chaiſe being in the middle, with his antag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oniſt on one ſide, and a cart driving againſt him on the other, the horſes reared, the carriages got entangled, Tom roared out a great oath to the other to ſtop, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Tom was taken to one of thoſe excellent hoſpitals with which London abounds. His agonies were dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, his leg was ſet, and a high fever came on. As ſoon as he was left alone to reflect on his condition, his firſt thought was that he ſhould die, and his horror was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable.—"Alas!"

Whenever he came to his ſenſes for a few minutes, he cried out, "O that my old companions could now ſee me, ſurely they would take warning by my ſad ſate, and repent before it is too late."</p>
                  <p>By the bleſſing of God, on the ſkill of the ſurgeon, and the care of the nurſes, he however grew better in a few days. And here let me ſtop to remark, what a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it is that we live in a chriſtian country, where the poor, when ſick, or lame, or wounded, are taken as much care of as any gentry; nay, in ſome reſpects, more, becauſe in hoſpitals and infirmaries there are more doctors and ſurgeons to attend, than moſt private gentle-folks can afford to have at their own houſes, whereas <hi>there never was an hoſpital in the whole heathen world.</hi> Bleſſed be God for this, among the thouſand other excellent fruits of the CHRISTIAN RELIGION!</p>
                  <p>It was eight weeks before Tom could be taken out of bed.

He could now pray heartily; he confeſſed and lamented his iniquities with many tears, and began to hope that the mercies of God, through the merits of a Redeemer, might yet be extended to him on his ſincere repentance. He reſolved never more to return to the ſame evil courſes, but he

And how ſhould it be otherwiſe? for he truſted in his own ſtrength, he never prayed to God to ſtrengthen him, nor even avoided the next tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The caſe was now different. Tom began to find that <hi>his ſtrength was perfect weakneſs,</hi> and that he could do nothing without the divine aſſiſtance, for which he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heartily and conſtantly. He ſent home for his Bible, and Prayer-book, which he had not opened for two years, and which had been given him when he left the Sunday ſchool. He ſpent the chief part of his time in reading them, and thus derived great comfort, as well as great knowledge. The ſtudy of the Bible filled his heart with gratitude to God, who had not cut him off in the midſt of his ſins, but given him ſpace for repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and the agonies he had lately ſuffered with his broken leg increaſed his thankfulneſs, that he had eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the more dreadful pain of eternal miſery. And here let the remark what encouragement this is for rich peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to give away Bibles and good books, and not to loſe all hope, though for a time they ſee little or no good effect from it. According to all appearance, Tom's were never likely to do him any good, and yet his generous benefactor, who had caſt his bread upon the waters, found it after many days, for this Bible which had lain untouched for years, was at laſt made the means of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035296_0036_1001C0367507F938"/>hoſpital, Tom began to think he muſt return to get his bread. At firſt he had ſome ſcruples about going back to his old employ; but, ſays he, ſenſibly enough, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlefolks muſt travel, travellers muſt have chaiſes, and chaiſes muſt have drivers; it is a very honeſt calling, and I don't know that goodneſs belongs to one ſort of buſineſs more than another: and he who can be good in a ſtate of great temptation, provided the calling be lawful, and the temptations are not of his own ſeeking, and he be diligent in prayer, may be better than another man for aught I know; and <hi>all that belongs to us is to do our duty in that ſtate of life in which it ſhall pleaſe God to call us.</hi> Tom had rubbed up his catechiſm at the hoſpital, and it is a pity that people don't look at their catechiſm ſometimes when they are grown up; for it is full as good for men and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>Tom now felt grieved that he was obliged to drive on Sundays. But people who are in earneſt, and have their hearts in a thing, can find helps in all caſes. As ſoon as he had ſet down his company at their ſtage, and had ſeen his horſes fed, ſays Tom, "A man who takes care of his horſes will generally think it right to let them reſt an hour or two at leaſt. In every town it is a chance but there may be a church open during part of that time. If the prayers ſhould be over, I'll try hard for the ſermon; and if I dare not ſtay to the ſermon, it is a chance but I may catch the prayers; it is worth trying for, however; and as I uſed to make nothing of making a puſh, for the ſake of getting an hour to gamble, I need not grudge to take a little pains extraordinary to ſerve God.

Tom indeed was very careful in looking after the linch pine, in never giving his horſes too much water when they were hot; nor, whatever was his haſte, would be ever gallop them up hill, ſtrike them acroſs the head, or when tired, cut and ſlaſh them in driving on the ſtones, as ſoon as he got into a town, as ſome fooliſh fellows do.

Well, Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſaid he, and you my faithful Sarah, any other friend might recommend peace and agreement to you on your marriage; but I, on the contrary, recommend cares and ſtrifes.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Dodd's Sayings.</note> The company ſtared—but Sarah, who knew that her old maſter was a facetious gentleman, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had ſome good meaning behind, looked ſerious.— "Cares and ſtrifes, ſir, ſaid the farmer, what do you mean?" I mean, ſaid he, for the firſt, that your cares ſhall be who ſhall pleaſe God moſt, and your ſtrifes, who ſhall ſerve him beſt, and do your duty moſt faithfully. Thus, all your cares and ſtrifes being employed to the higheſt purpoſes, all petty cares and worldly ſtrifes ſhall be at an end,</p>
                  <p>"Always remember, both of you, that you have ſtill a better friend than each other."—The company ſtared again, and thought no woman could have ſo good a friend as nor huſband. "As you have choſen each other from
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035296_0041_1001C0494782D230"/>the beſt motives," continued the doctor, "you have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very reaſonable ground to hope for happineſs; but as this world is a ſoil, in which troubles and misfortunes will ſpring up; troubles from which you cannot ſave one another: then remember, it is the beſt wiſdom to go to that friend who is always near, always willing, and always able to help you, and that friend is God."</p>
                  <p>"Sir," ſaid Farmer White, "I humbly thank you for all your kind inſtructions, of which I ſhall ſtand more in need than ever, as I ſhall have more duties to fulfil. I hope the remembrance of my paſt offences will keep me humble, and the ſenſe of my remaining ſin will keep me watchful. I ſet out in the world, ſir, with what is called a good natural diſpoſition, but I ſoon found, to my coſt, that, without God's grace, that will carry a man but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle way. A good temper is a good thing, but nothing but the fear of God can enable one to bear up againſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, evil company and evil paſſions. The misfortune of breaking my leg, as I then thought it, has proved the greateſt bleſſing of my life. It ſhewed me my own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſir, the value of the Bible, and the goodneſs of God. How many of my brother drivers have I ſeen ſince that time cut off in the prime of life by drinking, or by ſome ſudden accident, while I have not only been ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but bleſſed and proſpered. O, ſir! it would be the joy of my heart, if ſome of my old comrades, good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, civil fellows, (whom I can't help loving) could ſee, as I have done, the danger of evil courſes before it is too late. Though they may not hearken to you, ſir, or any other <hi>miniſter,</hi> they may believe <hi>me,</hi> becauſe I have been one of them; and I can ſpeak from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, of the great difference there is, even as to worldly comfort, between a life of ſobriety and a life of ſin. I could tell them, ſir, not as a thing I have read in a book, but as a truth I feel in my own heart, that to fear God and keep his commandments, will not only "bring a man peace at the laſt," but will make him happy <hi>now.</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="unknown:035296_0042_1001C04B1F22BFB8"/>And I will venture to ſay, ſir, that all the ſtocks, pillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, priſons, and gibbets in the land, tho' ſo very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to keep bad men in order, yet will never reſtrain a good man from committing evil, half ſo much as that ſingle text, "how ſhall I do this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God?" Dr. Shepherd condeſcended to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of what the farmer had ſaid, kindly ſhook him by the hand, and took leave.</p>
                  <p>Thomas White had always been fond of ſinging, but he had for many years deſpiſed that vile traſh which is too often ſung in a ſtable-yard. One Sunday evening he heard his miſtreſs at the Bear read ſome verſes out of a fine book called the Spectator. He was ſo ſtruck with the picture it contains of the great mercies of God, of which he had himſelf partaken ſo largely, that he took the liberty to aſk her for theſe verſes, and ſhe being a very good natured woman, made her daughter write out for the poſtilion the following</p>

                  <p>Farmer White never took it into his head, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he paid his debts, worked early and late, and ate the bread of carefulneſs, he was therefore to come into no <hi>misfortune like other folk,</hi> but was to be free <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>om the common trials and troubles of life. He knew that proſperity was far from being a ſure mark of God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, and had read in good books, and eſpecially in the Bible, of the great poverty and afflictions of the beſt of men. Though he was no great ſcholar, he had ſenſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to obſerve, that a time of public proſperity was not always a time of public virtue; and he thought that what was true of a whole nation might be true of one man. So the more he proſpered the more he prayed that proſperity might not corrupt his heart. And when he ſaw lately ſigns of public diſtreſs coming on, he was not half ſo much frightened as ſome others were, becauſe he thought it might do us good in the long run; and he was in hopes that a little poverty might bring on a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle penitence. The great grace he labored after was that of a cheerful ſubmiſſion. He uſed to ſay, that if the Lord's Prayer had only contained thoſe four little words THY WILL BE DONE, it would be worth more than the biggeſt book in the world without them.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Shepherd, the worthy vicar, (with whom the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's wife had formerly lived as houſekeeper) was very fond of taking a walk with him about his grounds, and uſed to ſay, that he learnt as much from the farmer as the farmer did from him. If the doctor happened to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, I am afraid theſe long rains will ſpoil this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ne piece of outs, the farmer would anſwer, "but then, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 words">

                     </gap> how good it is for the graſs." If the doctor ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:035296_0047_1001C05E66724900"/>ſure the rye would turn out well. When graſs failed, he did not doubt but turnips would be plenty. Even for floods and inundations he would find out ſome way to juſtify Providence. "'Tis better," ſaid he "to have our lands a little overflowed, than that the ſprings ſhould be dried up, and our cattle faint for lack of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter." When the drought came, he thanked God that the ſeaſon would be healthy; and high winds, which frightened others, he ſaid ſerved to clear the air. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever or whatever was wrong, he was always ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> that Providence was in the right. And he uſed to ſay, that a man with ever ſo ſmall an income, if he had but fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality and temperance, and caſt off all vain deſires, was richer than a lord who was tormented by vanity and covetouſneſs. When he ſaw others in the wrong, he did not however abuſe them for it, but took care to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the ſame fault. He had ſenſe and ſpirit enough to break through many old but very bad cuſtoms of his neighbors. "If a thing is wrong in itſelf," (ſaid he one day to Farmer Hodges) "a whole pariſh doing it can't make it right. And as to it's being an old cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, why if it be a good one I like it the better for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing old, becauſe it has the ſtamp of ages and the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of experience on its worth. But if it be old as well as bad, that is another reaſon for my trying to put an end to it, that we may not miſlead our children as our fathers have miſled us."</p>

                     <p>Some years after he was ſettled, he built a large new barn. All the workmen were looking forward to the uſual holiday of roof-raiſing. On this occaſion it was a cuſtom to give a dinner to the workmen, with ſo much liquor after it that they got ſo drunk that they not only loſt the remaining half day's work, but they were not always able to work the next day.</p>

Mrs. White provided a plentiful dinner for roof-raiſing, and gave each man his mug of beer. After a hearty meal they began to grow clamorous for more drink. The farmer ſaid, "My lads, I don't grudge you a few gallons of ale merely for the ſake of ſaving my liquor, though that is ſome conſideration; but I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will, knowingly, help any man to make a beaſt of himſelf. I am reſolved to break through a bad cuſtom. You are now well refreſhed. If you will go cheerfully to your work, you will have half a day's pay to take on Saturday night more than you would if this afternoon were waſted in drunkenneſs. For this your families will be the better: whereas, were I to give you more liquor when you have already had enough, I ſhould help to rob them of their bread. But I wiſh to ſhew you, that I have your good at heart full as much as my own profit. If you will now go to work, I will give you all another mug at night, when you leave off.—Thus your time will be ſaved, your families helped, and my ale will not go to make reaſonable creatures worſe than brute beaſts."</p>
                     <p>Here he ſtopped.—"You are in the right on't, mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter," ſaid Tom the thatcher. "You are a hearty man, farmer," ſaid John Plane the carpenter." "Come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, boys," ſaid Tim Brick the maſon; ſo they all went merrily to work, fortified with a good dinner.— There was only one drunken ſurly fellow who refuſed, that was Dick Guzzle, the ſmith. Dick never works above two or three days in the week, and ſpends the others at the Red Lion. He ſwore, that if the farmer did not let him have as much liquor as he liked at roof-raiſing, he would not ſtrike another ſtroke, but would leave the job unfiniſhed, and he might get hands where he could. Farmer White took him at his word, and paid him off directly: glad enough to get rid of ſuch a ſot, whom he had only employed from pity to a large and almoſt ſtarving family. When the men came for
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035296_0049_1001C06B9D6880E0"/>their mug in the evening, the farmer brought out the remains of the cold gammon: they made a hearty ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and thanked him for having broke through a fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh cuſtom, which was afterwards much left off in that pariſh, though Dick would not come into it, and loſt moſt of his work.</p>
                     <p>Farmer White's laborers were often complaining, that things were ſo dear that they could not buy a bit of meat. He knew it was partly true, but not entirely, for it was before theſe very hard times. One morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſtept out to ſee how an outhouſe which he was thatching went on. He was ſurprized to find the work at a ſtand. He walked over to the thatcher's houſe. "Tom," ſaid he, "I deſire that piece of work may be finiſhed directly. If a ſhower comes my grain will be ſpoiled." "Indeed, maſter, I ſhan't work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, nor to-morrow, neither," ſaid Tom. "You for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that 'tis Eaſter Monday, and to-morrow is Eaſter Tueſday. And ſo on Wedneſday I ſhall thatch away maſter. But 'tis hard if a poor man who works all the year, may not enjoy theſe few holidays."</p>
                     <p>"Tom," ſaid the farmer, "when theſe days were firſt put into our prayer-book, the good men who did it, little thought that the time would come when <hi>holy-day</hi> ſhould mean <hi>drunken-day.</hi> How much doſt think now I ſhall pay thee for this piece of thatch?" "Why you know maſter you have let it to me by the great. I think between this and to-morrow night, as the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſo fine, I could clear about four ſhillings, after I had paid my boy. But thatching does not come often, and other work is not ſo profitable." "Very well, Tom; and how much now do you think you may ſpend in theſe two holidays?" "Why maſter, if the ale is pleaſant, and the company merry, I do not expect to get off for leſs than three ſhillings." "Tom, can you do pounds, ſhillings, and pence?" "I can make a little ſcore, maſter, behind the kitchen door with a bit of chalk, which is as much as I want." "Well, Tom,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:035296_0050_1001C0700690C940"/>add the four ſhillings you would have earned, to the three you intend to ſpend, what does that make?" "Let me ſee! three and four make ſeven. Seven ſhillings, maſter." "Tom, you often tell me the times are ſo bad that you can never buy a bit of meat. Now here is the coſt of two joints at once; to ſay nothing of the ſin of waſting time and getting drunk." "I never once thought of that," ſaid Tom. "Now Tom," ſaid the farmer, "if I were you, I would ſtep over to Butcher Jobbin's, buy a ſhoulder of mutton, which being left from Saturday's market you will get a little cheaper.— This I would make my wife bake in a deep diſh full of potatoes. I would then go to work, and when the din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was ready I would go and enjoy it with my wife and children; you need not give the mutton to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren—the potatoes will have all the gravy, and be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſavory for them." "Aye, but I've got no beer mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the times are ſo hard that a poor man can't afford to brew a drop of drink now as we uſed to do."</p>
                     <p>"Times are bad, and malt is very dear, Tom, and yet both don't prevent your throwing away ſeven ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in keeping holiday. Now ſend for a quart of ale, as it is to be a feaſt; and you will even then be four ſhllings richer than if you had gone to the public houſe. I would put by theſe four ſhillings, till I could add a couple to them; with this I would get a buſnel of malt, and my wife ſhould brew it, and you may take a pint at home of a night, which will do you more good than a gallon at the Red Lion." "I have a great mind to take your advice, maſter, but I ſhall be made ſuch fun of at the Lion; they will ſo laugh at me if I dont go." "Let thoſe laugh that win, Tom." "But, maſter, I have got a friend to meet me there."—"Then aſk your friend to come and eat a bit of your cold mutton at night, and here is ſixpence for another pot, if you will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to brew a ſmall caſk of your own." "Thank you, maſter, and ſo I will; and I won't <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>THE SHEEP-SHEARING.</head>
                     <p>Dr. Shepherd happened to ſay to Farmer White one day, "that there was nothing he diſliked more than the manner in which ſheep-ſhearing and harveſt-home were kept by ſome in his pariſh. What, ſaid the good doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, juſt when we are bleſt with theſe natural riches of our land, the fleece of our flocks; when our barns are crowned with plenty, and we have reaped the fruits or the earth in due ſeaſon; is that very time to be ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for ribaldry, and riot, and drunkenneſs? Do we thank God for his mercies by making ourſelves unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and unfit to enjoy them?"</p>
                     <p>"I thank you for the hint, ſir," ſaid the farmer, "I am reſolved to rejoice, though, and others ſhall rejoice with me, and we will have a merry night on't."</p>
                     <p>So Mrs. White dreſſed a very plentiful ſupper of meat and pudding; and ſpread out two tables. The farmer ſat at the head of one, conſiſting of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e of the neighbors, and all his work-people. At the other ſat his wife, with two long benches on each ſide of her.— at theſe ſat all the old and infirm poor, eſpecially thoſe who lived in the work-houſe, and had no day of feſtivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to look forward to in the whole year but this. On the graſs, in the little court, ſat the children of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borers, and of the other poor, whoſe employment it had been to gather flowers, and dreſs and adorn the horns of the ram; for the farmer did not wiſh to put an end to any old cuſtom, if it was innocent. His own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſtood by the table, and he gave them plenty of pudding, which they carried to the children of the poor, with a little draught of cider to every one.</p>
                     <p>This feaſt, though orderly and decent, was yet hearty and cheerful. Dr. Shepherd dropped in with a good deal of company he had at his houſe, and they were
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035296_0052_1001C07AA58DD0B8"/>much pleaſed. When the doctor ſaw how the aged and the infirm poor were enjoying themſelves, he was much moved; he ſhook the farmer by the hand, and ſaid, "But thou, when thou makeſt a feaſt, call the blind, and the lame, and the halt; they cannot recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe thee, but thou ſhalt be recompenſed at the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the juſt."</p>
                     <p>"Sir," ſaid the farmer, "'tis no great matter of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe—I kill a ſheep of my own; potatoes are as plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as blackberries, with people who have a little fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought. I ſave much more cider in the courſe of a year, by never allowing any carouſing in my kitchen or drunkenneſs in my fields, than would ſupply many ſuch feaſts as theſe, ſo that I ſhall be never the poorer at Chriſtmas. It is cheaper to make people happy, ſir, than to make them drunk. The doctor and the ladies condeſcended to walk from one table to the other, and heard many merry ſtories, but not one profane word, or one indecent ſong: ſo that he was not-forced to the painful neceſſity either of reproving them, or leaving them in anger. When all was over they ſung the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-fifth pſalm, and the ladies all joined in it; and when they got home to the vicarage to tea, they declared they liked it better than any concert.</p>

                     <p>In the famous cold winter of the preſent year, 1795, it was edifying to ſee how patiently Farmer White bore that long and ſevere froſt. Many of his ſheep were frozen to death, but he thanked God that he had ſtill many left. He continued to find in-door work, that his men might not be out of employ. Mrs. White was ſo conſiderate, that juſt at that time ſhe leſſened the number of her hogs, that ſhe might have mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e whey and ſkim-milk to aſſiſt poor familes.—Nay, I have known her live on boiled meat for a long time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in a ſickly ſeaſon, becauſe the pot-liquor made
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:035296_0053_1001C082EAF49CD0"/>ſuch a ſupply of broth for the ſick poor. As the ſpring came on, and things grew worſe, ſhe never had a cake, a pye, or a pudding in her houſe; though ſhe uſed to have plenty of theſe good things, and will again, I hope, when the preſent ſcarcity is over; though the ſays ſhe never will uſe ſuch white flour again, even if it ſhould come down to five ſhillings a buſhel.</p>
                     <p>All the pariſh now began to murmur. Farmer Jones was ſure the froſt had killed the wheat. Farmer Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſaid the rye would never come up. Brown, the maltſter, inſiſted the barley was dead at the root. But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher Jobbins ſaid beef would be a ſhilling a pound. All declared there would not be a hop to brew with. The orchards were all blighted, there would not be apples enough to make a pye: and as to hay, there would be none to be had for love nor money.—"I'll tell you what," ſaid Farmer White, "the ſeaſon is dreadful.—The crops are unpromiſing juſt now; but 'tis too early to judge. Don't let us make things worſe than they are. We ought to comfort the poor, and you are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to deſpair. Don't you know how much God was diſpleaſed with the murmurs of his choſen people? And yet, when they were tired of manna he ſent them quails; but all did not do. Nothing ſatisfies grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers. We have a promiſe on our ſide, that there ſhall be ſeed time and harveſt time to the end. Let us then hope for a good day, but provide againſt an evil one. Let us rather prevent the evil before it comes upon us, than ſink under it when it comes. Grumbling cant help us. Activity can. Let us ſet about planting potatoes in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very nook and corner, in caſe the corn <hi>ſhould</hi> fail, which, however, I don't believe. Let us mend our manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before we are driven to it by actual want. And if we allow our honeſt laborers to plant a few potatoes for their families in the head-lands of our ploughed fields, or other waſte bits of ground, it will do us no harm, and be a great help to them."</p>

                        <pb n="55" facs="unknown:035296_0054_1001C087B7C6EE40"/>
The farmer had many temptations to ſend his corn at an extravagant price to a <hi>certain ſea-port town;</hi> but as he knew that it was intended to export it againſt law, he would not be tempted to encourage unlawful gain; ſo he threſhed out a ſmall mow at a time, and ſold it to the neighboring poor far below the market price. He ſerved his own workmen firſt. This was the ſame to them as if he had raiſed their wages, and even better, as it was a benefit of which their families were ſure to partake. If the poor in the next pariſh were more diſtreſſed than his own, he ſold to them at the ſame rate. "For," ſaid he, "there is no diſtinction of pariſhes in heaven; and though charity begins at home, yet it ought not to end there."</p>
                     <p>He had been uſed in good times now and then to catch a hare or a partridge, as he was qualified. But he now reſolved to give up that pleaſure. So he parted from a couple of ſpaniels he had; for he ſaid he could not bear that his dogs ſhould be eating the meat or the milk, which ſo many men, women, and children wanted.</p>

                     <head>THE WHITE LOAF.</head>
                     <p>One day, it was about the middle of laſt July, when things ſeemed to be at the deareſt, and the rulers of the land had agreed to ſet the example of eating nothing but coarſe bread. Doctor Shepherd read, before ſermon, in the church, their public declaration, which the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of the county ſent him, and had alſo ſigned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Mrs. White, of courſe, was at church, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it mightily. Next morning the doctor took a walk over to the farmer's, in order to ſettle further plans for the relief of the pariſh. He was much ſurpriſed to meet Mrs. White's little maid Sally with a very ſmall wheat loaf, which ſhe had been buying at a ſhop. He ſaid nothing to the girl, as he never thought it right to expoſe the faults of a miſtreſs to her ſervant, but walked on, reſolving to give Mrs. White a ſevere lecture for
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:035296_0055_1001C093343FCF08"/>the firſt time in his life. He ſoon changed his mind, for on going into the kitchen the firſt perſon he ſaw was Tom the thatcher, who had had a ſad fall from a ladder; his arm, which was ſlipped out of his ſleeve, was ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a frightful manner. Mrs. White was ſtanding at the dreſſer making the little wheat loaf into a poultice, which ſhe laid upon the ſwelling in a large clean old cloth.</p>
                     <p>"I aſk your pardon, my good Sarah," ſaid the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, "I ought not, however appearances were againſt you, to have ſuſpected that ſo humble and prudent a woman as you are, would be led either to indulge any daintineſs of your own, or to fly in the face of your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by eating white bread while they are eating brown. Whenever I come here I ſee it is not needful to be rich in order to be charitable. A bountiful rich man would have ſent Tom to a ſurgeon, who would have done no more for him than you have done; for in thoſe inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations the moſt ſkilful ſurgeon could only apply a poultice. Your kindneſs in dreſſing the wound your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will, I doubt not, perform the cure at the expenſe of that threepenny loaf and a little hog's lard. And I will take care that Tom ſhall have a good ſupply of rice from the ſubſcription." "And he ſhan't want for ſkim milk," ſaid Mrs. White; and was he the beſt lord in the land, in the ſtate he is in, a diſh of good nice milk would be better for him than the niceſt meat.</p>

                     <head>THE PARISH MEETING.</head>
                     <p>On the tenth of Auguſt the veſtry held another meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to conſult on the beſt method of further aſſiſting the poor. The abundant crops now cheered every heart. Farmer white had a mind to be a little jocular with his deſponding neighbors. "Well, neighbor Jones," ſaid he, "all the wheat was killed, I ſuppoſe. The barley all dead at the root." Farmer Jones looked ſheepiſh, and ſaid, "to be ſure the crops had turned out better
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035296_0056_1001A3519F1E4730"/>than he thought." "Then," ſaid Dr. Shepherd, "let us learn to truſt Providence another time."</p>
                     <p>Among other things, they agreed to ſubſcribe for a large quantity of rice, which was to be ſold out to the poor at a very low price, and Mrs. White was ſo kind as to undertake the trouble of ſelling it. After this day's work was over, all who wiſhed to buy at theſe reduced rates were ordered to come to the farm on the Tueſday evening. Dr. Shepherd dropped in at the ſame time, and when Mrs. White had done weighing her rice, the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſpoke as follows:</p>
                     <p>"My honeſt friends, it has pleaſed God to viſit this land with a ſcarcity, to which we have been little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed. There are ſome idle evil-minded people who are on the watch for public diſtreſſes, not that they may humble themſelves under the mighty hand of God, (which is the true uſe to be made of all troubles) but that they may benefit themſelves by diſturbing the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic peace. Theſe people, by riot and drunkenneſs, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the evil which they pretend to cure. Riot will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete our misfortunes, while peace, induſtry, and good management, will go near to cure them. Bread, to be ſure, is uncommonly dear. Among the various ways of making it cheaper, one is to reduce the quality of it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, to leſſen the quantity we conſume. If we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get enough of coarſe wheaten bread, let us make it of other grain. Or let us mix one half of potatoes, and one half of wheat. This laſt is what I eat in my own family. It is pleaſant and wholeſome. Our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ate barley bread you know, as we were told in the laſt month's Sunday Reading of the Cheap Repoſitory, which I hope you have all heard, as I deſired the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Sunday ſchool to read it juſt after evening ſervice, when I know many of the parents are apt to call in at the ſchool. This is a good cuſtom, and one of thoſe little books ſhall be often read at that time.</p>
                     <p>"My good women, I truly feel for you at this time
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:035296_0057_1001C09CF5A229E0"/>of ſcarcity; and I am going to ſhew my good will, as much by my advice as my ſubſcription. It is my duty, as your friend and miniſter, to tell you, that one half of your preſent hardſhips is owing to BAD MANAGEMENT. I often meet your children without ſhoes and ſtockings, with great luncheons of the very whiteſt bread, and that three times a day. Half that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>antity, and ſtill leſs-if it were coarſe, put into a diſh of good onion or leek por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge, would make them an excellent breakfaſt. Many too of the very pooreſt of you eat your bread hot from the oven; this makes the difference of one loaf in five; I aſſure you it is what I cannot afford to do. Come, Mrs. White, you muſt aſſiſt me a little. I am not very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in theſe matters myſelf; but I know that the rich would be twice as charitable if the poor made a better uſe of their bounty. Mrs. White do give theſe poor women a little advice how to make their pittance go farther than it now does. When you lived with me you were famous for making us nice, cheap diſhes, and I dare ſay you are not leſs notable now you manage for yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>"Indeed, neighbors," ſaid Mrs. White, "what the good doctor ſays is very true. A halfpenny worth of oatmeal or groats, with a leek or onion, out of your own garden, which coſts nothing, a bit or ſalt, and a little coarſe bread, will breakfaſt your whole family. It is a great miſtake at any time to think a bit of meat is ſo ruinous, and a great load of bread ſo cheap. A poor man gets ſeven or eight ſhillings a week; if he is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful he brings it home. I dare not ſay how much of this goes for tea in the afternoon, now ſugar and butter are ſo dear, becauſe I ſhould have you all upon me, but I will ſay that too much of this little goes even for bread, from a notion that it is the hardeſt fare. This, at all times, but particularly now, is bad management. Dry peaſe, to be ſure, have been very dear lately! but now they are plenty enough. I am certain then, that if a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:035296_0058_1001A359169C6BF0"/>or two of the ſeven or eight was laid out for a bit of coarſe beef, a ſheep's head, or any ſuch thing, it would be well beſtowed. I would throw a couple of pound of this into the pot, with two or three handfuls of grey peaſe, an onion, and a little pepper. Then I would throw in cabbage, or turnip, and carrot, or any garden ſtuff that was moſt plenty; let it ſtew two or three hours, and it will make a diſh fit for his majeſty. The work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man ſhould have the meat, the children don't want it, the ſoup will be thick and ſubſtantial, and requires no bread.</p>

                     <p>"Pray, Sarah, let me put in a word," ſaid Farmer White. "I adviſe my men to raiſe each a large bed of parſnips. They are very nouriſhing, and very profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Six penny worth of ſeed, well ſowed, and trod in, will produce more meals than ſour ſacks of potatoes; and what is material to you who have ſo little ground, it will not require more than an eight part of the ground which the four ſacks will take. Parſnips are very good the ſecond day warmed in the frying-pan, and a little raſher of pork or bacon will give them a nice flavour."</p>
                     <p>Dr. Shepherd now ſaid, "as a proof of the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quality of parſnips, I was reading in a hiſtory book this very day, that the American Indians make a great part of their bread of parſnips, though Indian corn is ſo famous; it will make a little variety too."</p>
                     <p>"I remember," ſays Mrs. White, "a cheap diſh, ſo nice that it makes my mouth water. I peel ſome raw potatoes, ſlice them thin, put the ſlices into a deep fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-pan, or pot, with a little water, an onion, and a bit of pepper.

                     <p>"Take two or three pickled herrings, put them into a ſtone jar, fill it up with potatoes, and a little water, and let it bake in the oven till it is done. I would give one hint more," added ſhe; "I have taken to uſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but potatoe ſtarch; and though I ſay it, that ſhould not ſay it, nobody's linen in a common way looks better than ours."</p>
                     <p>The Doctor now ſaid, "I am ſorry for one hardſhip which many poor-people labor under, I mean the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of getting a little milk. I wiſh all farmer's wives were as conſiderate as you are, Mrs. White. A little milk is a great comfort to the poor, eſpecially when their children are ſick. And I have known it anſwer to the ſeller as well as to the buyer, to keep a cow or two on purpoſe to ſell it out by the quart."</p>
                     <p>"Sir," ſaid Farmer White, "I beg leave to ſay a word to the men, if you pleaſe, for all your advice goes to the women. If you will drink leſs gin you may get more meat. If you abſtain from the alehouſe you may, many of you, get a little one-way beer at home." "Aye, that we can, Farmer," ſays poor Tom the thatcher, who was now got well. "Eaſter Monday for that—I ſay no more.—A word to the wiſe." The farmer ſmiled and went on. "The number of public houſes in many a pariſh brings on more hunger and rags than all the tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in it, heavy as they are. All the other evils put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether hardly make up the ſum of that one. We are now raiſing a freſh ſubſcription for you. This will be our rule of giving. We will not give to ſots, gamblers, and ſabbath-breakers. Thoſe who do not ſet their young children to work on week days, and ſend them to ſchool on Sundays, deſerve little favor. No man ſhould keep a dog till he has more food than his family wants. If
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035296_0061_1001C0B2B1C539E8"/>he feeds them at home they rob his children; if he ſtarves them, they rob his neighbors. We have heard in a neighboring city that ſome people carried back the ſubſcription loaves becauſe they were too coarſe; but we hope better things of you." Here Betty Plane beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, with all humility, to put in a word. "Certainly," ſaid the doctor, "we will liſten to all modeſt complaints, and try to redreſs them." "You were pleaſed to ſay, ſir," ſaid ſhe, "that we might find much comfort from buying coarſe bits of beef. And ſo we might, but you do not know, ſir, that we can ſeldom get them, even when we had the money, and times were not ſo bad." "How ſo, Betty?" "Sir, when we go to butcher Job<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins for a bit of ſhin, or any other lean piece, his anſwer is, 'you can't have it to-day. The cook at the great houſe has beſpoke it for gravy, or the doctor's maid (begging your pardon, ſir,) has juſt ordered it for ſoup.' Now, ſir, if ſuch kind gentlefolks were aware that this gravy and ſoup not only conſume a great deal of meat, (which, to be ſure, thoſe have a right to uſe who can pay for it) but that it takes away thoſe coarſe pieces which the poor would buy, if they bought at all, I am ſure they would not do it. For indeed the rich have been very kind, and I don't know what we ſhould have done without them."</p>
                     <p>"I thank you for the hint, Betty," ſaid the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, "and I aſſure you I will have no more gravy ſoup.—My garden will ſupply me with ſoups, that are both wholeſomer and better: and I will anſwer for my lady at the great houſe that ſhe will do the ſame.

                  <head>THE LIFE OF <hi>WILLIAM BAKER.</hi> BY THE REV. MR. GILPIN.</head>
                  <p>WILLIAM BAKER was born in the year 1710, in the pariſh of Boldre, near Lymington, in Hampſhire. His father dying when he was two years old, left him and a ſiſter to the care of his widow; who by taking in waſhing, maintained her two children with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any relief from the pariſh.—In theſe days ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry would exceed belief.</p>
                  <p>At ſeven years of age young Baker began that life of labor, which he continued through the ſpace of ſeventy years afterwards. He worked firſt for a penny a day in the vicarage garden; but ſoon thought himſelf equal to more profitable labor. He uſed to ſay he always conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himſelf as a poor friendleſs lad; and from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning depended only on himſelf.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time his mother grew old and infirm.—Her legs ſwelled, and ſhe could no longer ſtand at her waſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> tub. But nothing hurt her like the thoughts of going to the poor-houſe, or living on alms.</p>
                  <p>Her ſon was now about eighteen. He was healthy and ſtrong; and aſſured his mother, that while he was able to work for her, ſhe ſhould be obliged to nobody, He took a little cottage therefore on the edge of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt;
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035296_0064_1001C0BD432004B0"/>carried her to it; and got into the ſervice of a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in the neighborhood, as a day laborer. His mother lived nine years after this; during which time he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her with great cheerfulneſs, and kindneſs: nor had ſhe ever aſſiſtance from any other perſon. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied himſelf every little indulgence which young fellows of that age often take, that he might maintain his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—We do not often ſee ſuch an inſtance of goodneſs in a poor lad. It marked his character as ſomething un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common. He might, if he had pleaſed, have had her maintained by the pariſh.</p>
                  <p>About the time of his mother's death he thought of marrying. At a little diſtance from him, under the hill, lived a laborer of the name of Brooks. His daughter Joanna was the perſon whom Baker fixed on for a wife; and no objection being made, he married her, and bro't her to his cottage. Joanna had lived under a careful mother, juſt in the way in which he himſelf had always lived; and with the ſame notions of induſtry and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality. She entered therefore into all her huſband's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. What he gained, ſhe put to the beſt uſe.—"We both pulled the rope," he uſed to ſay "by the ſame end; and ſo we compaſſed many things which they cannot do, who pull at different ends."</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, his family increaſed; and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry increaſed with it. He now never worked "by the day," if he could help it; but took the hardeſt "taſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work" he could get, by which the moſt money was to be earned. And that he might "never" be idle, he took, at a ſmall rent, of Mrs. John Burrard, of Lyming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, a piece of rough ground, about nine or ten acres, on which he might employ his leiſure. Many a time he was ſeen working in it before ſun-riſe; and if his day's work had not been hard, in an evening by moon-light. In a few years he made it worth much more, than when he took it; and he found it of great u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e to his family in furniſhing him ſometimes with a crop of potatoes—or a
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035296_0065_1001C0C5B2556FE0"/>little corn—or a few loads of hay; which enabled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to keep two or three cows, and as many foreſt-colts.—Some years after, his good landlady died; and this piece of land fell into the hands of Mr. Brailsfield, of Kentiſh town; who finding it was tenanted by a man, who had taken ſo much pains to improve it, promiſed neither to raiſe his rent nor to take it from him; which I mention to his honor.—Thus a kind of providence bleſſed all Baker's deſigns; and he was richer than many a man who is born to thouſands. There are few men, who may not live comfortably, if they live "according to their ſtation:" and if they "do not," the higheſt ſtations will not ſecure from difficulties. I have often heard Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket ſay, he never knew what want was: but then he never relaxed his uſual frugality. When wheat was dear, to make all ends meet, he lived on barley; and when he could not with convenience compaſs a buſhel of malt, he contented himſelf with milk, or water.</p>
                  <p>He had now ſive children, who were a conſtant claim upon all his induſtry and frugality. But he had other claims. He had been kind to his ſiſter, though her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior did not entirely pleaſe him: and he was now call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on from a quarter, he did not expect. His wife's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, grown old, applied to him for aſſiſtance. Of this man he never had a high opinion; but for his mother-in-law he had always the greateſt eſteem. "She was as good a woman," he uſed to ſay, "as his wife; and could not ſay more for any woman on earth." However, tho' he could not pretend, with the incumbrance of ſo large a family, to maintain them entirely, he agreed with the overſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ers of the pariſh, that if they would pay them a ſhilling a week, he would do the reſt. Accordingly he built them a little cottage; and was as kind to them as he could. Soon after, on the old man's death, he took his mother-in-law into his houſe, and kept her till ſhe died <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>o' ſhe lived till ſhe was upwards of ninety; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> many years.</p>

                     <pb n="67" facs="unknown:035296_0066_1001C0C7C3DEE010"/>
About the time that his children were pretty well grown up, a fortunate circumſtance happened. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a legacy of ſeventy pounds, and a clock. This money came very happily to ſettle ſome of his children. "They had it all," he ſaid, "among them: he never had a belly full of meat out of it himſelf." The clock alone he kept. A clock was the only piece of furniture he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver coveted; and he always intended, if it ſhould be in his power, to have purchaſed one; though, it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if a clock had not been thus thrown in his way, he would always have found ſomething more uſeful for the employment of his money.</p>
                  <p>Nor was he kind only to his relations, as he got for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the world, he was very friendly among his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, and lent many a little ſum to aſſiſt them in their diſtreſſes, But as he was a very ſhrewd, intelligent man, he lent only where he ſaw his money could be of uſe; to the ſpendthrift he would lend nothing, nor to any man who frequented an alehouſe. So judicious was he in theſe loans, that although he helped many a man out of a difficulty, I have heard him ſay, he never loſt a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by lending money in his life. Often indeed he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the worth of what he had lent in a little corn, a pig, a calf, or ſomething that was more convenient for the borrower to pay with than money.</p>
                  <p>He was now advancing into years, and his good Joan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na began to feel the effects of age more than he did.—Her ailment was a mere decay of nature; but ſhe was ſo entirely weakened, that ſhe could do nothing for her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Her huſband hired a woman into the houſe to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend her near ſeven years, in which ſhe continued in this helpleſs ſtate, Every thing he could do, he did for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, "who," he ſaid, "had been kinder to every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy than herſelf. In the year 1776 ſhe died, and left him greatly afflicted for the loſs or a faithful friend, who had followed cloſe by his ſide, through all his laborious life, for the ſpace of forty years. I have ſeen him ſpeak of
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:035296_0067_1001C0CEC86B9420"/>her with tears in his eyes, and agitation in all he ſaid, at the age of eighty.</p>
                  <p>He had now the world, in a manner, to begin again. His children were all married, or diſperſed; and he had nobody with him, on whoſe arm he could lean in des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending the hill. He thought the wifeſt thing he could do, was to draw his little matters into as ſmall a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs as he could, and rid himſelf, as much as poſſible, of the cares of the world. Accordingly he ſold his cows, and horſes, and a little tenement or two, which he had purchaſed, and brought one hundred and ten pounds to a friend to put to ſome uſe. "For as I cannot now," ſaid he, "work myſelf, I muſt make my money," as he phraſed it, "work for me." His friend made him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, as well as he could, what was meant by the funds, and adviſed him to put his money into conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated annuities for twenty-eight years from January, 1780. As this tranſaction was in the year 1782, when the funds were low, he was made to underſtand, that the intereſt would be conſiderable, (about eight pounds a year) but that the whole would be loſt if he ſhould live twenty-ſix years. However, as he did not look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to that time, he took his friend's advice. Beſides this property, he had two or three other little ſums put out to intereſt in private hands; and a little tenement, which he reſerved for himſelf to live in; with two or three patches of ground, which lay near him, and ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to employ him.</p>
                  <p>He had a good opinion of the charitable ſocieties or clubs, as they are called, in the ſeveral pariſhes around him; but he thought them uſeful chiefly to thoſe, who could not depend upon themſelvs. If young fellows could depend on themſelves, and lay the ſame money by, without breaking into it, he thought it might gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be more uſeful to them. Four pence a week would amount to near a pound in the year. At harveſt ſome little matter might be added to it. And if this practice
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035296_0068_1001C0D400D804C8"/>were begun early in life, in a few years, it might amount to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>His manner now of ſpending his time, was ſomewhat different from what it uſed to be.

He had now gotten above the world—had his time much to himſelf—and ſpent a great part of it in reading the Bible, which was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly book he did read. He had the uſe of his eyes to the laſt, and generally, though by himſelf, read out, which he thought made the more impreſſion on his memory. Oftener than once, as I have approached his lonely cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, I have thought I heard voices, but when I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the old man was ſitting alone, with his Bible before him. He had as ſtrong natural parts as I almoſt ever met with, and eaſily underſtood, not only the general meaning and intention of the goſpel, but many of the moſt difficult paſſages in it. What our Saviour ſaid, he tho't, was very eaſy, and much of what St. Paul ſaid. And he told me, he had a very good book of prayers, in his phraſe, "for all intents and purpoſes."</p>
                  <p>As he grew more and more infirm, his friends tho't it comfortleſs for him to live entirely by himſelf, and endeavored to perſuade him to get ſome good old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to live with him, who might take care of his houſe, and likewiſe of him, if any thing ſhould ail him. "Aye," ſaid he, "if I could get ſome good old woman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but where is ſhe to be ſound?" He had tried the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſaid, but had no encouragement to try it again. People would not, he added, live now as he lived. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he had bad luck in his choice, but he found, that a
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:035296_0069_1001A3757763E6B0"/>woman now would ſpend as much in junketting in one day, as would ſerve him for two. Then, he ſaid, there was ſuch conſtant goſſipping, and noiſe in his houſe, that he could never have his time at his own diſpoſal.—In ſhort, he was obliged to live as they choſe, not as he choſe himſelf. Then fetching a deep ſigh, he would ſay, "His good Joanna had ſpoiled him for living with any other woman."</p>
                  <p>It was then propoſed to him to live with one of his daughters, who was married in the neighborhood. He had thought of that, he ſaid, but an old man was always giving offence to one or another, and one or another was always giving offence to him. Beſides, he ſaid, his daughter had ſeveral children, and ſo much noiſe did not ſuit his quiet way of living. He could now, at his own eaſe, follow his own inclination. In ſhort, it appeared, that while he lived, he wiſhed to live entirely to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and that it was very indifferent to him when, and where, and how he died.</p>
                  <p>The deſtitute condition, however in which he lived, laid him open to the depredations of a diſhoneſt neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood. Many little thefts, when he was watched out of his houſe, were committed. Among other things his pewter flaggon was ſtolen. It hung over his dreſſer, and contained all his little ſecurities, and promiſſory notes.—He had, however, with his uſual ſagacity, placed his money in ſuch ſafe hands, that he had, on this occaſion, no loſs.</p>
                  <p>But among the petty thefts, which were committed in his houſe, was a robbery of a very ſerious nature.—On the day before Lymington fair the old man had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome intereſt money (about five guineas) to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a few neceſſaries. This being probably known, two men, at midnight, broke into his houſe. His faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed was only ſuch as a good ſhake might eaſily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="71" facs="unknown:035296_0070_1001C0D80FA3A598"/>while the other ſought for the money, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently found. I heard him ſpeak of the tranſaction the next day, and his behaviour raiſed him in my opinion. He ſpoke with the caution of an honeſt man. The thieves had a dark lantern, he ſaid, with them, and he thought he could ſwear to one of them, but he durſt not venture it, where a man's life and character were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                  <p>From ſeveral circumſtances, however, it became more probable, that the man, whom Baker ſuſpected, was guilty. And indeed he himſelf ſoon after confirmed the ſuſpicion; for as the neighbors began more to talk of the thing, and to lay facts together, he thought it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to leave the country.—Indeed if wicked men would only conſider before hand the many circumſtances that lead to diſcovery, and the almoſt impoſſibility of provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt them all, they would be more cautious, on the mere principles of prudence, in committing any des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate wickedneſs. One circumſtance which tended to ſix the ſuſpicion of the fact on this man, was, that a child accidentally mentioned having ſeen a cut cheeſe in his houſe the day after the robbery. Baker had loſt a cut cheeſe, and it was well known the man had no cheeſe in his houſe before. The other perſon too was ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but if either of them had been taken up, it would, moſt probably, have diſcovered both: for a knave can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be depended on. And, indeed, it is probable, that both would have been diſcovered, had it not been for the the old man's ſcruples.—I mention all theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to ſhew that, in fact, it requires more care and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to commit a wicked action than moſt men poſſeſs. It is, indeed, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Notwithſtanding, however, the old man was thus ſo frequently preyed on by wicked people, he ſtill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to live alone. As to any farther loſſes, he had one w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Though he had now enough before him, he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtill to live with his uſual frugality. Many of his neighbors thought he might have indulged his age a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more, as he had the means to do it; and as they themſelves probably would have done in the ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, by which they might have ſpent all they had laid up for their old age, not knowing how long God might have lengthened out their lives. He lived, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as he had been accuſtomed to live, in the beſt of his days; for in many parts of his life he had been put to ſhifts. He had always good cheeſe in his houſe, and good bread which was his common food. He uſed to brew alſo now and then a buſhel of malt; ſo that he was ſeldom without a little caſk of beer. His garden produced him plenty of cabbages, which was the only plant he reared; and every year he bought at Lyming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton fair a ſide of bacon, a bit of which he would now and then put into his pot with a cabbage. Freſh meat he never taſted, nor were butter and tea among his neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. On this proviſion he never had a day's ſickneſs; and even at thoſe times when his food was leſs nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was able to do every thing to which the ſtrength of man is equal—What can the art of cookery do more?</p>
                  <p>He was now near eighty; his limbs began to fail; and he was ſubject to rheumatic pains, which ſeized his right leg, and made exerciſe very troubleſome to him.—Notwithſtanding, however, this infirmity, and his liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mile from the church, he rarely miſſed taking a painful walk to it every Sunday. The weather muſt have been very bad to prevent him. And though he was now become very deaf, he did not think even that a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for keeping from church—What an example did he ſet to thoſe, who, though in perfect health, inſtead of
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:035296_0072_1001C0DF37AC1B10"/>making the ſabbath a day for obtaining inſtruction, and begging God's bleſſing on the week, profane it by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a day of paſtime, and often a day of drinking and other wickedneſs. He was conſtant alſo at the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he always eſteemed a part of his duty.</p>
                  <p>He was confined to his houſe about ſix weeks before he died. His illneſs was a mere decay of nature. His legs ſwelled, and his conſtitution was broken up. He now ſubmitted to have ſomebody live in his cottage with him. He was preſſed to ſend for a phyſician, as he had the means to pay him, but he was reſolute againſt it.—"If you could find me a doctor," ſaid he, "who would tell me at once, I can do you good—or I cannot do you good, I would ſend for him; but elſe, why ſhould I ſend for a man to be paid for giving me phyſic, when I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take victuals?"—In ſhort, he knew he was dying, and wiſhed to die with as little moleſtation as he could.</p>
                  <p>He kept his bed about three days; and was ſenſible to the laſt. He was in conſiderable pain, but he bore it with that firmneſs and manlineſs with which he had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported all the hard duties of a conſtant life of induſtry. He died on the 15th day of May, 1791, and deſired that the 51ſt pſalm might be ſung before his corpſe, as he was carried through the church-yard to his grave. The tho't was new, and the decency and propriety of it had a good effect.</p>
                  <p>On his death his effects amounted to about four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds. That a man, in the loweſt ſtation, with a conſtant attention to money, ſhould, in the courſe of a long life, raiſe that ſum, or a greater, is not wonderful: but that a man, in the loweſt ſtation, ſhould leave ſuch a ſum behind him, after diſcharging all the offices of life with uprightneſs and propriety, is ſuch an example of an independent ſpirit, and of the force of induſtry and frugality, as deſerves to be recorded for the benefit of others.—The following inſcription ſtands over his grave in Boldre church-yard.</p>

                  <p>IT is the happineſs of our religion, that all mankind, poor and rich, are equally able to pleaſe God. The loweſt may be as acceptable in his Maker's ſight as the higheſt; nor are any man's ſervices ſo mean, as to be overlooked by his great Maſter. Before chriſtianity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, men were apt to think, that ſuch only as had the powerful means of doing good, could obtain the favor of God, and that low people could do little to pleaſe him. But the goſpel informs us, that God does not regard <hi>the action</hi> without <hi>the heart,</hi> from which the action pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds; and that the <hi>willing mind,</hi> though unaccompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the action, is as pleaſing in God's fight, as the <hi>action itſelf.</hi> So that, you ſee, the rich and poor are all equally in God's favor. Let each of us only do his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his proper ſtation, <hi>as to the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="75" facs="unknown:035296_0074_1001C0EEC9F149C0"/>—that is, with a deſire to pleaſe God, who has placed us in our ſeveral ſtations, and the loweſt of us ſhall be amongſt thoſe, to whom the text is applied: <hi>Well done, good and faithful ſervant; thou haſt been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now, my brethren, among the duties of our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtations, there are ſome, which equally belong both to rich and poor; and there are ſome which belong to one ſtation rather than the other.—Let me explain my meaning to you.</p>
                  <p>Among theſe duties, which belong to both, may be reckoned thoſe duties which we owe to God—love, truſt, reverence, prayer. Such alſo are the duties of reading, and meditating on ſcripture—of obſerving the ſabbath —of faith in our Redeemer—of attending the Lord's Supper. Such alſo are humility—honeſty—a deſire to ſerve our neighbor, as far as we can—the care of our families—and other duties that might be mentioned.— All theſe are equally required from the poor and rich; becauſe the poor may perform them as well as the rich.</p>
                  <p>But there are other duties which are <hi>not thus equally</hi> required. As the rich man abounds in the things of this world, it is required of him to be <hi>generous and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable;</hi> becauſe God hath enabled him to be ſo. But as the poor man cannot be generous and charitable, like the rich man, it is rather required of him to be <hi>indus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious</hi> and <hi>frugal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the preſent occaſion, therefore, I ſhall make the duties of <hi>induſtry</hi> and <hi>frugality</hi> the ſubject of my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. I mention them together, becauſe they muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways keep company, to be of any uſe. <hi>Frugality</hi> can do little without <hi>induſtry:</hi> and <hi>induſtry</hi> as little with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>frugality.</hi>—I ſhall give you the chief reaſons, which ſhould incline you to the practice of theſe duties.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, I would have you conſider what the ſcripture ſays on this ſubject. It is often touched upon;
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:035296_0075_1001C0F3B3176FF0"/>but one of the moſt remarkable paſſages is that of St. Paul to the Theſſalonians. <hi>When we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither ſhould he eat: for we hear there are ſome among you which walk diſorderly, working not at all. Now ſuch we command, and exhort by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that with quietneſs they work, and eat their own bread.</hi> —Now this command that we ſhould all <hi>eat our own bread</hi> is plainly founded on this reaſon, that nobody has a right to eat the bread of others, if he be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his own.—In ſome caſes, no doubt, the pariſh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance is a neceſſary relief—as when the father of a family is taken off, while his children are yet young— or when a family, perhaps, is greatly viſited by ſickneſs —or when a family is uncommonly large. But how many are there who ſhamefully run to the pariſh for relief, without any neceſſity of this kind? Theſe are people who either want <hi>induſtry</hi> in providing for their families—or <hi>frugality,</hi> in not making the beſt uſe of what they provide. They frequent the ale-houſe, or they ſpend what they have in good eating, or in other things, which are not neceſſary. Let them conſider how directly they break a ſcripture command, by <hi>eating o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men's bread for nought,</hi> and by <hi>becoming charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> without neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>It may be hoped, that with chriſtians a ſcripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand may have ſufficient weight. However, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to ſhew you more at large, on what <hi>reaſon</hi> this <hi>ſcripture command</hi> is founded.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, how deſirable is it to ſee your lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle habitations as clean, neat, and well furniſhed as any of your neighbors—to ſee your children decently cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed —to give them what little education you can—to have them taught to read, which may be a comfort to them during their lives—to have them taught to ſpin and work, which may give them early habits of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. But all this cannot be done without great indus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:035296_0076_1001C0F871F5EEA8"/>and frugality in the parent.—You have a choice, therefore, before you, whether it is better to do all this— at leaſt to do it in the beſt manner you can—or to idle away your time, or ſpend your money in drinking at ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes? How often are the children of idle parents ſent to poor-houſes, where their fathers' ſins are viſited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in all the wretchedneſs, miſery, and neglect which the poor little ſufferers are too often obliged to undergo.—Much have thoſe parents to anſwer for!—I have myſelt heard ſome of theſe idle parents alledge, that, as they made their money themſelves, they had a right to ſpend it as they pleaſed.—To tell ſuch people, that no man has a farther right to any thing, which God has given him, than to make a proper uſe of it, would be to little purpoſe, yet ſurely they muſt ſee the force of this, that if they marry, and have families, their families ſhould be conſidered as a part of themſelves, and have ſurely a right not only to their maintenance, but to the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and care their parents can beſtow. Who is the proper perſon to take care of the children but the parent?</p>
                  <p>I would have you conſider farther, that <hi>induſtry</hi> and <hi>frugality</hi> are virtues which have a particular tendency to keep you out of the way of temptation and miſchief. Where, think you, is lewdneſs, and drunkenneſs, and profaneneſs, and ſabbath breaking, and curſing, and ſwearing, and all other wickedneſs beſt taught? Its beſt ſchool, I believe, is the alehouſe. The devil tempts you to be idle firſt, and to love drink, then all wickedneſs follows naturally. He cannot ſo eaſily get hold of a fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, induſtrious man. The induſtrious man is otherwiſe employed. When the day's labor is over, be wiſhes for the night's reſt. Between both he has hardly time to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> quaintances, you will find the moſt induſtrious and the moſt frugal people to be alſo the beſt.</p>
                  <p>Conſider farther, that <hi>induſtry</hi> and <hi>frugality</hi> raiſe your
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035296_0077_1001C0FAA8F2B250"/>
                     <hi>characters</hi> in the pariſh, and give you conſequence.— You are often inclined to think yourſelves of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence than you really are. You are often ready to take offence when you hear any little ſtory told of you, which you think you do not deſerve, though probably the ſtory may be very true. All this however ſhews you wiſh to preſerve your characters. But you take the wrong way. It is not believing yourſelves of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or deſiring to ſtop people's mouths, that will give you credit with your neighbors. Leave your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors to talk as <hi>they will;</hi> and do you act as <hi>you ought,</hi> and you need take no farther care about your charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Honeſty, induſtry, and frugality will give charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and conſequence to the loweſt among you. He who ſupports himſelf by his own labor, is equal to any body. The richeſt man in the country is not more independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. While his idle neighbor, abject and baſe-minded, is pitifully going about begging relief of a pariſh-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, <hi>he</hi> feels his own conſequence, and is beholden only to his heavenly Maſter; he wants no aſſiſtance, but God's bleſſing and the uſe of his limbs.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I ſhould wiſh you to conſider, that <hi>induſtry</hi> and <hi>frugality</hi> are the beſt means of making you <hi>happy.</hi> I might ſay this with regard to the <hi>next</hi> world (for all virtues are generally more or leſs linked together, but I am ſpeaking now only of the happineſs of this life.— With what pleaſure may a poor man look round him, and ſee all his family out in the world, and by the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, doing well through his precepts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; and himſelf with ſome little matter ſtill before him, if God ſhould lengthen out his time a little longer? —There are many caſes, no doubt, where it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that any thing can be ſaved; but in many families, even in this pariſh, I know, ſomething might. If peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would only ſave what they ſpend at alehouſes, or in things unneceſſary, ſomething might be laid by againſt a ſit of ſickneſs! or (if God ſhould bleſs them with

And is the pleaſure, think you, of ſotting at an alehouſe equal to this comfortable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence? I know there are many who reaſon with themſelves, that if they can maintain their families, while they are well, it is all they deſire: when they are ſick, or old, the pariſh is obliged to maintain them. It may be a perſon's misfortune to come to the pariſh; but when a man in the prime of his ſtrength <hi>reaſons in this way,</hi> I dare take upon me to ſay, he is, at the bottom, an idle, good-for-nothing fellow, and his reaſoning is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an excuſe for drinking, or ſome other extravagance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They next get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to debt. If they have farms to manage, their affairs go wrong. If they are laborers, their families want bread; their children are half-ſtarved and half-naked. I need not point out theſe people to you, they point out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. You ſee them loitering about the pariſh, languid wretches, with faces ſodden, pale, and dropſical, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects equally of pity and contempt.—Many, no doubt, frequent ſotting houſes, who have not yet gone this length; but they are in the high way towards it; let them take care in time, <hi>their</hi> ruin is coming on.

However you may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed by the pleaſures of idleneſs and drinking, (which laſt is commonly the beginning of all miſchief) you may be aſſured, that all theſe things bring their bitter mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not only <hi>at laſt,</hi> but <hi>continually;</hi> and that nothing can make a man ſo happy, as living in his ſtation as he ought, with honeſty, ſobriety, induſtry, and frugality. No man can live happily, who lives at the will, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the control of others. Theſe virtues allow a man to live, independent of others, and in the manner he wiſhes to live himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Such was the life of our very reſpectable neigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

His ſtation in life, you know, was only that of a common day-laborer: but, as far as I could judge, he ſet juſt ſuch an example in that ſtation: and behaved exactly as he ought to have done. He had that generous independent ſpirit, which I have been recommending to you, that ſcorned to live upon the labors of others; and ſeemed to lay it down as a principle from the beginning of his life, to be obliged, under God, only to his own labor. By this alone he bred up a large family, without receiving a ſingle far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the pariſh. But this could not have been done without great induſtry, and frugality. He worked hard; he lived hard: denying himſelf every indulgence in eating and drinking, that he might not be a burden to others.—When his family was off his hands, he tho't, for the ſame reaſon, it was proper for him to lay up a little for his old age. While he <hi>could,</hi> therefore, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill to work; and lived in the ſame hard man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; which was now become quite eaſy; and habitual to him.—It pleaſed God to bleſs his labor; he laid up ſo much as maintained him, during his old age; and he has left ſomething behind him to be a comfort to his children, if they make a right uſe of it. He never could be ſaid to be wholly paſt his labor. Till within a few weeks of his death, he every day worked a little; and it became an agreeable amuſement to him. He had, all his life, been uſed to laborious working. Many a time I have heard him ſay, that, in general, laborers now did not know what it was to work: and I have heard others ſay, who knew him better than I did, that he would have done as much in one day, as many people, do in two.</p>
                  <p>I have heard ſome of his neighbors tax him with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a miſer and covetous; and ſay, that as he might have lived more comfortably in his old age, his hard living could be owing only to a covetous temper. He might it is true, have lived more comfortable in his old age, as
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:035296_0080_1001A37BC5D96408"/>
                     <hi>they</hi> may think, who accuſe him—and who are fonder of indulgence than he was: but he could not have lived more comfortably to himſelf, than he did: and I am perſuaded no man had ever leſs of the miſer in his heart, But let me defend the character of my good old neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor in this particular: let me ſhew you the difference between his temper, and that of a miſer.</p>
                  <p>A miſer hoards money for <hi>its own ſake.</hi> He does not conſider the uſe it is to anſwer; not indeed puts it to any uſe at all. Hoarding it up is all he has in view. He <hi>loves money.</hi> You remember an inſtance of a perſon, not many years ago in this pariſh, who expired graſping his purſe, under his bed-cloths, to his heart. Perhaps he meant to ſecure it, if he ſhould recover; but it plainly appeared to be his firſt care; and if any ſhould charge him with a love of money, I ſhould not know how to defend him.</p>
                  <p>With covetouſneſs, or a love of money, there is often mixed—indeed, I believe generally, a little knavery. If he who <hi>loves money</hi> do not openly cheat, he has many, ways of practiſing little under-hand, dirty tricks, which an upright man would hardly call honeſt.—I give you the beſt ſide of him, for the miſer is generally a very wicked character. The apoſtle indeed tells us, that the <hi>love of money is the root of all evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had our worthy deceaſed neighbor theſe ſigns of a miſer about him? As to his integrity, I dare take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to ſay, a more upright, honeſt man never lived. Many diſhoneſt practices, I have heard of in the pariſh —many little knaviſh tricks, I have ſeen, to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and get money, but I never heard of one action in the whole long life of our deceaſed neighbor, that was not fair, and honeſt, and upright in the higheſt degree: and I doubt not but you can all join with me in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this teſtimony. So far then you will allow, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the temper of a miſer yet appears. How ſhould there? there was no foundation for it. He had no love
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:035296_0081_1001C1096C6AF8C0"/>for money, merely for its own ſake, but as it might be the means of carrying him independently to the end of his life—and if he did not ſpend it all, that the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der might be of ſome little uſe to his family. I have known him to do what in his circumſtances were even generous things. Where he thought it neceſſary to ſpend his money, he ſpent it freely. He lived hard indeed, but whom did that hurt? It enabled him to do many a kind thing; but nobody ever ſuffered from it but himſelf. It is not <hi>living hard,</hi> it is not <hi>laying up money,</hi> that makes a man a miſer; but it is the intention with which he lives hard—it is the intention with which he lays up the money. Our late neighbor's intention was merely that of an independent ſpirit, which could not bear to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by other people's labor. He lived hard himſelf, leſt, if he had indulged himſelf, he ſhould afterwards have been obliged to live on the labors of others.—And is there any thing in this like a love for money? He had no love for money that interfered, I dare take upon me to ſay, with any one duty that belonged to his ſtation. How little he valued it for its own ſake, I had many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of ſeeing, as moſt of his money paſſed thro' my hands. Some years ago, you remember his houſe was broken open: he mentioned his loſs to me, not like a raiſer, but as far as his money was concerned, with chriſtian indifference. His chief diſtreſs was for thoſe, who had done the deed. To him, he ſaid, they had done little injury. By the bleſſing of God, he doubted not but he had enough to ſupport him while he lived; and it was owing, I believe, more to his lenity and ſcruple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> than to the want of evidence, that the thieves were not convicted. So far from having any thing covetous about him, he appeared always to me entirely diſengaged from, all worldly thoughts, ſtrongly impreſſed with a ſenſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

He uſed to talk of death, juſt as he would of one of the commoneſt events of life; and left with me a few directions about carrying his body to the grave, with as much indifference as a farmer would give directions about carrying a load of corn to his barn.</p>
                  <p>Thus, through a very long life he paſſed innocently, religiouſly, inoffenſively, and quietly to that grave, to which we now conſign him.

                  <head>THE TWO SOLDIERS.</head>
                  <p>TWO ſoldiers, Robert Wells and Iſaac Clark, had obtained a three month's furlow from their col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel, to viſit their relations and friends in a very diſtant part of England. On their return to join their regiment, which was quartered at Glouceſter, having travelled till they were weary, they propoſed lying by for the night, at a little alehouſe called the Green Dragon, near the road-ſide.</p>
                  <p>Wells obſerving the houſe was pretty much throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with company, propoſed to his companion to journey on to the next, where they might ſpend the night in more quiet, than the preſent proſpect of things offered at the Green Dragon.</p>
                  <p>I'll not ſtir a ſtep further to-night, ſaid Clark, for where there is good company and good liquor, there I'll make my head-quarters; ſo throwing his knapſack on the horſe-block, down he ſat himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Green Dragon was famous for brewing the beſt ale in thoſe parts, and of courſe became the general ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous of all the five-players, and ſkittle-players in the country; ſo very famous indeed was the liquor, that it introduced beggary and famine amongſt the wives and children in all the neighboring cottages.</p>
                  <p>A ſilver-laced hat had been bowled for that evening, and the prize was won by a young farmer, who ſpying our travellers, ſwore a tremendous oath they ſhould drink a bumper to the king's health.</p>
                  <p>After they had drunk plentifully, Wells twiched his comrade by the ſhoulder, and propoſed that they ſhould
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035296_0084_1001C119875096D0"/>proceed on their march, now they had been refreſhed with a friendly mug; Clark, with an oath, refuſed to comply, again repeating "the ſoldier's beſt head-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters was at the head of the beer barrel;" it ſhall never be ſaid, Wells, that Iſaac Clark was a ſtarter, where the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor was found, and the company good.</p>
                  <p>The liquor is very good ſure enough, ſaid Wells, who was naturally a very ſober fellow, but enough is as good as a feaſt: and as to the company, I never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held a worſe ſet of drunken, ſwearing rebrobates in my life, for which reaſon let us on, for if we cannot make them better, they may make us worſe.</p>
                  <p>Thou art always for preaching Bob, ſaid Clark, as if a body were going to die; why I was never In better health in my life; and 'tis time enough to be ſorry for one's ſins, when the laſs glaſs is out, ſo halloo Tap, bring us another pot.</p>
                  <p>Thus in ſpite of the perſuaſions of poor Wells, he went on calling for another mug, and another till he was as drunk as a beaſt; and his brains whirled round like the vanes of a wind-mill. Unhappily in ſome degree, Wells fell into the ſame error; but unaccuſtomed to take more than his pint, and being quite overcome with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, he felt himſelf extremely diſordered, and ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering into the freſh air; he fell flat on the graſs plat, where he lay in a dead ſleep all night; nor did he awake till the day was pretty far advanced; when his teeth chattered in his head, and his limbs ſhivered with cold, for the night was damp and miſty. As ſoon as he was able to ſtand, he ſtaggered in ſearch of Clark, whom he found in a ſtill more deplorable ſtate, for he had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed drinking till he was as mad as the reſt of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: They grew quarrelſome at length, and each took offence at the other, till words proceeded to blows, and Move ended in blood; for a very profligate young but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, ſtruck his neighbor the ſhoemaker ſuch a violent blow acroſs the head with a quart pot, that his ſkull was
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035296_0085_1001C120B877F2A8"/>fractured: This unlucky circumſtance bro't the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord to interfere, who was alarmed for the honor of his houſe, or to ſpeak truly, the fear of loſing his licence at next ſeſſions; ſo he very prudently ſent for a ſurgeon, whilſt the reſt of the joyous crew made their eſcape, for fear of falling into the hands of juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Our travellers left the Green Dragon, Clark's head was ſtill too confuſed with liquor to permit him to think; but Wells, who was now quite come to himſelf, was overcome with ſhame; and inwardly vowed, that if the entertainment he met with at the Dragon was called a merry making, he would never deſire to be merry again for the reſt of his days; for what good have we obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, ſaid he, but empty pockets, bloody noſes, ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bones, and the rod of juſtice hanging over our heads? Beſides what is ſtill worſe, muttered he to himſelf, by being overtaken in liquor, we have loſt our reaſon, which was the gift of God, and was given man as a precious token of his favor, to diſtinguiſh him from the brute-beaſt that periſheth.</p>
                  <p>Clark as they journeyed on, was ſpiteful, ſullen, and ſulky: Now and then muttering, that ſpite of the paſt he would get good ale wherever it was to be had.</p>
                  <p>And I, ſaid Wells, would make a vow to drink wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the reſt of my days, rather than ever make my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a beaſt again, for I have a character to maintains and a ſoul to be ſaved.—And I'll tell thee Bob what is my deſign, rejoined Clark, to ſwim in ſtrong beer when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I can find it, if poverty and death both ſtared me in the face.</p>

                  <p>We ſoldiers, Iſaac, ſhould be particularly careful to keep our accounts between God and our ſouls very ſhort, ſince at the beat of the drum, on the day of battle, ten thouſand may ruth, in a moment, into eternity, and the beſt Chriſtian then may be reckoned the bol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>s of conſcience: I am acre-mined to live my own way, both, come on't what will. Then take my word for it, ſaid Wells, thy ruin is nor far off; for though in a fit of bravery thou mayeſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to ſnake off the fear of God, the Devil may give up thy indentures at the laſt, and the law may take hold of thee in the mean time.</p>
                  <p>Then coming to a fine ſtream of water, Wells ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down, and taking up ſome in his hat, drank plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of it, ſaying it cooled the fever in his ſtomach.— Clark ſaid he was feveriſh alſo, but he ſhould cool his think with a glaſs of beſt Holland's at the next alehouſe, which they ſaw at ſome diſtance on the ſide of the bill.</p>
                  <p>There, however, they agreed to ſtop: After having made a plentiful breakfaſt, they called for their bill, when, to their great diſmay, they found their pockets entirely emptied of caſh, except two ſhillings and a few halfpence, each having loſt between two and three gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas, which had been given them by their friends to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the expenſes of their journey.</p>
                  <p>By what means they had been ſtripped of their caſh, they could not imagine; whether the landlord had made
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:035296_0087_1001BF6955257F78"/>free with their pockets to pay himſelf, or that it had ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out in the general ſcuffle; they were greatly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed, however, by their misfortune, for they had more than fifty miles to travel, and not more than ten pence left after the preſent expenſes were diſcharged; and when the night came on, they were compelled to ſeek the moſt comfortable lodging they could find under a hay-ſtack.</p>
                  <p>We ought not to complain of our hard fate, ſaid Wells, ſince what we are about to ſuffer is but part of the puniſhment due to our folly. With ſobriety, and good management, our money would have enabled us to travel comfortably, and at the end of our journey we ſhould have had plenty to ſpare, to have given a treat to our comrades, who have been often kind to us on a like occaſion.</p>
                  <p>I'll never return to the regiment to be laughed at, ſaid Clark mutteringly: I am almoſt famiſhed to death —I'll deſert. Prithee Iſaac, ſaid Wells, look well to thy words, and before thou art tempted to commit a great ſin, aſk thyſelf, how thou ſhalt like to bear the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when thou art ſound out: and if thou ſhouldeſt eſcape being brought to juſtice while on earth, it will find thee out in the day of judgment. Take my word for it, he is the only free, and, I may add, happy man, who is always doing the work of Him who made him. Talk no more of deſertion then, dear Iſaac, let us cear our misfortune like men, and as our catechiſin ſays, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently reſolve to do "our duty in that ſtate of life unto "which it hath pleaſed God to call us."</p>
                  <p>When I was a child, Bee, ſaid Clark, I never learnt my catechiſm; learning, which I have heard thee ſay, has kept thee out of ſo many ſcrapes, I hated; for I was a boy of ſpirit, I loved boxing, five-playing—and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of orchards a deal better th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>So much the worſe for thee Iſaac, a ſober education to a poor man will help him on in the world much more
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:035296_0088_1001BF6B80B8FB78"/>creditably than a little eſtate without it; for lazineſs and drunkenneſs will ſoon bring a pretty property to nothing, and thou mayeſt have heard that

                  </p>
                  <p>Honeſty is the beſt policy, Iſaac, and a good name is better than great riches. Think no more of deſerting then, thou haſt taken the king's money, and a ſtrong oath to ſerve him faithfully, take care, then, that thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Conſider we are all GENTLEMEN ſoldiers, then let us not diſgrace ourſelves by carrying the bloody marks of the rod of correction on our backs; if thou art reſolved to behave ſo as to deſerve puniſhment, don't murmur againſt the laws which muſt inflict it. The laws, Iſaac, are only made to protect honeſt men from the ſnares of villians. —Courage man, don't deſpair of finding a breakfaſt in the morning; mayhap we may meet with ſome good, charitable, well diſpoſed people, to whom we will relate our misfortune, and our diſgrace, for I ſhan't be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to aſk for bread, now my folly has reduced me to aſk for it.</p>
                  <p>This is fine talking, replied Clark, do as thou wilt, Bob, but my pride is above it; in this beggarly ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed condition I'll never join the regiment, to be ſneered and jeered at by every one; ſo I am reſolved to have my own way for once.</p>
                  <p>Then remember, Iſaac, it is a dangerous thing for a man to give himſelf up to the evil of his ways: I am only talking to thee for thy good, and ſince thou art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to have thy own way in every thing, I will only further adviſe thee to think, how thou can'ſt bear puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before thou committeſt a ſin which will ſooner or later bring down the vengeance of the law againſt thee. Have a good heart man, pluck up, that we may be able
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:035296_0089_1001BF6D9297B848"/>to begin our march by break of day; and, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we may meet with ſome kind aſſiſtance on the road; this is a charitable land, Iſaac, and there are few people in it who are not ready to relieve diſtreſs, when it is known to be real; and if we ſhould be repulſed at a ſurly door, we muſt not be angry, and unforgiving, ſince the kind hearts of the wealthy are ſo often impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, by falſe ſtories of misfortunes, that it often ſhuts up their bowels of compaſſion, when real miſery ſtands before them.—Man's nature, Clark, becomes ſuſpicious, when it has often been impoſed upon.</p>
                  <p>My pride now is to meet our regiment before the time of our furlow is expired; it will give us great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with our colonel, who is the very beſt of men, and who, ſeeing that we have made a generous uſe of the power intruſted to us, will not be afraid to indulge us again, at a ſit time. For ſeven years that I have been in the regiment, I have never received an ill word, or an unkind look from my officers, becauſe I always made it my pleaſure to do my duty.</p>
                  <p>My pleaſure then, replied Clark, is to have my own way; I don't care a ruſh for any man, I don't care for the general, I don't care for the colonel, nor I don't care for the captain—ſo I have made up my mind as to that matter—I'll have food whilſt I can eat it—drink when I can get it—and money and pleaſure wherever I can find them.</p>
                  <p>Clark, thou doſt make me tremble ſadly, ſaid Wells, to hear thee talk ſo deſperately; do turn thy thoughts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, for there ſeems to be a ſtrong temptation upon thee—humble thyſelf before him, tell him thou art a miſerable ſinner, and beg his mercy to aſſiſt thee in thy diſtreſs—don't go on adding ſin to ſin; we have been both guilty of an heinous fault; let us take this les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of inſtruction out of it, and reſolve to do ſo no more. My father was an honeſt laborer, and he uſed to tell all his children, that drunkenneſs was ſure to bring three
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:035296_0090_1001BF6FA09F5568"/>evils to every laboring man, namely.—ſickneſs, hunger, and rags; beſides no ſin makes the heart ſo hard as drunkenneſs. A drunkard is without pity, ſince he can behold his wife and children dying of famine, becauſe his own beaſtly appetite muſt have its fill of liquor at the village alehouſe.</p>
                  <p>Thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rt preaching to a deaf man, interrupted Clark, I'll have my own way I tell thee again and again; it is time enough to rail againſt pleaſure, when one has no power left to enjoy it.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt live to repent thy ſayings, take my word for it, ſaid Wells; for my part I would rather eat a hard cruſt for my dinner, than dine with the officers on roaſt beef and plum pudding, if I muſt do dirty work to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. I would dine with any man, ſaid Clark, who would give me a dinner, and drink with any man that would offer me his cup, though, perhaps, he did expect a little underhand buſineſs of me in return; I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſerve myſelf, Bob, and there's an end of my chapter.</p>
                  <p>And a ſorrowful ending it is, anſwered Wells, and ſo good night; drawing ſome of the looſe hay about him, and placing his knapſack under his head for a pillow: I ſhall ſay my prayers, Iſaac, for if I am taken off in my ſleep, it is a good thing for a man to have had his laſt waking thoughts employed on the goodneſs of God.</p>
                  <p>Wells ſlept ſweetly, till the riſing ſun ſhining on his face awakened him: he called aloud to his companion, telling him it was time to prepare for their journey; he called again and again, but ſtill no anſwer was made him; he then roſe to go in ſearch of him, but he was no where to be found.</p>
                  <p>After waiting his return for near an hour, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he did not appear, he ſet forward on his journey; after travelling ſome miles he began to find hunger very keen, and ſeeing a low farm houſe at a diſtance, he ſtruck acroſs a field and made up to it. Wells rapped at the
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:035296_0091_1001BF73488EEB00"/>door, which being opened by the miſtreſs of the houſe, he very modeſtly aſked her to give him a cup of whey, or a draught of ſmall beer, for he was a good deal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Diſtreſſed—aye, to be ſure, ſaid ſhe, the times are ſo hard, the world is full of diſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>The hardneſs of the times, ma'am, ſaid Wells, has nothing to do with my diſtreſs, ſince it is all the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of my own folly.</p>
                  <p>You muſt be an extraordinary man, Maſter Soldier, ſaid Mrs. Jenkins, to confeſs that your own crimes have brought you to hunger.</p>
                  <p>I tell you nothing but the truth, ſaid Wells, and hungry as I am, I would not impoſe a lie upon you, to obtain the beſt mouthful in your houſe; people in general rail at the badneſs of the times, when nine times out of ten they owe their miſery to their extravagance; two nights ago my fellow traveller, and myſelf, accidently fell into bad company, we got drunk, and we loſt our money; I have a journey of more than forty miles to make, and I have not a ſixpence left to furniſh me with proviſions.</p>
                  <p>Follow me to the kitchen, ſaid the good woman, and I will give you the beſt my houſe affords; I love a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to my heart, becauſe he fights for my country; but when I find a ſoldier to be a chriſtian, I love him to my ſoul, becauſe our country may ſtand a better chance to be preſerved from the enemy in time of war, if our ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are chriſtians; and ſince, my honeſt friend, you ha'n't the courage to tell a lie to God, I'm certain ſure you'll never fail in doing your duty towards your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                  <p>Wells now fed heartily on ſome cold pork and cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage, and drank prudently of an excellent mug of cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſtood before him.</p>
                  <p>After ſilently thanking the Giver of all good for a bleſſing ſo little expected, and ſo little deſerved, he was about to take his leave of his kind hoſteſs, when a huſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:035296_0092_1001C0B99514AAE0"/>was heard in the paſſage, and ſoon after the room was filled by a croud of people, in the midſt of whom Wells ſaw his unfortunate comrade Clark, with his hands tied behind him. His heart now miſgave him, and it was as clear to him as the light, before it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to him, that Clark had been as good as his word, and would have his own way let come on't what would. He was as pale as death, his jaws trembled, and the tears ran down his cheeks.</p>
                  <p>The farmer now explained to his wife that they had taken the villain who laſt night would have robbed the poſt-chaiſe, but was prevented by a gentleman within it, who let fly a brace of piſtols at him, which made him keep his diſtance; that early this morning, as he was riding to market, he himſelf had been attacked by him, before it was light, but ſome of the neighbors coming to his aſſiſtance, they determined to purſue the rogue, and came up with him about two miles off, as he was entering an alehouſe. I have ſent to the ſquire's, added the farmer, to advertiſe the gentleman who is at his houſe, that the robber is taken, and I hope he will ſoon be here.</p>
                  <p>Here poor Clark wept bitterly: Ah! Bob, Bob! ſaid he, ſpying Wells, had I taken thy kind advice, I ſhould never have been brought to this—I ſhould have lived like a man, and died like a chriſtian, but Lord have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon me, what have I brought myſelf to! I have brought my life into danger, and may be have ruined my own ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Honeſt Wells was grieved at heart: O Iſaac! cried he, could I have preſerved thee from ſuch a grievous misfortune, I would have ſhared my laſt morſel with thee; my prayers are now all I can offer thee, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y prayer only thou can'ſt ſerve thyſelf, for the prayer of a penitent, even when offered up in a priſon, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: If by timely repentance, Iſaac thou can'ſt win the favor of Heaven, thou wilt find comfort under every affliction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="unknown:035296_0093_1001BF766A001EF8"/>
Here the gentleman arrived whoſe carriage had been ſtopped the preceding evening: Clark no ſooner caught a glimpſe of him than he knew him to be his own colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. A man whom every perſon in the regiment loved and honored as a parent, O my gracious father! ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Clark, ſeeing this honorable gentleman enter, my puniſhment is already greater than I can bear, if I have offended the man I would die to ſerve. He then faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, but a little warm ale being given him, he ſoon recovered, when the noble colonel ſpoke ſo mildly, and kindly to him, that Mrs. Jenkins put her apron to her eyes.</p>
                  <p>Here Wells related to the colonel what had paſſed, he ſhook like an aſpen leaf, when he came to relate the ſorrowful adventures which befel them at the Green Dragon, and all the grief and affliction which had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen him in conſequence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Wells had finiſhed his ſtory—your father, Clark, ſaid the colonel, could not feel more concern at your preſent ſituation than I do: I have always regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every man in my regiment as my ſon, for I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways tried to win their affection by kindneſs rather than inforce their obedience by ſeverity. A man of true cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, Clark, abhors the thought of a baſe action, but if he lives without principle in his heart, he muſt not be ſurpriſed, if ſooner or later he is betrayed by his paſſions into the blackeſt ſins; and if he is taken in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of a crime he muſt expect to pay the penalty of the law.</p>
                  <p>Poor Clark groaned and wept bitterly, while the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel thus continued—I am thankful that I wounded no man, when I fired my piſtol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> on being ſtopped laſt night in my carriage. As the night was much too dark for me to be able to give evidence as to the identity of the perſon who ſtopped me, you may expect, Clark, that no bill of indictment will be preferred againſt you by me; it is a moſt dreadful thing for any man to take an oath,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:035296_0094_1001A2FAE510F7C8"/>when he is not poſitive as to the fact he is going to ſwear to: the farmer, I fear, from having ſecured your perſon, has certain evidence to bring againſt you, but that is a buſineſs in which I have no right to interfere, as your examination muſt take place before a neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtice of the peace. Whether the fact be, or be not proved againſt you, here is a title to ſupport you, in caſe you ſhould get your diſcharge, that you may not plead your wants as an excuſe for committing ſuch a dreadful outrage againſt ſociety. After what is paſt it will be highly improper to admit you again into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment; in future <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>arn to labor with diligence, live ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, then you will live honeſtly; be ſteady and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in attending on all the duties which your church enjoins you—learn to fear God, honor the king, and be juſt to your neighbor.</p>
                  <p>Tears now filled the eyes of all preſent, Mrs. Jenkins ſobbed aloud, and every one declared, they had never heard ſo moving a ſermon in their born days; they all ſaid, what a fine thing ſcholarſhip was when applied to chriſtian uſes, and what a pity it was the noble colonel could not be made a biſhop.</p>
                  <p>The colonel condeſcended to ſpeak to Wells as kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as if he had been his equal. As for you, honeſt Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, ſaid he, your ſteady conduct has long been the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my obſervation, and my praiſe amongſt all my brother officers; the ſobriety of your life, and your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity at church makes you always ready in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of your duty. I have long had it in my tho'ts to procure you ſome promotion, without being able to obtain the means. An occaſion has preſented itſelf in your abſence: Serjeant Jefferſon is dead, and I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his place for you. I know you can both write and caſt accounts well: In this poſt I doubt not but you will exerciſe power with as much humility, as you have hitherto practiſed obedience with cheerfulneſs; and ſince this little affray has cauſed you much diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:035296_0095_1001C0C99DA3CC90"/>and much delay on your journey, I will pay your fare, and your expenſes in the ſtage-coach, which I find will paſs this afternoon, that agreeably to your intentions you may join the regiment before the time of your fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low is expired, in order that your conduct may ſtand as an example to your comrades, that having been intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with power, you had too high a ſenſe of duty to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe it.</p>
                  <p>What makes the end of this little ſtory very moving, and very inſtructive is, that while Wells, for his honeſty and good conduct, was enabled by his colonel to finiſh his journey by the coach; at the very moment in which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <head>THE HISTORY OF CHARLES JONES, THE FOOTMAN.</head>
                  <byline>WRITTEN BY HIMSELF.</byline>
                  <p>MY Father, George Jones, commonly called Black George, on account of his ſwarthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, was one of the moſt induſtrious men in the whole village.—His cottage, which was his own, and partly built by his own hands, ſtands on the Common, about a ſtone's caſt from the road, near the great oak-tree, in the pariſh of King's Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in ſomerſetſhire.—The lord of the manor having granted him leave to incloſe a bit of the common for a garden, my father had got a thriving young orch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and a long ſtrip of potatoes, beſides his cottage, all the produce of his own induſtry. It uſed to be a favorite ſaying with him, that no man, to whom God had given two hands, had ever need to want. "For my part, ſays he, I never knew what want was.— When I am ſick, the club ſupports me; and when I am well. I warrant I'll ſupport myſelf." My mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, beſides being equally induſtrious, was much more religious, and therefore much happier. She was as good and as ſweet tempered a woman as any in the world, be the next where ſhe will. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy at her place of worſhip, civility to her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, cleanlineſs in her own perſon, her houſe, and her children, ſhe had not her fellow. But the moſt remarkable thing in her (I am afraid a very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing) was her ſteady and uninterrupted practice of family prayer. It muſt have been a hard day's
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:035296_0098_1001BF88B80913D8"/>work indeed that hindered her from her prayers.— At ſix in the morning, and eight in the evening, as regularly as ever the hour came, ſhe always knelt down, with her children round her (four of us) and read with great ſolemnity and devotion, a ſhort form given her by the clergyman, which concluded with the Lord's prayer, in which we all joined. And ſhe uſed to ſay after ſhe had finiſhed—"Now I can go to bed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap> work in peace; for now we may hope God will protect us."—I am ſorry to ſay my father ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom joined with us. He uſed to pretend he was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy or tired; and yet it would not have detained him long neither, for we were never more than ſix min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes about it, and ſurely twelve minutes a day (ſix in the morning &amp; ſix in the evening) is no great time to give to God. One thing has often ſtruck me, that if any thing went wrong, and ruffled my dear mother's temper, or made her uneaſy, the prayers ſeemed to ſet it all to rights. When ſhe had been to prayers, all her grief ſeemed to be fled away. And, indeed, I obſerved the ſame thing with reſpect to my father; if he ever did join with us, it always ſeemed ſomehow to compoſe and ſweeten his mind, and make him a great deal kinder to my mother and us.</p>
                  <p>As my father and mother were very induſtrious themſelves, they were very deſirous to make their children ſo; every child was employed, as ſoon as he was able, in ſomething or other. At about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of age, my employment had been for ſome time to weed in the parſon's garden, and run of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands for him. At fourteen he took me into his houſe, and not a little proud was I at obtaining the title of his "little footman." The morning I left my father's cottage, my dear mother, who was as kind as ſhe was good, appeared to be very much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; ſhe ſaid ſhe could not commit me to the wide world, without firſt committing me to God, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:035296_0099_1001BF8B03685C38"/>it; and then ſhe knelt down with me by her ſide, and prayed, "Gracious Lord, be pleaſed to have mercy on my dear boy. To thy care I commend him. Guard him, I beſeech thee, in the many temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations he is now beginning to encounter. May he with ſolid piety and honeſt diligence do his duty in that ſtate of life in which it hath pleaſed thee to place him." She then gave me her bleſſing, put a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into my pocket, bid me fear God, and always act for my maſter as I would do for myſelf.</p>
                  <p>In my new ſituation there were, to be ſure, ſome ſew things diſagreeable. My miſtreſs was peeviſh and fretful; the cook violent and paſſionate. But what ſervice is there, or indeed, what ſituation in life, howſoever much above ſervitude, in which there is not ſomething unpleaſant. Every ſtate has its trials: ſervants have theirs; but if they cannot learn to put up with ſome little inconveniences, they may charge their places every year of their lives, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſatisfied after all. This is a leſſon I have learnt by long experience.</p>
                  <p>Though, by God's bleſſing, I had received a more religious education than moſt children, it yet ſoon appeared that I had many faults, which it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for me to be corrected of before I could become a good ſervant. At firſt, when I was ſent upon an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, I was much given to loitering. I was then too young to conſider that by loitering in errands, I was waſting what was not my own, my maſter's time.— Beſides this fault, as every thing which I ſaw and heard in my maſter's houſe, was ſuch as I had never ſeen and heard before. I was too apt to talk of it to my old play-fellows, or at the village ſhop. But as ſoon as ever I became a little older, I began to reflect that this was very wrong. One Sunday evening, whon I had leave to go home to ſee my parents, I was beginning to tell my mother how there had been
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035296_0100_1001BF906729A280"/>a great uproar at the parſonage the day before about —. Here ſhe put her hand upon my lips, and ſaid, "Charles, not a word more of what has paſſed at the parſonage. Whatſoever happens in your maſter's houſe is never to be ſpoken of out of your maſter's doors. A tale-bearing ſervant is always an unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervant; he betrays the truſt which his maſter puts in him."</p>
                  <p>My mother's vehemence ſurprized me a little, but it made ſo much impreſſion upon me that I was pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well broken of the fault from that very time. Into how many ſcrapes has this talkative temper brought many ſervants of my acquaintance! There was poor Nick Jarrett, the Squire's under footman, that loſt his place, a new ſuit of black broad cloth, and a lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of five pounds, which he would ſoon have had by reaſon of his maſter's death, only for ſaying at a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor's houſe, that his miſtreſs ſometimes fell aſleep while the ſquire was reading to the family on a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night.</p>
                  <p>Nick and I were at one time rather too intimate; I remember one day, when I was about ſixteen, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attended my maſter to the Squire's houſe, Nick prevailed on me after dinner to play with him at pitch and toſs. I was worth at that time five ſhillings and two-pence, more money than I had ever poſſeſſed before in my life. In about two hours Nick reduced me to my laſt ſhilling. But though it was a heavy ſtroke at the time; yet it proved in the end a happy event, for, by my mother's perſuaſions, I reſolved thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward never to game again as long as I lived, which reſolution, by God's grace, I have hitherto happily kept. I wiſh from my heart that all other ſervants would reſolve the ſame. The practice of card-play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo common amongſt ſervants in large families, is the worſt cuſtom they could poſſibly fall into.—My poor brother Tom ſuffered enough for it. One day,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035296_0101_1001BF96E44EB550"/>having received in the morning a quarter's wages, he loſt the whole of it before night at All-fours; and what was the conſequence?—Why, from that very time, he took to thoſe practices of cheating his maſter which ended in his ruin. How much better would it be for all ſervants, if inſtead of waſting their leiſure in card-playing, they would amuſe themſelves in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome godly book, or improve themſelves in writing or cyphering. It was by this means, for I was nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er taught to write, that I qualified myſelf for the place of Bailiff, which I now fill.</p>
                  <p>I remember Nick uſed to ſay, "Whilſt my maſter plays cards in the parlour, why ſhouldſt thou be ſo ſqueamiſh as not to play in the kitchen." But Nick did not conſider that his maſter being rich, and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſmall ſums, his loſſes laid him under no temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of diſhoneſty in order to repair them; beſides, the Squire could read and write at any time, whereas this was our only leiſure time, and if we did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ourſelves than we never could; what might be comparatively innocent in him, might be ruinous to us. And even if my maſter be a profeſſed gambler, that is no reaſon I ſhould be ſo too. A ſervant is to do what is right, let his maſter do what he will. If a maſter ſwears and gets drunk, and talks at table with indecency, or againſt God and religion, to God he muſt account for it, and a ſorry account it will be I doubt; but his example will not excuſe our crimes, though it will aggravate his. We muſt take care of our own ſouls, whether our maſters take care of theirs or not.</p>
                  <p>But to return to my hiſtory; I am aſhamed to ſay that I was guilty more than once in the earlier part of my ſervitude, of the ſhocking and deteſtable crime of lying in order to excuſe or ſcreen my faults.— Happily I was cured of it in the following manner: Having been one day ordered to carry a bottle of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035296_0102_1001BF9A9A73BA80"/>wine to a ſick man, one of my maſter's pariſhioners, I accidentally broke the bottle, and of courſe, loſt the wine. What was to be done? Should I confeſs my misfortune and acknowledge my careleſſneſs, or conceal it by a lie? After ſome deliberation, I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon the lie. I therefore had made up my ſtory, "how the poor man ſent his duty to my maſter, and thanked him a thouſand times, and that he was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better, and that his wife ſaid ſhe thought this wine would ſave his life." Being thus prepared, as I was returning home, I met a pedlar, of whom I bought for a penny a little book, containing a ſtory of a woman at Devizes, who was ſtruck dead on the ſpot for tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a lie. To be ſure it was heaven that ſent the pedlar to me, to ſave me from the ſin I was going to commit. "If this woman was ſtruck dead for a lie," ſaid I to myſelf, "why may not I?"—I therefore went directly home, and made a confeſſion of my neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and misfortune. And it was well for me I did; for the ſick man, whoſe duty and thanks I had wickedly intended to carry my maſter, was dead, as I underſtood afterwards, three hours before the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle was broken. From this time, therefore, I began to ſee what I am now fully convinced of, that beſides the ſinfulneſs of lying, it was always more for the intereſt and laſting comfort of ſervants, to conſeſs the truth at once, than to conceal a fault by falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. When a ſervant has told a lie, he is always in danger of its being found out, and ſooner or later it generally is ſound out, and then his character is rumed. Whereas, if he confeſſes the truth at once, he probably eſcapes without any anger at all, or it worſt it is ſoon over, and the fault itſelf is forgotten.</p>
                  <p>Having now lived ſeven years at the parſonage, &amp; being twenty-one years of age, my maſter called me one day into his ſtudy, where he ſpent a good deal of his time, and ſaid to me, "Charles, you have lived
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035296_0103_1001A2FCE56F5408"/>with me a conſiderable time, and it has been always with much pleaſure that I have remarked the decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſobriety and diligence of your conduct. Thoſe few faults which you have, farther experience and more years will I doubt not, cure. You are now qualified for a better place than mine, and are enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to higher wages than it is in my power to give. I have therefore recommended you to a friend of mine in London, for which place you are to ſet out, if you approve it, in a month. But I ſhould think it a crime to diſmiſs you to a ſituation ſo full of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, without giving you ſome little advice. Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, therefore, my dear Charles, to what I ſhall ſay as I mean it only for your good. In the firſt place fear God, and then you will never have any occaſion to be afraid of man. Act always as in his preſence. Never enter or quit your bed without prayer. Do always for your maſter, as you would your maſter, if you were to change places, ſhould do for you. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to get a pious friend, but avoid, as you would the plague, all wicked company. Be cautious of too great familiarity with your female fellow-ſervants; an unlawful intercourſe of this kind will ruin you, body and ſoul. Flee from an ale-houſe as you would from the Devil; if you once get into it, you will never be out of it. Keep your money and your money will keep you. Here, Charles, is a bible for you; the more you read it, the more you will love it, and the more you love it, the better you will be and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier. I have written ſome directions for you in the firſt page of it. God! leſs you; and when my race which is now drawing to its end, ſhall finiſh, may we meet in heaven." My maſter's kindneſs ſo affected me, that I could not anſwer him for tears. I was indeed very glad of going to ſo fine a place as Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, though, at the ſame time. I could not leave a houſe where I had been treated more like a child
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035296_0104_1001BF9E1D3416E8"/>than a ſervant, without great regret. I ſhall not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to deſcribe my parting with my mother. No deſcription, I am ſure, could do juſtice to the ſolemn and affectionate manner in which ſhe exhorted me to be pious and juſt, and recommended me to God in prayer. Her laſt words I ſhall never forget. "I know my dear ſon," ſaid ſhe, "that you love me ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and that you would not give me unneceſſary pain on any account. Remember then, that whenever you do any wrong thing, you are planting a dagger in your mother's heart." With theſe words, her eyes brim full of tears, and her hands lifted up in ſilent prayer, to God ſhe turned away from me and went into the cottage.</p>
                  <p>And now, reader, you find me in the great and dangerous city of London, in the ſervice of a very wealthy maſter, who kept twelve ſervants beſides my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. If country people knew London as well as I do, how cautious they would be of exchanging their ſafe and peaceful ſituations in the country, for the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils and temptations of a great city. How many young fellows have I known, who lived honeſtly and happily in their native place, come up to London in hopes of higher wages, and there forfeit their integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, their peace of mind, their health, their charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſouls. Workmen in particular are very fond of getting into large cities, becauſe they think their labour will turn to better account there than in their own villages. They do not conſider that in a city they muſt give as much for a filthy room in a filthy houſe, inhabited by half a dozen families, ſituated in a cloſe, ſmoky, dirty, ſtreet, as in the country would pay the rent of a cottage and a garden. They do not conſider the dearneſs of proviſions in a city, the temptations they are under from bad women, wicked company, and the great number of ale-houſes. In ſhort, I am fully perſuaded that a laborer in the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035296_0105_1001BFA2DB11B7D0"/>country, on a ſhilling a day, is better off than one in the city on two ſhillings.</p>
                  <p>When I came to my place, I found every thing for the firſt three or four days very ſmooth and very pleaſant, plenty of proviſions, plenty of drink, little work, and a very merry ſervant's hall. But ſoon the face of things, with reſpect to me, changed very much, and I underwent a ſeverer temptation than I ever experienced before or ſince in my life. I had always hitherto been taught to conſider that ſobriety and diligence, and piety were virtues. I therefore never ſwore, I never got drunk, I never gamed, I went to church as often as I could, I ſaid my prayers night and morning, and on Sunday at leaſt, if not on other days, I read a little in my good old maſter's bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But here I ſoon found that all this was the worſt vice I could be guilty of. As ſoon as they found me out, it ſeemed to be a trial of ſkill amongſt them who ſhould plague me moſt. One called me the Parſon; another, Methodiſt; a third, a conceited Prig; a fourth, a canting Hypocrite. If I went into any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gentleman's kitchen it was all the ſame; my character always ſlew before me, and many were the jeſts and laughs raiſed both at home and abroad at my expenſe. In ſhort, during three months, my life was a conſtant ſtate of anxiety and torment; ſo that at laſt I was almoſt tempted, God forgive me for the thought, to do as they did, and forfeit my everlaſting ſoul in order to avoid preſent uneaſineſs. But while things were in this ſtate, I felt myſelf greatly and unexpectedly relieved one Sunday morning, by a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon which I happened to hear from our pariſh min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter, on the following text—<hi>Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil of you falsely for my sake, for great is your reward in heaven.</hi> The excellent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which this pious man delivered on theſe words
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035296_0106_1001BFAA62A045E8"/>was ſo exactly ſuited to my circumſtances and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that it ſeemed as if it had been addreſſed ſolely to me; and it pleaſed God ſo to apply what had been ſaid to my heart and underſtanding, that I not only determined to bear in <hi>future</hi> the ſneers and ſcoffs of my fellow-ſervants, with patience and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but even thoſe very ſneers which I formerly conſidered as my heavieſt calamity, were now no longer grievous. From this time, therefore, my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs was pretty well at an end. And I earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommend it to all other ſervants, who have been ſo happy as to acquire ſober and virtuous habits, not to ſuffer themſelves to be laughed out of their ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and virtue, by the jeſts and ridicule of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſervants. They may depend upon it that their cauſe is a good one, and though they ſuffer for it at firſt, they will finally triumph. In a ſhort time all my perſecution was at an end. "To be ſure," ſaid the coachman one day to the cook, "Charles is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle too religious, but upon my word I don't think he is any the worſe for it. Mayhap it might be better for us if we were more like him. I don't ſee but that he is as humble, friendly and worthy a fellow as any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us. For my part I ſhall laugh at him no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger." This ſpeech which I happened accidentally to overhear, gave me great pleaſure, and I ſoon found by the agreeable change in my fellow-ſervants' conduct towards me, that the coachman had expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the opinion of the whole hall. It is true I did every thing to obtain their good-will, that lay in my power. I was as civil and obliging to every one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, as I poſſibly could. Was any thing to be done? If nobody elſe would do it, I never ſtopped to conſider whether it belonged to my place or not, but did it out of hand. If any body took it into his head to fall out with me, I generally diſarmed him of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035296_0107_1001A2FE9B728128"/>his wrath by ſaying nothing. If any little quarrels or misfortunes, or miſconduct, happened in the hall, I always endeavoured to huſh it up, and never car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried any tales to the maſter, unleſs when I ſaw any body wronging him, and then I thought it my duty, or unleſs the thing was very bad indeed. In ſhort by purſuing always this line of conduct, I found my ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation very comfortable and agreeable. My maſter treated me with great confidence and kindneſs: my fellow-ſervants with great friendlineſs and reſpect.</p>
                  <p>In about two years time, the footman that uſed to go to market being turned away for drunkenneſs, which vice ſoon proved his ruin, my maſter told me that as he believed I was an honeſt and careful young man, and perceiving that I could write and keep an account, he ſhould in future employ me in marketing. To market, therefore, I went every day, and as I had now a good deal of my maſter's money always in my hands, I prayed heartily to God that he would be pleaſed to preſerve me under the temptation to which this expoſed me. My firſt exploit in this way was the purchaſe of ten ſhillings worth of fruit at a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erer's. When I had finiſhed my bargain and was coming out of the ſhop, the fruiterer ſlipped a ſhilling into my hand. As I had never to the beſt of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, ſeen him before, I was ſomewhat ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at his generoſity; but fortunately had the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of mind to aſk him whether he had charged his fruit the higher on account of this preſent to me. "Why young man," ſaid he, "that is an honeſt queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I will give you an honeſt anſwer. The fact is, that as we know that gentlemen of your cloth expect ſome complement from the tradeſmen they deal with, we are obliged in our own defence, to charge our articles the higher on that account to their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters." "And ſo," ſaid I, "the money you give us, comes finally from the pockets of our maſters?"—
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035296_0108_1001BFB1A9CD08D8"/>To be ſure it does." "Why then," ſaid I, "I will take your ſhilling, but ſhall charge my maſter only nine ſhillings." And this method I conſtantly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued in the like caſe ever after; for I think the above mentioned practice of footmen, which, however, I hope is not very common with them, is juſt the ſame thing in conſcience as if they ſhould rob their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's bureau.</p>
                  <p>One Monday morning, having ſettled my account for the laſt week with my maſter, I found that he had made a miſtake againſt himſelf of twenty ſhillings. As ſoon as I diſcovered it, I ſaid to myſelf, here now is an opportunity of getting twenty ſhillings without any riſk of detection: but God forbid that I ſhould do it, as it would ruin my peace of mind, &amp; deſtroy my ſoul. I therefore pointed out the error to my maſter the firſt opportunity. "Charles," ſaid he, "you are right, the miſtake is obvious, I acknowledge I made it purpoſely to try your honeſty. You ſhall find that this affair will turn out, before long, to your advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage." Now, though I do not think it quite fair for maſters to lay this kind of trap for their ſervants' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, yet as I know by experience they ſometimes do it, we muſt be doubly on our guard. Indeed diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty is never ſafe; it always will out ſomehow or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I have ſeen ſurpriſing inſtances of the diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of it, when it, ſeemed to have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with ſuch cunning as to be impoſſible to be detected. One day, as I was going to market, I met Sir Robert S's butler, who told me, that having long obſerved my ſobreity and diligence, he was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to have it now in his power to offer me a place in his maſter's family where my wages ſhould be raiſed two guineas a year. I thanked him, and told him he ſhould have his anſwer next evening. In the mean time, I called upon a pious and worthy friend, whom I conſulted in all difficulties, and aſked his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035296_0109_1001BFB713D1F1B0"/>After mature deliberation, he ſaid, "Charles don't go. When you are once got into a good place, ſtick to it like a le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>h. The rolling ſtone gets no moſs. The more years you continue in one ſervice, the more you are reſpected by your maſter and all the world. A good, family conſiders an old ſervant as one of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and can no more ſee him want than a near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whereas ſervants that are continually roving from place to place, have no friend in diſtreſs, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom get a proviſion for old age." Happy it was for me that I followed this good advice. If I had not I ſhould probably been nothing more than a poor footman all my life.</p>
                  <p>But before I bring my own ſtory to an end, I muſt beg my reader's patience, to liſten to the ſad fate of my poor brother Tom. Alas! poor Tom, he was a great favorite in our kitchen, becauſe he ſung the beſt ſong, and told the merrieſt tale, and paid his card money the moſt f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly of any gentleman footman about town. And then he ſwore ſo much like a gentleman, and was ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant to the ladies, and puſhed about the ſtrong beer ſo merrily that he was, ſaid our ſervants, the moſt argee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able company in the world. And yet all thoſe enter-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ning qualities did not preſerve my poor brother from the moſt diſtreſsful ſtate of diſtreſs and ruin. One mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he came to me about ten o'clock with a very woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful face, which was a thing very unuſual for him, and told me that he had juſt been turned away from his place without a character, and that he had no money, many debts, and no real friends, and what was worſe than all, that he was laboring under diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Tom grew worſe every day, and was at length given over. In the morning of that day, while I was ſitting at his bed-ſide, who ſhould come in but my dear mother. She had walked 130 miles, except now and then a liſt in the waggon, to attend upon &amp; comfort her undeſerving ſon. When ſhe ſaw him, pale and emaciated, and his
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035296_0110_1001BFB8B2C26E38"/>face half conſumed by diſeaſe, it ſo ſhocked her that ſhe ſainted away. As ſoon as ſhe recovered, and was a little relieved by a plentiful flood of tears, ſhe ſaid, "my dear Tom, I am come to take care of thee, and make thee better if I can." "Alas! mother," anſwered he, putting his clay-cold hand into her's, "it is all too late. I have but a few hours to live. It is by neglecting your advice that I am brought to this. Gaming and drink, and bad company, and bad women, have been my ruin. O! what will become of my ſoul! If I could but live my life over again." Here he was ſeized with a ſudden fit, and though he lived ſome hours, he never ſpoke after, and died that evening in my mother's arms.</p>
                  <p>After recounting the ſorrowful hiſtory of my unhappy brother, I muſt now haſten to conclude my own. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a twelvemonth after the offer of a place in Sir Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert S—'s family, my maſter, in conſideration, as he ſaid, of my faithful ſervices, made me his butler. He was indeed ſo kind and friendly to me on all occaſions, that I found it neceſſary to be extremely cautious leſt I ſhould grow proud, or ſaucy, or familiar, which ſome ſervants, when they live long in a place, and find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in favor, are apt to do. After enjoying this poſt about ſix years, our family being now removed into the country, I made acquaintance with a farmer's daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter living near the great houſe, whom, on account of her religious and induſtrious principles, and her amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and cheerful temper, I wiſhed to make my wife. She was no flaunter in fine cloaths, none of your dancing, flirting, forward laſſes, that run about to chriſtenings, and revels, and hops, that will ruin a man before he knows where he is; but a pious, ſober, ſtay-at-home, induſtrious young woman; elſe I am ſure any body might have had her for me. As I had never been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any unneceſſary expenſe, for nobody will call that unneceſſary which I ſent yearly to my parents, my ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the intereſt being added yearly to the principal in
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035296_0111_1001BFBB39AB8CC0"/>the hands of my maſter, amounted to 200 pounds. And as Fanny's father promiſed to give her another hundred, I thought we might with this take a ſmall farm, and maintain ourſelves comfortably and decently. I therefore communicated the affair to my maſter.— "Charles," ſaid he, "though I am loth to part with ſo good a ſervant, yet I think it an act of gratitude due to you for your long and faithful ſervices, to conſent to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing which may be for your welfare. But I do not think it neceſſary to part at all. I am at preſent in want of a bailiff. You may, if you approve it, undertake that office and ſtill retain your preſent wages. Your father-in-law, who is an experienced farmer, will inſtruct and aſſiſt you in the duties of it. I will, beſides, let you a ſmall farm on an advantageous leaſe, which you may make the moſt of for yourſelf.</p>
                  <p>To this kind and generous offer I joyfully aſſented. And Fanny and myſelf have now lived together ſix years in the farm-houſe, near the park-gate, happy and proſperous. My father being dead, and my brother and ſiſter ſettled, my mother, who is now very old, lives with me, and by her example and exhortation, I find a ſenſe or religion ſink deeper and deeper into my ſoul everyday; and, indeed, I am firmly convinced by long experience, that there is nothing in this world can make us truly happy but that.</p>
                  <p>I addreſs this little book, which I wrote by little and little in the long evenings of the laſt hard winter, to all footmen. I hope they will not be angry with my well-meant endeavours, but take kindly what is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only for their good.</p>

We young me indeed were ſent to church; but as we had no examples ſet us by the heads of the family going thither themſelves, Potter and I generally hired a gig and daſhed away from one tea-drinking place to another; theſe ſcenes ſoon made me loſe all reſpect for virtue and religion. It was at the Dog and Duck I firſt ſaw the infamous Miſs Weſt; ſhe was many years older than myſelf: her perſon was as love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as her heart was wicked. She was no ſooner infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that I was to come into poſſeſſion of 3000 <abbr>l.</abbr> the day I came of age, than ſhe made uſe of all her deceitful arts to enſnare both my ſoul and body, as ſhe often promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to defraud my maſter to ſupply her extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance. My attachment to Miſs Vincent was now on 01 the decline, for Miſs Weſt had ſo far wrought upon my vanity, as to make me belive that ſo handſome a young fellow as I was, ſhould look higher than a tradeſman's daughter, from that moment I treated Miſs Vincent with the moſt marked neglect, although I ſaw my conduct cut her to the heart; yet, at the ſame time was I baſe enough to borrow money of her, which I wantonly ſquandered away on Miſs Weſt.</p>
                  <p>When Potter's apprenticeſhip expired, inſtead of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving his fortune by throwing it into trade, he plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at once into all the vices of the town. He poſſeſſed a plauſible kind of prate, which cauſed him to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Chairman to our Club, which was chiefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of clerks and apprentice boys. Potter's principal excellence conſiſted in ſinging a merry ſong, telling an indecent ſtory, and teaching his heaters to laugh at mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and ſet all religion at defiance; ſer religion, he maintained, was only an old woman's tale, invented by cunning heads to keep children and fools in order.</p>
                  <p>There was an honeſt old porter lived in our family,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035296_0114_1001BFC626671DA0"/>who for ſome time had ſet himſelf to watch my conduct, and at length he made ſuch a faithful report of it to my maſter, that he gave up my indentures, and turned me out of doors.</p>
                  <p>I was too much delighted with my liberty to feel any ſenſe of ſhame at the means by which I obtained it.</p>
                  <p>I was ſorry, however, to break off entirely with Miſs Vincent, for I ſtill had a lurking affection for her; I told Potter ſo: his inventive genius ſoon laid a plan whereby I might get her into my power, and take a complete revenge on her whole family at the ſame time. This was by writing her a letter, ſetting forth the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of my love, the unmerited diſgrace I had received from her family, and at the ſame time requeſting her to grant me a private meeting, in order that I might juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify my conduct to her, as otherwiſe I feared the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of my paſſion would drive me to a fit of deſpair.</p>
                  <p>This poor imprudent girl met me at the time and place appointed. I will not here ſhock my readers with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the vile ſtratagems I made uſe of to complete the ruin of this young lady, nor the tremendous oaths I ſwore to repair her wrongs by marriage, as ſoon as I came of age, which would be in a very few months; this ſomewhat abated her ſorrow for the very indiſcreet ſtep ſhe had taken.</p>
                  <p>The day I became of age, I went down into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. My friends having been apprized of my profligate life, received me very coldly. I practiſed the deepeſt hypocriſy on my good mother, to make her believe I was quite a reformed man, in order to wheedle her out of a ſum of money, telling her at the ſame time, I had an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate proſpect of entering into a very profitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern with a partner of great reſponſibility, if I could but increaſe my capital.</p>
                  <p>"Frank," ſaid ſhe, with firmneſs, "there is no truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to your promiſes; as long as your conduct deſerved my love, you ever ſound me an indulgent mother; but you ſhall never have cauſe to ſay, I acted towards you
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035296_0115_1001BFC88AF4E6B0"/>like a weak woman, by robbing my virtuous children, to ſupply the wanton extravagance of a profligate ſon.—Your wicked life, Frank, has nearly broken my heart, but it ſhall not ſhake my juſtice." The well known ſteadineſs of my mother's temper convinced me at once ſhe was not further to be impoſed upon by the fallacy of my arguments.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as I had ſettled my buſineſs, I returned to London to Miſs Vincent, who had waited for me with the utmoſt patience, fully expecting I was come to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil my promiſe of marriage to her. "I can ſtruggle with want, dear Frank," ſaid ſhe, "but I will never conſent to live in ſhame." Nothing I am certain hardens the heart like vice, for although this poor young creature was brought into a very trying ſituation by the proſpect of her ſoon becoming a mother, I ſwore I would never make <hi>her</hi> my <hi>wife,</hi> who had diſgraced herſelf by living with me as a <hi>mistress.</hi> On hearing this, in all the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der agonies of grief, ſhe urged me to repair the wrongs I had done her, reminding me at the ſame time, of the wicked arts I had made uſe of to beguile her of her innocence, and then with claſped hands and ſtreaming eyes, ſhe threw herſelf on her knees before me, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to pity the agonies which rent her ſoul, yet ſtill my hardened nature was untouched by her ſorrow; again I ſolemnly ſwore I never would marry her.</p>
                  <p>Through exceſs of grief ſhe fainted away, in which pitiable ſtate I left her to the care of a ſervant, went out and ſpent the reſt of the evening with Miſs Weſt, whoſe flinty heart turned into ridicule the ſorrowful tale I related to her.</p>
                  <p>On returning to my lodgings the next morning, I was informed Miſs Vincent had left them without leaving behind her the leaſt information where ſhe was to be found, and much did I rejoice when I heard it, that ſhe had taken herſelf off ſo quietly.</p>
                  <p>I now laviſhed my money as though it would never have an end. By all I was eſteemed the moſt noble ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035296_0116_1001BFCEDF7957B0"/>fellow in the world, and even little wits would be ſilent in my preſence, becauſe I was ſure to pay for the wine upon which they were to riot. My caſh at length beginning to run low, as I had been all along drawing from the principal, I adviſed with Potter how to get furniſhed with future ſupplies. He adviſed the gaming table as a never failing friend, ſaying, it had long ſince been the only reſource from whence he derived his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>I took his advice and for ſome months was ſo ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that I began to daſh away in higher life at the Weſt end of the town.—I bought an elegant phaeton, which I drove every Sunday in Hyde Park, with Miſs Weſt by my ſide. One day as I was driving furiouſly through Temple Bar, I had the misfortune to overturn a poor man with a heavy load on his back; on his get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up, I perceived him to be Mr. Vincent's old por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to whom I formerly owed my diſgrace.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! ah! what, is it you young hopeful?" cried he, on ſeeing to whom he owed his misfortune, "well, he muſt needs go whom the devil drives; thy prancing nags may die a natural death, maſter Frank, but veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I think 'tis more than thou wilt, boy, for if thou dieſt in thy ſhoes, the gallows will be robbed of its due. What is become of poor Patty Vincent, thou profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate dog, haſt thou broken her heart, as thou haſt that of her poor afflicted parents!"</p>
                  <p>The ſudden recollection of that unfortunate girl cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuch a ſwimming in my head, that the reins dropt from my hands, my horſes took fright, and it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a miracle that I get home alive.—The porter's words had made ſuch an impreſſion on my mind that I could not ſhake them off. Soon after, Potter calling upon me, I told him of my interview with the old por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and alſo the effect it had on me. "Frank," ſaid he, "if a fellow of thy ſpirit can be thus eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by qualms of conſcience, let us inſtantly adjourn to the tavern, ſince good wine is the beſt remedy in the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035296_0117_1001BFD427033690"/>world to drown all uneaſy recollections in." I gladly accepted his propoſal: we called a coach, and off we went. He no ſooner ſaw my ſpirits inflamed with wine, than he drew me to the gaming table, where, before morning, I loſt every ſhilling I had in the world; I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Potter to lend me 50 guineas, as he had won more than 200 of me.</p>
                  <p>Laughing heartily, he told me, it had ever been a maxim with him, never to lend his money to a man who had not prudence to keep his own; "but, harkee, Frank," ſaid he, "I'll give thee my beſt advice gratis: ſuch a noble ſpirited young fellow as thou art, needs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be at a loſs for money while he can ſnap a trigger, and the highway is left open for him to practiſe upon. Men who follow the ſame courſe of pleaſure, are the laſt people in the world to help each other in the hour of diſtreſs; virtuous men, Frank, only feel for the wants of their friends, and they alone find pleaſure in reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them." He then whiſtled himſelf off.</p>
                  <p>When I got home, I ſat revolving in my mind how to get myſelf out of my preſent difficulties, when in a fatal moment, Satan whiſpered in my ears the word FORGERY. At firſt I ſtarted at the thought, but my poverty was clamorous, my pride ſtartled at diſgrace, although my conſcience did not ſhudder at the crime. I know I could copy Mr. Vincent's hand exactly, I ſnatched up the pen to draw a bill upon him for 500 <abbr>l.</abbr> but a cold ſhivering ſeizing me, it dropt from my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, a ſtrong ſenſe of my guilt now overtook me, I tore what I had written to pieces, and exclaimed, I am a free man again; and for a moment felt thankful that I had been enabled to reſiſt the violence of temptation. I ſat pondering, however, how I ſhould maintain myſelf; again I was aſſaulted with the dread of poverty, and again I ſnatched up the pen, drew the fatal bill, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly went and got it accepted.</p>
                  <p>But the moment I ſought to take reſt at night on my pillow, I felt as if all the horrors of hell had ſeized me.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035296_0118_1001BFD865F56070"/>I jumped out of bed in my ſleep, and was going to throw myſelf out of the window, having dreamt that I was apprehended, the people of the houſe, awakened by my cries, ran into the room, concluding ſome villains had broken in, and were going to murder me.</p>
                  <p>I never afterwards went into the ſtreet, but my fears told me I was the ſubject of converſation of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple I met. Once I happened to hear one man ſay to another, pointing to a third, "that's he, that's he," I took to my heels, concluding that I myſelf was meant, and ran from one ſtreet to another, without knowing whither, till my ſight failed me, and, through loſs of breath, I dropped down in a fit. Some humane people however, recovered me, and put me into a hackney coach which carried me home.</p>
                  <p>One day, a ſudden guſt of wind blew open my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber door, again I concluded the officers were coming to take me. Snatching up the poker to defend myſelf, I ſwore I would not be taken alive, when turning about ſuddenly, I caught a glimpſe of myſelf in the glaſs, my eyes looked wild, my lips quivered, my jaws dropped, my teeth chattered, and my body ſhook, as though the laſt agonies of death were upon me. On finding I was once more become the dupe of my fears, my ſpirits ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied again, I dreſſed and went to the play; there I met Sally Weſt, whom I had not ſeen for ſome weeks; for, to ſay the truth, I dreaded to meet an old acquaintance from the time I committed the forgery: after the play, we went off together to ſup at a tavern<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we had not been there a quarter of an hour when ſhe made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for quitting the room; in about ten minutes ſhe returned to me, expreſſing in the tendereſt terms the ſatisfaction ſhe had to ſee me again.</p>
                  <p>We were, as I believed, juſt going to ſet down to ſupper, when the waiters came in followed by two of Sir John Fielding's men. Immediately with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt coolneſs, Miſs Weſt aroſe, and laying her hand on my ſhoulder exclaimed, "the Philiſtines be upon thee
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035296_0119_1001BFE12B7FB630"/>Sampſon. Gentlemen," continued ſhe to the officers, "this is my good friend Mr. Francis H—of whom you have been ſometime in ſearch. Perhaps, Frank," continued ſhe, "you do not know that your forgery is diſcovered, and that 100 <abbr>l.</abbr> reward is offered for taking you, when I left the room juſt now it was to write a note to theſe gentlemen, ſignifying to them where you were to be found; I ſee you are terrified, but hear me for the laſt time perhaps, and you will the leſs wonder at my conduct. Early in life, Frank, I was betrayed to ruin, by a baſe deſigning man; my reputation once blaſted, I was deſerted by all the virtuous part of my own ſex; by having had examples always before my eyes, I ſoon became hardened in ſin and abandoned to ſhame. I have lately contracted debts; if they are not immediately diſcharged I ſhall be ſent to a jail; this jail I know not how to avoid but by ſending you thither in my ſtead; as the reward offered for taking you will juſt ſet me free from my creditors."</p>
                  <p>I was ſtruck motionleſs with terror, and fainted away on the officers approaching to tie my hands behind me; nor had I the leaſt recollection of what paſſed, till I found myſelf ſafe locked in my priſon. About a week after this, the keeper came to tell me, there was a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner lately brought in who was very deſirous of ſeeing me, and as ſhe appeared an object of great pity, he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conduct me to her. On entering the chamber, I ſaw a young woman very ſhabbily dreſſed, lying on a miſerable bed, in a very weak condition.</p>
                  <p>"Doſt thou not know me, Frank?" ſaid ſhe, in a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low broken voice. Haſt thou loſt all recollection of Patty Vincent." I felt inſtantly as if ſtruck with a thunderbolt. "Merciful Heaven!" cried I, falling on my knees by the bedſide; "I am unable to bear the puniſhment my crimes have brought upon me! O God of mercy ſupport my troubled ſoul." She kindly urged me to be comforted, ſaid ſhe wiſhed not to ſee me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach me for the evils I had brought upon her, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035296_0120_1001BFE582F051C0"/>to tell me with her laſt breath that ſhe forgave me.—"It is not an hour ſince, Frank," continued ſhe, "that I heard you was my fellow-priſoner, and what is worſe at my father's ſuit. I will not reproach you, Frank, I tell you again, for all the miſeries you have brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, becauſe you are a priſoner and in chains. If my breath will hold out, I will endeavor to give you a ſhort hiſtory of myſelf ſince we parted. On your refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to make me your lawful wife, I quitted your lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, reſolving by my labor to eat the bread of induſtry rather than follow a courſe of vice for a wretched ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence. I hired a garret in Holborn, where I applied for needle-work, and ſoon obtained it. In about three months after our ſeparation, my infant came into the world, I ſold my cloaths for my ſupport during my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, but that reſource ſoon failed me. My health and ſtrength declined, I was ſeized with a conſtant fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and cough, and quite unable to ſupply the ſcanty morſel of bread for the day, yet reſolved to die rather than afflict my dear parents with the knowledge of my miſery. At length being too weak to labor, I contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral ſmall debts, for which I was ſeized and brought hither. I have however ſince been prevailed upon to ſend my poor half-furniſhed baby to my parents, hoping they will afford her that bread which her dying mother dared not aſk for herſelf." Obſerving I was ſpeechleſs with agony, poor Patty went on. "I did not wiſh to ſee you, Frank, to afflict you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Here ſhe was interrupted by the unexpected entrance of Mr. and Mrs. Vincent. O ye, who ſhall hereafter read my ſtory, drop a tear of pity at the agony I now endured! They no ſooner beheld their child, than each by turns tenderly embraced her, aſſuring her of their forgiveneſs, and gently chid her, for having concealed herſelf ſo long, adding, that as a penitent child they would moſt gladly have received her, though they would have ſhunned her, if they found her living in proſperous wickedneſs. She thanked them and ſaid,</p>
                  <p>"Mourn not for my death, my deareſt parents, but rather rejoice that I die penitent for my tranſgreſſion, and ſince I have received your bleſſing and forgiveneſs I have but one favor more to aſk in life, which is, that you, my kind father, will extend your pity towards that young man," pointing to me. "O ſave him, if poſſible, from an ignominious death, and remember, that my child is alſo his. My buſineſs in life is done, and now, O Heavenly Father! receive my ſpirit, and pardon my ſin, through Jeſus Chriſt my Redeemer." Here her ſpeech failed her, and after a few convulſive ſtruggles ſhe expired.</p>
                  <p>Great Heaven! is there any puniſhment for me to ſuffer hereafter beyond what I endured at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? A dead ſilence ſucceeded for ſome time, my groans only were heard. As ſoon as Mr. Vincent had ſomewhat recovered the ſhock, he raiſed himſelf from the body of his child, and ſpoke to me as follows:</p>
                  <p>"Behold, O young man, the calamities which thy crimes have brought on my family! Behold, my depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed child lying on the boſom of her fainting mother; yet I am not inſenſible to the agonies which rend thy ſoul, and ſorry am I to add to them, by telling thee, thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent mother went out of her ſenſes, on hoaring thou hadſt committed a crime, by which thou hadſt forfeited
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035296_0122_1001BFEAB52CEE28"/>thy life to the laws of thy country. O Frank! Frank! what deep diſtreſs can one profligate child bring on whole families! Thy crimes, alas! have brought on thy own deſtruction, for I fear it will not be in my power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend thee on thy trial, much as I am diſpoſed to do it in conſideration of thy relations. Too late, Frank, thou muſt now ſee, how fatal an exceſſive love of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure muſt prove to a young tradeſman. Honeſt induſtry is generally a ſure road to wealth; as a ſober, religious life is to happineſs. To thy coſt thou muſt already have experienced, that the wicked can have no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon each other, ſince thou art betrayed and brought to ſhame, by thoſe very friends who firſt led thy youth aſtray."</p>
                  <p>"O Sir," cried I, "few and evil have been my days, but the great God above, who knoweth the ſecrets of all hearts, can alone judge of the ſorrows of mine; it is not, Sir, the puniſhment of death which I fear, but the juſt vengeance of offended Heaven, which muſt follow it; for though a very young man, I am a very old ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Alas! my dear, and honored mother, is it then true, that the crimes of your own child have robbed you of your ſenſes? And yet the merciful hand of God has hitherto withheld his vengeance from ſtriking me dead. To whom ſhall I fly for mercy and pity in my diſtreſs? From the law I cannot expect it, and from the offended Majeſty of high Heaven I dare not hope it, ſince my preſent puniſhment is but the certain wages of my ſin." Here I am told I fell into ſtrong convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion fits, and in that condition was conveyed to my cell.</p>

Although, at the inſtant I write, I am in all the prime of youth, and all the vigor of health, I ſhall this day die a juſt victim to the broken laws; and my precious ſoul may be conſigned over to everlaſting torments, unleſs the great judge of all things will be graciouſly pleaſed to accept my ſorrow for my ſin, through a gracious Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>My days are numbered, my hours are few, and the ſolemn tolling bell will ſoon be ſummoning me to meet my God in judgment.

                     </gap>ow he firſt loſt his place by gaming, and then had well nigh been the death of his wife through the ſame cauſe, and how, laſtly, his gaming was the occaſion of his being tranſported as a convict to Bota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Bay.</head>
                  <p>"I CAN'T, for my life, imagine (ſaid Mr. Smith to his oppoſite neighbor, Mr. Tomſon) what thoſe fellows can be about on the top of my houſe.—They have been theſe two days employed there in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the damage done by the high wind t'other night; a job which I think might have been done in a very few hours." Step over the way to my door," ſaid Tomſon "and I will preſently explain to you why the job is ſo long in hand." Smith did ſo—" turn about and look up," ſaid Tomſon, "and you will ſee the two men ſitting over againſt each other on the ridge of your houſe."—"Why they are playing at cards!" ſaid Smith—"no wonder my buſineſs is ſo long in doing." Away went Smith to the maſter bricklayer to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of his men. The maſter was very angry, as he well might be, and diſmiſſed the idle fellows from his ſervice; and as he made known the ſtory, the men found no one willing to employ them, ſo they had full leiſure for their gaming, and Betſworth loſt all his money with Tricket—Betſworth's wife in vain aſked him for caſh, proviſions were ſcarce, and they had lived on ſhort commons ſeveral days.</p>
                  <p>On Saturday Betſworth had no wages to receive, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035296_0125_1001BFF2563AFE88"/>he deſired his wife would get a bit of meat for a hot Sunday's dinner; "for" ſaid he, "we have lived hardly enough this week, and I ſhall aſk my friend Tricket to eat a bit with us." The wife ſaid nothing, but when her huſband and Tricket came in to dinner on Sunday, ſhe laid the cloth, and ſet upon the table a diſh with a cover. "What haſt thou got under thy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, wife?" ſaid Betſworth, "ſomething nice I hope." "As good as I could get," ſaid the wife, "had you brought me money you ſhould have had ſomething bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter." Upon this he lifted up the cover and behold! the diſh contained nothing but ſome dirty old cards ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about it! "Is this," ſaid Betſworth, "what you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for me and my friend?" "It is all that you and your friend have left us," ſaid ſhe; "I have nothing to eat myſelf, and theſe are the only tools you work with to provide for my maintenance and your own." "Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n the cards," ſaid Betſworth, "they have been the ruin of me: forgive me wife, I deſerve a more bitter reproof." "Tricket," added he, "my poor Molly has ſerved us rightly enough; for my part, I am reſolved to go to my maſter to-morrow, confeſs my fault, and try to get his work again; and I hope God will pardon me for the diſtreſs I have brought upon my family by my love of gaming; and that he will mercifully ſtrengthen me to reſiſt every temptation to return to ſuch a horrid practice."—Tricket did not reliſh the jeſt, but went ſurlily out of the houſe. Betſworth, however, is ſaid to have taken a hint from this little trick of his wife, and, as far as I have heard, he has never ſince been found amongſt the Gameſters.</p>
                  <p>I muſt now proceed to tell you ſomething more of Tricket, who continued his evil practices, and who is the only one of theſe two Gameſters whoſe hiſtory I mean to ſpeak of any farther.</p>

Having loſt his former gull whom he tried once or twice to draw into another game, by ſaying that the man wanted ſpirit, Tricket happened to light upon a ſecond brother gameſter, whom he hoped to drain as he had done Betſworth; but either through a ſad run of ill-luck, or, as I rather think, by his being not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cheated, he ſoon loſt every farthing of his former boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and he had nothing now left for him to ſtake at the next gaming party, except what little he could get by ſtripping his poor wife of the earnings of her hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor.—She had two children of four and five years of age, for whom, as well as herſelf, ſhe contri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed to get bread by taking in waſhing.</p>
                  <p>She bore with patience her huſband's ſpending all he got upon his own pleaſures, and leaving her to ſhift for herſelf; but when he came home and tore from her what ſhe had worked ſo hard for, ſhe could not help weeping and complaining, though her complaints were mild and far from the language of ſcolding; but her brutal huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, inſtead of being moved by her tears, only made them a pretence for running from her to the ale-houſe; "ſince," as he ſaid, "he could not have comfort at home."</p>
                  <p>One of the families for which ſhe waſhed would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten careleſsly make her wait a month or two for the payment of her bills, inſtead of diſcharging them week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when ſhe brought home the linen. This is a cruel inconſideratency, and very contrary to the merciful ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the law of God, which forbids to keep back the hire of the laborer. The truth is, perſons whoſe only ſupport is hard labor, can ſeldom do more than live from hand to mouth, and whilſt their pay is kept back by a thoughtleſs cuſtomer, they are likely enough to be ſtarving for the want of it.</p>
                  <p>It happened that ſhe had juſt received a waſhing bill of ſix weeks ſtanding, which ſhe had long been ſighing
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035296_0127_1001A31AF9D5C170"/>for, and was counting her money, when her huſband came home in a terrible humour, declared he had not a farthing in the world, and laid his violent hands on this money, every ſhilling of which he carried off.—She ſcreamed after him, begging that he would leave her ſome of it at leaſt, or how could ſhe get bread for her children? But he was quickly out of hearing, and haſtily returned to his play-mate, who waited for him at the ale-houſe. Tricket's cruelty ſtruck his wife to the heart; ſhe ſat down in dumb deſpair and could not eaſe her full heart by weeping; the children looked up in her face with terror, and ſoon began to cry, and to tell her they were hungry; this gave a free paſſage to her tears; ſhe hugged them both to her breaſt, and told them that they ſhould have all the food their cruel father had left them: ſhe brought out the remainder of her loaf, and divided it between them; for her part, ſhe could ſwallow none.</p>
                  <p>By being obliged to truſt her cuſtomers, ſhe had been reduced to borrow a little from her landlady, and ſhe owed ſome rent beſides, ſo that ſhe was aſhamed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to her again, and ſhe had not ſix-pence in the world to ſupply food, or to buy ſoap for her waſhing. He who ſhould aſſiſt her was her worſt enemy, and, careleſs of her wants, took from her the fruits of her induſtry to throw it away in gaming and drinking.</p>
                  <p>This barbarous treatment hurt her the more becauſe, with all his faults, ſhe retained more affection for him than he deſerved; and had often cheerfully ſupplied his extravagance with a ſhare of what ſhe got, when ſhe could do it without ſtarving herſelf and her children.—But now proviſions were ſo dear that ſhe found it not eaſy to get neceſſaries even by working early and late at her laborious buſineſs. No money could ſhe get from her huſband, and this day his antagoniſt had refuſed to play with him any longer upon tick; and the alehouſe-keeper,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035296_0128_1001C000499E3FF0"/>at whoſe houſe this gaming commonly went on, would draw no more beer without preſent pay. His character was become ſo bad, that he could not get em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed when neceſſity would have urged him to work. In this ſituation he had come home deſperate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked at his ill-fortune, when he found his wife with two guineas and a good deal of ſilver before her. The ſight of this money renewed his hopes, and his eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for trying once more to recover his loſings. With this only object in view, he flew like a vulture on his prey, and without a thought of the diſtreſsful ſtate of thoſe who ſhould have been dear to him as his life, ſnatched from them all the means of ſubſiſtence. Thus does gaming harden the heart and ſwallow up every good affection! whilſt the hateful paſſions of avarice and envy are continually fed and ſtrengthened by it!</p>
                  <p>Poor Mrs. Tricket, cold and faſting, put her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to bed and, ſat weeping over them whilſt her huſband ſpent his hours in greedy wiſhes, hopes, and fears; in rage, in oaths, and curſes, over his cards, with the tankard at his ſide, often drained by the thirſty paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion burning in his ſtomach, and raging in his mind.—At paſt midnight he came ſtaggering home, and found his wife ſitting up for him, pale and ſhivering, and her face ſwelled with weeping.—"I thought you had left us for good and all," ſaid ſhe, "left us to periſh; how could you be ſo barbarous as to rob me of all, and leave me without a penny in the houſe?—I beſeech you to give me back ſome of that money, which was all I had in the world, unleſs you do indeed deſire to ſee me and your children die with want." "If that was your <hi>all,</hi>" he replied, "<hi>die you must;</hi> for it is every penny gone, and more after it than I ſhall ever be able to pay." So ſaying, he turned his pockets inſide out, to ſhew her they were perfectly empty. At this ſight the poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whoſe ſpirits were before nearly exhauſted with grief and faſting, fell in a fainting fit at his feet; as he
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035296_0129_1001C0047AA20280"/>had never ſeen her ſo before he thought ſhe was dead, and alarmed the houſe with his cries; though he was much in liquor, and his mind almoſt diſtracted, yet the idea of having been the cauſe of her death ſtruck him with horror. The children, awakened by his out-cry, ſtarted up, and ſeeing her on the floor, cried, "Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my! Mammy!" with all their might.</p>
                  <p>This dreadful noiſe awakened both the landlady, who ſlept above ſtairs, and alſo a widow lady, who lodged on the firſt floor, but before either of theſe could run down ſtairs, Tricket was at their doors, crying in a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible tone, "My wife! my wife! come to her if you have any pity! I have killed her! help! help!" He then ran back, and found her lying where he had left her, and the two children on the ground with her, kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her cold hands and face, ſobbing and drowning her with their tears. The lady and landlady reached Trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et's room at the ſame inſtant, and looked with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on this wretched groupe, whilſt the man cried out, "See! ſee! what I have done!—I have murdered my wife!" "Sure you could not be ſuch a monſter, ſaid the lady, "how have you murdered her? where is her wound? help to raiſe her up, and let us ſee the hurt." They then lifted her up, and perceived returning life in her. "Where is your hurt my poor dear creature?" ſaid the landlady; "where did that inhuman villain ſtrike you?" The poor woman looked wildly: "what do you mean?" ſaid ſhe, "he did not ſtrike me, tho' I almoſt wiſh he had to the heart." Her huſband, now, with the moſt lively joy and gratitude, thanked God that ſhe was alive, and on his knees begged her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs. She aſſured him, as well as her weakneſs would allow, that ſhe forgave him all.</p>
                  <p>The good women now haſtened to make a fire, and to warm her bed, for they found ſhe ſhivered violently; when they had put her into it, the lady brought her a glaſs of warm wine and water, ſome of which ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035296_0130_1001C00664D926B8"/>on her to ſwallow.—Tricket, whoſe anguiſh had taken off his intoxication, put his children again into their little bed; he gazed upon them and their mother by turns; whilſt his heart was wrung with the ſenſe of their wants and his own wickedneſs. His wife fell aſleep ſoon after the refreſhment ſhe had taken; but in a few hours awoke in a burning fever.—Tricket watched by her ſide: when he felt her hand and head as hot as fire, his fears returned, and he ran out of the houſe to fetch an apothecary; though he recollected that he had nothing to pay for help, or even neceſſary food for her: however, he went into the ſtreet, taking a club ſtick in his hand, and had not gone half way to the apothecary's, when, on turning a corner, he ſaw a gentleman, walking alone before him. Tricket at that moment looking round the ſtreet, ſaw no creature near. Suddenly it darted into his mind, that he might now get bread for his wife and children, and that he could eſcape home again before any one could detect him; he ſtopt not for recollection, but ſtriking the gentleman with all his force on the back of his head, felled him to the ground, and was rifling his pockets, when a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, turning the ſame corner Tricket had done, ran up, winding his rattle as he ran.</p>
                  <p>Tricket tried to eſcape; but the rattle brought watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from ſo many quarters, that he was ſoon ſecured; whilſt ſome of them conveyed him to the round-houſe, others aſſiſted the gentleman to riſe; having been only ſtunned, he ſoon recovered his ſpeech, and directed the men to lead him to his houſe, which was not far off.—There they aſked him whether he was robbed? and on examining his pockets, he found that he had loſt his watch, and his purſe, both of which he particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. The watch he could ſwear to, if he ſaw it; and he told the colour of the purſe, and what money it contained, of which he gave the watchmen a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum.—They then returned to the round-houſe,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035296_0131_1001C00B4F7EE370"/>where, on ſearching the priſoner, the watch and purſe were found upon him.—He would not anſwer any of their queſtions, but remained in gloomy ſilence.</p>
                  <p>When the day was more advanced, they carried him before a Juſtice of the Peace, and gave in their infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Tricket was now obliged to ſpeak; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clearly that he muſt be convicted, he burſt into an agony of grief, and confeſſed the whole; but he plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the diſtreſs to which his wife and family were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, which alone, he ſaid, "had led him to this raſh action:" and he repeatedly obſerved, that ſince he was driven to it by <hi>necessity,</hi> he hoped that both his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and the Gentleman would let him go: and he proteſted that, till the fatal moment when he ſaw the Gentleman, and thought he might reſcue his wife from death, and his children from ſtarving, he had never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a thought of committing ſuch a crime.</p>
                  <p>In anſwer to this ſpeech of Tricket, the Juſtice (who was well acquainted with Tricket's whole character and hiſtory) remarked, "that although the crime in queſtion, was committed on the ſudden, and though it aroſe out of the man's diſtreſs, yet, that diſtreſs had been brought upon him evidently by gaming." "My friend," ſaid he, "you have gone from one ſtep to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as almoſt every other perſon has done, that has been brought before me. Firſt, when you were in a good place you were negligent of your work through the love of gaming; and when for this cauſe you loſt your employment, you then took to gambling more deſperately than ever, through a neceſſity which you brought upon yourſelf. Your neceſſities next led you to take from your wife her little earnings, and when you had thus nearly driven her to diſtraction, then it was that you began to feel for the wants of your wife and children; and thus you were driven by another ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of your own making to rob on the highway for her relief.</p>

"I cannot help therefore tracing your crime entirely to your gaming, for it is this which has brought you into temptation; and no man can tell when he has once treſpaſſed, as you have done, to what lengths the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil at one time or other may ſuddenly drive him. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead, therefore, of excuſing yourſelf, let me adviſe you to conſider how happy for you it is, that the gentleman whom you ſtruck is not killed; for in that caſe you would have been brought before me, not for the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and aſſault only, but for murder.</p>
                  <p>Poor Tricket was much affected by theſe remarks, and did not utter a word more in the way of excuſe for his crime; but he begged and prayed the Gentleman, for his dear wife's ſake, not to hang him. Upon which the Juſtice interfered, and told Tricket, that "as to the nature of his puniſhment, that muſt depend upon circumſtances that would appear on the trial;" and he immediately bound the Gentleman over to proſecute.</p>
                  <p>While this ſcene was paſſing at the Juſtice's, poor Mrs. Tricket was left in a doleful caſe. She was told by her huſband, when he went away, that he was only going to run to the apothecary's, in order to bring ſome help to her, and that he would be back inſtantly; two hours paſſed and ſhe heard nothing of him: ſhe began to ſuſpect ſomething dreadful, and her mind gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>w ſo agitated, that her brain ſeemed on fire, and her ſenſes forſook her.—It happened that a gentleman who had been preſent at the Juſtice's (having been drawn thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the croud) called, from motives of humanity, in the courſe of the day to inquire into the ſtate of Tric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket's family; and he was the firſt perſon who brought intelligence of the horrible event that had taken place. As Mrs. Tricket was ſo ill, the only ſtep that could be taken at preſent, was to bring the apothecary to her; who, by laying on a bliſter, and giving her proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, abated the fever, and took off the delirium: but as her reaſon returned, her anxiety about her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035296_0133_1001C0011C9E3671"/>returned alſo, and ſhe inceſſantly begged to know what was become of him. Still it was thought that the dreadful truth muſt not be told her, leſt it ſhould bring back her diſtraction; and it was not till three days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when the apothecary declared her to be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the ſad condition of her huſband was revealed to her.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner was this affecting diſcovery made to Mrs. Tricket, than ſhe grew eager to get out of bed, to go to her huſband in the priſon; but her weakneſs made it impoſſible.—It was with great difficulty that ſhe was kept in the houſe after ſhe was able to riſe; and the firſt moment that ſhe could extort from the apothecary permiſſion to ſtir out, ſhe put herſelf into a coach (for ſhe had not ſtrength to walk) and leaving her children in the care of her humane landlady, arrived at the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The ſight of her threw Tricket into an agony, yet he was glad to ſee her alive, and by degrees was ſoothed and comforted by her kindneſs and affection.—She entreated him with many tears, to make his peace with God by ſincere repentance, and to truſt in his mercy for forgiveneſs. She then, through her natural fondneſs and partiality for her huſband, endeavored to find out ſome circumſtances of mitigation; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly remarked, "that ſince it was his affection for her and for his ſtarving family, that had put him on this raſh action, ſhe hoped that when the trial came on, the Judge would ſhew mercy to him." "Oh! If that could be," ſaid Tricket, "I think I ſhould never again fall into my former vices; but I dare not hope it; the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery is fully proved, and it is no thanks to me, as his worſhip very juſtly obſerved, that murder was not alſo the conſequence of my villainous action; my trial ſoon comes on; prepare your mind for the ſad ſentence, and pray for me that I alſo may be prepared for a more aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful trial after death." She now fell on her knees, and he knelt by her, and both implored forgiveneſs at
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035296_0134_1001C01894F3EFF8"/>the throne of Grace, with ſuch feelings of contrition, that they roſe up, hoping that their prayers had been heard through the great Saviour of mankind: and their minds now became more calm and more reſigned to the event, whatever it might be.</p>
                  <p>Tricket was convicted at the next aſſines on the cleareſt evidence, and ſentenced to death; but ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable circumſtances in his caſe were reported to his Majeſty by the Judge, and the ſentence was in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence changed from death to tranſportation.</p>
                  <p>The fear of death at firſt made even Botany Bay ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a deliverance, but when he was to depart thither, bitter indeed was the affliction of his faithful wife; for ſince he had appeared a penitent, ſhe had become ſo much endeared to him, that all his paſt injuries being quite forgotten, his leaving her was worſe than death.</p>
                  <p>She was earneſtly deſirous to go with him, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe could not be allowed to take her children, ſhe tho't it her duty not to forſake them; at leaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the preſent circumſtances, nor indeed would he conſent to her departure. The excellency of Mrs. Tricket's character was the occaſion of raiſing her up many friends, who furniſhed her with work, and who aſſiſted both in educating and apprenticing her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p>Her mind was reſtored in ſome meaſure to peace and tranquillity; and ſhe found that they who faithfully do their own duty, and put their truſt in God are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by him, however unhappy they may be in their outward circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>Such is the ſad ſtory of poor Tricket, the Gameſter! Let each reader lay to heart the dreadful conſequences of Gambling; for by firſt bringing a man to want, it will harden his heart even againſt his moſt beloved wife and children; and who knows whether it may not alſo drive him to thoſe criminal acts, for which his very life may be juſtly forfeited to the laws of his country.</p>

                  <p>BETTY Brown, the Orange Girl, was born nobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy knows where, and bred nobody knows how. No girl in all the ſtreets of London could drive a barrow more nimbly, avoid puſhing againſt paſſengers more dexterouſly, or cry her "Fine China Oranges" in a ſhriller voice.—But then ſhe could neither ſew, nor ſpin, nor knit, nor waſh, nor iron, nor read, nor ſpell. Betty had not been always in ſo good a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as that in which we now deſcribe her. She came into the world before ſo many good gentlemen and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ern themſelves ſo kindly that the poor might have a little learning. There was no charitable Society then, as there is now, to pick up poor friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs children in the ſtreets, and put them into a good houſe, and give them meat, and drink, and lodging, and learning, and teach them to get their bread in an honeſt way into the bargain. Whereas, this now is often the caſe in London, bleſſed be God for all his m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rcies.</p>
                  <p>The longeſt thing that Betty can remember is, that ſhe uſed to crawl up out of a night cellar, ſtroll about the ſtreets, and pick cinders from the ſcavenger's carts. Among the aſhes ſhe ſometimes found ſome ragged gauze and dirty ribbons; with theſe ſhe uſed to dizen herſelf out and join the merry bands on the firſt of May. This was not however quite fair, as ſhe did not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully belong either to the female dancers who foot it gaily round the garland, or to the footy it be, who, on
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035296_0136_1001C020D19841D8"/>this happy holiday, forget their whole years toil; ſhe often, however, got a few ſcraps, by appearing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to both parties.</p>
                  <p>Betty was not an idle girl; ſhe always put herſelf in the way of doing ſomething.—She would run of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands for the footmen, or ſweep the door for the maid of any houſe where ſhe was known; ſhe would run and fetch ſome porter, and never was once known ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſip a drop, or ſteal the pot. Her quickneſs and fidelity in doing little jobs, got her into favor with a lazy cook-maid, who was too apt to give away her maſter's cold meat and beer, not to thoſe who were moſt in want, but to thoſe who waited upon her, and did the little things which ſhe ought to have done her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The cook, who found Betty a dextrous girl, ſoon employed her to ſell ends of candles, pieces of meat and cheeſe, and lumps of butter, or any thing elſe ſhe could crib from the houſe. Theſe were all carried to her friend Mrs. Sponge, who kept a little ſhop, and a kind of eating houſe for poor-working people, not far from the Seven Dials. She alſo bought as well as ſold many kind of ſecond hand things, and was not ſcrupulous to know whether what ſhe bought was honeſtly come by, provided ſhe got it for a ſixth part of what it was worth. But if the owner preſumed to aſk for its real value, ſhe had ſudden qualms of conſcience, ſuſpected the things were ſtolen, and gave herſelf airs of honeſty, which often took in poor ſilly people, and gave her a ſort of half reputation among the needy and the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, whoſe friend ſhe pretended to be.</p>
                  <p>To this artful woman Betty carried the cook's pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and as Mrs. Sponge would give no great price for theſe in money, the cook was willing to receive payment for her eatables in Mrs. Sponge's drinkables; for ſhe dealt in all kinds of ſpirits. I ſhall only juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark

                  <p>Betty was faithful to both her employers, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, conſidering the greatneſs of the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tter ignorance of good and evil. One day, ſhe ventured to aſk Mrs. Sponge if ſhe could not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt her to get into a more ſettled way of life. She told her, that when the roſe in the morning, ſhe never knew where ſhe ſhould lie at night, nor was ſhe ever fare of a meal before hand. Mrs. Sponge aſked her what ſhe thought herſelf ſit for. Betty with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, ſaid, there was one trade for which ſhe thought herſelf qualified, but ſhe had not the ambition to look ſo high. It was far above her humble views. This was to have a barrow, and ſell fruit, as ſeveral other of Mrs. Sponge's cuſtomers did, whom ſhe had often looked at with envy.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Sponge was an artful woman. Bad as ſhe was ſhe was always aiming at ſomething of a character, this was a great help to her trade. While ſhe wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſhe got by grinding the poor, ſhe ſpent in the moſt laxurious living; and, while ſhe would haggle with her hungry cuſtomers for a farthing, ſhe would ſpend pounds on the moſt coſtly delicacies for herſelf.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Sponge, laying aſide that haughty look and voice, well known to ſuch as had the miſfortune to be
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035296_0138_1001C027C2CD9EF0"/>in her debt, put on the hypocritical ſmile and ſoft tone, which ſhe always aſſumed when ſhe meant to take in her dependents. "Betty" ſaid ſhe, "I am reſolved to ſtand your friend. Theſe are ſad times to be ſure.—Money is money now. Yet I am reſolved to put you into a handſome way of living. You ſhall have a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and well furniſhed too." Betty could not have felt more joy or gratitude, if ſhe had been told that ſhe ſhould have a coach. "O, madam," ſaid Betty, "It is impoſſible. I have not a penny in the world towards helping me to ſet up." "I will take care of that," ſaid Mrs. Sponge; "only you muſt do as I bid you. You muſt pay me intereſt for my money. And you will, of courſe be glad alſo to pay ſo much every night for a nice hot ſupper which I get ready, quite out of kindneſs, for a number of poor working people. This wll be a great comfort for ſuch a friendleſs girl as you, for my victuals and drink are the beſt; and my company the merrieſt of any houſe in all St. Giles's." Betty thought all this only ſo many more favors, and courteſying to the ground, ſaid, "to be ſure, Ma'am, and thank you a thouſand times into the bargain."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Sponge knew what ſhe was about. Betty was a lively girl, who had a knack at learning any thing; and ſo well looking through all her dirt and rags, that there was little doubts ſhe would get cuſtom. A bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row was ſoon provided, and five ſhillings was put into Betty's hands. Mrs Sponge kindly condeſcended to go to ſhew her how to buy the fruit, for it was a rule with this prudent gentlewoman, and one from which ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver departed, that no one ſhould cheat but herſelf.—Betty had never poſſeſſed ſuch a ſum before.—She grudged to lay it out all at once, and was ready to fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhe could live upon the capital. The crown, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was laid out to the beſt advantage.—Betty was carefully taught in what manner to cry her Oranges: and received many uſeful leſſons how to get off the bad

                     </gap>me good ones at night. Betty ſtared. Mrs Sponge ſaid, "Betty, thoſe who would get money, muſt not be too nice about trifles. Keep one of theſe ſixpences in your hand, and if an ignorant young cuſtomer gives you a good ſixpence, do you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſlip it into your other hand, and give him the bad one, declaring that is the very one you have juſt received, and that you have not another ſixpence in the world. You muſt alſo learn how to treat different ſorts of cuſtomers. To ſome you may put off with ſafety, goods which would be quite unſaleable to others. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver offer bad fruit, Betty, to thoſe who know better: never waſte the good on thoſe who may be put off with worſe; put good Oranges at top and the mouldy ones under."</p>
                  <p>Poor Betty had not a nice conſcience, for ſhe had n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er learnt that grand but ſimple rule of all moral obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, "Never do that to another which you would not have another do to you."—She ſet off with her bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row as proud and as happy as if ſhe had been ſet up in the fineſt ſhop in Covent Garden. Betty had a ſort of natural good nature, which made her unwilling to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but ſhe had no principle which told her it was a ſin. She had ſuch good ſucceſs, that when night came, ſhe had not an Orange left. With a light heart, ſhe drove her empty barrow to Mrs. Sponge's door. She went in with a merry face, and threw down on the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter every farthing ſhe had taken, "Betty" ſaid Mrs. Sponge, "I have a right to it all, as it was got by my money. But I am too generous to take it.—I will therefore only take ſixpence for this day's uſe of my five ſhillings. This is a moſt reaſonable intereſt, and I will lend you the ſame ſum to trade with to-morrow, and ſo on; you only paying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Poor Betty's gratitude blinded her ſo completely that ſhe forgot to calculate the vaſt proportion which this generous benefactreſs was to receive out of her little gains. She thought herſelf a happy creature, and went in to ſupper with a number of others of her own claſs. For this ſupper, and for more porter and gin than ſhe ought to have drank, Betty was forced to pay ſo high, that it eat up all the profits of the day, which added to the daily intereſt, made Mrs. Sponge a rich return for her five ſhillings.</p>
                  <p>Betty was reminded again of the gentility of her new ſituation, as ſhe crept up to bed in one of Mrs. Sponge's garrets, five ſtories high. This loft, to be ſure, was ſmall, and had no window, but what it wanted in light was made up in company, as it had three L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>One day, as Betty was driving her barrow through a ſtreet near Holborn, a lady from a window called out to her that ſhe wanted ſome Oranges. While the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant went to fetch a plate, the lady entered into ſome talk with Betty, having been ſtruck with her honeſt countenance and civil manner. She queſtioned her as to her way of life, and the profit of her trade—and Betty, who had never been ſo kindly treated before by
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:035296_0141_1001C03032368DA0"/>ſo genteel a perſon, was very communicative. She told her little hiſtory as far as ſhe knew it, and dwelt much on the generoſity of Mrs. Sponge, in keeping her in her houſe, and truſting her with ſo large a capital as five ſhillings. At firſt it ſounded like a very good natured thing, but the lady, whoſe huſband was one of the Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of the new Police, happened to know more of Mrs. Sponge than was good, which led her to enquire ſtill further. Betty owned, that to be ſure it was not all clear profit, for that beſides that the high price of the ſupper and bed ran away with all ſhe got, ſhe paid ſixpence a day for the uſe of the five ſhillings. "And how long have you done this," ſaid the lady? "About a year Madam."</p>
                  <p>The lady's eyes were at once opened. "My poor girl," ſaid ſhe, "do you know that you have already paid for that ſingle five ſhillings the enormous ſum of 7<abbr>l.</abbr> 10<abbr>s.</abbr>? I believe it is the moſt profitable five ſhillings Mrs. Sponge ever laid out." "Oh, no, Madam," ſaid the girl, "that good gentlewoman does the ſame kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ten or twelve other poor friendleſs creatures like me." "Does ſhe ſo?" ſaid the lady, "then I never heard of a better trade than this woman carries on, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the maſk of charity, at the expence of her poor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures."</p>
                  <p>"But Madam," ſaid Betty, who did not comprehend this lady's arithmetic, "what can I do? I now contrive to pick up a morſel of bread without begging or ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Mrs. Sponge has been very good to me, and I don't ſee how I can help myſelf."</p>
                  <p>"I will tell you" ſaid the lady. "If you will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my advice, you may not only maintain yourſelf ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, but independently. Only oblige yourſelf to live hard for a little time, till you have ſaved five ſhillings out of your own earnings.—Give up that expenſive ſupper at night, drink only one pint of porter, and no gin at all. As ſoon as you have ſcraped together the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:035296_0142_1001C03902912E48"/>five ſhillings, carry it back to your falſe friend, and if you are induſtrious, you will at the end of the year have ſaved ſeven pounds ten ſhillings. If you can make a ſhift to live now, when you have this heavy intereſt to pay, judge how things will mend when your capital becomes your own.—You will put ſome cloaths on your back, and by leaving the uſe of ſpirits, and the company in which you drink them, your health, your morals, and your condition will mend."</p>
                  <p>The lady did not talk thus to ſave her money. She would gladly have given the girl the five ſhillings; but ſhe thought it was beginning at the wrong end. She wanted to try her. Beſides, ſhe know there was much more pleaſure as well as honor in poſſeſſing five ſhillings of one's own ſaving than of another's giving.—Betty promiſed to obey. She owned ſhe got no good by the company or the liquor at Mrs. Sponge's. She promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that very night to begin ſaving the expence of the ſupper, and that ſhe would not taſte a drop of gin till ſhe had the five ſhillings before hand. The lady, who knew the power of good habits, was contented with this, thinking, that if the girl could abſtain, for a certain time, it would become eaſy to her.—She therefore at preſent ſaid little about the ſin of drinking.</p>
                  <p>In a very few weeks, Betty had ſaved up the five ſhillings.—She went to carry back this money with great gratitude to Mrs. Sponge. This kind friend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to abuſe her moſt unmercifully. She called her many hard names not fit to repeat, for having forſaken the ſupper, by which ſhe ſwore ſhe got nothing at all; but as ſhe had the charity to dreſs it for ſuch beggarly wretches, ſhe inſiſted they ſhould pay for it whether they ate it or no. She alſo bro't in a heavy ſcore for lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though Betty had paid for it every night, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en notice of her intending to quit her. By all theſe falſe pretences, ſhe got from her not only her own five ſhillings, but all the little capital with which Betty was
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:035296_0143_1001C03CE3C1A7F0"/>going to ſet up for herſelf. As all was not ſufficient to anſwer her demands, ſhe declared ſhe would ſend her to priſon, but while ſhe went to call a conſtable, Betty contrived to make off.</p>
                  <p>With a light pocket and a heavy heart, ſhe went to the lady, and with many tears, told her ſad ſtory. The lady's huſband, the Juſtice, condeſcended to liſten to Betty's tale. He ſaid Mrs. Sponge had long been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his books as a receiver of ſtolen goods. Betty's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſtrengthened his bad opinion of her.—"This pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty ſyſtem of uſury," ſaid the gentleman, "may be thought trifling, but it will no longer appear ſo, if you reflect, that if one of theſe female ſharpers poſſeſſes a capital of ſeventy ſhillings, or 3 <abbr>l.</abbr> 10 <abbr>s.</abbr> with fourteen ſteady regular cuſtomers, ſhe can realize a fixed income of 100 guineas a year. Add to this the influence ſuch a loan gives her over theſe friendleſs creatures by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling them to eat at her houſe, or lodge or buy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, or by taking their pawns, and you will ſee the extent of the evil. I pity theſe poor victims: You, Betty, ſhall point out ſome of them to me. I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to open their eyes on their own bad manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is one of the greateſt acts of kindneſs to the poor to mend their oeconomy, and to give them right views of laying out their little money to advantage.—Theſe poor blinded creatures look no farther than to be able to pay this heavy intereſt every night, and to obtain the ſame loan on the ſame hard terms the next day. Thus are they kept in poverty and bondage all their lives; but I hope as many as hear of this will get on a better plan, and I ſhall be ready to help any who are willing to help themſelves." This worthy Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate went directly to Mrs. Sponge's with proper offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and he got to the bottom of many iniquities. He not only made her refund poor Betty's money, but committed her to priſon for receiving ſtolen goods, and
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035296_0144_1001A32DC419D5D0"/>various other offences, which may perhaps make the ſubject of another hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>Betty was now ſet up in trade to her hearts content. She had found the benefit of leaving off ſpirits, and ſhe reſolved to drink them no more.—The firſt fruits of this reſolution was, that in a fortnight ſhe bought her a new pair of ſhoes, and as there was now no deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for intereſt or for gin, her earnings became conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. The lady made her a preſent of a gown and a hat, on the eaſy condition that ſhe ſhould go to church. She accepted the terms, at firſt, rather as an act of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the lady, than from a ſenſe of a higher duty. But ſhe ſoon began to go from a better motive. This conſtant attendance at church, joined to the inſtructions of the lady, opened a new world to Betty. She now heard, for the firſt time, that ſhe was a ſinner; that God had given a law which was holy, juſt, and good; that ſhe had broken this law; had been a ſwearer, a ſabbath-breaker, and had lived without God in the world. All this was ſad news to Betty; ſhe knew indeed that there were ſinners, but ſhe thought they were only to be ſound in the priſons or at Botany Bay, or in thoſe mournful carts which ſhe had ſometimes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with her barrow, with the unthinking croud, to Tyburn. She was moſt ſtruck with the great truths revealed in the ſcripture, which were quite new to her. She was deſirous of improvement, and ſaid ſhe would give up all the profits of her barrow, and go into the hardeſt ſervice, rather than live in ſin and ignorance.</p>
                  <p>"Betty," ſaid the lady, "I am glad to ſee you ſo well diſpoſed, and will do what I can for you. Your preſent way of life, to be ſure, expoſes you to much danger; but the trade is not unlawful in itſelf, and we may pleaſe God in any calling, provided it be not a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt one. In this great town there muſt be barrow-women to ſell fruit. Do you, then, inſtead of forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your buſineſs, ſet a good example to thoſe in it,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:035296_0145_1001C04553217DD0"/>and ſhew them, that though a dangerous trade, it need not be a bad one. Till Providence points out ſome ſafer way of getting your bread, let your companions ſee, that it is poſſible to be good even in this. Your trade being carried on in the open ſtreet, and your fruit bought in an open ſhop, you are not ſo much obliged to keep ſinful company as may be thought. Take a garret in an honeſt houſe, to which you may go home in ſafety at night. I will give you a bed and a few ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries to furniſh your room; and I will alſo give you a conſtant Sunday's dinner. A barrow woman, bleſſed be God and our good laws, is as much her own miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs on Sundays as a Ducheſs; and the Church and the Bible are as much open tó her.—You may ſoon learn all that ſuch as you are expected to know.—A barrow woman may pray as heartily morning and night, and ſerve God as acceptably all day, while ſhe is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on her little trade, as if ſhe had her whole time to ſpare.</p>
                  <p>To do this well, you muſt mind the following <hi>rules for Retail Dealers:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reſiſt every temptation to cheat.</p>
                  <p>Never impoſe bad goods on falſe pretences.</p>
                  <p>Never put off bad money for good.</p>
                  <p>Never uſe prophane or uncivil language.</p>
                  <p>Never ſwear your goods coſt ſo much, when you know it is falſe. By ſo doing you are guilty of two ſins in one breath, a lie and an oath.</p>
                  <p>To break theſe rules, will be your chief temptation. God will mark how you behave under them, and will reward or puniſh you accordingly.—Theſe tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be as great to you as higher trials are to higher people; but you have the ſame God to look to for ſtrength to reſiſt them as they have.—You muſt pray to him to give you this ſtrength. You ſhall attend a Sunday School, where you will be taught theſe good
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:035296_0146_1001A332000C44A0"/>things, and I will promote you as you ſhall be found to deſerve.</p>
                  <p>Poor Betty here burſt into tears of joy and gratitude, crying out, "What, ſhall ſuch a poor friendleſs crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as I be treated ſo kindly, and learn to read the word of God too? Oh, Madam, what a lucky chance brought me to your door." "Betty," ſaid the lady, "what you have juſt ſaid, ſhews the need you have of being better taught; there is no ſuch thing as chance, and we offend God when we call that luck or chance which is brought about by his will and pleaſure. None of the events of your life have happened by chance—but all have been under the direction of a good and kind Providence. He has permitted you to experience want and diſtreſs, that you might acknowledge his hand in your preſent comfort and proſperity. Above all, you muſt bleſs his goodneſs in ſending you to me, not only becauſe I have been of uſe to you in your worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, but becauſe he has enabled me to ſhew you the danger of your ſtate from ſin and ignorance, and to put you in a way to know his will and to keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>How Betty, by induſtry and piety, roſe in the world, till at length ſhe came to keep a handſome Sauſage ſhop near the Seven Dials, and was married to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Hackney Coachman, may be told at ſome future time, in a Second Part.</p>

                  <head>BLACK GILES, THE POACHER;</head>
                  <head type="sub">With ſome account of a Family who had rather live by their Wits than their Work.</head>
                  <head type="sub">PART I.</head>
                  <p>POACHING GILES lived on the borders of one of thoſe great Moors in Somerſetſhire. Giles, to be ſure, has been a ſad fellow in his time; and it is none of his fault if his whole family do not end either at the gallows or at Botany Bay. He lives at the Mud Cottage with the broken windows, ſtuffed with dirty rags, juſt beyond the gate which divides the upper from the lower Moor. You may know the houſe at a good diſtance by the ragged tiles on the roof, and the looſe ſtones which are ready to drop out from the chimney; though a ſhort ladder, a hod of mortar, and half an hour's leiſure time would have prevented all this, and made the little dwelling tight enough. But as Giles had never learnt any thing that was good, ſo he did not know the value of ſuch uſeful ſayings as, that "a tile in time ſaves nine."</p>
                  <p>Beſides this, Giles fell into that common miſtake, that a beggarly looking cottage, and filthy ragged chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren raiſed moſt compaſſion, and of courſe drew moſt charity. But as cunning as he was in other things, he was out in his reckoning here; for it is neatneſs, houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery, and a decent appearance, which draws the kindneſs of the rich and charitable, while they turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way diſguſted from filth and lazineſs; not out of pride, but becauſe they ſee that it is next to impoſſible to
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:035296_0148_1001A3373895FE10"/>mend the condition of thoſe who degrade themſelves by dirt and ſloth.</p>
                  <p>The common on which Giles's hovel ſtands is quite a deep marſh in a wet winter, but in ſummer it looks green and pretty enough. To be ſure it would be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther convenient when one paſſes that way in a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, if one of the children would run out and open the gate, as it would ſave the poſt boy from getting off, which is not very ſafe for the people within the chaiſe; but inſtead of any one of theſe children running out as ſoon as they hear the wheels, which would be quite time enough, what does Giles do, but ſet all his ragged brats, with dirty faces, matted locks, and naked ſeet and legs, to lie all day upon a ſand bank hard by the gate, waiting for the ſlender chance of what may be picked up from travellers. At the ſound of a carriage, whole coveys of theſe little ſcare-ſerows ſtart up, ruſh to the gate and all at once thruſt out their hats and aprons; and for fear this, together with the noiſe of their clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orous begging, ſhould not ſufficiently frighten the horſes, they are very apt to let the gate ſlap ful! againſt you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are half way through, in their eager ſcuffle to ſnatch from each other the half-pence which you may have thrown out to them. I know two ladies who were one day very near being killed by theſe abominable tricks.</p>
                  <p>Thus five or ſix little idle creatures, who might be earning a trifle by knitting at home; who might be uſeful to the public by working in the field, and who might aſſiſt their families by learning to get their bread twenty honeſt ways, are ſuffered to lie about all day, in the hope of a few chance half-pence, which after all, they are by no means ſure of getting. Indeed, when the neighboring gentlefolks found out that opening the gate was the family trade, they ſoon left off giving any thing. And I myſelf, though I uſed to take out a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ready to give, had there been only one to receive it, when I ſee a whole family eſtabliſhed in ſo beggarly a
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035296_0149_1001C0580EEE4BD0"/>trade, quietly put it back again into my pocket, and give nothing at all.—And ſo few travellers paſs that way, that ſometimes, after the whole family have loſt a day, their gains do not amount to two-pence.</p>
                  <p>As Giles had a far greater taſte for living by his wits than his work, he was at one time in hopes that his children might have got a pretty penny by tumbling for the diverſion of travellers, and he ſet about training them in that indecent practice; but unluckily, the Moors being level, the carriages travelled faſter than the children tumbled.—He envied thoſe parents who lived on the London road, over the Wiltſhire Dowas, which being very hilly, enables the tumbler to keep pace with the traveller, till he ſometimes extorts from the light and the unthinking, a reward inſtead of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof. I begleave, however, to put all gentlemen and ladies in mind that ſuch tricks are a kind of apprentice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the trades of begging and thieving.</p>
                  <p>Giles, to be ſure, as his children grew older, began to train them to ſuch other employments as the idle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits they had learned at the gate very properly qualified them for. The right of Common, which ſome of the poor Cottagers have in that part of the country, and which is doubtleſs a conſiderable advantage to many, was converted by Giles into the means of corrupting his whole family, for his children, as ſoon as they grew too big for the trade of begging at the gate, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to the dignity of thieving on the Moor. Here he kept two or three aſſes, miſerable beings, which, if they had the good fortune to eſcape death by ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, did not fail to meet with it by beating. Some of the biggeſt boys were ſent out with theſe lean and galled animals to carry ſand or coals about the neighboring towns. Both ſand and coals were often ſtolen before they got them to ſell, or if not, they always took care to cheat in ſelling them. By long practice in this art, they grew ſo dextrous, that they could give a pretty
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:035296_0150_1001C05C58A9C438"/>good gueſs how large a coal they could crib out of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery bag before the buyer would be likely to miſs it.</p>
                  <p>All their odd time was taken up under the pretence of watching theſe aſſes on the Moor, or running after five or ſix half ſtarved geeſe; but the truth is, theſe boys were only watching for an opportunity to ſteal an odd gooſe of their neighbor's. They uſed alſo to pluck the quills or the down from theſe poor live creatures, or half milk a cow before the farmer's maid came with her pail. They all knew how to calculate to a minute what time to be down in a morning to let out their lank, hungry beaſts, which they had turned over night into the farmer's field, to ſteal a little good paſture. They contrived to get there juſt time enough to eſcape being caught in replacing the ſtakes they had pulled out for the cattle to get over. For Giles was a prudent, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed fellow, and wherever he ſtole food for his colts, took care never to ſteal ſtakes from the hedges at the ſame time. He had ſenſe enough to know that the gain did not make up for the danger; he knew that a looſe faggot, pulled from a neighbor's pile of wood after the family were gone to bed, anſwered the end better, and was not half the trouble.</p>
                  <p>Among the many trades which Giles profeſſed, he ſometimes practiſed that of a rat-catcher; but he was addicted to ſo many tricks that he never followed the ſame trade long. Whenever he was ſent for to a farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, his cuſtom was to kill a few of the old rats, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways taking care to leave a little ſtock of young ones alive ſufficient to keep up the breed; for ſaid he, "If I were to be ſuch a fool as to clear a houſe or a barn at once, how would my trade be carried on?" And where any barn was overſtocked, he uſed to borrow a few from thence, juſt to people a neighboring granary which had none; and he might have gone on till now, had he not unluckily been caught one evening emptying his cage of young rats under Parſon Wilſon's barn door.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="unknown:035296_0151_1001C061B9F34038"/>
This worthy Miniſter, Mr. Wilſon, uſed to pity the neglected children of Giles as much as he blamed the wicked parents. He one day picked up Dick, who was far the beſt of Giles's bad boys. Dick was loiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about in a field behind the Parſon's garden in ſearch of a hen's neſt, his mother having ordered him to bring home a few eggs that night by hook or by crook, as Giles was reſolved to have ſome pan-cakes for ſupper, though he knew that eggs were a penny a piece. Mr. Wilſon had long been deſirous of ſnatching ſome of this vagrant family from ruin, and his chief hopes were bent on Dick, as the leaſt hackneyed in knavery. He had once given him a new pair of ſhoes, on his promiſing to go to ſchool next Sunday; but no ſooner had Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel, the boy's mother, got the ſhoes into her clutches, than ſhe pawned them for a bottle of gin, and ordered the boy to keep out of the Parſon's ſight, and to be ſure to play his marbles on Sundays for the future, at the other end of the pariſh, and not near the Church-yard. Mr. Wilſon, however, picked up the boy once more, for it was not his way to deſpair of any body. Dick was juſt going to take to his heels, as uſual, for fear the old ſtory of the ſhoes ſhould be brought forward; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he could not get off, what does he do but run into a little puddle of muddy water which lay between him and the Parſon, that the ſight of his naked feet might not bring on the dreaded ſubject.—Now it happened that Mr. Wilſon was planting a little field of beans, ſo he thought this a good opportunity to employ Dick; he told him he had got ſome pretty eaſy work for him. Dick did as he was bid; he willingly went to work, and readily began to plant his beans with diſpatch and regularity, according to the directions given him.</p>
                  <p>While the boy was buſily at work by himſelf, Giles happened to come by, having been ſkulking round the back way, to look over the Parſon's garden wall, to ſee if there was any thing worthy climbing over for on
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:035296_0152_1001C06372A7C600"/>the enſuing night. He ſpied Dick, and began to rate him for working for the ſtingy old Parſon, for Giles had a natural antipathy to whatever belonged to the Church. "What has he promiſed thee a day?" ſaid he, "little enough, I dare ſay." "He is not to pay me by the day," ſaid Dick, "but ſays he will give me ſo much when I have planted this peck, and ſo much for the next." "Oh, oh! that alters the caſe," ſaid Giles. "One may, indeed, get a trifle by this ſort of work.— Come, give me a handful of the beans. I will teach thee how to plant when thou art paid for planting by the peck. All we have to do in that caſe is to diſpatch the work as faſt as we can, and get rid of the beans with all ſpeed; and as to the ſeed coming up or not, that is no buſineſs of ours; we are paid for planting, not for growing. At the rate thou goeſt on, thou wouldſt not get ſix-pence to night. Come along, bury away." So ſaying, he took his hat full of the ſeed, and where Dick had been ordered to ſet one bean, Giles buried a dozen. So the beans were ſoon out. But though the peck was emptied, the ground was unplanted. But cunning Giles knew this could not be found out till the time when the beans might be expected to come up, "and then, Dick," ſaid he, "the ſnails and the mice may go ſhares in the blame; or we can lay the fault on the rooks or the blackbirds." So ſaying, he ſent the boy into the Parſonage to receive his pay, taking care to ſecure about a quarter of the peck of beans for his own colt he put both bag and beans into his own pocket to carry home, bidding Dick tell Mr. Wilſon that he had planted his beans and loſt the bag.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time Giles's other boys were buſy in emptying the ponds and trout ſtreams in the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manor. They would ſteal away the carp and tench when they were no bigger than gud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Giles's boys had never ſeen the inſide of a church ſince they were chriſtened, and the father thought he knew his own intereſt better than to force them to it; for church time was the ſeaſon of their harveſt. Then the hens' neſts were ſearched, a ſtray duck was clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped under the ſmock frock, the tools which might have been left by chance in a farm yard, were picked up, and all the neighboring pigeon-houſes were thinned, ſo that Giles uſed to boaſt to his wife, that Sunday was to them the moſt profitable day in the week. With her it was certainly the moſt laborious day, as ſhe always did her waſhing and ironing on the Sunday morning, it being, as ſhe ſaid, the only leiſure day ſhe had, for on oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er days ſhe went about the country, telling fortunes, and ſelling dream-books, and wicked ſongs. Neither her huſband's nor her children's cloaths were ever mended, and if Sunday, her idle day, had not come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout once in every week, it is likely they would never have been waſhed neither. You might, however, ſee her as you were going to church, ſmoothing her own rags on her beſt red cloak, which ſhe always uſed for her ironing cloth on Sundays, for her cloak when ſhe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, and for her blanket at night; ſuch a wretched manager was Rachel! among her other articles of trade

Her way was to fill ſo many quart bottles with plain water, putting a ſpoonful of mint water in the mouth of each; theſe ſhe corked down with roſin, carrying to each cuſtomer a phial of real diſtilled water to taſte, by way of ſample. This was ſo good that her bottles were commonly bought up without being opened; but if any ſuſpicion aroſe, and ſhe was forced to uncork a bottle, by the few drops of diſtilled water lying on the top, ſhe even then eſcaped detection, and took care to get out of reach before the bottle was opened a ſecond time. She was too prudent ever to go twice to the ſame houſe.</p>
                  <p>There is hardly any petty miſchief that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the life of a poacher.—Mr. Wilſon was a ware of this; he was not only a pious clergyman, but an upright juſtice. He uſed to ſay that people who were truly conſcientious, muſt be ſo in ſmall things as well as in great ones, or they would deſtroy the effect of their own precepts, and their example would not be of general uſe. For this reaſon he never would accept of a hare or a partridge from any unqualified perſon in his pariſh. He did not content himſelf with ſhuffling the thing off by aſking no queſtions, and pretending to take it for granted in a general way, that the game was fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come at; but he uſed to ſay that by receiving the booty, he connived at a crime; made himſelf a ſharer in it, and if he gave a preſent to the man who brought it, he even tempted him to repeat the fault.</p>
                  <p>One day poor Jack Weſton, an honeſt fellow in the neighborhood, whom Mr. Wilſon had kindly viſited and relieved in a long ſickneſs, from which he had but juſt recovered, was brought before him as he was ſitting on the juſtice's bench; Jack was accuſed of having knocked down a hare, and of all the birds in the air, who
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035296_0155_1001C06D4D6B1EA0"/>ſhould the informer be but Black Giles, the poacher? Mr. Wilſon was grieved at the charge, he had a great regard for Jack, but he had a ſtill greater regard for the law. The poor fellow pleaded guilty. He did not deny the fact, but ſaid he did not conſider it a crime, he did not think game was private property, and he owned he had a ſtrong temptation for doing what he had done which he hoped would plead in his excuſe. The juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice deſired to know what this temptation was. "Sir," ſaid the poor fellow, "you know I was given over this ſpring in a bad fever. I had no friend in the world but you, Sir, under God you ſaved my life by your charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble relief; and I truſt alſo you may have helped to ſave my ſoul by your prayers and your good advice. I know I can never make you amends for all your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but I thought it would be ſome comfort to my full heart if I could but once give you ſome little token of my gratitude. So I had trained a pair of nice turtle doves for Madam Wilſon, but they were ſtolen from me, Sir, and I do ſuſpect Black Giles ſtole them. Yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday morning, Sir, I was crawling out to my work, for I am ſtill but very weak, a fine hare ran acroſs my path. I did not ſtay to conſider whether it was wrong to kill a hare, but I felt it was right to ſhew my grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; ſo, Sir, without a moment's thought, I did knock down the hare which I was going to carry to your worſhip, becauſe I knew Madam was fond of hare. I am truly ſorry for my fault, and will ſubmit to whatev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er puniſhment your worſhip may pleaſe to inflict."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Wilſon was much moved with this honeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and touched with the poor fellow's gratitude. What added to the effect of the ſtory, was the weak condition and pale ſickly looks of the offender. But this worthy juſtice never ſuffered his feelings to bias his integrity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he knew that he did not ſit on that bench to indulge pity, but to adminiſter juſtice. And while he was ſorry for the offender he would not juſtify the
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035296_0156_1001C074AF078148"/>offence. "John" ſaid he, "I am ſurpriſed that you could for a moment forget that I never accept any gift which cauſes the giver to break a law. On Sunday I teach you from the pulpit the laws of God, whoſe min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter I am. At preſent I fill the chair of the magiſtrate, to enforce and execute the laws of the land. Between thoſe and the others there is more connection than you are aware. I thank you, John, for your affection to me, and I admire your gratitude; but I muſt not allow ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affection or gratitude to be brought as a plea for a wrong action. It is not your buſineſs nor mine, John, to ſettle whether the game laws are good or bad. Till they are repealed we muſt obey them. Many, I doubt not, break theſe laws through ignorance, and many I am certain, who would not dare to ſteal a gooſe or a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key, make no ſcruple to knock down a hare or a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge. You will hereafter think yourſelf happy that this your firſt attempt has proved unſucceſsful, as I truſt you are too honeſt a fellow ever to intend to turn poach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. With poaching much moral evil is connected; a habit of nightly depredation; a cuſtom of prowling in the dark for prey produces, in time, a diſreliſh for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt labor. He whoſe firſt offence was committed without much thought or evil intention, if he happen to ſucceed a few times in carrying off his booty undiſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, grows bolder and bolder; and when he fancies there is no ſhame attending it, he very ſoon gets to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade himſelf that there is alſo no ſin. While ſome people pretend a ſcruple about ſtealing a ſheep, they partly live by plundering of warrens. But remember that the warrener pays a high rent, and that therefore his rabbits are as much his property as his ſheep. Do not then deceive yourſelves with theſe falſe diſtinctions. All property is ſacred, and as the laws of the land are intended to fence in that property, he who brings up his children to break down any of theſe fences, brings them up to certain ſin and ruin. He who begins with
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:035296_0157_1001A34B6CDF80C8"/>robbing orchards, rabbit warrens, and fish ponds, will probably end with horſe-ſtealing or highway robbery. Poaching is a regular apprenticeſhip to bolder crimes. He whom I may commit as a boy to ſit in the ſtocks fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> killing a patridge, may be likely to end at the gallows for killing a man.</p>
                  <p>"Obſerve, you who now hear me, the ſtrictneſs and impartiality of juſtice. I know Giles to be a worthleſs fellow, yet it is my duty to take his information; I know Jack Weſton to be an honeſt youth, yet I muſt be obliged to make him pay the penalty. Giles is a bad man, but he can prove this fact; Jack is a worthy lad, but he has committed this fault: I am ſorry for you, Jack; but do not let it grieve you that Giles has played worſe tricks a hundred times, and yet got off, while you were detected in the very firſt offence, for that would be grieving becauſe you are not ſo great a rogue as Giles. At this moment you think your good luck is very unequal; but all this will one day turn out in your favor. Giles is not the more the favorite of heaven becauſe he has hitherto eſcaped Botany Bay, or the Hulks; nor is it any mark of God's diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, John, that you were found out in your very firſt attempt."</p>
                  <p>Here the good juſtice left off ſpeaking, and no one could contradict the truth of what he had ſaid. Weſton humbly ſubmitted to his ſentence, but he was very poor, and knew not where to raiſe the money to pay his ſine. His character had always been ſo fair, that ſeveral far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers preſent kindly agreed to advance a trifle each to prevent his being ſent to priſon, and he thankfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to work out the debt. The juſtice himſelf, tho' he could not ſoften the law, yet ſhowed Weſton ſo much kindneſs, that he was enabled, before the year was out, to get out of this difficulty. He began to think more ſeriouſly than he had ever yet done, and grew to abhor poaching, not merely from fear, but from principle.</p>

We ſhall ſoon ſee whether poaching Giles always got off ſo ſucceſsfully. Here we have ſeen that proſperity is no ſure ſign of goodneſs.

                  <p>I THINK my readers got ſo well acquainted, laſt month, with Black Giles the Poacher, that they will not expect this month to hear any great good either of Giles himſelf, his wife Rachel, or any of their family. I am ſorry to expoſe their tricks, but it is their fault, not mine. If I pretend to ſpeak about peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at all I muſt tell the truth. I am ſure if folks would but turn about and mend, it would be a thouſand times pleaſanter to me to write their hiſtories; for it is no comfort to tell of any body's faults. If the world would but grow good, I ſhould be glad enough to tell of it; but till it really becomes ſo, I muſt go on deſcribing it as it is; otherwiſe, I ſhould only miſlead my readers, inſtead of inſtructing them.</p>
                  <p>As to Giles and his boys, I am ſure old Widow Brown has good reaſon to remember their dexterity.—
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035296_0159_1001C0804E30C448"/>Poor woman! ſhe had a fine little bed of onions in her neat and well-kept garden; ſhe was very fond of her onions, and many a rheumatiſm has ſhe caught by kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down to weed them in a damp day, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the little flannel cloak and the bit of an old mat which Madam Wilſon gave her, becauſe the old woman would needs weed in wet weather. Her onions ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways carefully treaſured up for her winter's ſtore; for an onion makes a little broth very reliſhing, and is indeed the only ſavory thing poor people are uſed to get. She alſo had a ſmall orchard, containing about a dozen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple trees, with which, in a good year, ſhe has been known to make a couple of barrels of cider, which ſhe ſold to her landlord towards paying her rent, beſides, having a little keg which ſhe was able to keep back for her own drinking. Well! would you believe it, Giles and his boys marked both onions and apples for their own; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a man who ſtole ſo many rabbits from the warren was likely enough to ſteal onions for ſauce. One day, when the widow was abroad on a little buſineſs, Giles and his boys made a clear riddance of the onion bed; and when they had pulled up every ſingle onion, they then turned a couple of pigs into the garden, who allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the ſmell, tore up the bed in ſuch a manner, that the widow, when ſhe came home, had not the leaſt doubt but the pigs had been the thieves. To confirm this opinion, they took care to leave the little hatch half open at one end of the garden, and to break down a bit of a fence at the other end.</p>
                  <p>I wonder how any body can find in his heart not to pity and reſpect poor old widows. There is ſomething ſo forlorn and helpleſs in their condition, that me thinks it is a call on every body, men, women and children, to do them all the kind ſervices that fall in their way.—Surely their having no one to take their part, is an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional reaſon for kind hearted people not to hurt and oppreſs them. But it was this very reaſon which led Giles to do this woman an hurt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="unknown:035296_0160_1001C084A5EE6360"/>
It happened unluckily for this poor widow that her cottage ſtood quite alone. On ſeveral mornings toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (for roguery gets up much earlier than induſtry,) Giles and his boys ſtole regularly into her orchard, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by their Jack Aſſes. She was ſo deaf that ſhe could not hear the aſſes if they had brayed ever ſo loud, and to this Giles truſted; for he was very cautious in his rogueries; ſince he could not otherwiſe have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to keep out of priſon; for though he was almoſt always ſuſpected, he had ſeldom been taken up, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver convicted. The boys uſed to fill their bags, load their aſſes, and then march off; and if in their way to the town where the apples were to be ſold, they chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to paſs by one of their neighbors who might be likely to ſuſpect them, they then all at once began to ſcream out, "buy my coal!—buy my ſand!"</p>
                  <p>Beſides the trees in her orchard, poor Widow Brown had in her ſmall garden one apple-tree particularly ſine; it was a Redſtreak, ſo tempting and ſo lovely, that Giles's family had watched it with longing eyes, till at laſt they reſolved on a plan for carrying off all this ſine fruit in their bags. But it was a nice point to manage. The tree ſtood directly under her chamber-window, ſo that there was ſome danger that ſhe might ſpie them at the work. They therefore determined to wait till the next Sunday morning, when they knew ſhe would not fail to be at church. Sunday came, and during ſervice Giles attended. It was a lone houſe, as I ſaid before, and the reſt of the pariſh were ſafe at church. In a trice the tree was cleared, the bags were filled, the aſſes were whipt, the thieves were off, the coaſt was clear, and all was ſafe and quiet by the time the ſermon was over.</p>
                  <p>Unluckily, however, it happened that this tree was ſo beautiful and the fruit ſo ſine, that the people as they uſed to paſs to and from church, were very apt to ſtop and admire Widow Brown's Redſtreaks; and ſome of the farmers rather envied her, that, in that ſcarce ſeaſon,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:035296_0161_1001C08BDE2FF760"/>when they hardly expected to make a pye out of a large orchard, ſhe was likely to make cider from a ſingle tree. I am afraid, indeed, if I muſt ſpeak out, ſhe herſelf rather ſet her heart too much upon this tree, and had felt as much pride as gratitude to a good providence for it; but this failing of her's was no excuſe for Gil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s. The covetouſneſs of this thief had for once got the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his caution; the tree was too completely ſtripped though the youngeſt boy Dick did beg hard that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would leave the poor old woman enough for a few dumplings, and when Giles ordered Dick in his turn to ſhake the tree, the boy did it ſo gently that hardly any apples fell, for which he got a good ſhake of the ſtick with which the old man was beating down the apples.</p>
                  <p>The neighbors, on their return from church, ſtopped as uſual, but it was not, alas! to admire the apples, for apples there were none left; but to lament the robbery and conſole the widow: meantime the Red ſtreaks were ſafely lodged in Giles's hovel, under a few bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of hay which he had contrived to pull from the farmers mow the night before, for the uſe of his jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſes. Such a ſtir, however, began to be made about the widow's apple-tree, that Giles, who knew how much his character laid him open to ſuſpicion, as ſoon as he ſaw the people ſafe in church again in the afternoon, ordered his boys to carry each a hatful of the apples, and thruſt them in at a little caſement window which happened to be open in the houſe of Samuel Price, a very honeſt carpenter in that pariſh, who was at church with his whole family. Giles's plan, by this contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, was to lay the theft on Price's ſons, in caſe the thing ſhould come to be further enquired into. Here Dick put in a word, and begged and prayed his father not to force them to carry the apples to Price's. But all that he got by his begging, was ſuch a knock as had nearly laid him on the earth.—"What, you cowardly raſcal," ſaid Giles, "you will go and peach I ſuppoſe,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:035296_0162_1001C08EEEC530B8"/>and get your father ſent to gaol." Poor Widow Brown, though her trouble had made her ſtill weaker than ſhe was, went to church again in the afternoon; indeed ſhe rightly thought that trouble was a new rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why ſhe ought to go. During this ſervice ſhe tried with all her might not to think of her Redſtreaks, and whenever they would come into her head ſhe took up her prayer book directly, and ſo ſhe forgot them a little, and indeed ſhe found herſelf much eaſier when ſhe came out of the church than when ſhe went in. Now it happened oddly enough, that on that Sunday, of all the Sundays in the year, ſhe ſhould call in to reſt a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle at Samuel Price's, to tell over again the lamentable ſtory of the apples, and to conſult with him how the thief might be brought to juſtice. But, O reader! gueſs if you can, for I am ſure I cannot tell you, what was her ſurpriſe, when on going into Samuel Price's kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſhe ſaw her own Redſtreaks lying in the window! The apples were of a ſort too remarkable for color, ſhape, and ſize to be miſtaken. There was not ſuch another tree in the pariſh. Widow Brown immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcreamed out, "laſs-a-day! as ſure as can be here are my Redſtreaks; I could ſwear to them in any court." Samuel Price who believed his ſons to be as honeſt as himſelf, was ſhocked and troubled at the ſight. He knew he had no Redſtreaks of his own; he knew there were no apples in the window when he went to church. He did verily believe them to be the widow's. But how they came there he could not poſſibly gueſs. He called for Tom, the only one of his ſons who now liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at home. Tom was at the Sunday ſchool, which he had never once miſſed ſince Mr. Wilſon the miniſter had ſet up one in the pariſh. Was ſuch a boy likely to do ſuch a deed?</p>
                  <p>A croud was by this time got about Price's door, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which was Giles and his boys, who had already taken care to ſpread the news that Tom Price was the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035296_0163_1001A34D5F0596E0"/>thief. Moſt people were unwilling to believe it. His character was very good, but appearances were ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt him. Mr. Wilſon, who had ſtaid to chriſten a child, now came in. He was much concerned that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Price, the beſt boy in his ſchool, ſhould ſtand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of ſuch a crime. He ſent for the boy, examined and croſs examined him. No marks of guilt appeared. But ſtill though he pleaded <hi>not guilty,</hi> there lay the Redſtreaks in his father's window. All the idle fellows in the place, who were likely to have committed ſuch a theft themſelves, fell with great vengeance on poor Tom. The wicked ſeldom give any quarter. "This is one of your ſanctified ones!" cried they. "This was all the good that Sunday ſchools did! For their parts they never ſaw any good come by religion. Sunday was the only day for a little paſtime, and if poor boys muſt be ſhut up with their godly books when they ought to be out taking a little pleaſure, it was no wonder they made themſelves amends by ſuch tricks." Another ſaid, he ſhould like to ſee Parſon Wilſon's righteous one well whipped. A third hoped he would be clapped in the ſtocks for a young hypocrite as he was, while old Giles, who thought to avoid ſuſpicion by being more violent than the reſt, declared, that "he hoped the young dog would be tranſported for life."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Wilſon was too wiſe and too juſt to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Tom without full proof. He declared the crime was a very heavy one, and he feared that heavy muſt be the puniſhment. Tom, who knew his own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, earneſtly prayed to God that it might be made to appear as clear as the noon-day, and very fervent were his ſecret devotions on that night.</p>
                  <p>Black Giles paſſed his night in a very different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. He ſet off as ſoon as it was dark with his ſons and their jack-aſſes laden with their ſtolen goods. As ſuch a cry was raiſed about the apples, he did not think it ſafe to keep them longer at home, but reſolved to go
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:035296_0164_1001C09125B0C9D8"/>and ſell them at the next town; borrowing without leave, a lame colt out of the moor to aſſiſt in carrying off his booty.</p>
                  <p>Giles and his eldeſt ſons had rare ſport all the way in thinking, that while they were enjoying the profit of their plunder, Tom Price would be whipped round the market place at leaſt, if not ſent beyond ſea. But the younger boy, Dick, who had naturally a tender heart, though hardened by his long familiarity with ſin, could not help crying when he thought that Tom Price might perhaps be tranſported for a crime which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had helped to commit. He had no compunction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the robbery, for he had not been inſtructed in the great principles of truth and juſtice. Nor would he, therefore, perhaps, have had much remorſe about accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an innocent boy. But tho' utterly devoid of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, he had ſome remains of natural feeling and of gratitude. Tom Price had often given him a bit of his own bread and cheeſe; and once, when Dick was like to be drowned, Tom had jumped into the pond with his clothes on, and ſaved his life when he was juſt ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: the remembrance of all this made his heart heavy. He ſaid nothing: as he trotted barefoot after the aſſes, he heard his father and brothers laugh at having out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted the godly ones; and he grieved to think how poor Tom would ſuffer for his wickedneſs, yet fear kept him ſilent; they called him ſulky dog, and laſhed the aſſes till, they bled.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time Tom Price kept up his ſpirits as well as he could. He worked hard all day, and prayed heartily night and morning. "It is true," ſaid he to himſelf, "I am not guilty of this ſin; but let this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation ſet me on examining myſelf, and truly repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all my other ſins, for I found enough to repent of, though I thank God I did not ſteal thoſe apples."</p>
                  <p>At length Sunday came. Tom went to ſchool as u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual. As ſoon as he walked in there was a deal of
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:035296_0165_1001C09700099CF0"/>whiſpering and laughing among the worſt of the boys; and he overheard them ſay, "who would have thought it? This is maſter's favorite! This is Parſon Wilſon's ſober Tommy! We ſhan't have Tommy thrown in our teeth again if we go to get a bird's neſt, or gather a few nuts of a Sunday." "Your demure ones are always hypocrites," ſays another. "The ſtill ſow ſucks all the milk," ſays a third.</p>
                  <p>Giles's family had always kept clear of the ſchool.—Dick, indeed, had ſometimes wiſhed to go, not that he had much ſenſe of ſin, or deſire after goodneſs, but he thought if he could once read, he might riſe in the world, and not be forced to drive aſſes all his life.—Through this whole Saturday night he could not ſleep. He longed to know what would be done to Tom. He began to wiſh to go to ſchool, but he had not courage; ſin is very cowardly; ſo on the Sunday morning he went and ſat himſelf down under the church wall. Mr. Wilſon paſſed by. It was not his way to reject the moſt wicked, till he had tried every means to bring them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and even then he pitied and prayed for them. He had indeed long left off talking to Giles's ſons; but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dick ſitting by himſelf, he once more ſpoke to him, deſired him to leave off his vagabond life, and go with him into the ſchool. The boy hung down his head, but made no anſwer. He did not, however, either riſe up and run away, or look ſulky, as he uſed to do. The Miniſter deſired him once more. "Sir," ſaid the boy, "I can't go; I am ſo big I am aſhamed." "The big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger you are the leſs time you have to looſe." "But, Sir, I can't read." "Then it is high time you ſhould learn." "I ſhould be aſhamed to begin to learn my letters."—"The ſhame is not in beginning to learn them, but in being contented never to know them." "But, Sir, I am ſo raggod!" "God looks at the heart, and not at the coat." "But, Sir, I have no ſhoes and ſtockings." "So much the worſe. I remember who gave you
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035296_0166_1001C098A529A048"/>both," (here Dick coloured.) "It is bad to want ſhoes and ſtockings; but ſtill if you can drive your aſſes a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen miles without them, you may certainly walk to ſchool without them." "But, Sir, the good boys will hate me, and won't ſpeak to me." "Good boys hate nobody, and as to not ſpeaking to you, to be ſure they will not keep you company while you go on in your preſent evil courſes; but as ſoon as they ſee you wiſh to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, they will help you, and pity you, and teach you, and ſo come along." Here Mr. Wilſon took this dirty boy by the hand, and gently pulled him forward, kindly talking to him all the way.</p>
                  <p>How the whole ſchool ſtared to ſee Dick Giles come in! No one, however, dared to ſay what he thought. The buſineſs went on, and Dick ſlunk into a corner, partly to hide his rags, and partly to hide his ſin, for laſt Sundays tranſaction ſat heavy at his heart, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had ſtolen the apples, but becauſe Tom Price had been accuſed. This, I ſay, made him ſlink behind. Poor boy! he little thought there was One ſaw him who ſees all things, aad from whoſe eye no hole nor corner can hide the ſinner.</p>
                  <p>It was the cuſtom in that ſchool for the maſter, who was a good and wiſe man, to mark down in his pocket book all the events of the week, that he might turn them to ſome account in his Sunday evening inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſuch as any uſeful ſtory in the newſpaper, any account of boys being drowned as they were out in a pleaſure boat on Sundays; any ſudden death in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, or any other remarkable viſitation of Providence, inſomuch, that many young people of the place, who did not belong to the ſchool, and many parents alſo, uſed to drop in for an hour on a Sunday evening, when they were ſure to hear ſomething profitable. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter greatly approved this practice, and often called in
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:035296_0167_1001C09B52D22168"/>himſelf, which was a great ſupport to the maſter, and encouragement to the people.</p>
                  <p>The maſter had taken a deep concern in the ſtory of widow Brown's apple-tree. He could not believe Tom Price was guilty, nor dared he pronounce him innocent; but he reſolved to turn the inſtructions of the preſent evening to this ſubject. He began thus; "My Dear boys, however light ſome of you may make of robbing an orchard, yet I have often told you there is no ſuch thing as a little ſin, if it be wilful or habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. I wiſh now to explain to you alſo, that there is hardly ſuch a thing as a ſingle, ſolitary ſin. You know I teach you not merely to repeat the commandments as an exerciſe for your memory, but as a rule for your conduct. If you were to come here only to learn to read and ſpell on a Sunday, I ſhould think that was not employing God's day for God's work; but I teach you to read that you may by this means come ſo to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Bible and the Catechiſm, as to make every text in the one, and every queſtion and anſwer in the other, to be ſo fixed in your hearts, that they may bring forth the fruits of good living.</p>

                     <p>I will put the caſe. Some wicked boy has robbed widow Brown's orchard. (Here the eyes of every one were turned on poor Tom Price, except thoſe of Dick Ciles, who fixed his on the ground.)

                  <p>"I will now go one ſtep further.

But if it be otherwiſe, if Tom Price ſhould be found guilty, 'tis not his good character ſhall ſave him. I ſhall ſhed tears over him, but puniſh him I muſt."—"No, that you ſhan't, roared out Dick Giles, who ſprung from his hiding place, fell on his knees, and burſt out a crying, "Tom Price is as good a boy as ever lived; it was father and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>It would have done your heart good to have ſeen the joy of the maſter, the modeſt bluſhes of Tom Price, and the ſatisfaction of every honeſt boy in the ſchool.—All ſhook hands with Tom, and even Dick got ſome portion of pity. I wiſh I had room to give my readers the moving exhortation which the maſter gave. But while Mr. Wilſon left the guilty boy to the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the maſter, he thought it became him, as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and a Magiſtrate, to go to the extent of the law in puniſhing the father. Early on the Monday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſent to apprehend Giles; in the mean time, Mr. Wilſon was ſent for to a gardener's houſe, two miles diſtant, to attend a man who w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s dying. This was a duty to which all others gave way in his mind. He ſet out directly, but what was his ſurpriſe on his arrival to ſee, on a little bed, on the floor, poaching Giles lying in all the agonies of death! Jack Weſton, the ſame poor
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:035296_0170_1001C0A5DAE3F110"/>young man againſt whom Giles had informed for kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a hare, was kneeling by him, offering him ſome broth, and talking to him in the kindeſt manner. Mr. Wilſon begged to know the meaning of all this, and Jack Weſton ſpoke as follows:</p>
                  <p>"At four this morning, as I was going out to mow, paſſing under the high wall of this garden, I heard a moſt diſmal moaning. The nearer I came, the more diſmal it grew. At laſt, who ſhould I ſee but poor Giles groaning and ſtruggling under a quantity of bricks and ſtones, but not able to ſtir. The day before he had marked a fine large not on this old wall, and reſolved to ſteal it, for he thought it might do as well to ketch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges as to preſerve cherries; ſo, Sir, ſtanding on the very top of this wall, and tugging with all his might to looſen the net from the hooks which faſtened it, down came Giles, net, wall and all, for the wall was gone to decay. It was very high indeed, and poor Giles not only broke his thigh, but has got a terrible blow on his brain, and is bruiſed all over like a mummy. On ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, Sir, poor Giles cried out, 'O Jack! I did try to ruin thee by lodging that information, and now thou wilt be revenged by letting me lie here and periſh.'—God forbid, Giles, cried I: thou ſhalt ſee what ſort of revenge a Chriſtian takes. So, Sir, I ſent off the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener's boy to fetch a ſurgeon, while I ſcampered home and brought on my back this bit of a hammock, which is indeed my own bed, and put Giles upon it, we then lifted him up bed and all, as tenderly as if he had been a gentleman, and brought him in here. My wife has juſt brought him a drop of nice broth, and now, Sir, as I have done what I could for his poor periſhing body, it was I who took the liberty to ſend to you to come to try to help his poor ſoul, for the Doctor ſays he can't live."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Wilſon could not help ſaying to himſelf, "Such an action as this is worth a whole volume of comments
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:035296_0171_1001C0AB741B2838"/>on that precept of our bleſſed Maſter, 'Do good to them that hate you." Giles's dying groans confirmed the ſad account Weſton had juſt given. The poor wretch could neither pray himſelf nor attend to the Miniſter. He could only cry out, "Oh Sir, what will become of me? I don't know how to repent. Oh my poor wicked children! Sir, I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ed them all up in ſin and ignorance. Have mercy on them, Sir; let me not meet them in the place of torment to which I am going."—He languiſhed a few days and died in the greateſt miſery.</p>
                  <p>Except the—Miniſter and Jack Weſton, no one came to ſee poor Giles, beſides Tom Price, who had been ſo ſadly wronged by him. Tom often brought him his own rice milk or apple dumpling, and Giles, ignorant and depraved as he was, often cried out, that he thought now there muſt be ſome truth in religion, ſince it taught even a boy to <hi>deny himself</hi> and to <hi>forgive an injury.</hi>—Mr. Wilſon the next Sunday made a moving diſcourſe on the danger of what are called "petty offences."—This, together with the awful death of Giles, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſuch an effect, that no Poacher has been able to ſhew his head in that pariſh ever ſince.</p>

This Mr. Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as I have heard, did not break through any violent miſconduct: he never was guilty of any ſcandalous and immediately ruinous tranſactions like ſome others, but then he was inattentive to his buſineſs, and by this mere inattention he was year after year dropping down, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being aware of it, into ſure and certain ruin: he never could be perſuaded to look carefully into his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which was owing at firſt to idleneſs, and latterly to this additional cauſe, that a certain kind of fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and falſe ſhame had got about him, inſomuch, that when ſome friends of his, who perceived his ignorance of book-keeping, offered, on the Chriſtmas before he broke, to lend him ſome aſſiſtance, he abſolutely decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, which was conſidered always as one of the moſt unpardonable parts of his whole conduct.</p>
                  <p>I propoſe now, after the example of theſe friends of Mr. Careleſs, to hold out to my readers ſome aſſiſtance in entering into that ſelf-examination which I am here preſſing upon them, and if they think proper to neglect
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:035296_0174_1001C0C2DDC54EB0"/>the help that is offered them, I can only ſay, that I think they really ſo much reſemble Mr. Careleſs, that they ought to come forward and take his part, and to defend his character from thoſe ſevere cenſures which I am told that his neglect of a like offer has every where brought upon him.</p>
                  <p>But let me firſt add a ſew more words to prove that the kind of comperiſon which I have ſpoken of, is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a juſt one; for many people ſeem by no means to be convinced, that a man may be ruined in his ſoul by mere neglect, in the ſame manner as he may in his trading buſineſs.—I will venture to obſerve on this head, that neglect is apt to bring on ruin not in a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer's ſhop only, but even in every thing. Name me now, if you can, any trade or profeſſion in life which can thrive without diligence. Has not God ſo made the world, as to ſhew that man muſt be diligent, and that it is at his peril to be neglectful? There is no bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs that will do itſelf; moreover, if a man be ever ſo diligent in one thing, but quite neglectful of another, he is ſure to feel the conſequence even of this partial careleſſneſs. If a farmer was to look well to his labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the field, but not to mind his marketing; or if trader Thrifty was to be always bringing up his books in the counting-houſe, but was never to go forward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſhop and wait upon his cuſtomers, do you think he would not ſuffer by it?—So if a man minds this world only, and never thinks of the next, the buſineſs of the next world will certainly not be done, as he will find hereafter to his coſt. Some men, if any one ſhould enquire into the ſtate of their ſouls, and ſhould aſk <hi>for a reason of the hope that is in them,</hi> would merely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in general, that God is merciful, and that Chriſt died for them, and add the like general reaſons, which any man in Chriſtendom may give as well as they; and if you were to preſs them further, they could only ſay, "I know not much about the matter, I hope well, I truſt
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:035296_0175_1001A367F5FFDA40"/>God with my ſoul: I ſhall fare as well as other men do: I thank God I never made any doubt of my Salvation." Now what do all ſuch kind of ſayings diſcover, but a wilful neglect of their Salvation? It is as if a ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter ſhould let his veſſel alone and ſay, "I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it among the rocks, and waves, and winds: I will truſt God with it: it will fare as well as other veſſels." I ſay, what horrible abuſe of God's mercy is this! He commands us to give diligence to make our calling and election ſure, and in this way of diligence truſt him.</p>
                  <p>It may further be added, that in general we find in all our affairs in this life, that whatever is moſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, requires the higheſt degree of care and diligence: ought we not, therefore, to fear leaſt negligence ſhould prove the moſt fatal of all in the concerns of the immort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſoul, which are certainly the greateſt of our concerns? What care is neceſſary to keep alive our body: it muſt be daily fed, and clothed, and cheriſhed, and provided for in a vaſt variety of ways; and it is not neceſſary to lay violent hands upon it in order to deſtroy it. If due care be not taken of it, it periſhes of courſe. So it is with a man's ſoul; it is certainly periſhing if its inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts are neglected and forgotten by him, and it may be as effectually deſtroyed without any great ſin, as the body may without any great blow.</p>
                  <p>Once more I beg leave to add, that it is no proof our ſouls are ſafe, that we feel at preſent no harm or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience from our neglect of them. Mr. Careleſs felt no inconvenience from <hi>his</hi> neglect at the time when he aſked Thrifty to dinner. His bankruptcy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him quite like a thunder-clap: his things, indeed, were in confuſion before, but the ſame idleneſs which kept him from examining them, kept him from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beforehand the miſery that awaited him. I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, therefore, that the cheerfulneſs of which ſome thoughtleſs and irreligious people make their boaſt, is no proof of their ſafety, but is merely like the gaiety of
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:035296_0176_1001C0CCB2E017F8"/>Mr. Careleſs on the day when he was making merry with his company, inſtead of caſting up his books and minding the main chance, as it is called.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt obſerve further, that there is one great error which a vaſt number of people fall into, and by which they are apt to be made very eaſy under the moſt complete neglect of their ſouls. The miſtake I mean is the following one—they are diligent, as they call it, at their duty: thus, for inſtance, they dig hard, if digging is their buſineſs; they write and caſt accounts, and keep ſhop diligently, if they are clerks or ſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers; or they do their exerciſe briſkly, and follow orders readily, if they are ſoldiers or ſailors, and having done this their daily work, they think they have done all that can be required of them. Religion they poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly allow to be a good thing, but this they ſay is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: nay, to do their work well, is the beſt ſort of religion, and they deſire to know no other. Let us now combat this error, which has a very fair appearance, and which has alſo ſome mixture of truth with it.</p>
                  <p>Preſuming my readers to believe the Bible, I will here, in the firſt place, quote Scripture on the ſubject. If to labor merely in our calling, is one and the ſame thing as to labor for our ſouls, how comes our Saviour to have uſed for inſtance ſuch expreſſions as the following? <hi>Labor not for the meat that perisheth, but for the meat which endureth to everlasting life.</hi> I grant our Saviour does not hereby mean, that we ought not in any ſenſe to labor for the <hi>meat that perisheth,</hi> but he certainly muſt mean that we ought not to labor for this only, nor even for this chiefly; he muſt alſo mean, that there is a duty called by him "laboring for everlaſting life," which is a diſtinct thing from laboring to ſupport our bodies; for if theſe things were not diſtinct, he would not have mentioned them ſo diſtinctly. Again our Saviour ſpeaks of a man who had been <hi>filling his garners and laying up goods for many years,</hi> who evidently, therefore, was
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035296_0177_1001C0D6259C4BC0"/>a very diligent man in his buſineſs, and yet this is the very man who is pointed out as one whoſe ſoul had been neglected: for it is ſaid, <hi>Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee.</hi> I will add another remarkable ſaying of our Saviour on the ſame ſubject. He deſcribes the general invitation to attend to the Goſpel by comparing it to "a Marriage Supper," to which, ſaid he, when men were aſked to come, <hi>they all with one consent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make excuse, for one went to his farm, another to his merchandize. One said, I have bought a yoke of oxen, and I must needs go and prove them, and another said, I have married a wife, and therefere I cannot come.</hi> Nothing can prove more plainly than this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the point we are now urging; for it ſhews, that attention to our worldly buſineſs, ſo far from being the ſame thing as attention to religion, is often the main hindrance to it. I am going to my farm, ſaid the men in Chriſt's time, and therefore I cannot attend to the Goſpel. I am going to my farm, ſay theſe men now; but they have the face even to pretend that this is the ſame thing as attending to the Goſpel, than which, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more contrary to our Saviour's declaration. Our Saviour ends his parable by aſſuring all the people who put him off by any ſuch excuſes, that <hi>none of those men that were bidden shall taste of his Supper;</hi> which is as if he had ſaid, "You who give no attention to the Goſpel, ſhall have no ſhare in the benefits of it. You have been invited indeed, but ſince you do not come, you ſhall never taſte of its ſalvation."</p>
                  <p>And indeed it ſeems quite agreeable to reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that God, who has made man to conſiſt both of body and mind, is not likely to be ſatisfied with his mere bodily labor, but that he muſt require the affections of the mind to be given to Him alſo. If mere diligence in our calling is all in all, I ſee not why a man may not be allowed even to deny the being of God: for an Atheiſt may very poſſibly be led to mind his buſineſs
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:035296_0178_1001C0DA77BFAAE0"/>tolerably well from mere worldly motives, and juſt in like manner ſome perſons who call themſelves Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, may be induced to go on regularly with their work, all the while forgetting God as much as if they were down-right Atheiſts.</p>
                  <p>Having thus proved, as I truſt, the neceſſity of attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the intereſts of the ſoul, and having alſo ſhewn that it is not ſufficient to carry on our worldly buſineſs merely on worldly principles, I ſhall proceed to the main point which is before us, namely, to offer the reader ſome help towards a ſerious examination of his conduct during the laſt year; and I truſt that what will be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid, will throw much additional light on the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſebject.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, then, I deſire the reader ſeriouſly to aſk himſelf, <hi>What has been the ordinary ground and motive of his actions during the last year?</hi> You proſeſs, I doubt not, to believe in God, and you expect hereafter to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Him; but have you in the laſt year made it the leading motive of all your actions, to endeavor to pleaſe Him? It is in vain to think that you have pleaſed Him, if you have not intended to pleaſe Him. How is it that we judge in caſes that ariſe between a man and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creatures? I believe a wiſe, for inſtance, would not much thank her huſband for doing her a kindneſs, if ſhe thought he never intended her a kindneſs, and had her not at all in his thoughts when he did it. Her huſband's affection is the thing ſhe chiefly wants, and the kind action is only ſo far pleaſing to her, as it is a ſymptom of this affection in the mind. Now all this is extremely reaſonable; there is ſome nicety, I grant, in the diſtinction, but it is a nicety we all very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in our own caſe, and we have no right, therefore, to ſay that we cannot underſtand it when God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. <hi>My son</hi> (ſaith God to us in the Scripture) <hi>give me thine heart.</hi> And again, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and all thy soul, and
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035296_0179_1001C0E49700CF28"/>all thy strength;</hi> this is the firſt and great command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Diſregarding this claim, we toil, we dig, we labor for our daily bread, without almoſt thinking of God in it, and at the year's end we expect him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this bodily ſervice (though performed with a mere view to our own worldly benefit) inſtead of the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he has required of us.</p>
                  <p>Now as this is a very great and awful ſubject, and as it is one on which every thing elſe that we ſhall add will be made to reſt, let us endeavor to lead the reader to dwell very ſeriouſly upon it. God is that being in whoſe character is to be found every poſſible perfection: He is moſt great and glorious, and holy, and excellent, and bountiful, and benevolent; and he is alſo full of compaſſion and tender mercy. Has any fellow-creature a claim to our regard? God has a ſtill clearer and more undoubted claim; and if we refuſe to pay regard to God, we may on much the ſame ground refuſe to honor our father, to love our neareſt relations, and to render thanks to all our earthly benefactors. They that never think of God, may, on a like principle, excuſe themſelves from ever thinking of them alſo: for is He not our Benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? Is He not our Father? Is it not He that ſends us thoſe very friends who are ſuch comforts to us, and who beſtows upon us all our bleſſings? Endeavor now to count all His mercies to you during the paſt year. Number firſt all the bleſſings that have come to you by the means of friends, and all your various family com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; theſe all have proceeded originally from God: Think next of the ſucceſs which you may have had in your calling. It is not your own hand that has gotten you the guineas which perhaps you have been lately numbering—It is the Lord. Think next of the health you have had, and the degree of freedom from bodily pain. It is God alſo that defends us <hi>from the noisome pestilence, from the arrow that flieth by night, and from the pestilence that walketh at noon-day.</hi> Again, think
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035296_0180_1001C0E6872FEF70"/>of the dangers of other kinds which you may in the laſt year have eſcaped, whether from ſecret enemies or open violence: the dangers to your perſon, to your proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to your reputation. Why is it that you are alive and well, and in ſo much ſecurity, at the year's end? It is becauſe the Lord hath been with you by night and by day, to watch over you, and guard and protect you, and keep you from evil. To theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, if you add your own particular and ſpecial mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and if you add, moreover, all the infinite bleſſings of the goſpel, ſuch as the promiſe of the forgiveneſs of ſins, through Jeſus Chriſt, and the hope of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, ſurely you muſt own that the Lord's goodneſs is vaſt and unſpeakable, and that his mercies are over all his works, and that they are more in number than the hairs of your head, and as the ſands on the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, innumerable. Do you not now, therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſee the nature of your obligation to him, and the reaſonableneſs of endeavoring to pleaſe a Being who is thus great and good alſo? What becomes, then, of that obſervation, ſo plauſible to an irreligious mind, namely, that if we have but done our work regularly, we have fulfilled our duty, even though God has not been thought of in it? Surely it is an obſervation full of baſeneſs and ingratitude. I believe no man, who loves his family and friends, forbears to think of them now and then, while his hand is at its labor; and why are not our thoughts to aſcend in like manner to God, as the great father of mercies, while the day's buſineſs is going forward; and why may not the deſire to pleaſe Him well in all things, form the very motive and ſpur to all our induſtry? Has this, then, been the ground and motive of your diligence during the laſt year? This is the firſt queſtion that is propoſed to you.</p>
                  <p>When this duty of regarding God in all things is well ſettled and underſtood (a duty which, by-the-by, is of all duties the ſtrongeſt and cleareſt) then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:035296_0181_1001C0EC7A2A84A8"/>eaſy to prove a number of further points, which are apt otherwiſe to be neglected; as for inſtance, <hi>the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to worship God in public and in secret.</hi> If we ſeel that regard to God which has been ſpoken of, we ſhall be naturally, as it were, diſpoſed to pray to him. If we feel the obligations that have been mentioned, we ſhall be ready to kneel down and thank him; and if we are ſenſible that it is He who not only ſupplies our wants, but alſo forgives us our ſins, and likewiſe that it is by Him alone, as the Scripture tells us, that we are enabled to think a good thought, and to fulfil any one duty aright, it follows that we ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually enlarging our petitions to Him, and that we ſhall call upon Him daily for all theſe important and indiſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nſible bleſſings. Have you then been thus lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a life of dependance on God, and truly devout pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Him, both in the public congregation, in your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and in ſecret, during the laſt year?</p>
                  <p>When this duty to God is well underſtood, then the ſin of <hi>neglecting the Sabbath</hi> begins to ſeem very plain alſo. This is that day which has been mercifully ſet apart for religious uſes, it therefore is the day for more particular and earneſt prayer in private and in public, and alſo for more regular ſelf-examination than can always take place on other days; and it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that as on every Sunday we ought to call our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to account for our behaviour during the week, ſo at the year's end it may be proper to take ourſelves to taſk for all our conduct on the Sabbaths; for if they have been neglected, it is more than probable that our whole duty has been neglected by us.</p>
                  <p>We will next ſpeak of <hi>reading the Scriptures.</hi> The difuſe of this practice ariſes from the ſame cauſe which we have before referred to, namely the want of a due regard to God. Many of thoſe who are moſt negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in this point, nevertheleſs acknowledge the Bible to be the word of God. It is plain therefore that the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:035296_0182_1001C0F602801748"/>negligence of theſe perſons muſt ariſe from their feeling no deſire to know what is the will of their Heavenly Father; for if they felt a deſire to know his will, they certainly would take all means of knowing it. If a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant had got a letter directed to him which he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be from his maſter, and was zealous to do his mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's will, do you think he would not be eager to open and read the letter? And if we are earneſt in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to know and do the will of God, ſhall we not be eager to open and read the ſcriptures? I believe it is the excuſe of ſome that the ſcriptures are difficult to be underſtood, and that their meaning in many places is doubtful; to which I anſwer, that ſo is the meaning of all books more or leſs to ſome kind of perſons. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection proves only at the moſt, that you ſhould read for the preſent thoſe parts of them which are more eaſy, and which have the moſt manifeſt tendency to do you good. In fact, however, it is the want of a deep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern about the ſalvation of our ſouls, (which is the chief ſubject the bible treats of) that cauſes it to appear ſo difficult, as well as inſipid and unimproving as it does to ſome people.</p>
                  <p>We have ſpoken hitherto only of religious duties.—We will now ſay ſomething of the ordinary duties of life, and if we deſcribe them truly, it will immediately appear that even theſe are not likely to have been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in any reſpect as they ought, unleſs there has been a religious principle for the foundation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, how have you performed the duties of your own calling in the laſt year? Here it may perhaps be anſwered by ſome people, "We have no calling, for we are able through the money which we have ſaved, or which our fathers have ſaved for us, to live without work. We have therefore had nothing to do; we are independent perſons." What, then, are you independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of God? It is the buſineſs of religion to put an end to this fancied right to independence, and to ſubject e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every thought, word, and action, to the will of a ſuperior,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:035296_0183_1001C0FCF6586638"/>to the will I mean of a ſtrict and holy God. What a bleſſing to ſociety is religion when conſidered in this view! It turns all thoſe perſons who are otherwiſe the drones of the community, into ſome of the moſt for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> able people in it. O, how many troubles and miſeries are there in this land, which, if a few more of our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent ladies and gentlemen would be ſo good as to turn Chriſtians, (I mean zealous Chriſtians!) would preſently be relieved. What a great number of poor cottagers are there who drag on life both in wickedneſs and miſery, for the want of being overlooked, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and adviſed, and now and then aſſiſted by their ſuperiors who dwell near them? Here perhaps a whole pariſh is neglected through want of a Chriſtian pariſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> officer; there the accounts of an hoſpital need examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or a work houſe is given up to vice and ruin; here a uſeful club wants a treaſurer or patron, or a declining charity ſchool is without an inſpector, or a new ſchool ought to be ſet up? here again a private quarrel is rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which the interference of a ſuperior, if he ſhould alſo be a Chriſtian, might preſently heal. What innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable opportunities alſo has an independent perſon of diſtributing religious books, or conveying ſerious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to thoſe whom Providence has placed under his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. Now theſe are the employments which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the calling of independent people. Chriſtianity brings them to a ſtrict ſenſe of their reſponſibility in theſe and many other like points, and at the ſame time enlarge their hearts in love to all their fellow creatures.</p>
                  <p>Well then, have you followed this your Chriſtian calling, and followed it diligently during the laſt year? Oh! no, you are one of thoſe perhaps who have ſpent the whole year in ſome triffling employment, merely to gratify your own taſte, or to pleaſe your own vanity. Theſe are the things which have formed your chief calling, and while the vices of the poor have been dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully increaſing in your pariſh, and the groans of the
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:035296_0184_1001C1069E863968"/>miſerable have been almoſt reaching your door, you have been ſpending your little independent income on yourſelf and fancying that all was well.</p>
                  <p>But let us next addreſs the more laboring part of the community, and if they will allow us to examine them cloſely, I believe it will equally appear, that a Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian principle is neceſſary in their caſe, in order to carry them through their buſineſs with real faithfulneſs and integrity. Firſt, have none of you been on the whole very idle during the laſt year? Are there none who have ſlackened in their work becauſe they thought the Pariſh muſt relieve them whenever thier idleneſs ſhould have brought them to want? Are there none who have choſen rather to burthen ſome charitable friend than to buckle heartily to their work? And has every one of you been as diligent juſt after he had got a week's wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in hand as before? Now, Chriſtianity will have led you to work at all times, not on Saturday only, but on Monday alſo, making conſcience of habitual diligence; nay, you will have been ready (as the apoſtle exhorts) <hi>to work with your hands in the things that are good that you may have to give to him that needeth.</hi> And how have you employed both your time and thoughts when the regular hours of work has been over? <hi>Which of you, says</hi> Chriſt, <hi>having a servant ploughing or feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cattle will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, go and set thou down to meat, and will not rather say to him, make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself and serve me.</hi> Thus does our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour teach us that we are all (rich indeed as well as poor) like ſo many ſervants, who when we have done ſerving our maſter in the field, muſt then go and ſerve him in the houſe. The Chriſtian laborer therefore is one who has no ſooner done ſerving Chriſt by his ordin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary calling abroad, than he proceeds next to ſerve the ſame maſter by his chriſtian conduct at home, by uſeful converſation with his children, by reading a portion of
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:035296_0185_1001C10AF5C91AA0"/>ſcripture to them, and by uniting with them in prayer to the great Father of Mercies for a bleſſing on all the family before they lie down to reſt.</p>
                  <p>Again, aſk yourſelf whether you may not have been more or leſs an <hi>eye-servant?</hi> If you are a common gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening man, have you not worked harder when the head gardener was in the garden, than when he was out of it? And if a clerk or apprentice, have you not made more ſpeed when your employer has happened to come into the ſhop or counting-houſe? If a footman, have you been as faithful and diligent, have you riſen as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, worked as ſteadily, gone your errands as nimbly, and turned your hand to any thing wanted of you, as readily as if your maſter had ſtood by watching you? Now, if you are a Chriſtian ſervant, you will have done every thing, under the impreſſion that One who is far greater than your earthly maſter, has been always at hand obſerving you. <hi>Servants,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>obey your masters, not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The idleneſs and eye-ſervice which have been ſpoken of, neceſſarily imply alſo ſome injuſtice to your employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: You have agreed with him to give him ſo much work for ſo much pay; but if you have ſecretly waſted in idleneſs, or turned to your own uſe, a part of that time which you engaged to give your maſter, you have then robbed him of his due; you have as much wronged your maſter, as your maſter would have wronged you, if he had ſecretly taken back a part of the wages he had profeſſed to give you, or had knowingly miſcounted the money in his own favor while he was paying you.</p>
                  <p>Again, there are many kinds of diſhoneſty which are practiſed almoſt without reflection, and with a very quiet conſcience, becauſe cuſtom is ſuppoſed to author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize them; the new-year, therefore, ſeems a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time for examining into theſe points. It may in
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:035296_0186_1001C1100A1B7A88"/>general be ſuſpected, that all profits or <hi>privileges,</hi> as they are called, which are carefully concealed, have ſomething diſhoneſt in them, for if they are quite hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, why ſhould they not be public? The difficulty of breaking through theſe cuſtoms, is often much increaſed by a certain falſe ſhame, which makes people afraid of doing it, leaſt they ſhould thereupon be charged with pretending to be better than their neighbors. Religion, however, tends to cure this falſe ſhame, for when a deep concern about the ſalvation of the ſoul ariſes, a man is carried above all thoſe little feelings which ſo often interfere with his duty, and being obliged to turn over a new leaf in many great points, he takes the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of rectifying a thouſand ſmaller inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which many men of the world, though accounted moral, never think of doing, becauſe they have no motive ſtrong enough to put them upon any kind of change.</p>

                  <p>How have you behaved through the laſt year in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to relative duties? It may not be amiſs, at this time of the year, to recollect the names of our rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and connections, one by one, and then to aſk our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves, who is there of theſe whom I have either hurt by my miſconduct, or neglected, through idleneſs or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>ive in any of thoſe vices of which the Scripture ſays, that <hi>they which do such things, shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</hi> Again, have you been combating with all your evil tempers in the laſt year, and what has been your ſucceſs in the conflict? Every man has ſome particular infirmity. Some are apt to be ſtubborn and ſelf-willed, others weak and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—Some are bold and forward, others too fearful and aſhamed. Some are ſleepy and inactive, others are too buſy and prone to meddle even in what does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them. Some are too ſilent, and others as much too talkative. Some have affections that are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally betraying them into inconveniences if not dangers, and ſome have an ungracious and diſagreeable harſhneſs with which they ought to contend. Some alſo have much natural pride, or a ſtrong turn to vanity. Now if you are uſed to ſearch out your faults, you will have long ſince known in ſome meaſure, which of theſe may be yours, and you will be glad to be reminded at the year's end that you ought to enquire how far you have gained ground on that ſin which has moſt eaſily beſet you.</p>
                  <p>We will only mention further, have you been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the hand of Providence in all the events that have come acroſs you in the laſt year? Have you referred your ſickneſs or your health, you loſſes in trade or your ſucceſſes, as well as all the deaths in your family, and among your friends, together with every other inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the year, to a Divine Providence, which has ordered all things that have befallen you.

                  <p>And laſtly, while you are now recollecting all the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes and deliverances you have experienced, as well as the affecting deaths and changes which you have perhaps witneſſed during the laſt twelvemonth in your family, are you led thereby to meditate on the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of your own future life, and on the coming of that awful day, when <hi>we must all appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ, to give an account of the things done in the body,</hi> and when both you and <hi>all that are in their graves shall come forth, they that have done good to the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil to the resurrection of damnation.</hi>

                  <p>To this ſubject of ſelf-examination, which is now cloſed, one important remark ſhall be added. Perhaps ſome reader will have been ready to reply to ſome of the ſtrict queſtions which have been put to him, "Why at this rate who can be ſaved? If all this be neceſſary for ſalvation, I muſt deſpair and give up the point."—We would requeſt every ſuch deſponding reader to turn this tract to the following uſe: let him avail him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of it in the firſt place in order to alarm his fears, and to do away that falſe notion of innocence, which men who never examine themſelves are apt to truſt to as the ground of their ſalvation, and when what he has read has thus convinced him of his exceeding guilt, let it then ſend his thoughts to that Saviour of the world <hi>whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A heart warmed with gratitude to Chriſt will ſtand in place of a thouſand arguments; it will make that labor more pleaſant which otherwiſe ſeems intolerable: and it will cauſe all thoſe duties, which we ſeemed to deſcribe with ſo much ſtrictneſs, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear now no more than a juſt and reaſonable ſervice.</p>

                  <head>A <hi>TRUE EXAMPLE</hi> OF THE INTERPOSITION OF PROVIDENCE, IN THE DISCOVERY AND PUNISHMENT OF MURDER.</head>
                  <byline>By that famous Magiſtrate, Mr. Juſtice Fielding.</byline>
                  <p>IN Lieceſterſhire, not far from Lutterworth, lived a Miller, who having a grudge againſt a man, had murdered him in his Mill, and privately buried him in his Garden. Not long after he had committed this horrible crime, the Miller found means to change his place of abode, and ſettled in another country, a great way off. Here he lived a long time, believing that his villainy would never be diſcovered; but this hardened
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:035296_0191_1001C127B96D5AE0"/>wretch did not reflect, that though no fellow-creature ſaw him, God did, and that though God is patient and long-ſuffering, he ſeldom fails to bring wicked actions to light in this world, and never fails to puniſh them in the next. Twenty years had now paſſed over his head in ſafety, and he thought he might, without any danger, venture to return to viſit ſome old friends in the village where he had formerly lived. All is now ſafe, thought he, and it is impoſſible the old ſtory ſhould be ever brought to light.</p>
                  <p>Juſt at the very time while he was on this viſit in his native village, by the Providence of God, the Miller who had preſent poſſeſſion of the Mill, having occaſion to dig uncommonly deep in his Garden found the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or rather the bones of the murdered man. The neighbors then recollected that about twenty years ago, a man had been miſſing in the Pariſh, and was never heard of after. Some likewiſe recollected who was then owner of the mill, and that very miller being now in the pariſh, they all ran to the houſe where he was, and ſurrounding it, call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> on him as the murderer of the perſon whoſe bones had been thus providentially diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. The wretched miller was ſo ſhocked and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with the ſudden and general accuſation: and conſcience, which had ſlept for twenty years, was now ſo horribly ſtung, that he ſoon confeſſed the fact, was tried, found guilty, and executed according to his juſt deſerts.</p>
                  <div type="observations">
                     <head>The following observations of this wise and famous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, being unhappily, just as well suited to the present time, as the time when that great man wrote them, I hope they may be useful to my readers.</head>
                     <p>That the moſt dreadful crime of murder, hath of late years increaſed in a very deplorable degree in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is a fact which every man muſt confeſs, and which every good man muſt very bitterly lament. Till this age, indeed, cruel and qloody actions were ſo
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:035296_0192_1001A37D9D1F6608"/>ſeldom heard of in England, that when they happened they appeared as prodigies, and raiſed not only the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhment, but the abhorrence of the people. Murder is but very lately begun to be common among us.</p>
                     <p>For my part, I ſincerely declare I can diſcover no more than one cauſe of the horrid evil of which I am complaining—One indeed, perfectly capable of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing every miſchief, and which hath more than all other cauſes, contributed to produce, and to increaſe all the evils with which the public is at preſent extremely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</p>
                     <p>My ſenſible reader will preſently gueſs what I mean. I mean that general neglect, I fear I may ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Religion, which hath within theſe few years, ſo fatally overſpread this whole kingdom, till it has reached the very loweſt ranks of men? It cannot be otherwiſe, for when we think of the ſolemn threatnings of Almighty God againſt the crime of Murder, how is it poſſible to think that a creature, who believes that there is a God, ſhould, unleſs he be a fool or a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, thus audaciouſly fly in the face of that awful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in whoſe words we muſt be aſſured is all truth, and in whoſe right hand is all power.</p>

                  <p>We ſhall proceed, without further preface, to ſpeak of a few of thoſe tempers and diſpoſitions which moſt remarkably diſtinguiſhed our bleſſed Lord, and they ſhall be the following.</p>
                  <p>Firſt. He was remarkable for his <hi>condeſcenſion and humility,</hi> and for his indifference to worloly praiſe.—He ſought not honor from men: he never aimed at earthly diſtinction or ſuperiority, but ſubmitted willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be conſidered as one of the meaneſt of the people.
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:035296_0194_1001C3059BA00580"/>No lofty high minded thoughts, no aſpiring deſires were harbored in his breaſt. He made himſelf <hi>of no reputation</hi> and appeared as the ſervant of all. It was moſt wonderful condeſcenſion in Chriſt, who is ſpoken of in Scripture as <hi>coming down from Heaven,</hi> and as having partaken in <hi>the glory of the Father before the world was,</hi> even to viſit this world at all. It was ſtill greater condeſcenſion to viſit us in the character of a man like ourſelves, but the condeſcenſion is increaſed to a ſtill more aſtoniſhing pitch, by appearing among us even as the pooreſt and moſt deſpiſed of mankind. He was deſtitute of ſuch common conveniencies as even the loweſt have. <hi>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have neſts, but the Son of Man had not where to lay his head.</hi> We find him condeſcending to waſh his diſciples' feet, and alſo warning them not to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves as true believers in him if they <hi>ſought honor one of another:</hi> at another time we find him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing them to be <hi>poor in ſpirit,</hi> and at another <hi>not to chuſe the higheſt place,</hi> but willingly and contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take the loweſt till they ſhould be called up high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, aſſuring them that it was a maxim in his kingdom, <hi>that every one that exalteth himſelf ſhall be abaſed, but he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly. Our Saviour was alſo endued with the greateſt <hi>meekneſs and patience.</hi> No haſtineſs of ſpirit; no raſh anger or reſentment was found in him. His ſoul was meek and gentle as a lamb: all the trials, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, and injuries which he met with were ſubmitted to by him patiently, without the leaſt murmuring or repining. <hi>He gave his back to the ſmiters, and his cheeks to them that plucked off the hair. He hid not his face from ſhame and ſpitting. He was oppreſſed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth. He was brought as a lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a ſheep before his ſhearers is dumb, ſo he opened not his mouth.</hi> St. Peter tells us, that <hi>when he was reviled, he reviled
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:035296_0195_1001C1351A1110B0"/>not again, when he ſuffered he threatened not, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly,</hi> and his own admonition to his followers is, <hi>take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye ſhall find reſt for your ſouls.</hi> When his enemies treated him with the greateſt unkindneſs and cruelty, he returned them good for evil, and ſought to promote their happineſs and ſalvation. So far was his mind from harboring any malice or revenge, that he prayed even for his murderers, and recommended them to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mercy, ſaying. <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly. The mind of Chriſt was alſo filled with the tendereſt <hi>compaſſion and love.</hi> This was manifeſted throughout his whole conduct, by the kind attention he ſhewed both to the bodies and ſouls of men. <hi>He went about doing good,</hi> relieving the helpleſs, healing the diſeaſed, and comforting the afflicted. He alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the ignorant, and <hi>gave light to them that ſat in darkneſs and in the ſhadow of death.</hi> The poor guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſinner found him a friend indeed. We never read of any ſinner turning from his ſins, and calling upon Chriſt, without receiving an anſwer of peace, ſo that our Saviour ſhewed by his conduct that he came, as he himſelf expreſſes it, <hi>to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt.</hi> He is repreſented in Scripture as one who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways laboring to promote the Salvation of thoſe around him; and when men would not hearken to his words, but determined ſtill to go on in their ſins, his ſoul piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and he was <hi>grieved for their hardneſs of heart</hi> How fully does his pathetic lamentation over devoted Jeruſalem ſpeak the compaſſionate affection of his mind! <hi>O Jeruſalem! Jeruſalem! thou that killeſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſtoneſt them that are ſent unto thee; how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wing, and ye would not.</hi>

But his love was ſhewn moſt eminently in his laying down his life for us: as he ſpeaks, <hi>greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</hi> This great inſtance of love he ſhewed, yet this was not all: He laid down his life for his <hi>enemies.</hi> St. Paul ſays, <hi>when we were yet without ſtrength</hi> (or when we had fallen, ſo as to be utterly helpleſs and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined) <hi>in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly. For ſcarcely for a righteous man would one die, yet perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture for a good man ſome would even dare to die.—But God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us.</hi> Herein is love beyond example. We read of ſome who have been induced to die for their country or their friends, but where have we heard or read of any one, except Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who has willingly died for his enemies; for thoſe who offended and cruelly injured him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly. Chriſt was remarkable for the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>obedience and reſignation to the will of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I came down from heaven,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>not to domine own will, but the will of him that ſent me. And I muſt work the work of him that ſent me while it is day, the night cometh when no man can work.</hi> At twelve years old we find him diligently employed in purſuing the great object for which God ſent him into the world, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning with and queſtioning the Jewiſh Doctors in the Temple. When his mother enquired of him concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reaſon of his conduct, his anſwer was, <hi>Wiſt ye not thut I muſt be about my Father's buſineſs.</hi> He was more intent on obeying God than on receiving his dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly food. <hi>I have meat to eat,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>which the world knows not of,</hi> and immediately after he adds, <hi>my meat is to do the will of God, and to finiſh the work which he hath given me to do.</hi> And as he was active in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, ſo was he always patient in ſuffering what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God required. All the ſevere trials and afflictions which Chriſt endured, were endured without reluctance
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:035296_0197_1001C138790F3D20"/>or repining, becauſe he knew that they came upon him by Divine appointment. Even when his laſt bitter ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings drew near, and his human nature ſhuddered at the proſpect of them, hear with what obedient reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he prayed: <hi>Now is my ſoul troubled, and what ſhall I ſay, Father, ſave me from this hour; but for this cauſe came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name. Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me; nevertheleſs, not my will but thine be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If there were room to enlarge on this ſubject, we might proceed to ſpeak of our Saviour's ſpotleſs puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of his unſhaken faith and truſt in God, of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble courage in the cauſe of truth, and alſo of his ardent devotion, as well as many other ſhining excellencies in his character; but it is the leſs neceſſary, becauſe they are partly implied in the tempers already treated of.</p>
                  <p>And now let me put a very ſimple queſtion to the reader. Who are they that are the true diſciples of this Jeſus Chriſt? The anſwer is eaſy. The true diſciples are thoſe undoubtedly who moſt nearly reſemble that character of Chriſt which has been ſpoken of. Thoſe are not the true Chriſtians who merely call themſelves ſuch. Again, thoſe are not the true Chriſtians, who, though they believe and affirm the Bible to be true, yet never read it, and know nothing of what is contained in it. Again, thoſe are not the true Chriſtians, who, though they may read the Bible, and though they can prove by argument that it is no impoſture, are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs no better for all this knowledge. Again, they are not the true Chriſtians who have had Chriſtian bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, who attend at Chriſtian worſhip, and receive ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery month the Chriſtian Sacrament, and who are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox even in their Creed, and can ſee the errors into which other men fall on theſe ſubjects; for a man may ſtill want the main thing which Chriſtianity conſiſts in, I mean he may want a reſemblance to Chriſt in his turn of character, and temper, and ſpirit. But in order to
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:035296_0198_1001C13A33EAB1F8"/>bring this whole ſubject more diſtinctly home to the reader, let us again briefly touch on the ſeveral tempers that were ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, then your Saviour was remarkable for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, humility, and indifference to worldly praiſe. Are you diſtinguiſhed by the ſame diſpoſitions?—Are you willing to drop down from your rank in life, as Chriſt did from his celeſtial dignity? Are you content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo with a low eſtate as he was? And is your heart deadened like his to the deſire of worldly praiſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation? Is this, I ſay, your character? Or, on the contrary, are you one of thoſe Chriſtians who make a point of not ſtooping to any employment that is judged beneath them, and who are continually aiming at high acquaintance, whoſe great anxiety is alſo to fare plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in this world, and who, in ſhort, are in full chace of wealth, as well as reputation, honor, and preferment? This is one teſt by which you are to judge whether you are a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. We ſpoke of the meekneſs and patience of Chriſt. When he was <hi>reviled, he reviled not again.</hi> His ſoul, as we obſerved, was meek and gentle as a lamb. Is this alſo your character? Has your natural temper, if it is haſty, been brought under, ſo that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts and injuries do not much ruffle you? Are you not made violent in your ſpirit by the violence of thoſe who are oppoſed to you? How do you feel, for inſtance, towards men of an oppoſite nation, or of a contrary party to you in politics, or of another ſect in religion? Chriſt died for his enemies; how do you feel towards all your enemies? Do you bear the evils of life alſo as Chriſt did, without murmuring and complaining, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting cheerfully to a hard and humble lot, if it be the will of your heavenly Father?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. Chriſt was full of tender compaſſion, and love, both to the bodies and ſouls of men. How ſtands the likeneſs in theſe particulars? For inſtance, what
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:035296_0199_1001C13EF2D95580"/>part of your time and money do you give to the relief of men's bodily diſtreſſes? Is your character that of a father to the fatherleſs, a viſitor of the ſick, a benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to the poor, and a comforter of the afflicted? Do you like your Saviour, <hi>go about doing good?</hi> How do you act alſo to thoſe who are of bad character in the world, and who have treſpaſſed, as ſome judge, paſt all forgiveneſs? Does your benevolence embrace even theſe outcaſts alſo? It was one of the reproaches caſt on Chriſt by the Phariſees, that he ſtooped too low in this reſpect, and that he ſeemed to take the part of wicked and undeſerving people. <hi>Behold!</hi> ſaid they, <hi>a friend to publicans and ſinners,</hi> and again, <hi>this woman is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> Are you in like manner a friend to the moſt dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creditable kind of ſinners? Is the idea of their unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs no argument with you for declining an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of doing them good? Do you take their part and not deſpair of them, notwithſtanding the ſneers of ſome unchriſtian people? Or, on the contrary, does the dread of ſuffering in your own reputation continually check you in the juſt exerciſe of your beneficence?</p>
                  <p>But the love of Chriſt had reſpect chiefly to the ſouls of men. Are you chiefly concerned about their ſouls al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo? Do you do what in you lieth to promote men's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal intereſts? Do you labor to enlighten, to inſtruct, to invite, and to warn men with all earneſtneſs, as Chriſt did? and do you weep over the cauſe of impenitent ſinners, as your Saviour wept over Jeruſalem? Or, on the contrary, are you one of thoſe who make light of men's ſpiritual intereſts, who ſeem almoſt to forget that their fellow-creatures have immortal ſouls, and who at the utmoſt can only be prevailed on to ſhew a little hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity to their bodies?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly. Chriſt was remarkable for his obedience and reſignation to the will of God. He evidently liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only for the purpoſe of doing the will of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father. Is this the propoſed end of your living?
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:035296_0200_1001A3E0CF57B818"/>Do you conſider all your employments in this life as the fulfilling of a work which God hath given you to do, and do you labor to know his will in order to your thus fulfilling it? Or, on the contrary, are you one of thoſe who never think of God's will, but go their own way and ſay, they have a right to pleaſe themſelves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they commit no great crime againſt their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor. And again, when croſſes or troubles come upon you, do you bear them with reſignation, conſidering them to be ſent by God, or are you impatient until they are removed, reverſing on ſuch occaſions the language of your Saviour and ſaying, "not thy will, O Lord! but mine be done."</p>
                  <p>On the ſubject of our Saviour's holineſs and purity, his unſhaken faith and truſt in God, his boldneſs in the cauſe of truth, and his ardent devotion, as well as his other excellencies, we will not attempt to enter here.—Let it be remembered, however, that it is the part of a true Chriſtian to trace out the whole character of his Saviour and to imitate him in every one of thoſe points in which the Scriptures ſet him forth as an example.</p>
                  <p>And now let us make an appeal in a few words to two or three different deſcriptions of people. And firſt to the downright Infidel. You are one who diſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, but are you one that has duly weighed and conſidered his character? What is the fault you find in it? When the unbelieving Jews once took up ſtones to caſt at J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſus, he anſwered them by ſaying, <hi>Many good works have I ſhewed you from my Father, and for which of theſe good works do you ſtone me?</hi> And ſo it may be ſaid to you now. Many excellencies in Chriſt's character have been ſet before you, and for which of theſe is it that you diſbelieve in him? Surely you cannot deny that there is ſomething very excellent and unimpeachable, ſomething very pure and holy, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing alſo very original, ſomething in ſhort that looks very like divine in the character that has been ſpoken of, nor
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:035296_0201_1001C141671664B8"/>can there be any do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>t of the tendency of the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which have been deſcribed to promote the peace and happineſs of mankind. When therefore one man ſcoffs, when another gravely diſbelieves, when a third doubts about Chriſtianity; when difficulties riſe up in the minds of ſome, and when profane and blaſpheming books are ſpread abroad to overthrow the faith of others, to all this hoſt of unbelievers we beg leave in this place ſimply to reply, by oppoſing to them the character of Jeſus Chriſt, a character which thoſe who are the moſt violent in running down Chriſtianity, will be found I believe in general, to take very little trouble in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering.</p>
                  <p>When thoſe unbelieving Jews of old who were ſo bent on crucifying Chriſt were aſked, <hi>Why what evil hath he done?</hi> the grand difficulty was, to get ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>et him be crucified;</hi> but when Pilate, though diſpoſed to ſide with the Jews, was obliged by his office to examine and croſs-examine this Jeſus, <hi>Verily,</hi> ſaid Pilate, <hi>I find no fault in him.</hi> Our preſent difficulty is much the ſame; for if we could but perſuade our modern infidels and blaſphemers to beſtow for once a little time in examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, point by point, the character of this Jeſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth as Pilate did, methinks they would be glad to waſh their hands alſo, like Pilate, of the blame of being his more forward enemies: they would turn over at leaſt the heavier part of the guilt to the rabble of more uninformed perſons ſaying, like Pilate after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination, <hi>Take ye him, and crucify him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let us next addreſs the merely nominal and falſe Chriſtians. Now theſe are the perſons who, though ſome of them lament perhaps the preſent growth of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, have been the principal cauſes of it. Not a few
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:035296_0202_1001C14927707368"/>of theſe Chriſtians ſo called are, it is to be feared, men even of immoral character, and theſe muſt be named a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the beſt friends of infidelity, for the corrupt life of one who calls himſelf a Chriſtian, is certainly the greateſt of all encouragements to the unbeliev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rs. But let us not confine our obſervations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> immoral Chriſtians only. You are certainly a promoter of infidelity if you do but fail of having that peculiar temper and turn of mind which has been deſcribed. I will ſuppoſe now that you are a decent moral perſon—but muſt we not own that ſo alſo are many of the infidels—honorable—ſo are the infidels—humane, perhaps handſome in your conduct, and very reſpectable—but ſo alſo are many of the infidels. If this then be all, you have nothing in your character but what is common both to you and them, and an infidel at this rate is juſt as good as a Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian; and if as good he muſt be as ſafe alſo—ſurely then there is no need of Chriſtianity: and if there is no need of it there ariſes a ſtrong ſuſpicion alſo that there is no truth in it; for to ſuppoſe Chriſtianity to be true, and ſent of God, as it profeſſes to be, while nevertheleſs there is no need of it, and while the followers of it are no better than the unbelievers, is to ſuppoſe that God acts fooliſhly and in vain, which ſuppoſition is itſelf a kind of infidelity, and is an approach even to Atheiſm. It follows, therefore, that in order to defend the truth of Chriſtianity, it is neceſſary to exclude out of the pale of the true Chriſtian Church every ſuch merely decent Chriſtian as I have been ſpeaking of, ſaying to him (as all ſerious Chriſtians indeed are uſed to do) that you have no ſhare in the privileges of the Goſpel any more than the unbelievers, and if <hi>he that believeth not ſhall be condemned,</hi> then you, it is to be ſeared, are involved in the ſame condemnation.</p>
                  <p>We cannot help obſerving that Chriſtians of this merely decent claſs, eſpecially if poſſeſſed of a little or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy alſo, are not ſeldom the perſons who cry out
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:035296_0203_1001C14E94E9AB10"/>moſt violently againſt infidelity, and who perhaps come forward in defence of the national faith, as if theſe were the beſt champions by whom the truths of Chriſt can be defended; whereas I think I have ſhewn, that they are ſome of the very perſons who have betrayed the cauſe, and have ſurrendered up the ark of our moſt holy faith into the hands of the modern Philiſtines.</p>
                  <p>Let us next addreſs another claſs of perſons, I mean thoſe who are very remarkable for their attachment to certain Chriſtian doctrines, and are very zealous for what they call the Goſpel. Some of theſe perhaps carry their zeal for doctrines ſo far, that they feel but little intereſt in any thing that can be ſaid concerning the example of Chriſt, and are ready to turn away from what they call ſo merely moral a leſſon. They deſire to hear of nothing elſe than the <hi>blood and righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> and his atonement, and grace, and interceſſion. But has not the ſame Scripture which ſpeaks on theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſaid alſo, <hi>Let the ſame mind be in you which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus, and that Chriſt hath ſet us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that we ſhould tread in his ſteps:</hi> and again, <hi>that he that ſaith he abideth in Him ought himſelf ſo to walk even as He walked:</hi> and again, <hi>that if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> (which certainly muſt include the temper or Chriſt) <hi>he is none of His.</hi> A plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural declaration of the character of Chriſt, and an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to thoſe texts which aſſert the neceſſity of being like Him in our own character and conduct, may be of admirable uſe in pulling down the vain confidence of the enthuſiaſt, in rectifying many errors of the bigot, in expoſing the ſinful paſſions of ſome who pretend that they are magnifying Chriſt, in proving in ſhort the faith of all, and in calming many political as well as religious controverſies of the Chriſtian Church.</p>
                  <p>But once more. There are ſome who think indeed that they copy after Chriſt, and that they copy him the more becauſe they make light of doctrines and beſtow
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:035296_0204_1001C152C2EB3910"/>their whole attention upon practice. But what is their practice? Are they cloſe and real imitators of all theſe holy tempers of Jeſus? I fear thoſe who neglect or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the doctrinal parts of Scripture in order to ſuit their own creed, are prone equally to forget or lower what is practical in Scripture in order to ſuit their own prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: many take, for inſtance, only a part of Chriſt's example inſtead of the whole of it, and even what they take they lower and deprive of all the ſpirit that is in it before they can agree to it: thus they may poſſibly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itate Chriſt's benevolence to the bodies of men, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this is done only in ſome ſmall degree, for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to <hi>go about doing good,</hi> as Chriſt did, making their benevolence their buſineſs, and quitting their home, like him, in ſearch of wretched people; and as to Chriſt's benevolence to the <hi>ſouls</hi> of men, they hardly think of it, and are altogether oppoſite to him in that particular: thus many alſo may conſider a certain degree of reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Providence in a time of calamity to be a branch of Chriſtian duty, and may fancy they follow Chriſt's example in this reſpect, while in fact perhaps they are much more influenced by an idea of it's being neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſubmit to their fate; and as to that other temper of Chriſt which we coupled with willingneſs to ſuffer. I mean a willingneſs alſo to <hi>do</hi> the whole will of our Heavenly Father. Here they moſt l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mentably fail: for do they look upon the doing of God's will, as Chriſt did, to be more neceſſary, as it were, than their daily meat, and do they count their time, their money, and their labor, loſt except as it is devoted to God's ſervice, and employed for His glory? In truth, the whole example of Chriſt, when rightly underſtood, can neither be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itated nor approved by the common kind of worldly men; and indeed we all ſeem naturally to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ll into diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions the moſt contrary to thoſe which characteriſed our Saviour; for are men <hi>naturally</hi> humble, and lowly, and indifferent, as he was to wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <hi>naturally</hi> prone to forgive injuries, and to love even their enemies, ſhewing their chief compaſſion alſo to the ſouls of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oſe whom they love? Are men <hi>naturally</hi> diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to renounce their own will, and to look only to the will of God? And are men <hi>naturally</hi> ſumiſſive, and reſigned, and devoted altogether, to the Lord's ſervice? The corruption of our nature then is one of the leſſons which we learn by thus appealing to the example of Chriſt as the Touchſtone of real goodneſs, and when through the knowledge of this corruption we are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled under the ſenſe of guilt, and are become anxious to find mercy, then, and not till then, we turn to our Saviour's croſs, and begin heartily to plead <hi>the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of that Son of God who <hi>bare our ſins in His own body on the tree,</hi> having <hi>given His own life to be a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The diſtance at which we find ourſelves from the Great Standard of perfection, and the difficulty which we ſoon begin to feel when we endeavor to copy after it, cannot fail to teach us another leſſon in Chriſtianity of the firſt importance: we are now taught, I mean, to <hi>bow our knees</hi> before the God of all grace, imploring him <hi>to help our infirmities,</hi> and to pour down upon us a portion of that Spirit which was <hi>given without meaſure</hi> unto Chriſt; and thus do the ſeveral parts of Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity reflect mutual light on each other. He then is the true Chriſtian who, believing the doctrines of Chriſt, is alſo animated thereby to follow all the precepts of his Maſter, who heartily approves and zealouſly copies after the bright example that is ſet before him, and who, by the help of Divine Grace, attains in his humble mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſome true reſemblance of his Saviour.</p>

Although there is ſaid to have been <hi>a Church,</hi> that is, a collection of worſhipping Chriſtians, in Philemon's houſe, yet Oneſimus ſeems to have been not at all the better for it. He received no doubt the inſtructions, he attended regularly at the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily prayers, he alſo beheld daily the bright example of Philemon, and yet his heart continued to be hardened.

In the mean time, temptations of various kinds would probably come upon him, and thus he would advance from bad to worſe, for one ſin common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leads on to another, and at length his heart being dreadfully hardened, he would be ready for almoſt any wickedneſs. It ſeems by St. Paul's account, that he became an unfaithful ſervant, and actually robbed his maſter, and that he then ran away (perhaps then taking his booty with him) to the great city of Rome, where it would be eaſy for Oneſimus to conceal himſelf, juſt as it is eaſy for a man who has played the villain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where at a diſtance in this country, to lie hid in London now.</p>
                  <p>If the preſent ſtory were to ſtop here, where then, it might be ſaid is the uſe of having all theſe family prayers and this <hi>Church in the houſe?</hi> Why the very ſervants you inſtruct will ſtill cheat you juſt as much as if they were not inſtructed, and it is as well therefore to leave them to go their own way, without trying to make them religious. I will not ſtop to reply to this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation here, becauſe, as we go on with the ſtory, the anſwer will be plain enough.</p>
                  <p>What I have next to remark of Oneſimus, is, that when he got to Rome, he went to hear the Apoſtle preach. We are not told the reaſon of his firſt attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Apoſtle. It is not improbable, however, that ſome qualm of conſcience might put him upon this viſit. Methinks I ſee him for a few days o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> weeks rioting in vice, ſpending freely the handful of plunder which he had carried off, and as his pocket grows low, becoming low in ſpirits alſo. At length his laſt ſhilling is gone. Alas! he has no Chriſtian maſter to ſupport him, no friend to pity him—and now having firſt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:035296_0208_1001A395698C1FA8"/>poſſibly whether to plunge into ſome new crime in order to relieve his growing diſtreſſes, he bethinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of what he had once ſo careleſsly hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's houſe, and ſays within his heart "well, there can be no comfort, no hope, no chance of deliverance for me now, but from the Goſpel." I think it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s alſo poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that he might have occaſionally overheard the name of Paul mentioned while he was waiting at Philemon's table, and when pricked in his conſcience at Rome.— Paul therefore is the man to whom he would naturally fly for relief.</p>
                  <p>Let no maſter then deſpair of being an inſtrument of good to his ſervants, even though for a time he ſhould ſee no fruit of his labors. I am perſuaded there has been many a footman, or ſtable boy, or other ſervant, both male and female, who has continued thoughtleſs and profane during the whole time of reſidence in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious maſter's houſe, and who nevertheleſs has been ſtruck to the heart afterwards, and has profited materially in the end, by ſome hint which appeared to have no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect at the time of receiving it.</p>
                  <p>But we are next to ſpeak of a new ſcene which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents itſelf. Oneſimus is converted to Chriſtianity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Paul's miniſtry. The ſinner is convicted of his ſin. Through God's mercy the run-away is arreſted in his mad and-wicked courſe. The poor guilty wretch of courſe cofneſſes to Paul his guilt, and through the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite grace of God in Chriſt he obtains pardon, and the hope of eternal life.</p>
                  <p>Here then is a ſtriking proof of the proviſion of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which there is in the Goſpel. A run-away ſlave and a thief may become a partaker of it: God can grant even to the vileſt and moſt miſerable ſinner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto life; and it is proper therefore, that all ſhould pray to God for a heart to repent, and that no one ſhould deſpair.</p>
                  <p>It is plain from many ſigns that the repentance of
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:035296_0209_1001C166DD175F58"/>Oneſimus was ſincere. In the firſt place I think we may take Paul's word that it was ſo, for Paul would not have ſpoken ſo decidedly as he did, if he had not firſt enquired into the caſe. No; I will warrant you Paul examined Oneſimus very cloſely, for Paul's charity did not conſiſt in believing in a good-natured way that ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery one was a Chriſtian who ſaid that he was ſo; on the contrary, Paul's charity led him to be careful and jealous leſt he ſhould comfort his flock with a falſe hope, or ſhould flatter the perſon of any one. It made him therefore exceedingly particular in examining the ſtate of men's ſouls: and hence it comes to paſs that the words of Paul have ſo much weight whenever he pronounces any one to be a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>But the ſincerity of Oneſimus's repentance is ſtill further proved by a circumſtance which is diſtinctly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; I mean by his readineſs to take Paul's advice when he bids him to go back again to his injured maſter. Now a falſe penitent would differ from Oneſimus in this particular. A falſe penitent would make a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand objections to ſuch a meaſure. "What," he would ſay "muſt I go back to my maſter whom I have wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? I dare not ſhew my face before him, nor before my fellow-ſervants. I ſhall ſink into the earth when I ſee them. Beſides, where is the neceſſity for returning? I am willing to repent indeed, but may I not repent at Rome? Surely I may be allowed to remain here in my preſent obſcurity, for the diſgrace of ſeeing my maſter and all my old friends again is more than I can bear, but I will bear any thing elſe; I will live hard and work honeſtly, and I will be very ſorry for my ſin, and I will continue to attend Paul's preaching. Surely this will ſuffice." "But go back again in the firſt place to your maſter," ſays Paul. "Go and own to him what you have done; away with all this pride and evil ſhame which is about you. Submit to the diſgrace you have brought on yourſelf, and try to repair the evil you have
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:035296_0210_1001C16D5FD94E18"/>done as well as you can, by working hard for Philemon in the time to come: endeavor to earn <hi>for</hi> him as much money as you have ſtolen <hi>from</hi> him, and be not afraid of Philemon's wrath, for I will give you a letter to him. This is the proof I require of your ſincerity."</p>
                  <p>How wiſe and judicious was this advice of Paul to Oneſimus! <hi>Whom,</hi> ſays he in the letter <hi>I have ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi> that is, whom I have ſent back again in order that he may confeſs his whole fault to you, and return into your ſervice. The confeſſion of the ſin againſt Philemon was better in this caſe than any general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith, or than any plauſible tale of Oneſimus's converſion; and ſo it may be obſerved in other caſes, that a readineſs to go back at all hazards, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our crime to the perſon we have offended, and to repair it as well as we are able, is the firſt proof of ſincerity that ſhould be required; whereas an unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to return implies much remaining pride of heart, a very ſinful ſort of ſhame, a diſregard to ſtrict honeſty, and a fear of conſequences that is inconſiſtent with that faith and truſt in God which accompany true repentance.</p>
                  <p>Oneſimus, as I have ſaid, conſented to return; and let us not ſuppoſe that he is now to be pitied on that account, or that any great miſeries were in conſequence about to fall upon his head. No, let us congratulate him rather on his right reſolution, for I will warrant you, that after the firſt affecting ſcene was over, he would be much the happier for it, and let us remember alſo, that we are to conſider him now as a Chriſtian, who has got among Chriſtian people, and that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts bearing in his hand that letter of St. Paul to Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emon, which I have ſpoken of, and which forms one of the ſhort Books or Epiſtles of the New Teſtament.— How kind, how affectionate, how condeſcending does every part of this Epiſtle appear, when carefully exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned! It is a ſpecimen of the Chriſtian ſpirit, and we
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:035296_0211_1001C172698F6780"/>ſhall therefore now turn from Oneſimus's character to the contemplation of that of Paul, which we have here a fine opportunity of conſidering.</p>
                  <p>Paul was now grown extremely old, and he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered much in the cauſe of the Goſpel. He was at this very time a priſoner, and it was while in priſon and in bonds that he had preached ſo effectually to Oneſimus. It is likewiſe remarkable that not only Oneſimus the ſlave, but that Philemon the maſter alſo, to whom the letter was addreſſed, had been converted through Paul's miniſtry. Thus, therefore, this venerable Saint was able to write with the authority that belonged to him both as an apoſtle, as an old man, and as Philemon's father in Chriſt, as the father in like manner of Oneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, and as a chief ſufferer, who was ſoon alſo to prove a noble martyr, in the cauſe of their common Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
                  <p>What then is the ground which he may be ſuppoſed to take in order to perſuade Philemon to ſpare the poor converted ſlave that is ſent back to him? The ground he takes is this: He forbears, he ſays, from that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his authority which ſuch a one as he might uſe; he hints, in a moſt affecting manner, how Philemon himſelf had owed the life of his very ſoul to the apoſtle, and he then entreats Philemon, for love's ſake, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the earneſt requeſt that is made to him, briefly intimating alſo the worldly profit which Philemon would derive from having now a Chriſtian ſervant inſtead of an unbelieving one. But let us quote the apoſtle's own words—<hi>wherefore,</hi> ſays he, <hi>though I might be bold in Chriſt to enjoin thee that which is convenient, yet, for love's ſake, I rather beſeech thee, being ſuch a one as Paul the aged, and now alſo a priſoner of Jeſus Chriſt; I beſeech thee for my ſon Oneſimus, whom I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in my bonds, which in times paſt was to thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, but is now profitable to thee and to me, whom I have ſent again, thou therefore receive him that is
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:035296_0212_1001C174E2A81200"/>mine own bowels.</hi> And then he adds, <hi>Thou therefore receive him not now as a ſervant, but above a ſervant, a brother beloved, eſpecially to me, but how much more unto thee both in the friſh and in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What an aſtoniſhing difference does Chriſtianity make in men! What a kind of ſpirit do we here trace! How ſtrange alſo muſt all this love and condeſcenſion ſeem to ſome people! A man of the world, whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant had robbed him and run away, would never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Chriſtianity could convert the man, and would diſdain to receive ſuch a kind of letter as I have deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. I am perſuaded alſo my readers will agree, that a worldly correſpondent, though naturally ever ſo hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, would be very far from writing ſuch a kind of letter as this; and certainly an unrepenting and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded flave would ill deſerve to have it written.— But how affectionately does Paul ſtill proceed—<hi>If,</hi> ſays Paul, <hi>thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myſelf. If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account. I Paul have written in with mine own hand, I will repay it. Albeit, I do not ſay to thee how thou oweſt to me thine own ſelf beſides.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now let it be remarked, what a happy influence had Chriſtianity on the whole condition of this poor wretched run-away. He was ſinking, no doubt, into the loweſt infamy as well as poverty and woe when he firſt waited on Paul: he was living, I dare ſay, among the dregs of the people at Rome; and if he had remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unconverted, if either he had not gone to Paul, or if having gone to him, he had again hardened his heart, and returned to his former wickedneſs, he would prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably have ended his days on the Crucifix or Gibbet, or at leaſt he would have ſoon periſhed through want, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and unregarded, for he would have been ſwept away among the thouſands whom the vice and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of every great city are continually ſending to an untimely grave: A guilty conſcience alſo would have
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:035296_0213_1001C17A25978CE8"/>haunted him in his laſt hours, and after death he muſt have ſtood before an offended God, and at laſt he muſt have had his portion in that place where <hi>there is weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and wailing, and gnaſhiug of teeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How happy then I ſay, how tranſporting was the change! The pride of his heart being firſt ſubdued through that bleſſed Goſpel which was made known to him, he returns to his maſter. This was a great ſtep. He returns to ſlavery indeed, but to a ſlavery no doubt that was extremely mild, and that ſcarcely deſerved the name; for he is immediately received even as a brother into the family from whence he had fled as a culprit, and the ſame epiſtle of Paul which introduced him to Philemon, would now recommend him, no doubt, to many members of the Church at Coluſſus, with whom he would become united in the bonds of Chriſtian love. Nay, if we believe the report of hiſtory, his good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct as a ſlave ſoon afterwards gained him his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and he even roſe, as ſome have ſuppoſed (though of this there may be a certain degree of doubt) to the ſituation of a Miniſter or Teacher of the infant Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Church.</p>
                  <p>But whatever his condition may have been during the remainder of his days on earth (and it is indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively of little moment) of this at leaſt we are ſure, that his everlaſting happineſs was ſecured, and that he is now numbered among the company or thoſe <hi>who have waſhed their garments, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb;</hi> whoſe offences in this life are pardoned through the merits of Chriſt, and who are <hi>ſtanding before the throne of God.</hi> There the great apoſtle Paul, and his excellent friend. Philemon, and there alſo the converted ſlave Oneſimus, unite with one voice in that triumphant ſong (God grant that each of us may one day join in it) <hi>unto him that hath loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood, and hath made us Kings and Prieſts unto God and the Father,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:035296_0214_1001C17F5661DFA8"/>unto him be Glory and Dominion for ever and ever.—Amen.</hi>

                     <head>An Application of the above Story to the caſe of thoſe unhappy Men and Women, who, like Oneſimus, have leſt their home and have got into a bad way of life.</head>
                     <p>THE ſtory which we have related, may be uſeful to perſons of every claſs, but there is a very particular application of it which may be made to thoſe who, in ſome meaſure, reſemble the run-away and unconverted Oneſimus.</p>
                     <p>I mean now, therefore, to addreſs myſelf to thoſe who, through ſome falſe ſtep in life, and perhaps by adding one piece of miſconduct to another, have ſallen into any very diſtreſsful and diſgraceful circumſtances. I addreſs myſelf more eſpecially to thoſe unhappy wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who, like Oneſimus, have run away from their proper home, where once perhaps they may have heard ſomething of the Goſpel, though they did not attend to it, and who are now ruined in their character, who are alſo plunged by their growing neceſſities into a life of open and allowed ſin, and are periſhing both as to body and ſoul, either in our great towns, or among the dregs of the people of our metropolis.</p>
                     <p>I would entreat ſuch perſons to conſider a little the caſe of this poor Oneſimus, at the time he was plunged, as I have ſuppoſed him to have been, in the debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Rome, and when he muſt be viewed as a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away, and even a thief and a vagabond. Methinks he reſembled, in a few leading particulars, what ſome of you may be at preſent. Now it happened that Oneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus went one day to hear Paul preach. What if you were for once in your lives, to do the ſame? I mean, what if you were to go and hear the preaching of ſome faithful and zealous Miniſter of Chriſt, ſome follower of Paul the Apoſtle? I would adviſe you, if you think of doing it at all, to go on the very next Sabbath.—
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:035296_0215_1001C180F79EFBB0"/>Oneſimus, by hearing Paul preach, was delivered out of all his troubles, for he was effectually converted to Chriſtianity; and who knows whether if you purſue the ſame means, it may not pleaſe God to ſave you both body and ſoul, in the ſame manner, Indeed, I can hardly imagine any other way than that which One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus actually took, by which he could have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; and, depend upon it, if ever you eſcape, and are reſtored to peace, to happineſs, and to ſociety, it muſt be by the ſame mighty power of the Goſpel.— Would to God, that ſome unhappy creature, who reads this tale, and who has imitated Oneſimus in his wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings, might imitate him alſo in his repentance.— Would to God, that ſome loſt ſheep might thus be brought back into the ſold of Chriſt. Would to God, that ſome Prodigal Son, for inſtance, might be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, like the Prodigal in the Goſpel, to repent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his father's houſe; or that ſome woman, who is a ſinner, while ſhe is reading this tale, might find her eyes begin to ſtream with tears, like the Magdalen, who wept ſo plentifully at the feet of our Saviour, and might, like her, attain to a comfortable and well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hope, that <hi>her ſins, which are many,</hi> are forgiven her.</p>
                     <p>"But what can we do," methinks I hear a whole multitude of ſuch perſons reply, "We long to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to all the comforts you ſpeak of; we are charmed at the very mention of ſuch happineſs, but we know not how to get poſſeſſion of it." I anſwer, do then in all reſpects like Oneſimus. Take example as far as your caſe will allow, from all the various circumſtances which may be ſuppoſed to have belonged to his tale.— Firſt of all, he attended Paul's preaching, after which, I ſuppoſe, he called on the Apoſtle, and told him his ſtory. The Apoſtle, indeed, was a poor man himſelf, and a priſoner alſo; ſo that a little good advice (which, however, is a very valuable thing) was all that could
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:035296_0216_1001C18377EDC790"/>be got from him; except, indeed, that Paul being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a number of good Chriſtians, among whom there might be ſome rich ones alſo, he was able to give Oneſimus a letter of introduction, if he thought proper. The ſame thing, perhaps, may happen now. If you will call on ſome Miniſter of the Goſpel, after having for a while attended his preaching, provided he judges you to be truly penitent, he will be induced, perhaps, if poor himſelf, to give you a recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſome Chriſtian friend of his, to ſome capital houſe-keeper, like Philemon.</p>
                     <p>But, ſhall I tell you what will be his difficulty? A ſuſpicion will immediately ariſe about your ſincerity, and the removal of this ſuſpicion is the great thing which you muſt aim at. Oneſimus ſucceeded in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving this ſuſpicion from the mind of Paul; for if he had not, I am ſure Paul would never have written ſuch a letter as he did to Philemon.</p>
                     <p>Let me, then, cloſe with a little advice as to this point, I mean as to the manner in which you muſt give proof of your ſincerity.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, when you confeſs your faults to any one of whom you aſk help, do not confeſs them by halves. I have known ſome perſons acknowledge a ſew things which they have done wrong, and which, indeed, they could not hide, while they have been mightily reſerved upon other points. They have left out half their ſtory. They have thought, perhaps, to ſpare themſelves here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, but, in fact, it has commonly proved, that what was concealed was afterwards diſcovered, and they have been rejected, not at all on account of any unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to help them, though hitherto ever ſo wicked, but on account of its continuing ſtill to be impoſſible to put any truſt in them. Oneſimus, I warrant you, confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his whole ſin to Paul, and was not detected after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in any little reſervations, or excuſes, or falſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorings.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="123" facs="unknown:035296_0217_1001C1889D79F1B8"/>
Again, draw nearer and nearer to religion. Read the Scriptures. Avoid bad company. Attend diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the preaching of the Goſpel; and endeavor to make acquaintance with thoſe who attend alſo, and who, however poor, are religious. Oneſimus had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one among the little ſociety of the <hi>Saints which were at Rome,</hi> at the time when Paul wrote ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of his ſincerity.</p>
                     <p>Again, put away your pride and falſe ſhame; very forlorn and wicked people are often very proud, and this pride works in a thouſand ways, ſo as to hinder their deliverance. Oneſimus ſubmitted to go back to his old maſter, notwithſtanding all the ſhame that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his return; and you muſt ſhew ſomething of the ſame temper, if you expect any one who underſtands the human heart, ſo as all Chriſtians do, to put confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in your ſincerity.</p>
                     <p>Again, put your truſt in Crod. Dare to fulfil your preſent duty; and do not reaſon too much about conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. God has all events, and he has likewiſe all hearts in his hand; and he can and will make a way for your eſcape, as he did for that of Oneſimus, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelve fully to fear him, and put your truſt in him.</p>
                     <p>Again, determine on a life of induſtry; tor all idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in you muſt be diſhoneſty. Oneſimus went and worked even as a ſlave. I hope you have no objection to go and work any where as a ſervant, and to accept even the loweſt ſervice. I hope too, you deſire to be a very diligent and profitable ſervant. <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> as St. Paul obſerves, <hi>had been once unprofitable, but was now profitable.</hi> He became a moſt valuable hard-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man when he became a Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>But, above all things, take care to be what you wiſh to appear; take care, I mean, to be a moſt ſincere and true penitent. It is a ſmall matter to ſeem ſincere in the ſight of your fellow creatures, when you are not ſo in the ſight of God. The heart is deceitrul. Enter, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:035296_0218_1001C18A8C09F478"/>deeply into this matter. Conſider your own weakneſs in times paſt; fly from temptation; be often on your knees alſo confeſſing your ſins, and praying to God to ſtrengthen you by his Holy Spirit; pray to him in ſhort, <hi>to ſearch and to try you, to prove you, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your ways, to look well if there be any way of wickedneſs in you, and to lead you in the way everlaſting.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now, are you ſtill out of ſpirits and deſponding? Do you ſtill think there is no friend to pity you, no help near you, and that no Miniſter, if you ſhould go to him, will take notice of your caſe? I will add ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hint on this ſubject. When Oneſimus firſt went to Paul, I dare ſay be l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Shall I then explain to you what was the cauſe which made Paul condeſcend ſo readily to this poor, repenting ſinner. It was this.

But Paul had obtained mercy, and now it became the happineſs of his life to tell of the grace of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Unto me,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>who am leſs than the leaſt of all Saints, is this grace given that I ſhould preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A Great man uſed to ſay that he never ſaw a crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal dragged to execution without aſking himſelf, "Who knows whether this poor fellow may not, on the whole, be guilty of leſs ſin than I am?" This is a queſtion which it would be well if we would all of us put to ourſelves, when we ſee any of our fellow-creatures puniſhed; for I am perſuaded, that many of us have ſins, which all things conſidered, deſerve the rod juſt as much as the ſins of thoſe people who endure chaſtiſement for them. I am ſorry to add, that in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, we are ſo far from putting to ourſelves any ſuch queſtion as I have ſpoken of, that we do what is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly the contrary. We contrive to praiſe, inſtead of taking occaſion to blame ourſelves, when we ſee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in fault. We immediately ſay, "Well, I thank
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:035296_0220_1001C19203B85CB0"/>God, I never did any thing ſo bad as this. I never in my life did what Mr. Such-a-one has done. I am not ſo bad as he, however;" and then we fall foul on his whole character, and think to ſhew our goodneſs by the extreme ſeverity which we uſe in ſpeaking of him.</p>
                  <p>Never was this temper better expoſed, or the evil of it reproved, than in the caſe of which I am now going to ſpeak; I mean on the occaſion of the Scribes and Phariſees bringing before our Saviour the woman taken in adultery.</p>
                  <p>We read, that <hi>as Chriſt was teaching in the temple, they brought to him this woman, and ſet her in the midſt, ſaying to him, Maſter, this woman was taken in adultery.</hi> Now, ſince adultery is certainly a moſt dreadful ſin, we might at firſt view be ready to praiſe theſe men, and alſo to ſay, "<hi>What holy and good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt theſe be! wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They were men, no doubt, who had taken ſome pains to waſh the outſide clean, and they were in good repute with their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors; nevertheleſs, as this ſtory will ſhew, they were all the while very wicked in their hearts; they brought this woman before Chriſt, and placed her in the midſt, from a very wrong motive, for they did it not for the ſake of glorifying God, not for the ſake of puniſhing ſin in this inſtance, in order to prevent it in others; and not therefore through any love to God, or charity to their neighbor; but, on the contrary, they acted from ſome of the baſeſt diſpoſitions, for they felt no compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the woman, and they wanted only to lay a trap for Chriſt, in order that they might have matter of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation againſt him.</p>
                  <p>How common is it for people, now-a-days, in ſome reſpects, to imitate theſe Scribes and Phariſees! What curioſity have ſome men, in the firſt place, to diſcover,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:035296_0221_1001C198534482A8"/>and then to publiſh all the faults and infirmities of their neighbors! Some there are, who ſpend half their lives in liſtening to, and repeating all the ſcandal that is pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. When they hear of a man that has been overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by a ſin, or of a woman that has loſt her reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one would think that they had heard one of the beſt pieces of news that had ever reached their ears; for how does converſation run on, and the ſpirits riſe, and the wit abound, when the fall of a fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the topic of the company! The Scribes and Phariſees brought this woman forth, and ſet her in the midſt. Juſt ſo, methinks, would the perſons I am bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſet every offender whom they accuſe in the midſt of the company, if they were able, for they ſhew by their language that they delight to expoſe every one as much as poſſible. But why, I repeat it, is all this ill-nature? Are theſe accuſers ſpotleſs in their own lives? Are they better even than thoſe whom they accuſe? No; I believe it has often happened that the very man who has been moſt forward in condemning another, has been himſelf guilty of the ſame fault, and liable to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> very ſame condemnation. It is the moſt wicked part of the world that is commonly the moſt ſevere. Your harſh judges are often the very worſt of men.</p>
                  <p>The words uſed by the Scribes and Phariſees, when they brought this woman to Chriſt, were the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Said they, <hi>Moſes in the law commanded us, that ſuch ſhould be ſtoned, but what ſayeſt thou?</hi> The deſign evidently was to put a difficulty in the way of Chriſt, and, if poſſible, to ſet him and Moſes at variance; for if, on the one hand, Chriſt ſhould ſay that the woman ought to be releaſed, this would be contradicting Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Chriſt would then have been called a falſe Prophet; but if, on the other hand, Chriſt ſhould or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her to be ſtoned, this they might think would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh ſomething from the mercifulneſs of his character as a Savior, and would hurt his credit with the people;
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:035296_0222_1001C19E128EFA00"/>ſo that, in either caſe, the Scribes and Phariſees would be gratified. What a crafty queſtion, therefore, was this! Let us now ſee how very prudently our Saviour anſwered it.</p>
                  <p>At firſt, he appeared as if he took no notice of what was ſaid to him (for when wicked men bring their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations againſt others merely to indulge their own malice, it is often beſt not to lend an ear to them) but our Saviour, ſtooping down, wrote with his finger on the ground. The Scribes and Phariſees now thought they had puzzled him, and they therefore preſſed their queſtion again with great earneſtneſs. Ah! how little did they know of the true character of Chriſt, for he underſtood all their thoughts, through that divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which belonged to him, and his ſilence, in fact, was only intended to draw theſe his enemies on into a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and to make his own anſwer the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Our Saviour, after ſome time, raiſed himſelf from the ground, and ſaid to them, <hi>he that is without ſin among you, let him firſt caſt a ſtone at her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What a heart-ſearching anſwer was this—and, at the ſame time, what an unexpected one! They that had juſt now been accuſers, were hereby accuſed in their turn. It was as if our Saviour had ſaid, "You have brought me a woman taken in adultery, and you ſeem to have been very eager in doing it, and you pretend that you merely want to know what ought to be done with her; I, however, ſee into your hearts, and becauſe I know that your motives are corrupt, I ſhall not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you in the manner in which you expect; Moſes as you obſerve, commanded the adulterer to be ſtoned: be it ſo; go then, if you pleaſe, and ſtone this woman; but take this hint with you, that it becomes thoſe who are the moſt forward in blaming others to be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly free from blame themſelves. Let him, therefore, take the lead in puniſhing her, who, by being free from fault himſelf, has the beſt right to inflict the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:035296_0223_1001C1A2675F0A60"/>
                     <hi>Let him that is without ſin among you, caſt the firſt ſtone at her.</hi> Having thus ſpoken, Chriſt return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his employment of writing on the ground, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his reproof to work on the minds of the Scribes and Phariſees.</p>
                  <p>And now, behold the mighty force of a few words—<hi>they which heard it being convicted by their own conſciences, went out one by one, beginning with the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, even unto the leaſt; and Jeſus was left alone, and the woman ſtanding in the mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The criminal alone remains, and her accuſers are fled; nor have they fled without reaſon, for they had now begun to perceive that there was one ready to accuſe them in their turn, and that <hi>all things were naked and open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him with whom they had to do.</hi> Oh, if it had pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Saviour to bring to light all the hidden circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of their lives, and to publiſh on the ſpot every ſecret ſin they had committed, how would they have had to bluſh before all the people! They thought it prudent, therefore, to make the beſt of their way out of the Temple, leaving our Saviour either to condemn or acquit the woman as he might think proper.</p>
                  <p>Reader, whenſoever you ſeem tempted to be ſevere on any crime or failing of your neighbor, call to mind what paſſed between our Lord and theſe Phariſees; they were ſo buſy in bringing to light the ſin of another, that they had forgot that they had any ſins of their own—they reflected not that they were ſome of the moſt unfit men in the world to take up the office of accuſers, nor do they ſeem to have ever conſidered what was likely to become of themſelves hereafter, when God ſhould call them to judgment. And this is a common evil: God has given to every man his work; each has an evil heart of his own, which he ought to look to; each, if not guilty of open crimes, has many a ſecret
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:035296_0224_1001C1AA9535BFA0"/>ſin that he ought to repent of: inſtead of which, every one is beſtowing his attention on his neighbor's faults, without giving any heed to his own. We are all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally apt to entertain a very good opinion of ourſelves, but a ſtrict examination of our ways might chance to ſpoil that good opinion, and we are therefore very back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in entering upon the taſk. On the contrary, we are very ready to blame our neighbor, for, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as we blacken his character, we cauſe our own to appear in a favorable light.</p>
                  <p>But how very fooliſh, as well as vain, is all this ſelf-deceit! We may hide our ſins, for a while, both from ourſelves and from others alſo; juſt as the Phariſees concealed their true character, till our Saviour ſent them this rebuke; <hi>ſoon, however, a day will come when all that has been kept ſecret ſhall be brought to light;</hi> and even now, let me remark, that the ſame divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who, by a few words, confounded theſe hypocrites, has his eye upon us; <hi>for the Lord knoweth our down-ſitting and our up-riſing, and underſtandeth our thoughts long before; he is about our path, and about our bed, and eſpieth out all our ways. From him the darkneſs cannot hide us, for the darkneſs is no darkneſs to him, but the night is as clear as the day.</hi> Before him lies the hiſtory of our whole lives, in which is noted every thing that we have ever ſaid, every thing that we have ever done, and every thing alſo that we have ever tho't or imagined in our minds. And now, if the ſame Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſhould again appear in the Temple, and reprove us as he did the Phariſees, awakening in like manner our conſciences, and ſetting them to condemn us, who is there among us that could abide it? If he ſhould pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh among the croud of our fellow-creatures ſtanding round us, all the ſecret ſins of our lives, or ſhould draw them up in the form of an accuſation againſt us, and ſhould require us to ſtand by and hear the long indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment read, who is there, I ſay, who could ſtay to hear
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:035296_0225_1001C1B0E5D7B6B0"/>it to the end!—Who is there, who would not be glad to eſcape from his preſence, and leave him again alone in the Temple!</p>
                  <p>Nor let us forget that, although Chriſt walketh not on earth as he once did, and though he is not preſent to reprove us with an audible voice, as he did the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, yet he ſtill ſpeaks to us by our conſciences, and alſo by the ſtill voice of his Holy Spirit, which ſtriveth with us: and great is the power of conſcience, when once awakened, and ſet to work by the power of God's Holy Spirit; for then nothing can withſtand it; from the moment when it is truly alarmed it begins to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a man to himſelf, and it will then find him ſo much employment at home, that he will have little leiſure and leſs inclination to turn accuſer of his brethren. Go now into the chamber of him whom ſickneſs and ſorrow have brought low, and have filled with a deep ſenſe of ſin; ſee with what readineſs he confeſſes his iniquity, and with what earneſtneſs he prays for pardon; ſee how en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely he is taken up by the affairs of his own ſoul, and how he is laboring to make his peace with God. Tell him that ſome neighbor has fallen into a dreadful ſin, and how, think you, will be be affected by it? Why, he will lament, pity, and pray for the perſon. But if you ſhould try after the manner of ſome profane people to raiſe a joke at the expence of the unhappy ſinner, hoping to divert the ſick perſon with the ſubject, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks he would turn from you as from a man not fit for him to talk with, and he would probably beg you to go out of the room. To proceed one ſtep farther. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the laſt day to be now come. Imagine that you ſee the Judge upon the Throne, the generations of mankind aſſembled before him, and the books opened, out of which we are all to be judged. Who, in that ſituation, would have any diſpoſition to revile, or laugh at the ſins of his neighbor, or would have any heart to be ſevere upon him? Who is there whoſe thoughts
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:035296_0226_1001C1B6271F8C78"/>would not be employed entirely upon his own caſe?—Who would not be anxious to obtain his own pardon; who, in ſhort, would not leave God to deal as he tho't fit with others, hoping and praying that they alſo, if poſſible, might obtain mercy? To this temper, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is plain that ſickneſs may ſoon bring us, and to this temper, may God grant that we may all be brought before it is too late, ſince death and judgment will moſt aſſuredly bring us to it at laſt.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour having thus diſpatched the Phariſees, the woman alone remains: ſhe was detained in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the ſame cauſe which made the others depart—I mean conſciouſneſs of guilt. This kept her fixed to the ſpot even after her accuſers were gone, expecting now to hear her ſentence pronounced by Chriſt; who, at length, raiſed himſelf from the ground, on which he had been writing, ſays to the woman, <hi>where are thoſe thine accuſers? Hath no man condemned thee? She ſaid, no man, Lord. And Jeſus ſaid unto her, neither do I condemn thee; go, and ſin no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us not be led by this laſt ſpeech of Chriſt, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>t he meant either to make light of the ſin, or to ſay any thing againſt the law of God. No, let us take occaſion rather in this place to remark how very dreadful a crime adultery is conſidered by our Creator, ſince he ordered it in the Old Teſtament to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even with death. This puniſhment, however, was not to be inflicted, except after regular proof; an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer and ſufficient witneſſes muſt come forward in every ſuch caſe; the proper Judge or Magiſtrate muſt alſo hear the cauſe, and muſt himſelf pronounce the ſentence. If all theſe neceſſary rules had been complied with, Chriſt would not have thought of ſtopping the due courſe of law, for he was not uſed to meddle with the civil power, nor is there any inſtance of his ſhowing forth his mercy by ſaving a criminal out of the hands of public juſtice. In the preſent inſtance no kind of trial
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:035296_0227_1001C1BE10939760"/>had been had; on the contrary, the accuſers and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were all fled; this woman, therefore, not being accuſed by thoſe whoſe office it was to accuſe her, was not accuſed by Chriſt neither, whoſe office it certainly was not. On another occaſion, when Chriſt was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to by one who ſeems to have been wronged in his property, he made anſwer, <hi>man, who made me a judge and a divider.</hi> Our Saviour came into the world not to ſettle diſputes about property, nor to meddle in caſes of common criminal juſtice; he left all ſuch things as theſe to be managed by the perſons whom the ſtate appointed for the purpoſe. He came to be a Saviour, he came to pardon ſins committed againſt God, for which he made atonement by his death, and in his life time he taught men how to obtain this ſalvation, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by repenting and believing in him, and reſolving to <hi>ſin no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In full agreement with theſe ends of his coming into the world, he, in the preſent caſe, leaves the law of Moſes juſt as it was, neither condemning nor yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting the woman; but as the publiſher of the Goſpel of the grace of God, and, as the author of everlaſting Salvation, he comforts, with the hope of pardon, the wretched perſon whom the malicious Phariſees had bro't before him, and he directs her how to eſcape, not the more puniſhment of the law, but the more bitter pains of eternal death. <hi>Go,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and ſin no more.</hi> It is as if he had ſaid, "Be not concerned about the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the magiſtrate, which has been brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, for your accuſers indeed are gone. I have put them to ſlight by a ſingle ſentence ſpoken to their conſciences; and ſince the Phariſees do not accuſe you, neither ſhall I turn proſecutor.

                  <head>THE GRAND ASSIZES; OR, <hi>GENERAL GAOL DELIVERY.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THERE was in a certain country a great king, who was alſo a judge. He was very merciful, but he was alſo very juſt; for he uſed to ſay that juſtice was the foundation of all goodneſs. His ſubjects were apt enough, in a general way, to extol his merciful temper, and eſpecially thoſe ſubjects who were always committing crimes which made them liable to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by his juſtice. This laſt quality they conſtantly kept out of ſight, till they had cheated themſelves into a notion that he was too good to puniſh at all.</p>
                  <p>Now it happened a long time before, that this whole people had broken their allegiance, and had forfeited the king's favor, and had alſo fallen from a very proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſtate in which he had placed them, having one and all become bankrupts; but when they were over head and ears in debt, and had nothing to pay, the king's ſon moſt generouſly took the whole burthen of the debts on himſelf; and, in ſhort, it was propoſed that all their affairs ſhould be ſettled, and their very crimes forgiven, (for they were criminals as well as debtors) provided only they would ſhew themſelves to be ſorry for what they had done themſelves, and be thankful for what was done for them. I ſhould however remark, that a book was alſo given them, in which a true and faithful account of their own rebellion was written; and of the manner of obtaining the king's pardon, together with a variety of directions for their conduct in time to come;
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:035296_0230_1001A3A1B44437F0"/>and in this book it was particularly mentioned, that after having lived a certain number of years in a part of the ſame king's country, and under his eye and juriſdiction, there ſhould be a Grand Aſſize, when every one was to be publicly tried for his paſt behavior, and after this trial was over, certain heavy puniſhments were to be inflicted on thoſe who ſhould have ſtill perſiſted in their rebellion, and certain high premiums were to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed as a gracious reward upon the obedient.</p>
                  <p>It may be proper here to notice, that this king's court differed in ſome reſpects from our courts of jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, being indeed a ſort of court of appeal, to which queſtions were carried after they had been imperfectly decided in the common courts. And although with us all criminals are tried (and very pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap> my opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion) by a jury of their peers, yet in this king's country the mode was very different; for, ſince every one of the people had been in a certain ſenſe criminals, the king did not think it fair to make them judges alſo. It would, indeed, have been impoſſible to follow in all reſpects, the cuſtoms which prevail with us, for the crimes with which men are charged in our courts are mere "overt acts," as the lawyers call them, that is, acts which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the outward behavior; ſuch as the acts of ſtriking, maiming, ſtealing, and ſo forth. But in the king's court it was not merely outward ſins, but ſins of the heart alſo which were to be puniſhed. Many a crime, therefore, which was never heard of in the court of king's-bench, or at the Old Baily, was here to be bro't to light, and was reſerved for this great day. Among theſe were pride, and oppreſſion, and envy, and malice, and revenge, and covetouſneſs, and ſecret vanity of mind, and evil thoughts of all ſorts, and all evil wiſhes and deſires. When covetouſneſs, indeed, put men on committing robbery, or when malice drove them to an not of murder, then the common courts immediately judged the criminal, without waiting for theſe Great
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:035296_0231_1001C1CE5BE97648"/>Aſſizes; nevertheleſs ſince even a thief and murderer would now and then eſcape in the common courts, for want of evidence, or through ſome fault or other of the judge of jury, the eſcape was of little moment to the poor criminal, for he was ſure to be tried again by this great king; and even though the man ſhould have been puniſhed in ſome ſenſe before, yet he had now a farther puniſhment to fear, unleſs, indeed he was one of thoſe, who had obtained (by the means I before ſpoke of) this great king's pardon. The ſins of the heart, however, were by far the moſt numerous ſort of ſins, which were to come before this great tribunal; and theſe were to be judged by this great king in perſon, and by none but himſelf; becauſe he poſſeſſed a certain power of getting at all ſecrets.</p>
                  <p>I once heard of a certain king of Sicily, who built a whiſpering gallery in the form of an ear, through which he could hear every word that his rebellious ſubjects uttered, though ſpoken ever ſo low. But this ſecret of the king of Sicily was nothing to what this great king poſſeſſed; for he had the power of knowing every tho't which was conceived in the mind, though it never broke out into words, or proceeded to actions.</p>
                  <p>Now you may be ready to think, perhaps, that theſe people were worſe off than any others, becauſe they were to be examined ſo cloſely, and judged ſo ſtrictly. Far from it: the king was too juſt to expect bricks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving them ſtraw; he gave them, therefore, every help that they needed. He gave them a book of direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as I before obſerved; and becauſe they were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſhort-ſighted, he ſupplied them with a glaſs for reading it, and thus the moſt dim-ſighted might ſee, if they did not wilfully ſhut their eyes; but though the king <hi>invited</hi> them to open their eyes, he did not <hi>compel</hi> them; and many remained ſtone blind all their lives with the book in their hand, becauſe they would not uſe the glaſs, nor take the proper means for reading and
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:035296_0232_1001C1D0DA4D13F8"/>underſtanding all that was written for them. The humble and ſincere learnt in time to ſee even that part of the book which was leaſt plainly written; and it was obſerved that the ability to underſtand it depended more on the heart than the head; and evil diſpoſition blinded the ſight, while humility operated like an eye-ſalve.</p>
                  <p>Now it happened that thoſe who had been ſo lucky as to eſcape the puniſhment of the lower courts, took it into their heads that they were all very good ſort of people, and of courſe very ſafe from any danger at this Great Aſſize. This grand intended trial, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, had been talked of ſo much, and put off ſo long, (for it had ſeemed long at leaſt to theſe ſhort-ſighted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) that many perſuaded themſelves that it would never take place at all; and far the greater part were living away therefore without ever thinking about it; they went on juſt as if nothing at all had been done for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit; and as if they had no king to pleaſe, no king's ſon to be thankful to, no book to guide themſelves by, and as if the Aſſizes were never to come about.</p>
                  <p>But with this king <hi>a thouſand years were as one day, for he was not ſlack concerning his promiſes, as ſome men count ſlackneſs.</hi> So at length the ſolemn period ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached. Still, however, the people did not prepare for the ſolemnity, or rather, they prepared for it much as ſome of the people in our towns are apt to prepare for the Aſſize times; I mean by balls and feaſtings, and they ſaw their own trial come on with as little concern as is felt by the people in our ſtreets, when they ſee the judge's proceſſion enter the town, who indeed comfort themſelves that it is only thoſe in the priſons who are guilty.</p>
                  <p>But when at laſt the day came, and every man found that he was to be judged for himſelf, and that ſome how or other, all his ſecrets were brought out, and that there was now no eſcape, things began to take a more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous turn. Some of the worſt of the criminals were
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:035296_0233_1001C1D780283CC8"/>got together debating in an outer court of the Grand Hall, and there they paſſed their time, not in compunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with tears, not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> comparing their lives with what was required in that book which had been given them, but in comparing themſelves with ſuch as had been ſtill more notorious offenders.</p>
                  <p>One who had grown wealthy by rapine and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but had contrived to keep within the letter of the law, inſulted a poor fellow as a thief, becauſe he had ſtolen a loaf of bread. "You were far wickeder than I was," ſaid a citizen to his apprentice, "for you drank and ſwore at the alehouſe every Sunday night." "Yes," ſaid the poor fellow, "but it was your fault that I did ſo, for you took no care of my ſoul, but ſpent all your Sabbaths in jaunting abroad or in rioting at home; I might have learnt, but there was no one to teach me; I might have followed a good example, but I ſaw only bad ones. I ſinned againſt leſs light than you did." A drunken journeyman, who had ſpent all his wages on gin, took comfort that he had not ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>I have not room to deſcribe the awful pomp of the court, nor the terrible ſounding of the trumpet which attended the judge's entrance, nor the ſitting of the judge, nor the opening the books, nor the crouding of the millions, who ſtood before him. I ſhall paſs over the multitudes who were tried and condemned to dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, and chains, and fire, and to perpetual baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the preſence of the king, which always ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the ſaddeſt part of the ſentence. I ſhall only notice further, a few who brought ſome plea of merit, and claimed a right to be rewarded by the king, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven deceived themſelves ſo far as to think that his own book of laws would be their juſtification.</p>
                  <p>A thoughtleſs ſpendthrift advanced without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:035296_0234_1001C1DF150BB5E8"/>and ſaid, "that he had lived handſomely, and had <hi>hated the covetous whom God abhorreth,</hi> and that he truſted in that paſſage of the book which ſaid, that <hi>covetouſneſs was idolatry;</hi> and that he therefore loped for a favorable ſentence." Now it proved that this man had not only avoided covetouſneſs, but that he had even left his wife and children in want through his exceſſive prodigality. The judge therefore immediately pointed to that place in the book where it is written, <hi>he that provideth not for his houſehold is worſe than an infidel. He that liveth in pleaſure is dead while he liveth; thou,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>in thy life time receivedeſt thy good things, and now thou muſt be tormented.</hi>—Then a miſer, whom hunger and hoarding had worn to ſkin and bone, crept forward, and praiſed the ſentence paſſed on this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant youth, "and ſurely," ſaid he, "ſince he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, I am the man that may make ſome plea to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor—I was never idle or drunk, I kept my body in ſubjection. I have been ſo ſelf-denying that I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a ſaint: I have loved neither father, nor mother, nor wife, nor children, to exceſs; in all this I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed the book of the law." Then the judge ſaid, "<hi>but where are thy works of mercy and thy labors of love?</hi> ſee that family which periſhed in thy ſight laſt hard winter, while thy barns were overflowing; that poor family were my repreſentatives, yet <hi>they were hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and thou gaveſt them no meat. Go to now thou rich man, weep and howl for the miſeries that are come upon you. Your gold and your ſilves is cankered and the ruſt of them ſhall be a witneſs againſt you, and ſhall eat your fleſh as it were fire.</hi>" Then came up one with a moſt ſelf-ſufficient air. He walked up boldly, having in one hand the plan of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> hoſpital which he had built, and in the other the drawing of a ſtatue which was erecting for him in the country that he had juſt left, and on his forehead appeared in gold letters, the liſt of all the Public Charities to which he had ſubſcribed.—
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:035296_0235_1001C1E4045B2C60"/>He ſeemed to take great pleaſure in the condemnation of the Miſer, and ſaid, <hi>Lord, where ſaw I thee hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and fed thee not, or in priſon and viſited thee not? I have viſited the fatherleſs and widow in their afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Here the Judge cut him ſhort by ſaying, "True, thou didſt viſit the fatherleſs, but didſt thou fulfil equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that other part of my command <hi>to keep thyſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted from the world.</hi>" No, thou wert conformed to the world in many of its ſinful cuſtoms, <hi>thou didſt follow a multitude to do evil; thou didſt love the world and the things of the world;</hi> and the motive to all thy charities was not a regard to me but to thy own credit with thy fellow-men. Thou haſt done every thing for the ſake of reputation, and now thou art vainly truſting in thy works, inſtead of putting all thy truſt in my Son, who has offered himſelf to be a ſurety for thee. Where has been that humility and gratitude to him which was required of thee. No, thou wouldſt be thine own ſurety: thou haſt truſted in thyſelf: thou haſt made thy boaſt of thine own goodneſs: thou haſt ſought after and thou haſt enjoyed the praiſe of men, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, I ſay unto thee, <hi>thou haſt had thy reward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A poor diſeaſed blind cripple, from the very Hoſpital which this great man had built, then fell proſtrate on his face, crying out, <hi>Lord be merciful to me a ſinner!</hi> on which the Judge, to the ſurprize of all, ſaid, <hi>well done good and faithful ſervant.</hi> The poor man repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "Lord, I have done nothing!" "But thou haſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered well," ſaid the Judge; "thou haſt been an example of patience and meekneſs and though thou hadſt but few talents, yet thou haſt well improved thoſe few; thou hadſt time, this thou didſt ſpend in the humble duties of thy ſtation, and alſo in earneſt prayer, even for that proud Founder of thine Hoſpital, who never prayed for himſelf; thou waſt indeed blind and lame, but it is no where ſaid, my Son, give me thy feet or thine eyes, but <hi>give me thy heart;</hi> and even the faculties I did

One talked of his generoſity, another of his courage, and a third of his fortitude; but it proved, on a cloſe examination, that ſome of thoſe ſuppoſed virtues were merely the effect of a particular conſtitution of body; that others proceeded from a falſe motive, and that not a few of them were actual vices, ſince they were carried to exceſs; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of fulfilling one duty, ſome other duty was loſt ſight of; in ſhort, theſe partial virtues were none of them done in obedience to the will of the king, but merely to pleaſe the perſon's own humour, and they would not therefore ſtand this day's trial, for <hi>he that had kept the whole law, and yet had wilfully and habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally offended in any one point, was declared guilty of breaking the whole.</hi>
                  </p>

Each at once ſaw himſelf in his true light, and found, alas! when it was too late, that he ſhould have made the book which had been given him his rule of practice before, ſince it now proved to be the rule by which he was to be judged. Nay, every one now tho't himſelf even worſe than his neighbor, becauſe, while he only ſaw and heard of the guilt of others, he felt his own in all its aggravated hor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>To complete their confuſion, they were compelled to acknowledge the juſtice of the Judge who condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; and alſo to approve the favorable ſentence by which thouſands of other crimmals had not only their lives ſaved, but were made happy and glorious beyond all imagination, and all this was in conſequence of their

One thing was remarkable, that whilſt moſt of thoſe who were condemned, never expected condemnation, but even claimed a reward for their ſuppoſed innocence or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, all who were really rewarded and forgiven were ſenſible that they owed every thing to a mere act of grace, and they cried out with one voice, <hi>not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy name be the praiſe!!!</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>ONCE upon a time methought I ſet out upon a long journey, and the place through which I travelled appeared to be a dark Valley, which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Valley of Tears. It had obtained this name not only on account of the many ſorrowful adventures which poor paſſengers commonly meet with in their journey through it, but alſo becauſe moſt of theſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers entered it weeping and crying, and left it in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great pain and anguiſh. This vaſt valley was full of people of all colors, ages, ſizes, and deſcriptions.— But whether white or black, or tawney, all were tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling the ſame road; or, rather, they were taking different little paths which all led to the ſame common end.</p>
                  <p>Now it was remarkable, that notwithſtanding the
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:035296_0238_1001C1F1BA4F1408"/>different complexions, ages, and tempers of this vaſt variety of people, yet all reſembled each other in this one reſpect, that each had a burthen on his back which he was deſtined to carry through the toil and heat of the day, until he ſhould arrive by a longer or ſhorter courſe at his journey's end. Theſe burthens would in general have made the pilgrimage quite intolerable, had not the Lord of the Valley, out of his great compaſſion for theſe poor Pilgrims, provided among other things the following means for their relief.</p>
                  <p>In their full view over the entrance of the Valley there were written in great letters, the following words:
<q>Bear ye one another's Burthens.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I ſaw in my viſion that many of the travellers hurried on without ſtopping to read this inſtruction, and others, though they had once read it, yet paid little or no attention to it. A third ſort thought it very good advice for other people, but very ſeldom applied it to themſelves. In ſhort, I ſaw that too many of thoſe people were of opinion that they had burthens enough of their own, and that there was therefore no occaſion to take upon them thoſe of others; ſo each tried to make his own load as light, and his own journey as pleaſant as he could, without ſo much as once caſting a thought on a pool over-loaded neighbor. Here, however, I have to make a rather ſingular remark, by which I ſhall plainly ſhew the folly of theſe ſelfiſh people. It was ſo ordered and contrived by the Lord of this valley, that if any one ſtretched out his hand to lighten a neighbor's burthen, in fact he never failed to find that he at that moment alſo lightened his own. Beſides, the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to help each other, and the benefit of doing ſo were mutual. If a man helped his neighbor, it commonly happened that ſome other neighbor came by-and-by and helped him in his turn; for there was no ſuch thing as what we call <hi>independence</hi> in the whole valley. Not
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:035296_0239_1001C1F71131D330"/>one of all theſe travellers, however ſtout and ſtrong, could move on comfortably without aſſiſtance, for ſo the Lord of the Valley, whoſe laws were all of them kind and good, had expreſsly ordained.</p>
                  <p>I ſtood ſtill to watch the progreſs of theſe poor way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring people, who moved ſlowly on, like ſo many tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et porters, with burthens of various kinds on their backs; of which ſome were heavier, and ſome were lighter, but from a burthen of one kind or other, not one traveller was entirely free.</p>

I was wondering how it was that he got on even ſo well as he did, till I ſpied his wife, a kind, meek, Chriſtian woman, who was doing her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to aſſiſt him. She quietly got behind, gently laid her ſhoulder to the burthen, and carried a much larger proportion of it than appeared to me when I was at a diſtance. She not only ſuſtained him by her ſtrength, but cheered him by her counſels. She told him that <hi>through much tribulation we muſt enter into reſt,</hi> that <hi>he that overcometh ſhall inherit all things.</hi> In ſhort,
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:035296_0240_1001C1FEBB845BD0"/>ſhe ſo ſupported his fainting ſpirit, that he was enabled to <hi>run with patience the race that was ſet before him.</hi>

                     <head>THE KIND NEIGHBOR.</head>
                     <p>An infirm blind woman was creeping forward with a very heavy burthen, in which were packed ſickneſs and want, with numberleſs other of thoſe raw materials, out of which human miſery is worked up. She was ſo weak that ſhe could not have got on at all, had it not been for the kind aſſiſtance of another woman almoſt as poor as herſelf; who, though ſhe had no light burthen of her own, cheerfully lent an helping hand to a fellow traveller who was ſtill more heavily laden. This friend had indeed little or nothing to give, but the very voice of kindneſs is ſoothing to the weary. And I remarked in many other caſes, that it was not ſo much the degree of the help afforded, as the manner of helping that lightened the burthens. Some had a coarſe, rough, clumſy way of aſſiſting a neighbor, which, though in fact it might be of real uſe, yet ſeemed, by galling the travellers, to add to the load it was intended to lighten; while I obſerved in others that ſo cheap a kindneſs as a mild word, or even an affectionate look, made a poor burthened wretch move on cheerily. The bare feeling that ſome human being cared for him, ſeemed to light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the load. But to return to this kind neighbor. She had a little old book in her hand, the covers of which were worn out by much uſe. When ſhe ſaw the blind woman ready to faint, ſhe would read her a few words out of this book, ſuch as the following—<hi>bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.—Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted. I will never leave thee nor forſake thee. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi>

The burthen of the pariſh thus divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed became tolerable. The Miniſter, being no longer bowed down by the temporal diſtreſſes of his people, applied himſelf cheerfully to his own part of the weight. And it was pleaſant to ſee how thoſe two perſons, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them very ſtrong, or rich, or healthy, by thus kindly uniting together, were enabled to bear the weight of a whole pariſh; though ſingly, either of them muſt have ſunk under the attempt. And I remember one great grief I felt during my whole journey was, that I did not ſee more of this union and concurring kindneſs, by which all the burthens might have been ſo eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.

                     <p>I now ſpied a ſwarm of poor black men, women, and children, a multitude which no man could number; theſe groaned and toiled, and ſweated, and bled under far heavier loads than I had yet ſeen. But for a while no man helped them; at length a few white travellers were touched with the ſorrowful ſighing of thoſe mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, and very heartily did they pat their hands to the burthens; but their number was not quite equal to the work they had undertaken. I perceived, however, that they never loſt ſight of thoſe poor heavy-laden wretches, and as the number of theſe generous helpers encreaſed, I felt a comfortable hope, that before all the blacks got out of the Valley, the whites would fairly divide the burthen, and the loads would be effectually lightened.</p>
                     <p>Among the travellers, I had occaſion to remark, that thoſe who moſt kicked and ſtruggled under their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, only made them ſo much the heavier; for their
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:035296_0242_1001C208D2724A40"/>ſhoulders became extremely galled by thoſe vain ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles. The load, if borne patiently, would in the end have turned even to the advantage of the bearers, (for ſo the Lord of the Valley had kindly decreed) but as to theſe grumblers, they had all the ſmart and none of the benefit. But the thing which made all theſe burthens ſeem ſo very heavy was, that in every one without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, there was a certain <hi>inner pacquet,</hi> which moſt of the travellers took pains to conceal, and carefully wrap up; and while they were forward enough to complain of the other part of their burthens, few ſaid a word about this; though in truth it was the preſſing weight of this <hi>ſecret pacquet</hi> which ſerved to render the general burthen ſo intolerable. In ſpite of all their caution, I contrived to get a peep at it; I found in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>THE Strait Gate and the Broad Way, BEING THE SECOND PART OF THE VALLEY OF TEARS.</head>
                  <p>NOW I had a ſecond viſion of what was paſſing in <hi>the Valley of Tears.</hi> Methought I ſaw again the ſame kind of travellers whom I had ſeen in the former part, and they were wandering at large through the ſame vaſt wilderneſs. At firſt ſetting out on his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, each traveller had a lamp ſo fixed in his boſom,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:035296_0244_1001C214FACD0250"/>that it ſeemed to make a part of himſelf, but as this <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural light</hi> did not prove to be ſufficient to direct them in the right way, the king of the country, in pity to their wanderings and their blindneſs, out of his gracious condeſcenſion, promiſed to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e theſe poor way-faring people an additional ſupply of light from his own Royal Treaſury. But as he did not cauſe to laviſh his favors where there ſeemed no diſpoſition to receive them, he would not beſtow any of his oil on ſuch as did not think it worth aſking for. <hi>Aſk and ye ſhall have,</hi> was the rule he laid down for them. Many were prevented from aſking through pride, for they thought they had light enough already, preferring the feeble glimmerings of their own lamp to all the light from the king's treaſury. Yet it was obſerved of thoſe who rejected it, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had enough, that hardly any acted up to what even their own light ſhewed them. Others were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from aſking, becauſe they were told that it not only pointed out the dangers and difficulties of the road, but by a certain reflecting power, it turned inward on themſelves, and revealed to them ugly ſights in their own hearts, to which they rather choſe to be blind; for thoſe travellers <hi>choſe darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds were evil.</hi> Now it was remarkable that theſe two properties were inſeparable, and that the lamp would be of little outward uſe, except to thoſe who uſed it as an internal reflector. A threat and a promiſe alſo never failed to accompany the offer of this light from the king, a promiſe that to thoſe who improved what they had, <hi>more ſhould be given, and a threat that from thoſe who did not uſe it wiſely, ſhould be taken away even what they had.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I obſerved that when the road was very dangerous, when terrors and difficulties and death beſet the faithful traveller, then on their fervent importunity, the king voluntarily gave large and bountiful ſupplies of light, ſuch as in common ſeaſons never could have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:035296_0245_1001C219E2025068"/>always proportioning the quantity given to the neceſſity of the caſe, <hi>as their day was, ſuch was their light and ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though many choſe to depend entirely on their own lamp, yet it was obſerved that this light was apt to go out if left to itſelf. It was eaſily blown out by thoſe violent guſts which were perpetually howling through the wilderneſs, and indeed it was the natural tendency of that unwholeſome atmoſphere to extinguiſh it, juſt as you have ſeen a candle go out when expoſed to the vapours and foul air of a damp room. It was a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly ſight to ſee multitudes of travellers heedleſsly pacing on, boaſting that they had light enough, and deſpiſing the offer of more. But what aſtoniſhed me moſt of all was, to ſee many, and ſome of them too ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted men of firſt rate wit, actually buſy in blowing out their own light, becauſe while any ſpark of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, it only ſerved to torment them, and point out things which they did not wiſh to ſee. And having once blown out their own light, they were not eaſy till they had blown out that of their neighbor's alſo; ſo that a good part of the wilderneſs ſeemed to exhibit a ſort of univerſal <hi>blindman's buff,</hi> each endeavoring to catch his neighbor, while his own voluntary blindneſs expoſed him to be caught himſelf, ſo that each was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually falling into the ſnare he was laying for another, till at length, as ſelfiſhneſs is the natural conſequence of blindneſs, "catch he that catch can," became the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral cry throughout the wilderneſs.</p>
                  <p>Now I ſaw in my viſion that there were ſome others who were buſy in ſtrewing the moſt gaudy flowers over the numerous bogs, precipices, and pit-falls with which the wilderneſs abounded, and thus making danger and death look ſo gay, that poor thoughtleſs creatures ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to delight in their own deſtruction. Thoſe pit-falls did not appear deep or dangerous, becauſe over them were raiſed gay edifices with alluring names, in which
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:035296_0246_1001C21DF7F370C8"/>were ſinging men and ſinging women, and dancing, and feaſting, and gaming, and drinking, and jollity, and madneſs. But though the ſcenery was gay, the footing was unſound. The floors were full of holes through which the unthinking merry-makers were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſinking. Some tumbled through in the middle of a ſong, many at the end of a feaſt, and though there was many a cup of intoxication wreathed with flowers, yet there was always poiſon at the bottom. But what moſt ſurpriſed me was, that though no day paſſed over their heads in which ſome of thoſe merry-makers did not drop through, yet their loſs made little impreſſion on thoſe who were left. Nay, inſtead of being awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to more circumſpection and ſelf-denial by the continual dropping off of thoſe about them, ſeveral of them ſeemed to borrow from thence an argument of a direct contrary tendency, and the very ſhortneſs of the time was only urged as a reaſon to uſe it more ſedulous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the indulgence in ſenſual delights. <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die. Let us crown our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with roſe-buds before they are withered.</hi> With theſe and a thouſand other ſuch little mottos, the gay garlands of the wilderneſs were decorated. Some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired poets were ſet to work to put the moſt corrupt ſentiments into the moſt harmonious tunes; theſe were ſung without ſcruple, chiefly indeed by the looſer ſons of riot, but not ſeldom alſo by the more orderly daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſobriety, who were not aſhamed to ſing to the ſound of inſtruments, ſentiments ſo corrupt and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that they would have bluſhed to ſpeak or read them; but the muſic ſeemed to ſanctify the corruption, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as was connected with love or drinking.</p>
                  <p>Now I obſerved that all the travellers who had ſo much as a ſpark of light left, ſeemed every now and then, as they moved onwards, to caſt an eye, though with very different degrees of attention, towards the <hi>happy land,</hi> which they were told lay at the end of their
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:035296_0247_1001C22542281FC0"/>journey; but as they could not ſee very far forward, and as they knew there was a <hi>dark and ſhadowy valley</hi> which muſt needs be croſſed before they could attain to the <hi>happy land,</hi> they tried to turn their attention from it as much as they could. The truth is, they were not ſufficiently apt to conſult a map which the king had given them, and which pointed cut the road to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py land ſo clearly, that <hi>the way-faring men, though ſimple, could not err.</hi> This map alſo defined very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly the boundaries of the <hi>happy land</hi> from the <hi>land of miſery,</hi> both of which lay on the other ſide of the <hi>dark and ſhadowy valley;</hi> but ſo many beacons and light-houſes were erected, ſo many clear and explicit directions furniſhed for avoiding the one country and attaining the other, that it was not the king's fault, if even one ſingle traveller got wrong. But I am incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to think that in ſpite of the map, and the king's word, and his offers of aſſiſtance to get them thither, that the travellers in general did not heartily and truly believe after all, that there was any ſuch country as the <hi>happy land;</hi> or at leaſt, the paltry and tranſient plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the wilderneſs ſo beſotted them, the thoughts of the <hi>dark and ſhadowy valley</hi> ſo frightened them, that they thought they ſhould be more comfortable by ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing all thought and forecaſt.</p>
                  <p>Now I alſo ſaw in my dream, that there were two roads through the wilderneſs, one of which every tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller muſt needs take. The firſt was narrow and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, and rough, but it was infallibly ſafe. It did not admit the traveller to ſtray either to the right hand or the left, yet it was far from being deſtitute of real com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts or ſober pleaſures. The other was a <hi>broad and tempting way,</hi> abounding with luxurious fruits and gaudy flowers to tempt the eye, and pleaſe the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. To forget this dark valley, through which every traveller was well aſſured he muſt one day paſs, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indeed the object of general deſire. To this grand
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:035296_0248_1001C22A88883440"/>end, all that human ingenuity could invent was indus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triouſly ſet to work. The travellers read, and they wrote, and they painted, and they ſung, and they dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and they drank as they went along, not ſo much becauſe they all cared for theſe things, or had any real joy in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, as becauſe this reſtleſs activity ſerved to divert their attention from ever being fixed on the <hi>dark and ſhadowy valley.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The king, who knew the thoughtleſs temper of the travellers, and how apt they were to forget their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's end, had thought of a thouſand little kind atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to warn them of their dangers. And as we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſee in our gardens written on a board in great let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, BEWARE OF SPRING GUNS—MAN TRAPS ARE SET HERE; ſo had this king cauſed to be written and ſtuck up before the eyes of the travellers, ſeveral like notices and cautions, ſuch as <hi>broad is the way that leadeth to deſtruction—Take heed leſt ye alſo periſh—Woe to them that riſe up early to drink wine—The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin are but for a ſeaſon,</hi> &amp;c. Such were the notices directed to the <hi>broad-way</hi> travellers, but they were ſo buſily engaged in plucking the flowers, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before they were blown, and in devouring the fruits, often before they were ripe, and in loading themſelves with <hi>yellow-clay,</hi> under the weight of which millions periſhed, that they had no time ſo much as to look at the king's directions. Many went wrong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they preferred a merry journey to a ſafe one, and were terrified by certain notices, chiefly intended for the <hi>narrow-way</hi> travellers, ſuch as, <hi>ye ſhall weep and lament, but the world ſhall rejoice;</hi> but had theſe fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh people allowed themſelves time or patience to read to the end, which they ſeldom would do, they would have ſeen theſe comfortable words added, <hi>but your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſhall be turned into joy,</hi> alſo, <hi>your joy no man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth from you, and they that ſow in tears ſhall reap in joy.</hi>

Now I alſo ſaw in my dream, that many travellers who had a ſtrong dread of ending at the <hi>land of miſery,</hi> walked up to the <hi>Strait Gate,</hi> hoping that though the entrance was narrow, yet if they could once get in, the road would widen; but what was their grief when on looking more cloſely, they ſaw written on the inſide, <hi>narrow is the way;</hi> this made them take fright, they compared the inſcriptions with which the whole way was lined, ſuch as, <hi>be ye not conformed to this world— deny yourſelves—take up your croſs,</hi> with all the tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſures of the wilderneſs. Some indeed recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſine deſcriptions they had read of the <hi>happy land, the golden city, and the rivers of pleaſures,</hi> and they ſighed: but then, thoſe joys were diſtant, and from the faintneſs of their light, they ſoon got to think that what was remote might be uncertain, and while the preſent good increaſed in bulk by its nearneſs, the diſtant good receded, diminiſhed, diſappeared! Their faith failed, they would truſt no farther than they could ſee; they drew back and got into the <hi>broad-way,</hi> taking a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon but ſad refuge in the number and gaiety of their companions. When theſe ſaint-hearted people, who yet had ſet out well, turned back, their light was quite put out, and then they became worſe than thoſe who had made no attempt to get in. <hi>For it is impoſſible,</hi> that is, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In the mean time there came a great multitude of travellers, all from <hi>Laodicea;</hi> this was the largeſt party I had yet ſeen; theſe were <hi>neither hot nor cold,</hi> they would not give up future hope, they could not endure preſent pain; ſo they contrived to deceive themſelves by fancying that they reſolved to keep the <hi>happy land</hi> in view, yet that there needs muſt be many different ways which led to it, no doubt all equally ſure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being all equally rough; ſo they ſet on foot little contrivances to attain the end without uſing the means, and ſoftened down the ſpirit of the king's directions to fit them to their own practice. Sometimes they would ſplit a direction in two, and only uſe that half which ſuited them. For inſtance, when they met with the following rule, <hi>Truſt in the Lord and be doing good,</hi> they would take the firſt half, and make themſelves eaſy with a general ſort of truſt, that through the mercy of the king all would go will with them, though they themſelves did nothing; and on the other hand, many made ſure that a few good works of their own would do their buſineſs, and carry them ſafely to the <hi>happy land,</hi> though they did not truſt in the Lord, nor place any faith in his word. Thus, ſome periſhed by a lazy
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:035296_0251_1001C23C96D48F08"/>faith, and others by a working pride. A large party of <hi>Phariſees</hi> now appeared, who had ſo neglected their lamp that they did not ſee their way at all, though they fancied themſelves to be full of light; they kept up ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances ſo well, as to delude others, and moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to delude themſelves with a notion that they might be found in the right way at laſt. In this dreadful delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they went on to the end, and till they were finally plunged in the dark valley, never diſcovered the horrors which awaited them on the diſmal ſhore. It was rema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable that while theſe Phariſees were often boaſting how bright their light burnt, in order to get the praiſe of men, the humble travellers, whoſe ſteady light ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their good works to others, refuſed all commendation, and the brighter their light ſhined before men, ſo much the more they inſiſted that they ought to glorify not themſelves, but <hi>their Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I now ſet myſelf to obſerve what was the particular let, moleſtation, and hindrance, which obſtructed parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular travellers in their endeavors to enter in at the Strait Gate. I remarked a huge portly man who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſirous of getting in, but he carried about him ſuch a vaſt proviſion of bags full of gold, and had on ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rich garments which ſtuffed him out ſo wide, that though he puſhed and ſqueezed, like one who had really a mind to get in, yet he could not poſſibly do ſo. Then I heard a voice crying, <hi>woe to him that loadeth himſelf with thick clay.</hi> The poor man felt ſomething was wrong, and even went ſo far as to change ſome of his more cumberſome vanities into others which ſeemed loſs bulky, but ſtill he and his pack were much too wide for the gate. He would not however give up the matter ſo eaſily, but began to throw away a little of the coarſer part of his baggage, but ſtill I remarked that he threw away none of the vanities which lay near his heart. He tried again, but it would not do; ſtill his

Had he read on he would have ſeen that <hi>with God all things are poſſible.</hi>

He ſoon found, however, that he was ſo bloated with pride, and ſtuffed out with ſelf-ſufficiency, that he could not get in. Nay, he was in a worſe way than the rich man juſt named; for <hi>he</hi> was willing to throw away ſome of his outward luggage, whereas this man refuſed to part with a grain of that vanity and ſelf-applauſe which made him too big for the way. The ſenſe of his own worth ſo ſwelled him out, that he ſtuck faſt in the <hi>gateway,</hi> and could neither get in nor out. Finding now that he muſt cut off all thoſe big thoughts of himſelf if he wiſhed to be reduced to ſuch a ſize as to paſs the gate, he gave up all thoughts of it. He ſcorned that humility and ſelf-denial which might have ſhrunk him down to the proper dimenſions; the more he inſiſted on his own qualifications for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, the more impoſſible it became, for the bigger he grew. Finding that he muſt become quite another manner of man before he could hope to get in, he gave up the deſire; and I now ſaw that though when he ſet his face towards the <hi>happy land</hi> he could not yet an inch forward, yet the inſtant he made a motion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

A fit of ſickneſs perhaps, which is very apt to reduce, had for a time brought their bodies into ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo that they were able juſt to get in at the <hi>gateway;</hi> but as ſoon as health and ſpirits returned, the way grew narrower and narrower to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Others were fatally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by loads of bad habits which they would not lay down, though they knew it prevented their entrance. Some few, however, of moſt deſcriptions, who had kept their light alive, by craving conſtant ſupplies from the king's treaſury, got through at laſt by a ſtrength which they felt not to be their own. One poor man, who carried the largeſt bundle of bad habits I had ſeen, could not get on a ſtep; he never ceaſed, however, to implore for light enough to ſee where his miſery lay; he threw down one of his bundles, then another, but all to little purpoſe; ſtill he could not ſtir. At laſt ſtriving as if in an agony, (which is the true way of entering) he threw down the heavieſt article in his pack; this was <hi>ſelfiſhneſs;</hi> the poor fellow felt relieved at once, his light burnt brightly, and the reſt of his paok was as nothing.</p>
                  <p>Then I heard a great noiſe as of carpenters at work. I looked what this might be, and ſaw many ſturdy tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, who finding they were too bulky to get through, took it into their heads not to reduce themſelves, but to widen the gate; they hacked on this ſide, and hewed on that; but all their hacking, and hewing, and hammering,
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:035296_0254_1001C24ECE35BDB8"/>was to no purpoſe, they got only their labor for their pains; it was poſſible they might have reduced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but they could not widen the way.</p>
                  <p>What grieved me moſt was to obſerve that many who had got on ſucceſsfully a good way, now ſtopped to reſt, and to admire their own progreſs. While they were thus valuing themſelves on their attainments, their light diminiſhed. While theſe were boaſting how far they had left others behind, who had ſet out much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, ſome ſlower travellers, whoſe beginning had not been ſo promiſing, but who had walked carefully, now outſtripped them.

                  <p>MRS. JONES was a great merchant's lady. She was liberal to the poor, but as ſhe was too much taken up with the world, ſhe did not ſpare ſo much of her time and thoughts about doing good as ſhe ought, ſo that her money was often ill beſtowed. In the late troubles, Mr. Jones, who had lived in a grand manner, failed, and he took his misfortunes ſo much to heart that he fell ſick and died. Mrs. Jones retired on a very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row income to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> ſmall village of Weſton, where ſhe ſeldom went out except to church. Though a pious woman ſhe was too apt to indulge her ſorrow; and tho' ſhe did not neglect to read and pray, yet ſhe gave up a great part of her time to melancholy thoughts, and grew quite inactive. She well knew how ſinful it would be for her to ſeek a cure for her grief in worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which is a way many people take under afflictions, but ſhe was not aware how wrong it was to weep away that time which might have been better ſpent in drying the tears of others.</p>
                  <p>It was happy for her that Mr. Simpſon, the vicar of Weſton, was a pious man. One Sunday he happened to preach upon the good Samaritan. It was a charity ſermon, and there was a collection at the door. He called on Mrs. Jones after church, and found her in tears. She told him ſhe had been much moved by his diſcourſe, and ſhe wept becauſe ſhe had ſo little to give
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:035296_0256_1001A3B607C72A48"/>to the plate; for though ſhe felt very keenly for the poor in theſe dear times, yet ſhe could not aſſiſt them. "Indeed fir," added ſhe, "I never ſo much regretted the loſs of my fortune, as this afternoon, when you bade us <hi>go and do likewiſe."</hi> "You do not," replied Mr. Simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, "enter into the ſpirit of our Saviour's parable, if you think you cannot <hi>go and do likewiſe</hi> without being rich. In the caſe of the Samaritan you may obſerve, that charity was afforded more by kindneſs, and care, and medicine, than by money. You, Madam, were as much concerned in my ſermon, as Sir John with his great eſtate; and, to ſpeak plainly, I have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſurpiſed that you ſhould not put yourſelf in the way of being more uſeful."</p>
                  <p>"Sir," ſaid Mrs. Jones, "I am grown ſhy of the poor ſince I have nothing to give them." "Nothing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam," replied the clergyman, "do you call your time, your talents, your kind offices nothing? I will venture to ſay that you might do more good than the richeſt man in the pariſh could do by merely giving his money. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſitting here, brooding over your misfortunes, which are paſt remedy, beſtir yourſelf to find out ways of doing much good with little money; or even without any money at all. You have lately ſtudied oeconomy for yourſelf. Inſtruct your poor neighbors in it. They want it almoſt as much as they want money. You have influence with the few rich perſons in the pariſh. Exert that influence. Betty, my houſekeeper, ſhall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt you in any thing in which ſhe can be uſeful. Try this for one year, and if you then tell me that you ſhould have better ſhewn your love to God and man, and been a happier woman had you continued gloomy and inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, I ſhall be much ſurpriſed."</p>
                  <p>The ſermon and this diſcourſe made ſo deep an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on Mrs. Jones, that ſhe formed a new plan of life, and ſet about it at once, as every body does who is in earneſt. Her chief arm was the happineſs of her poor
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:035296_0257_1001C25E68FFBA40"/>neighbors in the next world; but ſhe was alſo very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to promote their preſent comfort. The plans ſhe purſued with a view to the latter object ſhall be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this little book. Mrs. Jones was much reſpect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d by all the rich perſons in Weſton who had known her in her proſperity. Sir John was thoughtleſs, laviſh, and indolent. The 'Squire was over-frugal, but active, ſober, and not ill-natured. Sir John loved pleaſure, the 'Squire loved money. Sir John was one of thoſe popular ſort of people who get much praiſe and yet do little good; who ſubſcribe with equal readineſs to a cricket match or a charity ſchool; who take it for granted that the poor are to be indulged with bell-ringing and bonfires, and to be made drunk at Chriſtmas; this Sir John called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kind to them; but he thought it was folly to teach them, and madneſs to think of reforming them.—He was, however, always ready to give his guinea; but I queſtion whether he would have given up his hunting and his gaining to have cured every grievance in the land. On the other hand, the 'Squire would aſſiſt Mrs. Jones in any of her plans if it coſt him nothing; ſo ſhe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her good ſenſe by never aſking Sir John for advice, or the 'Squire for ſubſcriptions, and by this prudence gained the full ſupport of both.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Jones reſolved to ſpend two or three days in a week in getting acquainted with the ſtate of the pariſh, and ſhe took care never to walk out without a few little good books in her pocket to give away. She found that among the numerous wants ſhe met with, no ſmall ſhare was owing to bad management or to indiſpoſition. She was ſtruck with the ſmall ſize of the loaves. Wheat was now not very dear, and ſhe was ſure a good deal of blame reſted with the baker. She ſent for a ſhilling loaf to the next great town where the mayor often ſent to the bakers' ſtops to ſee that the bread was prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ry loaf, and found the latter two pounds lighter than it
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:035296_0258_1001C26325FAEE50"/>ought to be. This was not the ſort of grievance to carry to Sir John; but luckily the 'Squire was alſo a magiſtrate, and it was quite in his way. He told her he could remedy the evil if ſome one would lodge the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation againſt the baker.</p>
                  <p>She dropt in on the blackſmith. He was at dinner. She enquired if his bread was good. "Aye, good enough miſtreſs, for you ſee 'tis as white as your cap, if we had but more of it. Here's a ſixpenny loaf, you might take it for a penny roll!" He then heartily curſed Crib the the baker and ſaid he ought to be hanged. Mrs. Jones now told him what ſhe had done, how ſhe had detected the fraud, and aſſured him the evil ſhould be redreſſed on the morrow, provided he would appear and inform. "I inform!" ſaid he with a ſhocking oath, "hang an informer! I ſcorn the office." "You are nice in the wrong place, friend," replied Mrs. Jones, "for you do not ſcorn to abuſe the baker, nor to be in a paſſion, nor to ſwear, though you ſcorn to redreſs a public injury, and to increaſe your children's bread. Let me tell you, there is nothing in which you ignorant people miſtake more than in your notions about <hi>informers.</hi> Informing is the lawful way of obtaining redreſs, and though it is a miſchievous and a hateful thing to go to a juſtice about every trifling matter, yet laying an information on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant occaſions, without malice or bitterneſs of any kind, is what no honeſt man ought to be aſhamed of.—The ſhame is to commit the offence, not to inform a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. I, for my part, ſhould p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rhaps do right if I not only informed againſt Crib for making light bread, but againſt you for ſwearing at him." "Well but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam," ſaid the ſmith, a little ſoftened, "don't you think it a ſin and a ſhame to turn informer?" "So far from it when a man's motives are good," ſaid Mrs. Jones, "that in ſuch clear caſes as the preſent, I think it a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and a virtue. If it is right that there ſhould be laws, it muſt be right that they ſhould be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:035296_0259_1001C26863916090"/>but how can this be, if people will not inform the magiſtrates when they ſee the laws broken? An informer by trade is commonly a knave; a raſh, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, or paſtionate informer is a fire-brand, but honeſt and prudent informers are almoſt as uſeful members of ſociety as the judges of the land. If you continue in your preſent mind on this ſubject, do not you think that you will be anſwerable for the crimes you might have prevented by informing, and be a ſort of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice of the villains who commit them?"</p>
                  <p>"Well madam," ſaid the ſmith, "I now ſee plainly enough, that there is no ſhame in turning informer when my cauſe is good." "And your motive right, always mind that," ſaid Mrs. Jones. Next day the ſmith attended, Crib was fined in the uſual penalty, his light bread was taken from him, and given to the poor. The juſtices reſolved henceforward to inſpect the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in their diſtrict; and all of them, except Crib, and ſuch as Crib, were glad of it, for honeſty never dreads a trial. Thus had Mrs. Jones the comfort of ſeeing how uſeful people may be without expence; for if ſhe could have given the poor 50 <abbr>l.</abbr> ſhe would not have done them ſo great or ſo laſting a benefit, and the true light in which ſhe had put the buſineſs of <hi>informing,</hi> was of no ſmall uſe.</p>
                  <p>There were two ſhops in the pariſh, but Mrs. Sparks at the Croſs had not half ſo much cuſtom as Wills at the Sugar Loaf, though ſhe ſold her goods a penny in a ſhilling cheaper, and all agreed that they were much better. Mrs. Jones aſked Mrs. Sparks the reaſon.—"Madam," ſaid the ſhop-keeper, "Mr. Wills will give longer truſt. Beſides this, his wife keeps ſhop on a Sunday morning while I am at Church." Mrs. Jones reminded Mr. Simpſon to read the King's proclamation againſt vice and immorality next Sunday at Church, and prevailed on the 'Squire to fine any one who ſhould keep open ſhop on a Sunday. She alſo put the people
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:035296_0260_1001C26C736FE090"/>in mind that a ſhop-keeper, who would ſell on a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, would be more likely to cheat them all the week, than one who went to Church.</p>
                  <p>She alſo labored hard to convince them how much they would leſſen their diſtreſs if they would contrive to deal with Mrs. Sparks for ready money, rather than with Wills on long credit; thoſe who liſtened to her, found their circumſtances far more comfortable at the year's end, while the reſt, tempted, like ſome of their betters, by the pleaſure of putting off the evil day of payment, like them at laſt found themſelves plunged in debt and diſtreſs. She took care to make a good uſe of ſuch inſtances in her converſations with the poor, and by perſeverance, ſhe at length brought them ſo much to her way of thinking, that Wills found it to be his intereſt to alter his plan, and ſell his goods on as good terms and as ſhort credit as Mrs. Sparks ſold hers.—This compleated Mrs. Jones's ſucceſs, and ſhe had the ſatisfaction of having put a ſtop to three or four great evils in the pariſh of Weſton, without ſpending a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in doing it.</p>
                  <p>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They both told Mrs. Jones that the poor would get the coarſe pieces of meat cheaper, if the gentlefolks did not buy them for ſoups and gravy. Mrs. Jones thought there was reaſon in this. So away ſhe went to Sir John, the 'Squire, the Surgeon, the Attorney, and the Steward, the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the pariſh who could afford to buy coſtly things. She told them if they would all be ſo good as to buy only prime pieces, which they could very well afford, the coarſe and cheap joints would come more within the reach of the poor. Moſt of the gentry readily conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Sir John cared not what his meat coſt him, but told Mrs. Jones in his gay way, that he would eat any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or give any thing, ſo that ſhe would not teize him with long ſtories about the poor. The 'Squire

The Steward choſe to imitate the 'Squire; and the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney found it would be quite ungenteel to ſtand out. So gravy ſoups became very unfaſhionable in the pariſh of Weſton; and I am ſure if rich people did but think a little on this ſubject, they would be as unfaſhionable in many other places.</p>
                  <p>When wheat grew cheaper, Mrs. Jones was earneſt with the poor women to bake large brown loaves at home, inſtead of buying ſmall white ones at the ſhop. Mrs. Betty had told her that baking at home would be one ſtep towards reſtoring the good old management. Only Betty Smart and Jenny Roſe baked at home in the whole pariſh, and who lived ſo well as they did? Yet the general objection ſeemed reaſonable. They could not bake without yeaſt, which often could not be had, as no one brewed but the great folks and the public houſes. Mrs. Jones found, however, that Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ty and Jenny contrived to brew as well as to bake. She ſent for theſe women, knowing that from them ſhe could get truth and reaſon. "How comes it," ſaid ſhe to them, "that you two are the only poor women in the pariſh who can afford to brew a ſmall caſk of beer? Your hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands have not better wages than other men." "True Madam," ſaid Betty, "but they never ſet foot in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic houſe. I will tell you the truth. When I firſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, our John went to the Checquers every night, and I had my tea and freſh butter twice a day at home.—This ſlop, which conſumed a deal of ſugar, began to <hi>rake</hi> my ſtomach ſadly, as I had neither meat nor milk; at laſt (I am aſhamed to own it) I began to take a drop of gin to quiet the pain, till in time I looked for my gin as regularly as for my tea. At laſt the gin, the ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and the tea, began to make us both ſick and poor. I had like to have died with my firſt child.—Parſon Simpſon then talked ſo finely to us that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:035296_0262_1001C2746C75A720"/>by the grace of God, to turn over a new leaf, and I promiſed John if he would give up the Checquers I would break the gin-bottle, and never drink tea in the afternoon, except on Sundays when he was at home with me. We have kept our word, and both our eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking, our health and our conſciences are the better for it. Though meat is ſadly dear, we can buy two pounds of freſh meat for leſs than one pound of freſh butter, and it gives five times the nouriſhment.—And dear as malt is, I contrive to keep a drop of drink in the houſe for John, and John will make me drink half a pint with him every evening, and a pint a day when I am a nurſe."</p>
                  <p>As one good deed as well as one bad one brings on another, this converſation ſet Mrs. Jones on enquiring why ſo many ale-houſes were allowed. She did not chuſe to talk to Sir John on this ſubject, who would only have ſaid, "let them enjoy themſelves poor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; if they get drunk now and then they work hard." But thoſe who have this falſe good-nature, forget, that while the man is <hi>enjoying himſelf,</hi> as it is called, his wife and children are ragged and ſtarving. True chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian good-nature never indulges one at the coſt of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but is kind to all. The 'Squire, who was a friend to order, took up the matter. He conſulted Mr. Simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. "The Lion," ſaid he, "is neceſſary. It ſtands by the road ſide: travellers muſt have a reſting place. As to the Checquers and the Bell they do no good but much harm." Mr. Simpſon had before made many at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to get the Checquers put down; but unluckily, it was Sir John's own houſe, and kept by his late butler. Not that Sir John valued the rent, but he had a falſe kindneſs which made him ſupport the cauſe of an old ſervant, though he knew he kept a diſorderly houſe.—The 'Squire, however, now took away the licence from the Bell. And a fray happening ſoon after at the Checquers (which was near the Church) in time of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:035296_0263_1001C277C87AEDD0"/>ſervice, Sir John was obliged to ſuffer the houſe to be put down as a nuiſance. You would not believe how many poor families were able to brew a little caſk when the temptations of thoſe ale-houſes were taken out of their way. Mrs. Jones, in her evening walks, had the pleaſure to ſee many an honeſt man drinking his wholeſome cup of beer by his own fire ſide, his roſy children playing about his knees, his clean, cheerful wife ſinging h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some few, I am ſorry to ſay, though I don't chuſe to name names, ſtill preferred getting drunk once a week at the Lion, and drinking water at other times.</p>
                  <p>The good women being now ſupplied with yeaſt from each other's brewings, would have baked, but two difficulties ſtill remained. Many of them had no ovens, for ſince the new bad management had crept in, many cottages have been built without this convenience. Fuel was alſo ſcarce at Weſton. Mrs. Jones adviſed the building a large pariſh oven. To this oven, at a certain h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>, three times a week, the elder children carried the loaves which their mothers had made at home, and paid a half-penny, or a penny, according to their ſize, for the baking.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Jones found that no poor woman in Weſton could buy a little milk, as the farmers' wives did not care to rob their dairies.—This was a great diſtreſs, eſpecially when the children were ſick. So Mrs. Jones adviſed Mrs. Sparks at the Croſs, to keep a couple of cows, and ſell out the milk at half-penny worths. She did ſo, and found, that though this plan gave her ſome additional trouble, ſhe got full as much by it as if ſhe had made cheeſe and butter. She alſo ſold rice at a cheap rate, ſo that with the help of the milk and the public oven, a fine rice pudding was to be had for a trifle.</p>

The girls' ſchool in the pariſh was fallen into ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, for though many would be ſubſcribers, yet no one would look after it. I wiſh this was the caſe at Weſton only. It was not in Mr. Simpſon's way to ſee if girls were taught to work. This is ladies' buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Mrs. Jones conſulted her counſellor, Mrs. Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and they went every Friday to the ſchool, where they invited mothers as well as daughters to come, and learn to cut out to the beſt advantage. Mrs. Jones had not been bred to theſe things, but by means of Mrs. Cooper's excellent cutting out book, ſhe ſoon became miſtreſs of the whole art. She not only had the girls taught to make and mend, but to waſh andiron too. She alſo allowed the mother or eldeſt daughter of every family to come once a week and learn how to dreſs <hi>one cheap diſh.</hi> One Friday, which was cooking day, who ſhould paſs by but the 'Squire, with his gun and his dogs.— He looked into the ſchool for the firſt time. "Well, madam," ſaid he, "what good are you doing here?— What are you girls learning and earning? Where are your manufactures? Where is your ſpinning and your carding?" "Sir," ſaid ſhe, "this is a ſmall pariſh, and you know ours is not a manufacturing country; ſo that when theſe girls are women, they will not be much employed in ſpinning. However, we teach them a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of it, and more of knitting, that they may be able to get up a ſmall piece of houſehold linen once a year, and provide the family with ſtockings, by employing the odds and ends of their time in theſe ways. But there is a manufacture which I am carrying on, and I know of none within my own reach which is ſo valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble." "What can that be," ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I am teaching theſe girls the art of induſtry and good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement. It is little encouragement to an honeſt man to work hard all the week, if his wages are waſted by

"Sir," replied Mrs. Jones, "I have lately got ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Mrs. White, who has given us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her cheap diſhes, and wiſe cookery, in one of the cheap Repoſitory little books. Mrs. Betty and I have made all her diſhes, and very good they are, and we have got ſeveral others of our own. Every Friday we come here and dreſs one. Theſe good women ſee how it is done, and learn to dreſs it at their own houſes. I take home part for my own dinner, and what is left I give to each in turn. I hope I have opened their eyes on a ſad miſtake they had got into, <hi>that we think any thing is good enough for the poor."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Pray, Mrs. Betty," ſaid the Squire, "oblige me with a baſon of your ſoup." The Squire found it ſo good after his walk, that he was almoſt ſorry he had promiſed to buy no more legs of beef, and declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that not one ſheep's head ſhould ever go to his kennel again. He begged his cook might have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, and Mrs. Jones wrote it out for her. She has alſo been ſo obliging as to favor me with a copy of all her receipts. And as I hate all monopoly, and ſee no reaſon why ſuch cheap, nouriſhing, and ſavoury diſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſhould be confined to the pariſh of Weſton, I print them that all other pariſhes may have the ſame advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Not only the poor, but all perſons with ſmall incomes may be glad of them. "Well, madam," ſaid Mr. Simpſon, who came in ſoon after, "which is beſt, to ſit down and cry over our misfortunes, or to beſtir ourſelves to do our duty in the world?" "Sir," repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mrs. Jones, "I thank you for the uſeful leſſon you have given me. You have taught me that our time and talents are to be employed with zeal in God's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, if we wiſh for his favour here or hereafter, and that one great employment of them, which he requires,

It is ſomething gained to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue children from idling away their ſabbath in the fields or the ſtreets. It is no ſmall thing to keep them from thoſe tricks to which a day of leiſure tempts the idle and the ignorant.

                     <head>ON RECOMMENDATIONS.</head>
                     <p>Mrs. Jones had one talent that eminently qualified her to do good, namely, judgment; this even in the gay part of her life had kept her from many miſtakes, but though ſhe had ſometimes been deceived herſelf, ſhe was very careful not to deceive others, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending people to fill any office either through ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or falſe kindneſs. She uſed to ſay, "there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſome one appropriate quality which every perſon muſt poſſeſs, in order to fit them for any particular em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:035296_0269_1001C294E4721400"/>Even in this quality," ſaid ſhe to Mr. Simpſon, the clergyman, "I do not expect perfection; but if they are deſtitute of this, whatever good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they may poſſeſs beſides, though they may do for ſome other employment, they will not do for this. If I want a pair of ſhoes, I go to a ſhoemaker; I do not go to a man of another trade however ingenious he may be, to aſk him if he cannot <hi>contrive</hi> to make me a pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r of ſhoes. When I lived in London, I learnt to be much on my guard as to recommendations. I found people often wanted to impoſe on me ſome one who was a burthen to themſelves. Once I remember when I undertook to get a matron for an hoſpital, half my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance had ſome one to offer me. Mrs. Gibſon ſent me an old cook whom ſhe herſelf had diſcharged for waſting her own proviſions, yet ſhe had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to recommend this woman to take care of the proviſions of a large community. Mrs. Grey ſent me a diſcarded houſekeeper whoſe conſtitution had been ruined by ſitting up with Mrs. Grey's gouty huſband, but who ſhe yet thought might do well enough to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the fatigue of taking care of an hundred poor ſick people. A third friend ſent me a woman who had no merit but that of being very poor, and it would be charity to provide for her. The truth is, the lady was obliged to allow her a ſmall penſion till ſhe could get her off her own hands by turning her on thoſe of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers."</p>
                     <p>"It is very true madam," ſaid Mr. Simpſon, "the right way is always to prefer the good of the many to the good of one; if indeed it can be called doing good to any one to place them in a ſtation in which they muſt feel unhappy, by not knowing how to diſcharge the duties of it. I will tell you how I manage. If the perſons recommended are objects of charity, I private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubſcribe to their wants; I pity and help them, but I never promote them to a ſtation for which they are
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:035296_0270_1001C29C19BA6148"/>unfit, and thus hurt a whole community to help a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed individual."</p>
                     <p>Thus Mrs. Jones reſolved, that the firſt ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſetting up her ſchool ſhould be to provide a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able miſtreſs. The veſtry were ſo earneſt in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending one woman that ſhe thought it worth looking into. On enquiry, ſhe found it was a ſcheme to take a large family off the pariſh; they never conſidered that a very ignorant woman, with a family of young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, was not fit for a ſchool, all they conſidered was that the profits of the ſchool might enable her to live without pariſh pay. Mrs. Jones refuſed another, tho' ſhe could read well and was decent in her conduct, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe uſed to ſend her children to the ſhop on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days. And ſhe objected to a third, a very ſenſible wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, becauſe ſhe was ſuſpected of making an outward profeſſion of religion a cloak for immoral conduct.— Mrs. Jones knew ſhe muſt not be too nice neither, ſhe knew ſhe muſt put up wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h many faults at laſt.— "I know," ſaid ſhe to Mr. Simpſon, "the imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every thing that is human. As the miſtreſs will have much to bear with from the children, ſo I expect to have ſomething to bear with in the miſtreſs, and ſhe and I muſt ſubmit to our reſpective trials, by thinking how much God has to bear with in us all. But there are three things which a miſtreſs muſt not be without, <hi>good-ſenſe, activity,</hi> and <hi>piety.</hi> Without the firſt ſhe will miſlead others, without the ſecond ſhe will neglect them, and without the third, though ſhe may civilize, yet ſhe will never chriſtianize them."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Simpſon ſaid, "he really knew but of one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the pariſh who was fully likely to anſwer her purpoſe: this," continued he "is no other than my houſe-keeper, Mrs. Betty Crew. It will indeed be a great loſs to me to part from her; and to her it will be a far more fatiguing life than ſhe at preſent leads. But ought I to put my own perſonal comfort, or ought
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:035296_0271_1001C2A148AC90D8"/>Betty to put her own eaſe and quiet in competition with the good of above an hundred children? This will appear ſtill more important if we conſider the good done, not as <hi>fruit</hi> but <hi>ſeed;</hi> if we take into the account how many yet unborn may become chriſtians, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of our making theſe children chriſtians. For how can we calculate the number which may be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after trained for heaven, by thoſe very children we are going to teach, when they themſelves ſhall become pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and you and I are dead and forgotten? To be ſure, by parting from Betty, my peaſe ſoup will not be quite ſo well flavored, nor my linen ſo neatly got up; but the day is faſt approaching when all this will ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy but little; but it will not ſignify a little whether one hundred immortal ſouls were the better from my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this petty ſacrifice. Betty Crew is a real chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, has excellent ſenſe, and had a good education from my mother. She has alſo had a little ſort of train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for when the poor children come to the parſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age for the broth on a Saturday evening, Betty is uſed to appoint them all to come at the ſame time, and after ſhe has filled their pitchers, ſhe ranges them round her in the garden, and examines them in their catechiſm. She is juſt and fair in dealing out the broth and beef, not making my favour to the parents depend on the ſkill of their children. But her own old caps, and rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons, and caſt off cloaths, are beſtowed as little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on the beſt ſcholars. So that taking the time ſhe ſpends in working for them, and the things ſhe gives them, there is many a lady who does not exceed Betty in acts of charity; this I mention to confirm your notion, that it is not neceſſary to be rich in order to do good; a religious upper ſervant has great opportunities of this ſort."</p>

                                 <p>My good women, on Sunday next I propoſe to open a ſchool for the inſtruction of your children.— Thoſe among you who know what it is to be able to read your Bible will, I doubt not, rejoice that the ſame bleſſing is hold out to your children. You who are <hi>not</hi> able yourſelves to read what your Saviour has done and ſuffered for you, ought to be doubly anxious that your children ſhould reap a bleſſing which you have loſt.— Would not that mother be thought an unnatural mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter who ſhould ſtand by and ſnatch out of her child's mouth the bread which a kind friend had juſt put into it? But ſuch a mother would be merciful compared with her who ſhould rob her children of the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of learning to read the word of God when it is held out to them. Remember, that if you ſlight the preſent offer, or if after having ſent your children a few times you ſhould afterwards keep them at home under vain pretences, you will have to anſwer for it at the day of judgment. Let not your poor children <hi>then</hi> have cauſe to ſay, "my fond mother was my worſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy. I might have been bred up in the fear of the Lord, and ſhe oppoſed it for the ſake of a little paltry pleaſure, for an idle holiday, I am now brought to the gates of hell." My dear women, which of you could bear to ſee your darling child condemned to everlaſting deſtruction? which of you could bear to hear him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe you as the cauſe of it? Is there any mother here preſent who will venture to ſay, 'I will doom the child I bore to ſin and hell, rather than put them or myſelf to a little preſent pain by curtailing their evil inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I will let them ſpend the Sabbath in ignorance and idleneſs inſtead of ſending them to ſchool!' Let
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:035296_0273_1001C2ACA3FC6ED0"/>that mother who values her child's pleaſure more than his ſoul now walk away, and I will ſet down the names of all thoſe who wiſh to bring their young ones up in the way that leads to eternal life, inſtead of indulging them in the pleaſures of ſin which are but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     <p>When Mrs. Jones had done ſpeaking, moſt of the women thanked her for her good advice, and hoped that God would give them grace to follow it; promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſend their children conſtantly. Others, who were not ſo well diſpoſed, were yet afraid to refuſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſin of ſo doing had been ſo plainly ſet before them. The worſt of the women had kept away from this meeting, reſolving to ſet their faces againſt the ſchool. Moſt of them who were preſent, as ſoon as they got home ſet about providing their children with what little decent apparel they could raiſe. Many a willing mother lent her tall daughter her hat, beſt cap, and white handkerchief, and many a grateful father ſpared his linen waiſtcoat and better moſt hat to induce his grown up ſon to attend: for it was a rule with wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Mrs. Jones was very deſirous of getting the help and countenance of the farmers and trades-people, whoſe duty ſhe thought it was to ſupport a plan calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to improve the virtue and happineſs of the pariſh. Moſt of them ſubſcribed, and promiſed to ſee that
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:035296_0274_1001C2B4EA5F9860"/>their workmen ſent their children. She met with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle oppoſition till ſhe called on farmer Hoſkins. She told him as he was the richeſt farmer in the pariſh, ſhe came to him for a handſome ſubſcription. "Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!" ſaid he, "it is nothing but ſubſcriptions I think; a man had need be made of money." "Farmer," ſaid Mrs. Jones, "God has bleſſed you with abundant pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and he expects you ſhould be liberal in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your great ability." "I do not know what you mean by bleſſing," ſaid he; "I have been up early and late, lived hard while I had little, and now when I thought I had got forward in the world, what with tythes and ſubſcriptions it all goes I think." "Mr. Hoſkins," ſaid Mrs. Jones, "this is but an ungrateful return for all your bleſſings." "You are again at your bleſſings," ſaid the Farmer, "but let every one work as hard as I have done and I dare ſay he will do as well. It is to my own induſtry I owe what I have. My crops have been good becauſe I minded my ploughing and ſowing." "Oh, farmer!" cried Mrs. Jones, "you forget whoſe ſuns and ſhowers make your crops to grow; but I do not come here to preach but to beg." "Well, madam, what is it now?

"I am going to eſtabliſh a Sunday ſchool, farmer, and I come to you as one of the principal inhabitants, hoping your example will ſpur on the reſt to give." "Why then," ſaid the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, "as one of the principal inhabitan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s, I will give nothing, hoping it will ſpur on the reſt to refuſe. Of all the fooliſh inventions, and new fangled devices to ruin the country, that of teaching the poor to read is the very worſt." "And I, farmer, think that to teach good principles to the lower claſſes is the moſt likely way to ſave the country. Now in order to this we muſt teach them to read," "Not with my conſent nor
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:035296_0275_1001C2BEB08687F8"/>my money," ſaid the farmer, "for I know it always does more harm than good." "So it may," ſaid Mrs. Jones, "if you only teach them to read and then turn them adrift to find out books for themſelves. There is a proneneſs in the heart to evil which it is our duty to counteract, and which I ſee you are promoting. Only look round your own kitchen, I am aſhamed to ſee it hung round with looſe ſongs and ballads. I grant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it would be better for your men and maids, and even your daughters, not to be able to read at all than to read ſuch ſtuff as this. But if when they aſk for bread you will give them a ſtone, nay worſe, a ſerpent, yours is the blame." Then taking up a penny book which had a very looſe title, ſhe went on, "I do not wonder if you, who read ſuch books as theſe, think it ſafer that people ſhould not read at all." The farmer grinned, and ſaid "it is hard if a man of my ſubſtance may not divert myſelf; when a bit of fun coſts only a penny, and a man can ſpare that penny, there is no harm done. When it is very hot, or very wet, and I come in to reſt and have drank my mug of cider, I like to take up a bit of a jeſt book or a comical ſtory to make me laugh." "Oh, Mr. Hoſkins," replied Mrs. Jones, "when you come in to reſt from a burning ſun or ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, do you never think of him whoſe ſun it is that is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening your corn? or whoſe ſhower is filling the ear or cauſing the graſs to grow? I could tell you of ſome books which would ſtrengthen ſuch thoughts, whereas ſuch as you read only ſerve to put them out of your head." Mrs. Jones having taken pains to let Mr. Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins know, that all the genteel and wealthy people had ſubſcribed, he at laſt ſaid, "Why, as to the matter of that I do not value a crown; only I think it might be better beſtowed, and I am afraid my own workmen will fly in my face if once they are made ſcholars, and that they will think themſelves too good to work."—"Now "Now you talk ſoberly and give your reaſons," ſaid
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:035296_0276_1001A3C61D413E18"/>Mrs. Jones, "weak as they are, they deſerve an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Do you think that either man, woman, or child ever did his duty the worſe, only becauſe he knew it the better?" "No, perhaps not." "Now the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of learning which we intend to give the poor, is only to enable them to read the Bible, a book in which every duty is explained, every doctrine brought into practice, and the brighteſt truths made level to the meaneſt underſtanding. The knowledge of that book and its practical influence on the heart is the beſt ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity you can have both for the induſtry and obedience of your ſervants. Now can you think any man will be the worſe ſervant for being a good chriſtian?" "Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not." "Are not the duties of children, of ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and the poor expreſsly ſet forth in the Bible?"—"Yes." "Do you think any duties are likely to be ſo well performed from any human motives, ſuch as fear or prudence, as from theſe religious motives which are backed with the ſanctions of rewards and puniſhments, of heaven or hell? Even upon your own principles of worldly policy, do you think a poor man is not leſs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſteal a ſheep or a horſe, who was taught when a boy, that it was a ſin to rob a hen rooſt or an orchard? Will your property be ſecured ſo effectually by the ſtocks on the green, as by teaching the boys in the ſchool, that <hi>for all theſe things God will bring them into judgment?</hi> Is a poor fellow who can read his Bible ſo likely to ſleep or to drink away his few hours of leiſure as one who <hi>cannot</hi> read? He may, and he often does make a bad uſe of his reading, but I doubt he would have been as bad without it. And the hours ſpent in learning to read will always have been among the moſt harmleſs ones of his life."</p>
                     <p>"Well madam," ſaid the farmer, "if you do not think that religion will ſpoil my young ſervants, I do not care if you do put me down for half a guinea. What has farmer Dobſon given?" "Half a guinea," ſaid
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:035296_0277_1001C2C91F8EA0E8"/>Mrs. Jones. "Well," cried the farmer, "it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſaid I did not give more than he, who is only a renter. Dobſon give half a guinea? Why he wears his coat as thread-bare as a laborer." "Perhaps," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Mrs. Jones, "that is one reaſon why he gives ſo much." "Well, put me down a guinea," cried the farmer. "As ſcarce as guineas are juſt now, I'll never be put upon the ſame footing with Dobſon nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther." "Yes, and you muſt exert yourſelf beſides in inſiſting that your workmen ſend their children, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten look into the ſchool yourſelf to ſee if they are there, and reward or diſcourage them accordingly," added Mrs. Jones, as ſhe took her leave. The farmer inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in waiting on her to the door. When they got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the yard, they ſpied Mr. Simpſon, who was ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near a little group of females, conſiſting of the farmer's two young daughters, and a couple of roſy dairy maids, and old blind fidler, and a woman who led him. The woman had laid a baſket on the ground, out of which ſhe was dealing ſome ſongs to the girls, who were kneeling round it, and eagerly picking out ſuch whoſe titles ſuited their taſtes. On ſeeing the clergyman come up, the fiddler's companion (for I am ſorry to ſay ſhe was not his wife) puſhed ſome of the ſongs to the bottom of the baſket, turned round to the company, and in a whining tone, aſked "if they would pleaſe to buy a godly book." Mr. Simpſon ſaw thro' the hypocriſy at once, and inſtead of making any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, took out of one of the girl's hands, a ſong which the woman had not been able to ſnatch away. He was ſhocked and grieved to ſee that theſe young girls were about to read, to ſing, and to learn by heart ſuch rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aldry, as he was aſhamed even to caſt his eyes on. He turned about to the girl and gravely, but mildly ſaid, "young woman, what do you think ſhould be done to a perſon who ſhould be found carrying a box of poiſon round the country, and leaving a little at every houſe?".
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:035296_0278_1001C2D1DF53A358"/>The girls all agreed that ſuch a perſon ought to be hanged; "that the ſhould," ſaid the farmer, "if I was upon the jury." The fiddler and his woman were of the ſame opinion, declaring <hi>they</hi> would not do ſuch a wicked thing for the world, for if they were poor they were honeſt. Mr. Simpſon, turning to the other girl, ſaid, "which is of moſt value, the ſoul or the body?" "The ſoul ſir;" ſaid the girl. "Why ſo?" ſaid he, "becauſe ſir, I have heard you ſay in the pulpit, the ſoul is to laſt for ever." Then cried Mr. Simpſon, in a ſtern voice, turning to the fiddler's woman, "are not you aſhamed to ſell poiſon for that part which is to laſt for ever? poiſon for the ſoul?" "Poiſon!" ſaid the terrified girl, throwing down the book, and ſhudder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as people do who are afraid they have touched ſomething infectious. "Poiſon!" echoed the farmer's daughters, recollecting with horror the ratſbane which Lion, the old houſe dog had got at the day before, and after eating which, they had ſeen him drop down dead in convulſions. "Yes," ſaid Mr. Simpſon to the woman, "I do again repeat, the ſouls of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent girls will be poiſoned, and may be eternally ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined by this vile traſh which you carry about."</p>
                     <p>"I now ſee," ſaid Mrs. Jones to the farmer, "the reaſon why you think learning to read does more harm than good. It is indeed far better that they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know how to tell a letter, unleſs you keep ſuch traſh as this out of their way, and provide them with what is good or what is harmleſs. Still this is not the fault of reading, but the abuſe of it. Wine is ſtill a good cordial, though it is too often abuſed to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of drunkenneſs.</p>
                     <p>The farmer ſaid that neither of his maids could read their horn book, though he owned he often heard them ſinging that ſong which the parſon had thought ſo bad, but for his part it made him as merry as a nightingale.</p>
                     <p>"Yes," ſaid Mrs. Jones, "as a proof that it is not
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:035296_0279_1001A3C8065BCEC0"/>merely being able to read which does the miſchief. I have often heard as I have been croſſing a hay-field, young girls ſinging ſuch indecent ribaldry as has driven me out of the field, though I well knew they could not read a line of what they were ſinging, but had caught it from others. So you ſee you may as well ſay the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is a wicked talent becauſe ſome people miſapply it, as to ſay that reading is dangerous, becauſe ſome folks abuſe it."</p>
                     <p>While they were talking, the fiddler and his woman were trying to ſteal away, but Mr. Simpſon ſtopped them and ſaid, "woman, I ſhall have ſome farther talk with you. I am a magiſtrate as well as a miniſter, and if I know it, I will no more allow a wicked book to be ſold in my pariſh than a doſe of poiſon." The girls threw away all their ſongs, thanked Mr. Simpſon, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Mrs. Jones would take them into her ſchool after the had done milking in the evenings, that they might learn to read only what was proper. They promiſed they would never more deal with any but ſober, honeſt hawkers, ſuch as ſell good little books, chriſtmas car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rols, and harmleſs ſongs, and deſired the ſiddler's wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man never to call there again.</p>
                     <p>This little incident afterwards confirmed Mrs. Jones in a plan ſhe had before ſome thoughts of putting in practice. This was, after her ſchool had been es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed a few months, to invite all the well-diſpoſed grown-up youth of the pariſh to meet her at the ſchool an hour or two on a Sunday evening, after the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry buſineſs of the dairy and of ſerving the cattle was over. Both Mrs. Jones and her agent had the talent of making this time paſs ſo agreeably by their manner of explaining ſcripture, and of impreſſing the heart by ſerious and affectionate diſcourſe, that in a ſhort time the evening ſchool was nearly filled with a ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany after the younger ones were diſmiſſed. In time, not only the ſervants, but the ſons and daughters of
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:035296_0280_1001C2DAAB9C90E8"/>the moſt ſubſtantial people in the pariſh attended. At length, many of the parents, pleaſed with the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo viſible in the young people, got a habit of drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in, that they might learn how to inſtruct their own families. And it was obſerved that as the ſchool filled, not only the fives-court and public houſe were thinned, but even Sunday goſſiping and tea viſiting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined. Even Farmer Hoſkins, who was at firſt angry with his maids for learning of thoſe <hi>merry</hi> ſongs as he called them, was ſo pleaſed by the manner in which the pſalms were ſung at the ſchool, that he promiſed Mrs. Jones to make her a preſent of half a ſheep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her firſt May-day feaſt. Of this feaſt ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſhall be given hereafter, and the reader may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſome further account of the Sunday School next month in the Hiſtory of Heſter Wilmot.</p>

                  <head>THE HISTORY OF HESTER WILMOT; OR, THE SECOND PART OF THE <hi>SUNDAY SCHOOL.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>HESTER WILMOT was born in the pariſh of Weſton, of parents who maintained themſelves
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:035296_0281_1001C2DF95C6F380"/>by their labor, they were both of them ungodly, it is no wonder therefore they were unhappy. They lived badly together, and how could they do otherwiſe, for their tempers were very different, and they had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to ſmooth down this difference, or to teach them that they ought to bear with each other's faults. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca Wilmot was a proof that people may have ſome right qualities, and yet be but bad characters. She was clean, notable, and induſtrious. Now I know ſome folks fancy that the poor who have theſe qualities, need have no other; but this is a ſad miſtake, as I am ſure every page in the Bible would ſhew; and it is a pity people do not conſult it oftener. Rebecca was of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent ungovernable temper; and that very neatneſs which is in itſelf ſo pleaſing, in her became a ſin, for her affection to her huſband and children was quite loſt in an over anxious deſire to have her houſe reckoned the niceſt in the pariſh. Rebecca was alſo a proof that a poor woman may be as vain as a rich one, for it was not ſo much the comfort of neatneſs, as the praiſe of neatneſs which ſhe coveted. A ſpot on her hearth, or a bit of ruſt on a braſs candleſtick would throw her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a violent paſſion. Now it is very right to keep the hearth clean and the candleſtick bright, but it is very wrong ſo to ſet one's affections on a hearth or a candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick as to make oneſelf unhappy if any trifling accident happens to them; and if Rebecca had been as careful to keep her heart without ſpot or her life without blem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, as ſhe was to keep her fire-irons free from either, ſhe would have been held up in this hiſtory, not as a warning, but a pattern, and in that caſe her nicety would have come in for a part of the praiſe. It was no fault in Rebecca but a merit, that her oak table was ſo bright you could almoſt ſee to put your cap on init; but it was no merit but a fault that when John, her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, laid down his cup of beer upon it ſo as to leave a mark, ſhe would fly out into ſo terrible a paſſion that
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:035296_0282_1001C2E3C3ECD648"/>all the children were forced to run to corners; now poor John having no corner to run to, ran to the al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>-houſe, till that which was at firſt a refuge, too ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Rebecca never wiſhed her children to learn to read becauſe ſhe ſaid it would only ſerve to make them lazy, and ſhe herſelf had done very well without it. She would keep poor Heſter from church to ſtone the ſpace under the chairs in fine patterns and whim-whams. I don't pretend to ſay there was any harm in this little decoration, it looks pretty enough, and it is better to let the children do that than do nothing. But ſtill theſe are not things to ſet one's heart upon, and beſides, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca only did it as a trap for praiſe; for ſhe was ſulky, and diſappointed if any ladies happened to call in and did not ſeem delighted with the flowers which ſhe uſed to draw with a burnt ſtick on the white waſh of the chimney corners. Beſides all this finery was often done on a Sunday, and there is a great deal of harm in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right things at a wrong time, or in waſting much time on things which are of no real uſe, or in doing any thing at all out of vanity. Now I beg that no lazy ſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of a wife will go and take any comfort in her dirt from what is here ſaid againſt Rebecca's nicety; for I believe that for one who makes her huſband unhappy through neatneſs, twenty do ſo by dirt and lazineſs.—All exceſſes are wrong, but the exceſs of a good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not ſo common as the exceſs of a bad one.</p>
                  <p>John Wilmot was not an ill-natured man, but he had no fixed principle. Inſtead of ſetting himſelf to cure his wife's faults by mild reproof and a good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he was driven by them into ſtill greater faults him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. It is a common caſe with people who have no religion, when any croſs accident befals them, inſtead of trying to make the beſt of a bad matter, inſtead of conſidering their trouble as a trial ſent from God to purify them, or inſtead of conſidering the faults of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:035296_0283_1001C2E8F3860870"/>as a puniſhment for their own ſins, what do they do but either ſink down at once into deſpair, or elſe run for comfort into evil courſes. Drinking is the common remedy for ſorrow, if that can be called a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, the end of which is to deſtroy ſoul and body.—John now began to ſpend all his leiſure hours at the Bell. He uſed to be fond of his children, but when he found he could not come home in quiet and play with the little ones, while his wife dreſſed him a bit of hot ſupper, he grew in time not to come home at all. He who has once taken to drink can ſeldom be ſaid to be guilty of one ſin only; John's heart became hardened. His affection for his family was loſt in ſelf-indulgence. Patience and ſubmiſſion on the part of his wife might have won much upon a man of John's temper, but inſtead of trying to reclaim him, his wife ſeemed rather to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in putting him as much in the wrong as ſhe could, that ſhe might be juſtified in her conſtant abuſe of him. I doubt whether ſhe would have been as much pleaſed with his reformation as ſhe was with always talking of his faults, though I know it was the opinion of the neighbors, that if ſhe had taken as much pains to reform her huſband by reforming her own temper, as ſhe did to abuſe him and expoſe him, her endeavors might have been bleſſed with ſucceſs. Good people, who are try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſubdue their own faults, can hardly believe that the ungodly have a ſort of ſavage ſatisfaction in trying, by the indulgence of their own evil tempers, to leſſen the happineſs of thoſe with whom they have to do.—Need we look any farther for a proof of our own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, when we ſee mankind delight in ſins which have neither the temptation of profit or pleaſure, ſuch as plaguing, vexing, or abuſing each other.</p>
                  <p>Heſter was the eldeſt of their five children, ſhe was a ſharp, ſenſible girl, but at fourteen years old ſhe could not tell a letter, nor had ſhe ever been taught to bow her knee to him who made her, for John's or rather

                  <p>It was juſt about this time, if I miſtake not, that Mrs. Jones ſet up her Sunday ſchool, of which Mrs. Betty Crew was appointed miſtreſs, as was related laſt month. Mrs. Jones finding that none of the Wilmots were ſent to ſchool, took a walk to Rebecca's houſe, and civilly told her ſhe called to let her know that a ſchool was opened to which ſhe deſired her to ſend her children on the Sunday following, eſpecially her eldeſt daughter Heſter. "Well," ſaid Rebecca, "and what will you give her if I do?" "Give her!" replied Mrs. Jones, "that is rather a rude queſtion, and aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a rude manner: however, as <hi>a ſoft anſwer turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away wrath,</hi> I aſſure you that I will give her the beſt of learning; I will teach her to <hi>fear God and keep his commandments."</hi> "I would rather you would teach her to fear me, and to keep my houſe clean," ſaid this wicked woman. "She ſhan't come, however, unleſs you will pay her for it." "Pay her for it," ſaid the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, "will it not be reward enough that ſhe will be taught to read the word of God without any expence to you? For though many gifts both of books and cloathing will be given the children, yet you are not to conſider theſe gifts ſo much in the light of payment as an expreſſion of good will in your benefactors." "I ſay," interrupted Rebecca, "that Heſter ſhan't go to ſchool. Religion is of no uſe that I know of, but to make people hate their own fleſh and blood; and I ſee no good in learning but to make folks proud, and lazy, and dirty. I cannot tell a letter myſelf, and, though I ſay it that ſhould not ſay it, there is not a notabler wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the pariſh." "Pray," ſaid Mrs. Jones mildly, "do you think that young people will diſobey their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents the more for being taught to fear God?" "I don't think any thing about it," ſaid Rebecca, "I ſhan't let her come, and there's the long and ſhort of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:035296_0285_1001C2F61F752D48"/>Heſter has other fiſh to fry; but you may have ſome of theſe little ones if you will?" "No," ſaid Mrs. Jones, "I will not; I have not ſet up a nurſery but a ſchool. I am not at all this expence to take cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing babes out of the mother's way, but to inſtruct rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ings. And it ought to be a rule in all ſchools not to take the troubleſome young children unleſs the mother will try to ſpare the elder ones, who are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of learning." "But," ſaid Rebecca, "I have a young child which Heſter muſt nurſe while I dreſs dinner. And the muſt iron the rags, and ſcour the irons, and dig the potatoes, and fetch the water to boil them." "As to nurſing the child, that is indeed a neceſſary duty, and Heſter ought to ſtay at home part of the day to enable you to go to church; and families ſhould relieve each other in this way, but as to all the reſt they are no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at all, for the irons need not be ſcoured ſo often, and the rags ſhould be ironed and the potatoes dug, and the water fetched on the Saturday, and I can tell you that neither your miniſter here, nor your judge hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will accept of any ſuch excuſes."</p>
                  <p>All this while Heſter ſtaid behind, pale and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, leſt her unkind mother ſhould carry her point—She looked up at Mrs. Jones with ſo much love and gratitude as to win her affection, and this good lady went on trying to ſoften this harſh mother. At laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca condeſcended to ſay, "well, I don't know but I may let her come now and then when I can ſpare her, provided I find you make it worth her while." All this time ſhe had never aſked Mrs. Jones to ſit down, nor had once bid her young children be quiet, though they were crying and ſqualling the whole time. Rebecca fancied this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>deneſs was the only way ſhe had of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe thought herſelf as good as her gueſt, but Mrs. Jones never loſt her temper. The moment ſhe went out of the houſe, Rebecca called our loud enough for her to hear, and ordered Heſter to get the ſtone and a
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:035296_0286_1001C2F8EF1DCC50"/>bit of ſand to ſcrub out the prints of that dirty woman's ſhoes. Heſter, in high ſpirits, cheerfully obeyed, and rubbed out the ſtains ſo neatly, that her mother could not help lamenting that ſo handy a girl was going to be ſpoiled by being taught godlineſs, and learning, and ſuch nonſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Jones, who knew the world, told her agent, Mrs. Crew, that her grand difficulty would ariſe not ſo much from the children as the parents. "Theſe," ſaid ſhe, "are apt to fall into that ſad miſtake, that becauſe their children are poor and have little of this world's goods, the mothers muſt make it up to them in falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence. The children of the gentry are much more reproved and corrected for their faults, and bred up in far ſtricter diſcipline. He was a King who ſaid, <hi>chas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thy ſon, and let not thy rod ſpare for his crying.</hi>—But the more vicious the children are, you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the more they ſtand in need of your inſtruction. When they are bad, comfort yourſelf with thinking how much worſe they would have been but for you; and what a burthen they would become to ſociety if theſe evil tempers were to receive no check." The great thing which enabled Mrs. Crew to teach well, was, the deep inſight ſhe had got into the corruption of human nature. And I doubt if any one can make a thoroughly good teacher of religion and morals who wants this maſter-key to the heart. Others, indeed, may teach knowledge, decency, and good manners.—Mrs. Crew who knew that out of the heart proceed lying, theft, and all that train of evils which begin to break out even in young children, applied her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors to correct this root of evil. But though a diligent, ſhe was an humble teacher, well knowing that unleſs the grace of God bleſſed her labors, ſhe ſhould but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor in vain.</p>
                  <p>Heſter Wilmot never failed to attend the ſchool, whenever her perverſe mother would give her leave,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:035296_0287_1001A3D7DC06A308"/>and her delight in learning was ſo great, that ſhe would work early and late to gain a little time for her book. As ſhe had a quick capacity, ſhe learned ſoon to ſpell and read, and Mrs. Crew obſerving her diligence, uſed to lend her a book to carry home, that ſhe might pick up a little at odd times. It would be well if teachers would make this diſtinction. To give or lend books to thoſe who take no delight in them is an uſeleſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe; while it is kind and right to aſſiſt well diſpoſed young people with every help of this ſort. Thoſe who love books ſeldom hurt them, while the ſlothful who hate learning, will wear out a book more in a week than the diligent will do in a year. Heſter's way was to read over one queſtion in her catechiſm, or one verſe in her hymn book, by fire-light before ſhe went to bed; this ſhe thought over in the night, and when ſhe was dreſſing herſelf in the morning ſhe was glad to find ſhe always knew a little more than ſhe had done the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before. It is not to be believed how much thoſe people will be found to have gained at the end of a year, who are accuſtomed to work up all the little odd ends and remnants of time; who are convinced that minutes are no more to be waſted than pence. Nay, he who finds he was waſted a ſhilling may by diligence hope to fetch it up again; but no repentance or indus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try can ever bring back one waſted hour. My good young reader, if ever you are tempted to waſte an hour, go and aſk a dying man what he would give for that hour which you are throwing away, and according as he anſwers, ſo do you act.</p>
                  <p>As her mother hated the ſight of a book, Heſter was forced to learn out of ſight: it was no diſobedience to do this, as long as ſhe waſted no part of that time which it was her duty to ſpend in uſeful labor. She would have thought it a ſin to have left her work for her book; but ſhe did not think it wrong to ſteal time from her ſleep, and to be learning an hour before the reſt of the
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:035296_0288_1001C131DF82D178"/>family were awake. Heſter would not neglect the waſhing-tub, or the ſpinning-wheel, even to get on with her catechiſm; but ſhe thought it fair to think over her queſtions, while ſhe was waſhing and ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. In a few months ſhe was able to read fluently in St. John's goſpel, which is the eaſieſt. But Mrs. Crew did not think it enough that her children could read a chapter, ſhe would make them underſtand it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. It is in a good degree owing to the want of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious knowledge in teachers that there is ſo little reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the world. Unleſs the bible is laid open to the underſtanding, children may read from Geneſis to the Revelation, without any other improvement than bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learning how to pronounce the words. Mrs. Crew found that there was but one way to compel their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: this was by obliging them to return back again to her the ſenſe of what ſhe had read to them, and this they might do in their own words, if they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the words of ſcripture. Thoſe who had weak capacities would, to be ſure, do this but very imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but even the weakeſt if they were willing would retain ſomething. She ſo managed that ſaying the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>echiſm was not merely an act of the memory, but of the underſtanding; for ſhe had obſerved formerly, that thoſe who had learned the catechiſm in the common formal way, when they were children, had never underſtood it when they became men and women, and it remained in the memory without having made any impreſſion on the mind. Thus this fine ſummary of the chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is conſidered as little more than a form of words, the being able to repeat which, is a qualification for being confirmed by the biſhop, inſtead of being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as really containing thoſe grounds of chriſtian faith and practice, by which they are to be confirmed chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Crew uſed to ſay to Mrs. Jones, "thoſe who teach the poor muſt indeed give line upon line, precept
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:035296_0289_1001C30947D5B4F0"/>upon precept, here a little and there a little, as they can receive it. So that teaching muſt be a great grievance to thoſe who do not really make it a labor of love. I ſee ſo much levity, obſtinacy, and ignorance, that it keeps my own forbearance in continual exerciſe, ſo that I cruſt I am getting good myſelf while I am doing good to others. No one, madam, can know till they try, that after they have aſked a poor untaught child the ſame queſtion nineteen times, they muſt not loſe their temper, but go on and aſk it the twentieth. Now and then, when I am tempted to be impatient, I correct myſelf, by thinking over that active proof which our bleſſed Saviour requires of our love to him when he ſays, <hi>feed my lambs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Heſter Wilmot had never been bred to go to church, for her father and mother had never thought for going themſelves, unleſs at a chriſtening in their own family, or at a funeral of their neighbors, both of which they conſidered merely as opportunities for good eating and drinking, and not as offices of religion.</p>
                  <p>As poor Heſter had no comfort at home, it was the leſs wonder ſhe delighted in her ſchool, her bible and church, for ſo great is God's goodneſs, that he is pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make religion a peculiar comfort to thoſe who have no other comfort. The God whoſe name ſhe had ſeldom heard but when it was <hi>taken in vain,</hi> was now revealed to her as a God of infinite power, jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and holineſs. What ſhe read in her bible, and what ſhe felt in her own heart, convinced her ſhe was a ſinner; and her catechiſm ſaid the ſame. She was much diſtreſſed one day on thinking over this promiſe which ſhe had juſt made (in anſwer to the queſtion which fell to her lot) <hi>To renoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="196" facs="unknown:035296_0290_1001A3DF444A6768"/>which ſhe was bound to perform. She was ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puzzled to know how this was to be done, till ſhe met with theſe words in her bible. <hi>My grace is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for thee.</hi> But ſtill ſhe was at a loſs to know how this grace was to be obtained. Happily Mr. Simpſon preached on the next Sunday from this text, <hi>Aſk and ye ſhall have,</hi> &amp;c. In this ſermon was explained to her the nature, the duty, and the efficacy of prayer. After this ſhe opened her heart to Mrs. Crew, who taught her the great doctrines of Scripture in a ſerious, but plain way. Heſter's own heart led her to aſſent to that humbling doctrine of the catechiſm, that <hi>we are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture born in ſin;</hi> and truly glad was ſhe to be relieved by hearing or <hi>that ſpiritual grace by which we have a new birth unto righteouſneſs.</hi> Thus her mind was no ſooner humbled by one part, than it gained comfort from another. On the other hand, while ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing in a <hi>lively hope of God's mercy through Chriſt,</hi> her miſtreſs put her in mind that that was the only true repentance, <hi>by which we forſake ſin.</hi> Thus the cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm explained by a pious teacher was found to contain <hi>all the articles of the chriſtian faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mrs. Jones greatly diſapproved the practice of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the ſcholars, becauſe they were grown up— "Young people," ſaid ſhe, "want to be warned at ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen more than they did at ſix, and they are commonly turned adrift at the very age when they want moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; when dangers and temptations moſt beſet them. They are expoſed to more evil by the leiſure of a Sunday evening than by the buſineſs of the whole week: but then religion muſt be made pleaſant, and inſtruction muſt be carried in a kind, and agreeable, and familiar way. If they once diſlike the teacher they will ſoon get to diſlike that is taught, ſo that a mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or miſtreſs is in ſome meaſure anſwerable for the future piety of young perſons, inaſmuch as that piety depends on their manner of making religion pleaſant as
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:035296_0291_1001C311F77F1B88"/>well as profitable." To attend Mrs. Jones's evening inſtructions was ſoon thought not a taſk but a holiday. In a few months it was reckoned a diſadvantage to the character of any young perſon in the pariſh to know they did not attend the evening ſchool. At firſt, indeed, many of them came only with a view to learn to ſing pſalms; but, by the bleſſing of God, they grew fond of inſtruction, and ſome of them became truly pious— Mrs. Jones ſpoke to them one Sunday evening as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: "My dear young women, I rejoice at your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement; but I rejoice with trembling. I have known young people ſet out well, who afterwards fell off. The heart is deceitful. Many like religious know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, who do not like the ſtrictneſs of a religious life. I muſt therefore watch whether thoſe who are diligent at church and ſchool are diligent in their daily walk.— Whether thoſe who ſay they believe in God, really o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him. Whether they who profeſs to love Chriſt keep his commandments. Thoſe who hear themſelves commended for early piety, may learn to reſt ſatisfied with the praiſe of man. People may get a knack at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious phraſes without being religious; they may even get to frequent places of worſhip as an amuſement, in order to meet their friends, and may learn to delight in a ſort <hi>ſpiritual goſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And though ſhe ſecretly prayed to God that this ſickneſs might change her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's heart, yet ſhe never once reproached her, or put her in mind, that it was caught by indulging in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pleaſure. Another Sunday night her father told Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he thought ſhe had been at ſchool long enough for him to have a little good of her learning, ſo he deſired ſhe would ſtay at home and read to him. Heſter cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ran and fetched her Teſtament, but John fell a laughing, called her a fool, and ſaid, "it would be time enough to read the Teſtament to him when he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to die, but at preſent he muſt have ſomething mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry." So ſaying, he gave her a ſong-book which he had picked up at the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll. Heſter having caſt her eyes over it, refuſed to read it, ſaying, "ſhe did not dare offend God by reading what would hurt her own ſoul." John called her a canting hypocrite, and ſaid, he would put the Teſtament in the ſire, for that there was not a more merry girl than the was before ſhe became religious.— Her mother, for once, took her part, not becauſe ſhe thought by her daughter in the right, but becauſe ſhe was
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:035296_0294_1001C16BD40411B8"/>glad of any pretence to ſhew her huſband was in the wrong; though ſhe herſelf would have abuſed Heſter for the ſame thing if John had taken her part. John, with a ſhocking oath, abuſed them both, and went off in a violent paſſion. Heſter, inſtead of ſaying one undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful word againſt her father, took up a pſalter in order to teach her little ſiſters, but Rebecca was ſo provoked at her for not joining her in her abuſe of her huſband, that ſhe changed her humor, ſaid John was in the right, and Heſter a perverſe hypocrite, who only made reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion a pretence for being undutiful to her parents.—Heſter bore all in ſilence, and committed her cauſe to 02 him who judgeth righteouſly. It would have been a great comfort to her if ſhe had dared to go and open her heart to Mrs. Crew, and to have joined in the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious exerciſes of the evening at ſchool. But her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refuſed to let her, ſaying, it would only harden her heart in miſchief. Heſter ſaid not a word, but after having put the little ones to bed, and heard them ſay their prayers out of ſight, ſhe went and ſat down in her own little loſt, and ſaid to herſelf, "it would be pleaſant to me to have taught my little ſiſters to read, I thought it was my duty, for David has ſaid, <hi>Come yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> children, hearken unto me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</hi> It would have been ſtill more pleaſant to have paſſed the evening at ſchool, becauſe I am ſtill ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and fitter to learn than to teach; but I cannot do either without flying in the face of my mother; God fees fit to-night to change my pleaſant duties into a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful trial. I give up my will, and I ſubmit to the will of my father; but when he orders me to commit a known ſin then I dare not do it, becauſe, in ſo doing, I muſt diſobly my Father which is in heaven." Now it ſo fell out that this diſpute happened on the very Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day next before Mrs. Jones's yearly feaſt. On May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day all the ſchool attended her to church, each in a ſtuff gow of their own earning, and a cap and white apron
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:035296_0295_1001C16F59949580"/>of her giving. After church there was an examination made into the learning and behaviour of the ſchools; thoſe who were moſt perfect in their chapters, and brought the beſt character for induſtry, humility, and ſobriety, received a bible, or ſome other good book.</p>
                  <p>Now Heſter had been a whole year hoarding up her little ſavings in order to be ready with a new gown on the May-day feaſt. She had never got leſs than two ſhillings a week by her ſpinning, beſides working for the family, and earning a trifle by odd jobs. This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſhe faithfully carried to her mother every Saturday night, keeping back, by conſent, only two pence a week towards the gown. The ſum was compleat, the pattern had long been ſettled, and Heſter had only on the Monday morning to go to the ſhop, pay her money, and bring home her gown to be made. Her mother happened to go out that morning early to iron-in a gentleman's family, where ſhe uſually ſtayed a day or two, and Heſter was buſy putting the houſe in order before ſhe went to the ſhop.</p>
                  <p>On that very Monday there was to be a meeting at the Bell of all the idle fellows in the pariſh. John Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot of courſe was to be there. Indeed he had accepted a challenge of the blackſmith to a batch at all-fours.—The blackſmith was fluſh of money, John thought himſelf the beſt player; and that he might make ſure of winning, he reſolved to keep himſelf ſober, which he knew was more than the other would do. John was ſo uſed to go upon tick for ale, that he got to the door of the Bell before he recollected that he could not keep his word with the gambler without money, and he had not a penny in his pocket, ſo he ſullenly turned home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. He dared not apply to his wife, as he knew he ſhould be more likely to get a ſcratched ſace than a ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence from her; but he knew that Heſter had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two ſhillings for her laſt week's ſpinning on Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and perhaps ſhe might not yet have given it to her
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:035296_0296_1001C177304E8420"/>mother. Of the hoarded ſum he knew nothing. He aſked her if ſhe could lend him half a crown and he would pay her next day. Heſter pleaſed to ſee him in good humor after what had paſſed the night before, ran up and fetched down her little box, and, in the joy of her heart that he now deſired ſomething ſhe could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with without wounding her conſcience, cheerfully poured out her whole little ſtock upon the table. John was in raptures at the ſight of three half-crowns and a ſix-pence, eagerly ſeized it, box and all, together with a ſew hoarded halfpence at the bottom, though he had only aſked to borrow half a crown. None but one whoſe heart was hardened by a long courſe of drunkenneſs could have taken away the whole, and for ſuch a purpoſe. He told her ſhe ſhould certainly have it again next morning, and indeed intended to pay it, not doubting but he ſhould double the ſum. But John over-rated his own ſkill or luck, for he loſt every farthing to the blackſmith, and ſneaked home before midnight, and quietly walked up to-bed. He was quite ſober, which Heſter thought a good ſign. Next morning ſhe aſked him in a very humble way for the money, which ſhe ſaid ſhe would not have done, but that if the gown was not bought directly, it would not be ready in time for the feaſt. John's conſcience had troubled him a little for what he had done, for when he was not drunk he was not ill-natured, and he ſtammered out a broken ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, but owned he had loſt the money, and had not a farthing left. The moment Heſter ſaw him mild and kind, her heart was ſoſtened, and ſhe begged him not to vex; adding that ſhe would be contented never to have a new gown as long as ſhe lived, if ſhe could have the comfort of always ſeeing him come home as ſober as he was laſt night. For Heſter did not know that he had refrained from getting drunk, only that he might gamble with a better chance of ſucceſs, and that when a gameſter keeps himſelf ſober, it is not that he may
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:035296_0297_1001C17CF58BFA30"/>practiſe a virtue, but that he may commit a worſe crime. "I am indeed ſorry for what I have done," ſaid he, "you cannot go to the feaſt, and what will Madam Jones ſay?" "Yes, but I can," ſaid Heſter, "for God looks not at the gown, but at the heart, and I am ſure he ſees mine full of gratitude at hearing you talk ſo kindly; and if I thought my dear father would change his preſent evil courſes, I ſhould be the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt girl at the feaſt to-morrow." John walked away mournfully, and ſaid to himſelf, "ſurely there muſt be ſomething in religion ſince it can thus change the heart. Heſter was a pert girl, and now ſhe is as mild as a lamb. She was an indolent girl, and now ſhe is up with the lark. She was a vain girl, and would do any thing for a new ribbon; and now ſhe is contented to go in rags to a feaſt at which every one elſe will have a new gown. She deprived herſelf of the gown to give me the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and yet this very girl, ſo dutiful in ſome things, would ſubmit to be turned out of doors, rather than read a looſe book at my command, or break the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. I do not underſtand this, there muſt be ſome myſtery in it." All this he ſaid as he was going to work. In the evening he did not go to the Bell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was owing to his new thoughts or to his not having a penny in his pocket, I will not take upon me poſitively to ſay, but I believe it was a little of one, and a little of the other.</p>
                  <p>As the pattern of the intended gown had long been ſettled in the family, and as Heſter had the money by her, it was looked on as good as bought, ſo that ſhe was truſted to get it brought home and made in her mother's abſence. Indeed, ſo little did Rebecca care about the ſchool, that ſhe would not have cared any thing about the gown, if her vanity had not made her wiſh that her daughter ſhould be the beſt dreſt of any girl at the feaſt. Being from home as was ſaid before, ſhe knew nothing of the diſappointment. On May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:035296_0298_1001C18D0EB3EA80"/>morning, Heſter, inſtead of keeping from the feaſt becauſe ſhe had not a new gown, or meanly inventing any excuſe, dreſſed herſelf out as neatly as ſhe could in her poor old things, and went to join the ſchool in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to go to church. Whether Heſter had formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged a little pride of heart, and talked of this gown rather too much, I am not quite ſure, certain it is, there was a great hue and cry made at ſeeing Heſter Wilmot, the neateſt girl, the moſt induſtrious girl in the ſchool, come to the May-day feaſt in an old ſtuff gown, when every other girl was ſo creditably dreſſ. Indeed, I am ſorry to ſay, there were two or three much too ſmart for their ſtation, and who had dizened themſelves out in very improper finery, which Mrs. Jones made them take eff before her. "I mean this feaſt," ſaid ſhe, "as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of induſtry and piety, and not as a trial of ſkill who can be fineſt, and outvie the reſt in ſhow. If I do not take care my feaſt will become an encouragement, not to virtue, but to vanity. I am ſo great a friend to decency of apparel, that I even like to ſee you deny your appetites that you may be able to come decently dreſſer to the houſe of God. To encourage you to do this, I like to ſet apart this one day of innocent pleaſure againſt which you may be preparing all the year, by laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ſomething every week towards buying a gown out of your little ſavings. But let me tell you, that meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and an humble ſpirit is of more value in the ſight of God and good men than the gayeſt cotton gown, or the brighteſt pink ribbon in the pariſh."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Jones, for all this, was as much ſurpriſed as the reſt at Heſter's mean garb: but ſuch is the power of a good character that ſhe gave her credit for a right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, eſpecially as ſhe knew the unhappy ſtate of her family. For it was Mrs. Jones's way (and it is not a bad way) always to wait, and enquire into the truth, before ſhe condemned any body of good character, tho' appearances were againſt them. "As we cannot judge
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:035296_0299_1001C19059303E00"/>of people's motives," ſaid ſhe, "we may, from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, condemn their beſt actions, and approve of their worſt." It will be always time enough to judge unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorably, and let us give others credit as long as we can and then we in our turn may expect a favorable judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from others." Heſter was no more proud of what ſhe had done for her father, than ſhe was humbled by the meanneſs of her garb, and though Betty Stiles, one of the girls, whoſe finery had been taken away, ſneered at her, Heſter never offered to clear herſelf by expoſing her father, though ſhe thought it right ſecretly to inform Mrs. Jones of what had paſt. When the examination of the girls began, Betty Stiles was aſked ſome ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the fourth and fifth commandments, which ſhe anſwered very well. Heſter was aſked nearly the ſame queſtions, and though ſhe anſwered them no better than Betty had done, they were all ſurpriſed to ſee Mrs. Jones riſe up and give a handſome bible to Heſter, while ſhe gave nothing to Betty. This girl cried out rather pertly, "Madam, it is very hard that I have no book, I was as perfect as Heſter." "I have often told you," ſaid Mrs. Jones, "that religion is not a thing of the tongue b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> of the heart. That girl gives me the beſt proof that ſhe has learned the fourth commandment to good purpoſe, who perſiſts in keeping holy the ſabbath day, though commanded to break it by a parent whom ſhe loves. And that girl beſt proves that ſhe keeps the fifth, who gives up her own comfort and cloathing, and credit, to honor and obey her father and mother, even though they are not ſuch as ſhe could wiſh. Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Stiles, though ſhe could anſwer the queſtions ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, went a nutting laſt Sunday when ſhe ſhould have been at ſchool, and refuſed to nurſe her ſick mother when ſhe could not help herſelf."</p>
                  <p>Farmer Hoſkins, who ſtood by, whiſpered to Mrs. Jones, "Well, Madam, now you have convinced even one of the benefit of religious inſtruction, now I ſce
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:035296_0300_1001C195F1D35730"/>there is a meaning to it. I thought it was in at one ear and out at the other, and that a ſong was as well as a pſalm; but now I have found that the proof of the pudding is in the eating. I ſce your ſcholars muſt <hi>do</hi> what they <hi>bear,</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> what they <hi>learn.</hi> Why at this rate, they will all be the better ſervants for being real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly godly, and ſo I will add a pudding to next year's feaſt."</p>
                  <p>The pleaſure Heſter felt in receiving a new bible, made her forget that ſhe had on an old gown. She walked to church in a thankful frame; but how great was her joy, when ſhe ſaw, among a number of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, her own father going into church. As ſhe paſt by him ſhe caſt on him a look of ſo much joy and affection, that it brought tears into his eyes, eſpecially when he compared her mean dreſs with that of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther girls, and thought who had been the cauſe of it.—John, who had not been at church for ſome years, was deeply ſtruck with the ſervice. The confeſſion with which it opens went to his heart. He felt, for the firſt time, that he was <hi>a miſerable ſinner, and that there was no health in him.</hi> He now felt compunction for ſin in general, though it was only his ill beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r to his daughter which had brought him to church. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was ſuch as ſerved to ſtrengthen the impreſſion which the prayers had made, and when it was over, inſtead of joining the ringers (for the belfry was the only part of the church John liked, becauſe it uſually led to the ale-houſe) he quietly walked back to his work. It was indeed the beſt day's work he ever made. He could not get out of his head the whole day the firſt words he had heard at church. <hi>When the wicked man turneth away from his wickedneſs, and doth that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſave his ſoul alive.</hi> At night, inſtead of going to the Bell, he went home, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to aſk Heſter to forgive him; but as ſoon as he got to the door, he heard Rebecca rating his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:035296_0301_1001C19AC63B4A88"/>for having brought ſuch a diſgrace on the family as to be ſeen in that old rag of a gown, and inſiſted on knowing what ſhe had done with the money. Heſter tried to keep the ſecret, but her mother declared ſhe w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uld turn her out of doors if ſhe did not tell the truth. Heſter was at laſt forced to confeſs ſhe had given it to her father. Unfortunately for poor John, it was at this very moment he opened the door. The mother now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided her fury between her guilty huſband and her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent child, till from words ſhe fell to blows. John defended his daughter, and received ſome of the ſtrokes intended for the poor girl. This turbulent ſcene part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put John's good reſolutions to flight, though the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of Heſter did him almoſt as much good as the ſermon he had heard. At length the poor girl eſcaped up ſtairs, not a litte bruiſed, and a ſcene of much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence paſſed between John and Rebecca. She declared ſhe would not ſit down to ſupper with ſuch a brute, and ſet off to a neighbor's houſe, that ſhe might have the pleaſure of abuting him the longer. John, whoſe mind was much diſturbed, went up ſtairs without his ſupper. As he was paſſing by Heſter's little room he heard her voice, and as he concluded ſhe was venting bitter complaints againſt her unnatural parents, he ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to liſten, reſolving to go in and comfort her. He ſtopped at the door, for by the light of the moon he ſaw her kneeling by her bedſide, and praying ſo earneſtly that ſhe did not hear him. As he made ſure ſhe could be praying for nothing but his death, what was his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe to hear theſe words, "O Lord, have mercy upon my dear father and mother, teach me to love them, to pray for them, and do them good, make me more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and more patient, that, adorning the doctrine of God, my Saviour, I may recommend his holy religion, and my dear parents may be brought to love and fear thee."</p>
                  <p>Poor John, who would never have been hard hearted
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:035296_0302_1001C1A025A3C5D0"/>if he had not been a drunkard, could not ſtand this, he fell down on his knees, embraced his child, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her to teach him how to pray. He prayed himſelf as well as he could, and though he did not know what words to uſe, yet his heart was melted; he owned he was a ſinner, and begged Heſter to fetch the prayer-book, and read over the confeſſion with which he had been ſo much ſtruck at church. This was the pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt order ſhe had ever obeyed. Seeing him deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with a ſenſe of ſin, ſhe pointed out to him the Saviour of ſinners; and in this manner ſhe paſt ſome hours with her father, which were the happieſt of her life; ſuch a night was worth a hundred cotton, or even ſilk gowns. In the courſe of the week Heſter read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the confeſſion, and ſome other prayers to her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo often that he got them by heart, and repeated them while he was at work. And at length he took courage to kneel down and pray before he went to-bed From that time he bore his wife's ill-humor much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he had ever done, and, as he knew her to be neat and notable, and ſaving, he began to think, that if her temper was not quite ſo bad, his home might ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e did not know what to do with his long evenings after the little ones were in bed, for he began once more to delight in playing with them. Heſter propoſed that ſhe ſhould teach him to read an hour every night, and he conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Rebecca began to ſtorm from the mere trick ſhe had got of ſtorming; but finding that he now brought home all his earnings, and that ſhe got both his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and his company (for ſhe had once loved him) ſhe began to reconcile herſelf to this new way of life. In a few months John could read a pſalm; in learning to read it he alſo got it by heart, and this proved a little ſtore for private devotion, and while he was mowing be could call to mind a text to cheer his labor. Henow
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:035296_0303_1001C1A5948B5E70"/>went conſtantly to church, and often dropped in at the ſchool on a Sunday evening to hear their prayers. He expreſſed ſo much pleaſure at this, that one day Heſter ventured to aſk him if they ſhould ſet up family prayer at home. John ſaid he ſhould like it mightily, but as he could not yet read quite well enough, he deſired Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to try to get a proper book, and begin next Sunday night. Heſter had bought of a pious hawker for three half-pence the book of prayers, printed for the cheap Repoſitory, by Mr. Marſhall, Queer-ſtreet, Cheap-ſide.</p>
                  <p>When Heſter read the exhortation at the beginning of this little book, her mother who ſat in the corner; and pretended to be aſleep, was ſo much ſtruck that ſhe could not find a word to ſay againſt it. For a few nights indeed, ſhe continued to ſit ſtill, or pretended to rock the young child while her huſband and daughter were kneeling at their prayers. She expected John would have ſcolded her for this, and ſo perverſe was her tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that ſhe was diſappointed at his finding no fault with her. Seeing at laſt that he was very patient, and that though he prayed fervently himſelf, he ſuffered her to do as ſhe liked, ſhe loft the ſpirit of oppoſition for want of ſomething to provoke it. As her pride be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be ſubdued, ſome little diſpoſition to piety was awakened in her heart. By degrees ſhe ſlid down on her knees, though at firſt it was behind the cradle or the clock, or in ſome corner where ſhe thought they would not ſee her. Heſter rejoiced even in this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward change in her mother, and prayed that God would at laſt be pleaſed to touch her heart as he had done that of her father.</p>
                  <p>As John now ſpent no idle money, he had ſaved up a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>trifle by working over-hours, this he kindly offered to Heſter to make up for the loſs of her gown. Inſtead of accepting it, Heſter told him, that as ſhe herſelf was young and healthy, ſhe ſhould ſoon be able to clothe
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:035296_0304_1001C1AD51F25088"/>herſelf out of her own ſavings, and begged him to make her mother a preſent of this gown, which he did. It had been a maxim of Rebecca, that it was better not to go to church at all tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> go in an old gown. She had, however, ſo far conquered this evil notion, that ſhe had lately gone pretty often. This kindneſs of the gown touched her not a little, and the firſt Sunday ſhe put it on, Mr. Simpſon happened to preach from this text, <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.</hi> This ſermon ſo affected Rebecca that ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver once thought ſhe had her new gown on, till ſhe came to take it off when ſhe went to-bed, and that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry night, inſtead of ſkulking behind, ſhe knelt down by her huſband.</p>
                  <p>There was one thing ſunk deep in Rebecca's mind, ſhe had obſerved that ſince her huſband had grown re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious he had been ſo careful not to give her any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that he was become ſcrupulouſly clean; took off his dirty ſhoes before he ſat down, and was very cautious not to ſpill a drop of beer on her ſhining table. Now it was rather remarkable, that as John grew more neat, Rebecca grew more indifferent to neatneſs. But both theſe changes aroſe from the ſame cauſe, the growth of religion in their hearts. John grew cleanly from the fear of giving pain to his wife, while Rebecca grew indifferent from having diſcovered the ſin and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of an over anxious care about triſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Heſter continues to grow in grace and in knowledge.

                  <p>HOW comes it that ſo many perſons who go re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly to public worſhip, nevertheleſs do not attend at the Sacrament? Are they right or wrong in turning their backs on this ſolemn ordinance? It is a queſtion well worth conſidering, and it is the intention of this tract to clear up, in ſome meaſure, this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſubject.</p>
                  <p>I believe the principal reaſon which many people have to give for not receiving the Sacrament is, that they are afraid of it. "I think it an awful thing," ſay they, "to receive the Sacrament. I am fearful leſt I ſhould eat and drink my own damnation." To ſuch perſons we reply, have you ever enquired into the real meaning and nature of what you ſo much dread? Read the preſent tract. Learn to under ſtand what the acra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord's Supper is, and when you know, then decide whether you will receive it or not. Let me here remark alſo, that the phraſe of <hi>eating and drinking our own damnation</hi> is a phraſe extremely miſunderſtood. It is borrowed from the Apoſtle Paul, but when the Apoſtle uſed it he applied it to certain Corinthians who got drunk at the Sacrament; and it is material alſo to obſerve, that by the word "damnation" the Apoſtle meant "condemnation," and you will find, if you will read the paſſage that he alluded chiefly to certain judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this world which the Corinthians brought upon them, ſo that even in their caſe he did not mean
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:035296_0306_1001C1B8B9773A38"/>to declare, that there would be no room for repentance in this world, and no ſalvation in the next. It muſt be owned in like manner, or rather it ought to be ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſiſted on, that every one who now communicates unworthily, encreaſes his guilt rather than promotes his ſalvation; but ſtill be does not ſin paſt all poſſibility of forgiveneſs; and let it be remembered, that a man may ſin not only by communicating unworthily, but alſo by refuſing to communicate.</p>

                     <p>The beſt means of knowing what is the true nature of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, is to enquire into all that paſſed when our Saviour appointed it.—We read, with little difference of terms, in ſeveral of the Evangeliſts, that our Saviour, <hi>on the ſame night on which he was betrayed, being at ſupper with his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, took bread and gave thanks, and brake it and gave unto them, ſaying, this is my body which is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for you. This do in remembrance of me. Likewiſe alſo, the cup after ſupper, ſaying, this cup is the New Teſtament in my blood which is ſhed for you.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Paul further obſerves, <hi>For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's death till be come.</hi> From this ſhort and ſimple account, which is nearly all that Scripture ſays on the ſubject, we are to collect what was our Saviour's intention in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing this Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Now I think we are to underſtand, that he thereby meant to command all chriſtians to meet together, from time to time, and to partake of bread and wine, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to keep up among them the remembrance of this his laſt ſupper with his diſciples, and of the ſufferings and death of Chriſt, which immediately followed. <hi>Take eat,</hi> ſaid he, after having broken the bread, <hi>this is my body.</hi> That is, this broken bread is to remind you of my
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:035296_0307_1001C1BBE231C4D8"/>body broken for your ſake. And ſpeaking of the cup, he ſaid, <hi>Drink ye all of this, for this is my blood of the New Teſtament which is ſhed for many for the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins.</hi> That is, this cup is to remind you of my blood being ſhed for the pardon (or remiſſion) of ſins. <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> Theſe laſt mentioned words may be underſtood both as an entreaty and as a command. Chriſt, your Saviour, entreats you thus to remember him. Chriſt, alſo, who is your Judge and Lord, commands you to do it. The command is as plain as any other command of Scripture, and he who diſobeys one command of Chriſt, may, with much the ſame reaſon, diſobey every other. It is, in ſhort, as if our bleſſed Saviour had ſaid, "I am now about to die for your ſins, and to riſe again for your juſtification, and I make it my laſt and dying requeſt that you, and all my diſciples will accuſtom yourſelves to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to partake of bread and wine, as we have now done, in token of your bearing in mind, my pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and bloody death, and in token alſo of your believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I, who am now about to be crucified, ſhall hereafter come again, according to my promiſe, in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and great glory." <hi>For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's death till he come.</hi>

                     <head>What it is to receive the Sacrament unworthily.</head>
                     <p>Firſt then, I think it is plain that to receive it igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, is to receive it unworthily. This may very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called <hi>not diſcerning the Lord's body.</hi> Groſs ignorance or error concerning the nature of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, evidently ſhews a man to be unfit at preſent to receive it, and groſs ignorance of the doctrines of chriſtianity is in like manner a diſqualification. This ignorance, however, is that which ſhould immediately be cured. Every perſon who is come to years of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be afraid of remaining a ſtranger to the
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:035296_0308_1001A3A02CB5FBE0"/>Lord's table. He ſhould loſe no time in enquiring into the nature of it, and when he underſtands it, he is no more to be excuſed for abſenting himſelf from it, than he is for abſenting himſelf from the common public worſhip.</p>
                     <p>But next I would obſerve, that to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any reſpect, lightly and careleſsly, is to receive it unworthily. Some receive the Sacrament as a thing of courſe as ſoon as ever they arrive at a certain age; and at this ſame age perhaps they go and plunge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into all the vanities and follies of the world, if not into its vices alſo. Some receive it becauſe they have a grave character to ſupport; ſome becauſe they are expected to receive it, and are aſhamed to refuſe to do ſo, having, for inſtance, a brother or a ſiſter who receives it from whom they do not care to differ; ſome from mere zeal for their own church, of which they ſhew themſelves ſteady members by receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament according to the forms which it has appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: ſome from a confuſed mixture of ſeveral of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovementioned motives; and ſome for the mere pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of qualifying themſelves for a place under govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thus, while many ſeriouſly diſpoſed perſons need to be encouraged to come to the Lord's table much more than is their cuſtom, it is to be feared alſo, that there are not a few of our communicants who in one way or other receive the Sacrament very unworthily.</p>
                     <p>Again, to receive the Lord's Supper ſuperſtitiouſly is to receive it in ſome meaſure unworthily. Now a man receive it ſuperſtitiouſly who thinks there is ſome charm or unaccountable virtue in it, and who is not content with believing the Sacrament to be a means of grace, in the ſame manner as prayer or the reading of the Scriptures, or attendance on public worſhip. The papiſts go ſo far as to adore the elements of bread and wine, which they alſo fancy that the prieſt is able, by conſecration, to turn into the real and literal body and
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:035296_0309_1001C1C514419BA0"/>blood of Chriſt; and there are ſome Proteſtants who have not entirely eſcaped from the ſame error; for they fancy that there is ſome dark and myſtical meaning in the Sacrament, which, however, they cannot explain; and they are not aware that it is that plain and ſimple thing which we have deſcribed it to be. I am ſorry to add that ſome ſuperſtitious proteſtants imitate the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in another reſpect. They think they have done a very meritorious deed when they have received the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; they have gone through what they call their religious duty, and in conſideration of this they fancy that they have now obtained a right to employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in any manner they think ſit, and away therefore they go from the Lord's table into the world with minds full of ambition or pride, or covetouſneſs, and the very Sacrament which they have attended ſerves to confirm them in the neglect of daily and habitual repentance, and to give a dangerous and falſe peace to their conſciences, There are perſons of this deſcription who prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves poſſibly with much ſolemnity for the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament, and who even attend the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice with a face of great ſanctity and ſeriouſneſs. It muſt, nevertheleſs, be laid down as a maxim, that whenever any one's life is quite at variance with every thing he profeſſes at the Lord's table, that perſon muſt be conſidered as a mere hypocrite and ſelf-deceiver, and as one of the worſt and moſt unworthy ſort of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants.</p>

                     <p>St. Paul, after reproving the Corinthians for their profanation of the Lord's Supper, obſerves, <hi>but let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.</hi> In the catechiſm of the church of England we are inſtructed, what it is that may now be particularly required of communicants; namely,
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:035296_0310_1001C1CA5FA82810"/>"that they ſhould examine themſelves whether they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent them truly of their former ſins, ſtedfaſtly purpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to lead a new life; whether they have a lively faith in God's mere, through Chriſt, with a thankful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his death, and whether they are in chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with all men!"

                     <p>The Lord's Supper was ordained "for a continual remembrance of the ſacrifice and death of Chriſt, and of the benefits which we receive thereby." The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which we receive from the death of Chriſt, are therefore one of the chief ſubjects on which we ſhould reflect when we are approaching the table of the Lord
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:035296_0311_1001C1CC19A68B28"/>We ſhould conſider that we are now about to comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate the death of that Savior who died for us, <hi>the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God: who was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our iniquities, and the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and by his ſtripes we are healed. All we like ſheep had gone aſtray; but the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</hi> Let it never be forgotten when we go to the table of the Lord that we ſhould go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the very character of ſinners. In this reſpect there is no difference, <hi>for all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God, being juſtified freely by his grace, thro' the redemption that is in Jeſus, whom God has ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him who believeth in Jeſus.</hi> Chriſt is that <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> a Lamb <hi>without blemiſh and without ſpot,</hi> which has been offered up as a bleeding ſacrifice, and <hi>which taketh away the ſins of the world. Take, eat, this is my body, which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for you,</hi> and <hi>this is my blood which is ſhed for you for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Unto him, therefore, we are to look, and through the exerciſe of this faith in Chriſt, and not <hi>through our own works or deſervings,</hi> we are to hope for pardon. <hi>There is, therefore now no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit.

                     <head>On the character and conduct which becomes us after having received the Sacrament.</head>
                     <p>Preſuming the reader to be a member of the church of England, we will here more particularly remind him
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:035296_0312_1001A3A5F95C5380"/>of a few paſſages in the Sacramental ſervice provided by our Church. In that ſervice we are ſuppoſed to ſay, "We do not preſume to come to this thy table, O mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Lord! truſting in our own righteouſneſs, but in thy manifold and great mercies." Now have we been ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in uttering theſe words? Let us beware then how we afterwards talk of the innocence of our lives and the goodneſs of our hearts, and how we boaſt of our character and our honor as worldly people do; let us take care that we never put any part of our confidence in that righteouſneſs which we have profeſſed in thoſe words to renounce. Humility, meekneſs, patience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, loving kindneſs and charity, a diſpoſition to forgive injuries and to take reproofs without anger, contentment with our lot, and ſubmiſſion under the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting hand of Providence, all theſe are tempers which cannot fail to ariſe out of an habitual ſenſe of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, and they are the tempers therefore which become a communicant; nor is there any doubt that every ſincere communicant will find theſe tempers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in him through his frequent attendance at the Lord's table.</p>
                     <p>Again, we are ſuppoſed by another part of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice moſt humbly to declare, "We do moſt earneſtly repent, and are heartily ſorry for theſe our miſdoings. The remembrance of them is grievous unto us, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of them is intolerable." But how falſe and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical ſhould we ſuſpect ourſelves to have been in theſe words, if we ſeldom afterwards feel any ſorrow for our ſins, if we neglect the duty of habitual repentance, and if we pretend that Chriſt with ſave us, or that the mere Sacrament will ſave us, without our feeling in our hearts any great hatred of iniquity. Let us therefore never think after we have pronounced thoſe words, that ſin can be counted too great an evil, that temptations to ſin can be too much avoided, that repentance can ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be too deep or ſerious, or that things in this reſpect can, as the world imagine, be ever carried too far.</p>

Once more—we are ſuppoſed at the end of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice each of us to declare, "and here we offer and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto thee ourſelves, and ſouls and bodies, to be a reaſonable, holy, and lively ſacrifice unto thee." Do we then indeed and in truth thus devote ourſelves to God? To have ſaid theſe words, and to have repeated them again and again at the Sacrament, is to have done little. By theſe words it is meant, not only that a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſervice ſhould be performed, and that a moment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary feeling ſhould be expreſſed, but it is intended alſo to imply that we purpoſe actually to employ all our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and faculties, whether of body or of ſoul, our time, our wealth, our abilities, and our influence in the cauſe of our Maker and our Redeemer; for <hi>we are not our own, but are bought with a price;</hi> a life really laid out in the ſervice of God is therefore to be expected in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant. To redeem each precious moment of our time by employing it in whatever is our moſt proper and moſt urgent work, to ſhake off our natural indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and ſloth, and to go from the Lord's table into ſcenes of diligence and uſefulneſs: thus to join together the love of God and of man, and to be active as well as to be devout, is to be conſiſtent in our character as chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>If then we have attended at the table of the Lord, <hi>let us not forget to do good, and to diſtribute;</hi> for theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are <hi>ſacrifices with which God is well pleaſed.</hi> Let us not only pour out our hearts in prayer, but let us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo employ our active powers in the Lord's ſervice. <hi>Let us be ſtedfaſt, immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.</hi> Let us <hi>keep under our body, and bring it into ſubjection.</hi> Let us command our paſſions, and reſtrain our tongues.

                  <head>THE HISTORY OF MR. FANTOM, THE NEW FASHIONED PHILOSOPHER, AND HIS MAN WILLIAM.</head>
                  <p>MR. FANTOM was a retail trader in the city of London. As he had no turn to any expenſive vices, he was reckoned a ſober, decent man, but he was covetous and proud, ſelfiſh and conceited. As ſoon as he got forward in the world, his vanity began to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play itſelf, but not in the ordinary method of making a figure, and living away; but ſtill he was tormented with a longing deſire to draw public notice, and to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh himſelf. He felt a general ſenſe of diſcontent at what he was, with a general ambition to be ſomething which he was not; but this deſire had not yet turned it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to any particular object. It was not by his money he could hope to be diſtinguiſhed, for half his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance had more, and a man muſt be rich indeed, to be noted for his riches in London. Mr. Fantom's mind was a prey to vain imaginations. He deſpiſed all thoſe little acts of kindneſs and charity which every man is called to perform every day, and while he was contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> grand ſchemes which lay quite out of his reach, he
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:035296_0315_1001C1DC552690E8"/>neglected the ordinary duties of life which lay directly before him.</p>
                  <p>About this time he got hold of a famous little book written by the new philoſopher, whoſe peſtilent doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines found a ready entrance into Mr. Fantom's mind; a mind at once ſhallow and inquiſitive, ſpeculative and vain, ambitious and diſſatisfied. As almoſt every book was new to him, he fell into the common error of thoſe who begin to read late in life, that of thinking that what he did not know himſelf was equally new to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and he was apt to fancy that he and the author he was reading were the only two people in the world who knew any thing. This book led to the grand diſcovery; he had now found what his heart panted after, a way to <hi>diſtinguiſh himſelf.</hi> To ſtart out a full grown philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher at once, to be wiſe without education, to diſpute without learning, and to make proſelytes without ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, was a ſhort cut to fame; which well ſuited his vanity and his ignorance. He rejoiced that he had been ſo clever as to examine for himſelf, pitied his friends who took things upon truſt, and was reſolved to aſſert the freedom of his own mind. To a man fond of bold novelties and daring paradoxes, ſolid argument would be flat, and truth would be dull, merely becauſe it is not new. Mr. Fantom believed, not in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſtrength of the evidence, but to the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the aſſertion. The trampling on holy ground with dirty ſhoes, the ſmearing the ſanctuary with filth and mire, the calling prophets and apoſtles by the moſt ſcurrilous names, was new, and daſhing, and dazzling. Mr. Fantom now being ſet free from the chains of ſlavery and ſuperſtition, was reſolved to ſhow his zeal in the uſual way, by trying to free others, but it would have hurt his vanity had he known that he was the convert of a man who had written only for the vulgar, who had invented nothing, no, not even one idea of original wickedneſs; but who had ſtooped to rake up
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:035296_0316_1001C1E273534070"/>out of the kennel of infidelity, all the loathſome dregs and offal dirt, which politer unbelievers had thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as too groſs and offenſive for their better bred rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Fantom, who conſidered that a philoſopher muſt ſet up with a little ſort of ſtock in trade, now pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up all the common place notions againſt chriſtianity, which have been anſwered a hundred times over: theſe he kept by him ready cut and dried, and brought ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in all companies with a zeal which would have done honor to a better cauſe, but which the friends to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cauſe are not ſo apt to diſcover. He ſoon got all the cant of the new ſchool. He talked of narrowneſs, and ignorance, and bigotry, and prejudice, and prieſt caſt, on the one hand; and on the other of public good, the love of mankind, and liberality, and candor, and tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and above all, benevolence. Benevolence, he ſaid, made up the whole of religion, and all the other parts of it were nothing but cant, and jargon, and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy. Finding, however, that he made little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on his old club at the Cat and Bagpipes, he grew tired of their company, yet there was one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber whoſe ſociety he could not reſolve to give up, tho' they ſeldom agreed, as indeed no two men in the ſame claſs and habits of life could leſs reſemble each other.— Mr. Trueman was an honeſt, plain, ſimple hearted tradeſman of the good old cut, who feared God and followed his buſineſs, he went to church twice on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, and minded his ſhop all the week, ſpent frugally, gave liberally, and ſaved moderately.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Fantom reſolved to retire for a while into the country, and devote his time to his new plans, ſchemes, theories, and projects for the public good. A life of talking, and reading, and writing, and diſputing, and teaching, and proſelyting now ſtruck him as the only life, ſo he ſoon ſet out for the country with his family, to which was now added his new footman, William
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:035296_0317_1001C1E7D4F79D60"/>Wilſon, whom he had taken with a good character out of a ſober family. He was no ſooner ſettled than he wrote to invite Mr. Trueman to come and pay him a viſit, for he would have burſt if he could not have got ſome one to whom he might diſplay his new knowledge. He knew that if on the one hand, Trueman was no ſcholar, yet on the other he was no fool, and though he deſpiſed his prejudices, yet he thought he might be made a good decoy duck, for if he could once bring Trueman over, the whole club at the Cat and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes might be brought to follow his example, and thus he might ſee himſelf at the head of a ſociety of his own proſelytes, the ſupreme object of a philoſopher's ambition. Trueman came accordingly. He ſoon found that however he might be ſhocked at the impious doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines his friend maintained, yet that an important les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might be learnt even from the worſt enemies of truth; namely, an ever-wakeful attention to their grand object. If they ſet out with talking of trade or poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics; of private news or public affairs, ſtill Mr. Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom was ever on the watch to hitch in his darling doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines; whatever he began with, he was ſure to end with a pert ſquib at the Bible, a vapid jeſt on the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, the miſeries of ſuperſtition, and the bleſſings of philoſophy. "Oh!" ſaid Trueman to himſelf, "when ſhall I ſee chriſtians half ſo much in earneſt? Why is it that almoſt all zeal is on the wrong ſide?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, Mr. Fantom," ſaid Trueman next day at breakfeaſt, "I am afraid you are leading but an idle ſort of life here." "Sir," ſaid Fantom, "I now begin to live to ſome purpoſe; I have indeed loſt too much time, and waſted my talents on a little retail trade, in which one is of no note; one can't diſtinguiſh one's ſelf." "So much the better," ſaid Trueman, "I had rather not diſtinguiſh myſelf, unleſs it was by leading a better life than my neighbors. There is nothing I ſhould dread more than being talked about. I dare ſay now heaven is in a good meaſure filled with people
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:035296_0318_1001C1EE7285F1D8"/>whoſe names were never heard out of their own ſtreet or village. So I beg leave not to diſtinguiſh myſelf." "Yes, but one may if it is only by ſigning one's name to an eſſay or a paragraph in a newſpaper," ſaid Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. "Heaven keep John Trueman's name out of a newſpaper," interrupted he in a fright, "for it muſt either be found in the Old Bailey or the Bankrupt Liſt, unleſs indeed, I were to remove ſhop, or ſell off my old ſtock." "But in your preſent confined ſituation you can be of no uſe," ſaid Fantom. "That I deny," interrupted the other. "I have filled all the pariſh of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices with ſome credit. I never took a bribe at an elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no, not ſo much as a treat; I take care of my apprentices, and don't ſet them a bad example by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to plays and Sadler's Wells in the week, or jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about in a gig all day on Sundays; for I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it that the country jaunt of the maſter on Sundays expoſes his ſervants to more danger than their whole week's temptations in trade put together."</p>

Indeed, from the reeling gait of ſome of them when they go back at night, one might take them for a certain ſect called the <hi>tipling</hi> philoſophers. Then in anſwer to your charge, that a little tradeſman can do no good, I muſt tell you that I belong to the ſociety for relieving priſoners for ſmall debts, and to the ſick man's friend, and to.—</p>

                     <p>Sir, I have a plan in my head for relieving the miſeries of the whole world. Every thing is bad as it now ſtands. I would alter all the laws, and do away all the religions, and put an end to all the wars in the world. I would every where redreſs the injuſtice of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or what the vulgar call providence. I would put an end to all puniſhments, I would not leave a ſingle priſoner on the face of the globe. This is what I call doing things on a grand ſcale. "A ſcale with a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance," ſaid Trueman. "As to releaſing the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, however, I don't ſo much like that, as it would be pleaſing a few rogues at the expence of all honeſt men;
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:035296_0320_1001C1F9EE5E0E60"/>but as to the reſt of your plan, if all chriſtian countries would be ſo good as to turn chriſtians, it might be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a good deal. There would be ſtill miſery enough left indeed, becauſe God intended this world ſhould be earth and not heaven. But ſtill, baniſhing irreligion from the world would be like ſtriking off all the pounds from an over charged bill; and all the troubles which would be left, would be reduced to mere ſhillings, pence, and farthings, as one may ſay."</p>

                     <p>Sir, I have no projects. Projects are in general the offspring of reſtleſsneſs, vanity, and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I am too buſy for projects, too contented for theories, and I hope, have too much humility for a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher. The utmoſt extent of my ambition at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is, to redreſs the wrongs of a pariſh 'prentice who has been cruelly uſed by his maſter; indeed, I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother little ſcheme, which is to proſecute a fellow in our ſtreet who has let a poor wretch in a work-houſe, of which he had the care, periſh through neglect, and you muſt aſſiſt me.</p>

It is provinces, empires, continents, that the benevolence of the philoſopher embraces; every one can do a little pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try good to his next neighbor.</p>

                     <p>Every one can, but I don't ſee every one does. If they would, indeed, your buſineſs would be ready done to your hands, and your grand ocean of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence would be filled with the drops which private charity would throw into it. I am glad, however, you are ſuch a friend to the priſoners, becauſe I am juſt now getting a little ſubſcription from our club, to ſet free your poor old friend, Tom Saunders, a very honeſt
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:035296_0321_1001C2010606EC48"/>brother tradeſman, who firſt got into debt and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to gaol, through no fault of his own, but merely thro' the preſſure of the times. We have each of us allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a trifle every week towards maintaining Tom's young family ſince he has been in priſon, but we think we ſhall do much more ſervice to Saunders, and indeed in the end lighten our own expence, by paying down at once a little ſum to reſtore to him the comforts of life and put him in a way of maintaining his family a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. We have made up the money all except five guineas, I am already promiſed four, and you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do but to give me the fifth. And ſo for a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle guinea, without any of the trouble, the meetings, and the looking into his affairs, which we have had, you will at once have the pleaſure (and it is no ſmall one) of helping to ſave a worthy family from ſtarving, of redeeming an old friend from gaol, and of putting a little of your boaſted benevolence into action. Realize! maſter Fantom, there is nothing like realizing. "Why hearkee, Mr. Trueman," ſaid Fantom ſtammering, and looking very black, "don't think I value a guinea; no Sir, I deſpiſe money, 'tis traſh, 'tis dirt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the regard of a wiſe man. 'Tis one of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling inventions of artificial ſociety. Sir I could talk to you for half a day on the abuſe of riches, and on my own contempt of money.</p>

                     <p>O pray don't give yourſelf the trouble, it will be an eaſier way by half of proving both, juſt to put your hand in your pocket and give me the guinea without ſaying a word about it; and then to you who value time ſo much and money ſo little, it will cut the matter ſhort. But come now (for I ſee you will give nothing) I ſhould be mighty glad to know what is the ſort of good you do yourſelves, ſince you always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to what is done by others. "Sir," ſaid Mr. Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, "the object of a true philoſopher is to diffuſe light
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:035296_0322_1001C2046345C900"/>and knowledge. I wiſh to ſee the whole world enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened."</p>

                     <p>Amen! if you mean with the light of the goſpel. But if you mean that one religion is as good as another, and that no religion is the beſt of all; in ſhort, if you want to make the whole world philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, why they had better ſtay as they are. But as to the true light, I wiſh it to reach the very loweſt, and I therefore bleſs God for charity ſchools, as inſtruments of diffuſing it.</p>
                     <p>Fantom, who had no reaſon to expect that his friend was going to call upon him for a ſubſcription on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ventured to praiſe them, ſaying, "I am no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy to theſe inſtitutions. I would indeed change the object of inſtruction, but I would have the whole world inſtructed."</p>
                     <p>Here Mrs. Fantom, who with her daughter had qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly ſat by at their work, ventured to put in a word, a liberty ſhe ſeldom took with her huſband, who in his zeal to make the whole world free and happy, was too prudent to include his wife. "Then my dear," ſaid ſhe, "I wonder you don't let your own ſervants be taught a little. The maids can ſcarcely tell a letter, or ſay the Lord's prayer; and you know you won't allow them time to learn. William too has never been at church ſince we came out of town. He was at firſt very orderly and obedient, but now he is ſeldom ſober of an evening, and in the morning when he ſhould be rubbing the tables in the parlor, he is generally lolling upon them and reading your little manual of the new philoſophy." "Mrs. Fantom," ſaid her huſband an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grily, "you know that my labors for the public good, leave me little time to think of my own family. I muſt have a great field, I like to do good to hundreds at once."</p>
                     <p>"I am very glad of that papa," ſaid Miſs Polly, "for then I hope you won't refuſe to ſubſcribe to all thoſe
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:035296_0323_1001C206940BAB08"/>pretty children at the Sunday ſchool as you did yeſterday, when the gentleman came a begging, becauſe that is the very thing you were wiſhing for; there are two or three hundred to be done good to at once."</p>

                     <p>Well Mr. Fantom, you are a wonderful man to keep up ſuch a ſtock of benevolence at ſo ſmall an expence. To love mankind ſo dearly and yet avoid all opportunities of doing them good; to have ſuch a noble zeal for the millions, and to feel ſo little compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the units; ſurely none but a philoſopher could indulge ſo much philanthropy and ſo much frugality at the ſame time.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fantom.</speaker>
                     <p>I deſpiſe the man whoſe benevolence is ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the narrow concerns of his own family, or pariſh, or country.</p>

                     <speaker>Trueman.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, now I have a notion that 'tis as well to do one's own duty as that of another man, and to do good at home as well as abroad, and I had as lieve help Tom Saunders to freedom as a Pole or a South American, though I ſhould be very glad to help them too, but one muſt begin to love ſomewhere, and to do good ſomewhere; and I think 'tis as natural to love one's own family and to do good in one's own neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood as to any body elſe. And if every man in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry family, pariſh, and county, did the ſame, why! all the ſchemes would meet, and the end of one pariſh where I was doing good, would be the beginning of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where ſomebody elſe was doing good; ſo my ſchemes would jut into my neighbors, and all would fit with a ſort of dove-tail exactneſs.</p>
                     <p>Here they were told dinner was on table. "Don't think," ſaid Mr. Fantom, "that you have the beſt of the argument, becauſe you happen to have the laſt word. We will finiſh our talk ſome other time." So ſaying they went in to dinner.</p>
                     <p>When t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> ſat down, Mr. Fantom was not a little out of humor, to ſee his table in ſome diſorder. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:035296_0324_1001C20C72EAD9E0"/>was alſo rather more negligent than uſual. If the company called for bread, he gave them beer, and he took away the clean plates, and gave them dirty ones. Mr. Fantom ſoon diſcovered that his ſervant was very drunk; he flew into a violent paſſion, and ordered him out of the room, charging that he ſhould not appear in his preſence in that condition. William obeyed; but having ſlept an hour or two, and got about half ſober, he again made his appearance. His maſter gave him a ſevere reprimand, and called him an idle, drunken, vicious fellow. "Sir," ſaid William, very pertly, "if I do get drunk now and then, I only do it for the good of my country, and in obedience to your wiſhes." Mr. Fantom, thoroughly provoked, now began to ſcold him in words not fit to be repeated, and aſked him what he meant. "Why, Sir," ſaid William, "you are a philoſopher you know, and I have often over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard you ſay to your company, that private vices are public benefits, and ſo I thought that getting drunk was as pleaſant a way of doing good to the public as any, eſpecially when I could oblige my maſter at the ſame time."</p>
                     <p>"Get out of my houſe," ſaid Mr. Fantom, in a great rage. "I do not deſire to ſtay a moment longer, ſo pay me my wages." "Not I, indeed," replied the maſter, "nor will I give you a character, ſo never let me ſee your face again." William took his maſter at his word, and not only got out of the houſe, but out of the country too as faſt as poſſible. When they found he was really gone, they made a hue-and-cry, in order to detain him till they had examined if he had left eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in the houſe as he had found it. But William had got out of reach, knowing he could not ſtand ſuch a ſcrutiny. On examination, Mr. Fantom found that all his port was gone, and Mrs. Fantom miſſed three of her beſt new ſpoons. William was purſued, but without ſucceſs, and Mr. Fantom was ſo much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed,
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:035296_0325_1001C2127AB37358"/>that he could not for the reſt of the day talk of any thing but his wine and his ſpoons, nor harangue on any project but that of recovering both by bringing William to juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Some days paſt away, in which Mr. Fantom having had time to cool, began to be aſhamed that he had been betrayed into ſuch ungoverned paſſion. He made the beſt excuſe he could, ſaid no man was perfect, and though he owned he had been too violent, yet he ſtill hoped William would be brought to the puniſhment he deſerved. "In the mean time," ſaid Mr. Trueman, "ſeeing how ill philoſophy has agreed with your man, ſuppoſe you were to ſet about teaching your maids a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle religion?" Mr. Fantom coolly replied, "that the impertinent retort of a drunken footman could not ſpoil a ſyſtem." "Your ſyſtem, however, and your own behavior," ſaid Trueman, "have made that footman a ſcoundrel; and you are anſwerable for his offences."— "Not I, truly," ſaid Fantom, "he has ſeen me do no harm; he has neither ſeen me cheat, gamble, nor get drunk: and I defy you to ſay I corrupt my ſervants. I am a moral man, Sir." "Mr. Fantom," ſaid True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, "if you were to get drunk every day, and game every night, you would indeed endanger your own ſoul, and give a dreadful example to your family; but great as thoſe ſins are, and God forbid that I ſhould attempt to leſſen them, ſtill they are not worſe, nay, they are not ſo bad as the peſtilent doctrines with which you infect your houſe and your neighborhood. A bad action is like a ſingle murder, but a wicked principle is throwing lighted gun powder into a town, it is poiſoning a river; there are no bounds, no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, no end to its miſchief. The ill effects of the worſt action may ceaſe in time, and the conſequences of your example may end with your life; but ſouls may be bro't to perdition by a wicked principle, after the author of it has been dead for ages.</p>

I don't want any of your farthing candle philoſophy in the broad ſun-ſhine of the goſpel, Mr. Fantom. My bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tells me that <hi>God is love,</hi> not merely loving, but <hi>love.</hi> Now do you think a being whoſe very eſſence is love, would permit any miſery among his children here, if it was not to be ſome way or other, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where or other, for their good? You forget too that in a world where there is ſin there muſt be miſery.—Then, too, I ſuppoſe, God permits miſery partly to exerciſe the ſufferers, and partly to try the proſperous; for by trouble God corrects ſome and tries others.—Suppoſe now, Tom Saunders had not been put in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, you and I—no, I beg pardon, <hi>you</hi> ſaved your guinea: well then, our club and I could not have ſhown our kindneſs by getting him out, nor would poor Saunders himſelf have had an opportunity of exerciſing his own patience under want and impriſonment. So you ſee one reaſon why God permits miſery is, that good men may have an opportunity of leſſening it."—Mr. Fantom replied, "There is no object which I have more at heart; I have as I told you a plan in my head of ſuch univerſal benevolence as to include the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:035296_0327_1001C21B97CFFE38"/>of all mankind." "Mr. Fantom," ſaid Trueman, "I feel that I have a general good will towards all my brethren of mankind; and if I had as much money in my purſe as I have love in my heart, I truſt I ſhould prove it; all I ſay is, that in a ſtation of life where I can't do much, I am more called upon to procure the happineſs of a poor neighbor who has no one elſe to look to, than to form wild plans for the good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind too extenſive to be accompliſhed, and too chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical to be put in practice.

                  <p>Some weeks after a letter was brought to Mr. Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom from his late ſervant William, who had been turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away for drunkenneſs, as related in the former part of this hiſtory, and who had alſo robbed his maſter of ſome wine and ſome ſpoons. Mr. Fantom glancing his eye over the letter ſaid, "it is dated from Chelmsford jail; that raſcal is got into priſon. I am glad of it with all my heart, it is the fitteſt place for ſuch ſcoundrels. I hope he will be ſent to Botany Bay, if not hanged." "O ho! my good friend," ſaid Trueman, "then I find that in aboliſhing all priſons you would juſt let one ſtand for the accommodation of thoſe who ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to rob <hi>you.</hi>" Mr. Fantom drily obſerved, that he was not fond of jokes, and proceeded to read the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It expreſſed an earneſt wiſh that his late maſter would condeſcend to pay him one viſit in his dark and doleful abode, as he wiſhed to ſay a few words to him before the dreadful ſentence of the law, which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been pronounced, ſhould be executed."</p>
                  <p>"Let us go and ſee the poor fellow," ſaid Trueman, "it is but a morning's ride. If he is really ſo near his end, it would be cruel to refuſe him." "Not I truly," ſaid Fantom, "he deſerves nothing at my hands but the halter he is likely to meet with. Such port as is
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:035296_0328_1001C222C98E4DE8"/>not to be had for money, and the ſpoons part of my new dozen." "As to the wine," ſaid Trueman, "I am afraid you muſt give that up, but the only way to get any tidings of the ſpoons is to go and hear what he has to ſay; I have no doubt but he will make ſuch a confeſſion as may be very uſeful to others, which, you know, is one grand advantage of puniſhments; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we may afford him ſome little comfort." "As to comfort he deſerves none from me," ſaid Fantom, "and as to his confeſſions they can be of no uſe to me, but as they give me a chance of getting my ſpoons, ſo I don't much care if I do take a ride with you."</p>
                  <p>When they came to the priſon Mr. Trueman's ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heart ſunk within him. He deplored the corrupt nature of man, which makes ſuch rigorous confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment needful, not merely for the puniſhment of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, but for the ſafety of ſociety. Fantom, from mere trick and habit, was juſt preparing a ſpeech on general benevolence, and the cruelty of impriſonment, till the recollection of his old port and his new ſpoons cooled his ardor, and he went on without ſaying a word. When they reached the cell where the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py William was confined, they ſtopped at the door.—The poor wretch had thrown himſelf on the ground as well as his chains would give him leave. He groaned piteouſly, and was ſo ſwallowed up wich a ſenſe of his own miſeries, that he neither heard the door open, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> an agony which made his words hardly intelligible. Thus much they could make out—"God be merciful to me a ſinner—the chief of ſinners!" then ſuddenly attempting to ſtart up, but prevented by his irons, he roared out, "O God! thou canſt <hi>not</hi> be merciful to me for I have denied thee; I have ridiculed my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour who died for me; I have derided his word, I have reſiſted his ſpirit. I have laughed at that heaven which is ſhut againſt me, I have denied thoſe torments
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:035296_0329_1001C22840F17098"/>which await me. To-morrow! to-morrow! O for a longer ſpace for repentance, O for a ſhort reprieve from hell." Mr. Trueman wept ſo loud that it drew the attention of the criminal, who now lifted up his eyes, and caſt on his late maſter a look ſo dreadful, that Fantom wiſhed for a moment that he had given up all hope of the ſpoons rather than have expoſed himſelf to ſuch a ſcene. At length the poor wretch, ſaid, in a voice that would have melted a heart of ſtone, "O Sir, are you there? I did wiſh to ſee you before my dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſentence is put in execution. O Sir! to-morrow, to-morrow! But I have a confeſſion to make to you." This revived Mr. Fantom, who again ventured to glance a hope at the ſpoons. "Sir," ſaid William, "I could not die without making my confeſſion." "Aye, and reſtitution too I hope," replied Fantom. "Where are my ſpoons?"—"Sir, they are gone with the reſt of my wretched booty. But O Sir! theſe ſpoons make ſo petty an article in my black account that I hardly think of them. Murder, Sir, murder is the crime for which I am juſtly doomed to die. O Sir! Who can dwell with everlaſting burnings?" As this was a ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which even a philoſopher could not anſwer, Mr. Fantom was going to ſteal off, eſpecially as he now gave up all hope of the ſpoons: but William called him back. "Stay, Sir, ſtay, I conjure you, as you will anſwer it at the bar of God. You are the cauſe of my being about to ſuffer a ſhameful death. Yes, Sir, you made me a drunkard, a thief, and a murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er." "How dare you, William," cried Mr. Fantom, with great emotion, "accuſe me with being the cauſe of ſuch horrid crimes?" "Sir," anſwered the criminal, "from you I learnt the principles which lead to thoſe crimes. By the grace of God I ſhould never have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into ſins deſerving of the gallows if I had not often overheard you ſay there was no hereafter, no judgment, no future reckoning, O Sir! there is a hell, dreadful,
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:035296_0330_1001C22CC01EF5C8"/>inconceivable, eternal!" Here through the exceſs of anguiſh, the poor fellow fainted away. Mr. Fantom, who did not at all reliſh this ſcene, ſaid to his friend, "well Sir, we will go if you pleaſe, for you ſee there is nothing to be done."</p>
                  <p>"Sir," replied Mr. Trueman, mournfully, "you may go if you pleaſe, but I ſhall ſtay, for I ſee there is a great deal to be done. "What," rejoined the other, "do you think it poſſible his life can be ſaved?" "No, indeed," ſaid Trueman, "but I hope it is poſſible his ſoul may be ſaved." I don't underſtand theſe things," ſaid Fantom, making towards the door. "Nor I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther", ſaid Trueman, "but as a fellow ſinner I am bound to do what I can for this poor fellow. Do you go home Mr. Fantom, and finiſh your treatiſe on uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal benevolence, and the bleſſed effects of philoſophy; and hark ye, be ſure you let the frontiſpiece of your book repreſent <hi>William on the gibbet;</hi> that will be what our parſon calls a <hi>practical illuſtration.</hi> You know I hate theories; this is <hi>realiving;</hi> this is philoſophy made eaſy to the meaneſt capacity."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Fantom ſneaked off to finiſh his work at home, and Mr. Trueman ſtaid to finiſh his in the priſon. He paſſed the night with the wretched convict, he prayed with him and for him, and read to him the penitential pſalms, and ſome portions of the goſpel. But he was too humble and too prudent a man to venture out of his depth by arguments and conſolations which he was not warranted to uſe. This he left for the miniſter.—But he preſſed on William the great duty of making the only amends now in his power to thoſe whom he had led aſtray. They then drew up the following paper which Mr. Trueman got printed, and gave away at the place of execution.</p>

                              <p>I was bred up in the fear of God, and lived with credit in many ſober families, in which I was a faithful ſervant. But being tempted by a little higher wages, I left a good place to go and live with Mr. Fantom, who, however, made good none of his fine promiſes, but proved a hard maſter. In his ſervice I was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed time to go to church. This troubled me at firſt, till I overheard my maſter ſay, that going to church was a ſuperſtitious prejudice, and only meant for the vulgar. Upon this I reſolved to go no more; for I thought there could not be two religions, one for the maſter, and one for the ſervant. Finding my maſter never prayed, I too left off praying, this gave Satan great power over me, ſo that I from that time fell into almoſt every ſin. I was very uneaſy at firſt, and my conſcience gave me no reſt; but I was ſoon reconciled by overhearing my maſter and another gentleman ſay, that death was only a long ſleep, and hell and judgment were but an invention of prieſts to keep the poor in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I mention this as a warning to all maſters and miſtreſſes to take care what they converſe about while ſervants are waiting at table. They cannot tell how many ſouls they have ſent to perdition by ſuch looſe talk. The crime for which I die is the natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the principles I learnt of my maſter. A rich man, indeed, who throws off religion, may eſcape the gallows, becauſe want does not drive him to commit the crimes which lead to it; but what ſhall reſtrain a needy man, who has been taught that there is no dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reckoning? Oh, my dear fellow ſervants! take warning by my ſad fate, never be tempted away from a ſober ſervice for the ſake of a little more wages.

                  <p>Mr. Trueman would never leave this poor penitent till he was launched into eternity, but attended him with the miniſter in the Cart. This pious miniſter never cared to tell what he thought of William's ſtate.—When I ventured to mention my hope, that though his penitence was late yet it was ſincere, and ſpoke of the dying thief on the croſs as a ground of encouragement, the miniſter, with a very ſerious look, made me this anſwer, "Sir, that inſtance is too often brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on occaſions to which it does not apply: I do not chooſe to ſay any thing to your application of it in the preſent caſe, but I will anſwer you in the words of a good man ſpeaking of the penitent thief."

                  <p>THE oldeſt man living at Compton-Aſhby, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not call to mind ſuch another hubbub as that which happened there ſome months ago, on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, juſt before the poor-houſe door. A number of men, women, and children, had formed a ring round one farmer Ruſſel, a ſullen, down-looking fellow, whom no one loved and every one feared; for his love of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney had led him to be hard-hearted, and his power over the poor had made him inſolent. Never was there ſuch a hiſſing and hooting, and hallooing heard. Many of theſe people had been grievouſly oppreſſed by the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and now they had him in their power, they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſolved to ſhew him little mercy.</p>
                  <p>Betty Jobbins beat the frying-pan with the key of the door, Sally Gore pounded the peſtle and mortar, Nelly Shepſton rung the warming-pan, Dick Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire blew the Ram's-horn, whilſt Nick Stafford and others gingled the ſheeps' bells. It ſo happened that one Mr. Britton rode up at the inſtant to enquire what was the matter, of two poor women who were ſitting in the porch of the poor-houſe. One of them, Amy Talbot, ſeemed to be about ſixty years of age, but time
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:035296_0334_1001C23EC2231E80"/>had not cured Amy of goſſiping, or taught her to mend her cloaths. As ſhe had no turn for induſtry in her youth, ſhe ſoon eat and drank up the little property left her by her parents, which might now have afforded her a comfortable maintenance; but no, Amy's tongue was always abuſive and always buſy, whilſt her fingers were ſeldom employed. Wherever there was a goſſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the pariſh, thither ran Amy with her rags flying about her, like a ſcare-crow in a cherry tree. Her ſkin which was quite tawny, was never waſhed; her hair had worked itſelf thro' the holes of her mob, half the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of which was loſt, and the flaps of it were always flying behind her; the pigs had one day eaten a hole thro' her hat as it lay on the ground, and a piece of it now hung over her eye like a black patch, her petticoats were all tatters, and her gown reached but little below her knees; it had been torn away bit by bit, till it was ravelled out to the above dimenſions; her ſtockings had no feet, and her feet were ſlipped into a miſerable pair of ſhoes, which ſhe had not taken the trouble to draw up at heel, even when they were new; in one hand ſhe clenched her rags together, whilſt with the other, ſhe held a ſhort pipe in her mouth reſting her elbow on her knee, as ſhe ſat croſs-legged.</p>
                  <p>The other poor woman whoſe name was Apſley, was of a very different caſt from Amy; ſhe was the picture of cleanlineſs and good houſewifery; ſhe was mending her apron, which though very coarſe, was as white as the driven ſnow; this good woman never ſat at the door to take the air, but ſhe was doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; "it is a duty," ſhe would ſay, "to turn our time to the beſt account we can," and when her other employment was over ſhe would read a chapter in her bible. Mr. Britton aſked her what occaſioned the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, and at the ſame time ſlipped half a crown into her hand, giving afterwards a few half-pence to Amy, which he thought was more than ſuch a dirty woman deſerved.</p>

"Why Sir, cried Amy, pocketing her pence, "I'll tell you all how and about it; don't you ſee that ſulky <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Then ſhe fell to hooting and hiſſing, till ſhe foamed at the mouth again; which having wiped off with the corner of her gown, ſhe ſaid, "now Sir, I'll tell you: that fellow's ſtomach has been well filled with every thing of the beſt, whilſt he has ſtarved we poor almoſt to death, but 'tis likely to come home to him at laſt, and he may chance to ſwing for it, and then we ſhall all be revenged of him," and again ſhe fell to clapping her hands.</p>
                  <p>"Prithee Amy," replied dame Apſley very camly, "don't give way to ſuch evil tempers; we have been hardly uſed by the farmer to be ſure, but if we are chriſtians, we muſt learn to forget and forgive." "If ever I forgive the villain," cried Amy, knocking the duſt out of her pipe, "may I never get another quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of tobacco; revenge is ſweet, Sir, revenge is ſweet."</p>
                  <p>"To an unchriſtian temper I grant it is," ſaid Mr. Britton, "but revenge is the worſt paſſion that can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the human breaſt, it is the very ſpirit of Satan."</p>
                  <p>"It is a very fine remark truly, Sir," ſaid dame Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſley, "for to my thinking, a man who is always nurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up an evil paſſion in his boſom, is as if he cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſerpent there, which muſt ſting him to death at laſt; yet, Sir, I muſt be bold to ſay, much as I want money, I would not accept of ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>"Nor perhaps much better," anſwered dame Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſley, "for, after all, 'tis a very unthankful office to have much to do with poor people, eſpecially if they have not the fear of God before their eyes; becauſe then they are abuſive, and ungrateful to thoſe who are guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians over them; for the matter of that, Amy, have we not ſeveral old people in this poor houſe, who have been drunken, idle, blaſpheming people all their lives; and though we live ſo near to the church, not one of them has ſeen the inſide of it for many years paſt, unleſs when there has been Chriſtmas gifts' money to be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en away; but I think if I were the parſon, Amy, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lord's day I would drive the whole poſſe into church before me, if they were able to ſet one foo before anothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"My good woman," ſaid Mr. Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, "I am mightily pleaſed to ſee how uſefully you employ your time, for you have continued your work ever ſince we have been chatting together." "Time, Sir, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he gift of God, and I muſt account to him for it; beſides, Sir, often when I am buſily employed at my needle, I can ponder on ſome text of ſcripture; and I can ſay with king David, <hi>As for me, when I am poor and in heavineſs, thy help, O God, ſhall lift me up.</hi> Now, Sir, although I am very poor, that is no reaſon why I ſhould not be very clean; if my clothing be coarſe, that is no excuſe for its being ragged, and if I am lame in my feet, that is no cauſe for my fingers being idle; beſides, Sir, a ſtitch in time ſaves nine, and I frequently get a ſhilling by mending ſtays, or quilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſervants' petticoats, when my health will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! well," interrupted Amy, "I never had the heart to work unleſs I were better paid for it. But I ſay, dame, I will ſay, that I am glad at heart farmer Rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel

Here again Amy began hiſſing and hooting the farmer, inſomuch that Mr. Britton began to think he ſhould never get at the end of the ſtory.</p>
                  <p>"Now, Sir," cried Amy at laſt, whilſt ſhe filled her pipe, "now I have got breath again, I'll tell you all how and about it. You muſt know laſt hard winter. Sir, when bread was ſo dear, and coals were ſo ſcarce, farmer Ruſſel would not let the pariſh be at the expence of mending the thatch on our houſe, ſo that when the ſnow melted it ran in ſtreams down on dame's bed, by which ſhe loſt the uſe of her limbs, and ſhe has hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with crutches ever ſince: yet ſhe, fooliſh woman, ſeldom complains: but off ſhe goes to her Bible for comfort, as another body would to a glaſs of gin, or a pot of beer, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>"The troubles of life," ſaid dame Apſley, "are but as ſhadows which paſs away; but the chriſtian's reſt will be eternal: and certain I am, Sir, my weak nature would often have given way to ſinful murmurings, but for the gracious promiſe of better things in the life to come. O! Sir," continued ſhe, "I have found it much more for my ſoul's good, to bleſs Heaven for what I have, than to murmur for what I have not; though, to be ſure, I have ſeen better days," wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron.</p>
                  <p>"Indeed has ſhe, Sir," cried Amy, "for dame's hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was a man well to paſs in the world; he rented a

                  <p>"That I do," replied ſhe, "ſince my bleſſed Saviour not only forgave his enemies, but prayed to his Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father to forgive them alſo; and I ſhould read my Bible to little profit, Amy, if I learnt nothing from ſo bright an example; but, good Sir," ſaid ſhe, turning to Mr. Britton, "your patience muſt be quite tired, not to be yet made acquainted with all the hubbub yonder: but moſt folks are ſo fond of telling their own ſtories, that they do not think of other people. There is, Sir, a poor ſoldier found dead this morning, in the next pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and it is thought that farmer Ruſſel has had ſome concern in the matter, ſo the people are now going to carry him before a juſtice to be examined."</p>
                  <p>"And I hope he will be hanged, I hope he will be hanged," cried Amy, clapping her hands;—"and I hope he will live to repent," cried dame Apſley, wiping her eyes. Mr. Britton's curioſity was now raiſed, and he attended the mob to the juſtice's.</p>

No temptation could ever prevail on his worſhip unjuſtly to favor any man: the laws, he ſaid, muſt take their courſe; if they were found ſevere, he did not make them: it was his duty to adminiſter them.</p>
                  <p>"And, pleaſe your worſhip," cried one Jones, who ſeemed to be the ring-leader of the mob, "we all hope that you will now take revenge for us on the farmer, for all the ſpiteful tricks he has played us."</p>

                  <p>Then turning over a great book, as big as a church bible, the witneſs was called, who depoſed upon oath, that the laſt evening, juſt between light and dark, he ſaw farmer Ruſſel dragging a ſoldier-like looking man over Compton bridge, clear out of his own pariſh into the next, that he there laid him down by the ſide of a ditch; that at firſt he, the witneſs, believed the man to be dead; but that, in a ſhort time, he found the poor fellow had only ſainted through weakneſs; that the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had lent the poor ſoldier all the aſſiſtance in his power; but that he was obliged ſoon after to follow his cattle."</p>
                  <p>Here the witneſs's evidence cloſed. "And could you," ſaid the juſtice to farmer Ruſſel, "drag a poor traveller out of your pariſh in this barbarous manner? In order to ſave your own pariſh a trifling expence, you

                  <p>The farmer then in a ſurly tone replied, "that the man had no buſineſs in his pariſh, and that as for himſelf, no one could ſay he was unkind to the poor, for he paid three times as much to the poor-rates as any man in the pariſh, (the lord of the manor only excepted.)"— "And reaſon good," cried ragged Amy, who had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the mob; "becauſe you are the greateſt renter in it; for by diſhoneſt practices you have got all the ſmall farms into your own hands; but, farmer, no one has heard you ever gave a penny out of your own pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et to the poor, when the laws did not compel you, ſo no thanks for your charity.

                  <p>Many tears were ſhed whilſt Mr. Britton read the letter. "My good friends," ſaid he, when he had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed it, "let me now give you a word of advice:— Whenever a ſick and poor traveller (and eſpecially when a brave Britiſh ſoldier or ſailor, who has ſhed, his blood in fighting for you in foreign parts, and is perhaps eſcaped from an enemy's priſon) knocks at your door to aſk for charity, do not refuſe him a cup of beer, or a plentiful ſlice of bread and cheeſe; to you who abound it is little, to him it may be much; and henceforward let us all learn to look upon every man in diſtreſs as a child or a brother; and let us do by him as we would wiſh to be done by, if we were in his condition. As for you, farmer Ruſſel," continued he "no reproof from me is wanting, for the event that has happened is of itſelf the moſt bitter of all reproofs."</p>
                  <p>"O my ſon! my ſon!" at length cried the farmer, (wringing his hands, and tearing his hair with grief) "my own curſes have brought on my own deſtruction! Wretch! wretch! that I am!" (here attempting to riſe, he ſunk down by the body of his ſon, and then fell into

Rachel was alſo a famous interpreter of dreams, and could diſtinguiſh exactly between the fate of any two perſons who happened to have a mole on the right or the left cheek. She had a cunning way of getting herſelf off when any of her prophecies failed. When ſhe explained a dream according to the natural appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of things, and it did not come to paſs; then ſhe would get out of that ſcrape by ſaying, that "this ſort of dreams went by contraries." Now of two very op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite things the chance always is that one of them may turn out to be tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Rachel in one of her rambles ſtopped at the houſe of Farmer Jenkins. She contrived to call when ſhe knew the maſter of the houſe was from home, which indeed was her uſual way. She knocked at the door; the maids being out hay-making, Mrs. Jenkins went to open it herſelf. Rachel aſked her if ſhe would pleaſe to let her light her pipe? This was a common pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, when ſhe could find no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>er way of getting into a houſe. While ſhe was filling her pipe, ſhe looked at Mrs. Jenkins and ſaid, ſhe could tell her ſome good fortune. The farmer's wife, who was a very inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, but a weak and ſuperſtitious woman, was curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to know what ſhe meant. Rachel then looked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout very carefully, and ſhutting the door with a mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious air, aſked her if ſhe was ſure nobody would hear them. This appearance of myſtery was at once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful and terrifying to Mrs. Jenkins, who bid the cunning woman ſpeak out. "Then," ſaid Rachel, in a ſolemn whiſper, "there is to my certain knowledge a pot of money hid under one of the ſtones in your cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar." "Indeed," ſaid Mrs. Jenkins, "it is impoſſible, for now I think of it, I dreamt laſt night I was in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for debt." "Did you indeed?" ſaid Rachel, "that is quite ſurpriſing. Did you dream before twelve o'clock or after?" "O it was this morning, juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:035296_0347_1001C28787000DA0"/>I awoke. "Then I am ſure it is true, for morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dreams always go by contraries," cried Rachel.— "How lucky it is you dreamt it ſo late." Mrs. Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins could hardly contain her joy, and aſked "how the money was to be come at." "There is but one way," ſaid Rachel, "I muſt go into the cellar. I know by my art under which ſtone it lies, but I muſt not tell." They then both went down into the cellar, but Rachel refuſed to point at the ſtone unleſs Mrs. Jenkins would put five pieces of gold into a baſon and do as ſhe direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The ſimple woman inſtead of turning her out of doors for a cheat, did as ſhe was bid. She put the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas into a baſon which ſhe gave into Rachel's hand.— Rachel ſtrewed ſome white powder over the gold, mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſome barbarous words, and pretended to perform the black art. She then told Mrs. Jenkins to put the baſon quietly down within the cellar; telling her that it ſhe offered to look into it, or even to ſpeak a word, the charm would be broken. She alſo directed her to lock the cellar door, and on no pretence to open it in leſs than forty-eight hours. "If," added ſhe, "you cloſely follow theſe directions, then, by the power of my art, you will find the baſon conveyed to the very ſtone under which the money lies hid, and a fine trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it will be." Mrs. Jenkins who believed every word the woman ſaid, did exactly as ſhe was told, and Rachel took her leave with a handſome reward.</p>
                  <p>When farmer Jenkins came home he deſired his wife to draw him a cup of eider; this ſhe put off doing ſo long that he began to be diſpleaſed. At laſt ſhe beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged he would drink a little beer inſtead. He inſiſted on knowing the reaſon, and when at laſt he grew angry, ſhe told him all that had paſt; and owned that as the pot of gold happened to be in the cider cellar, ſhe did not dare open the door, as ſhe was ſure it would break the charm. "And it would be a pity you know," ſaid ſhe, "to loſe a good fortune for the ſake of a draught of cider."—
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:035296_0348_1001C28C180AA1F0"/>The farmer, who was not ſo eaſily impoſed upon, ſus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a trict. He demanded the key, and went and opened the cellar door. He found the baſon, and in it five round pieces of tin covered with powder. Mrs. Jenkins burſt out a crying; but the farmer thought of nothing but of getting a warrant to apprehend the cunning woman. Indeed ſhe well proved her claim to that name, when ſhe inſiſted that the cellar door might be kept locked till ſhe had time to get out of the reach of all purſuit.</p>

                     </gap>lly was as harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a girl as ever churned a pound of butter; but Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was ignorant and ſuperſtitious. She delighted in dream-books, and had conſulted all the cunning wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the country to tell her whether the two moles on her cheek denoted that ſhe was to have two hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, or only two children. If ſhe picked up an old horſe-ſhoe going to church ſhe was ſure that would be a lucky week. She never made a black-pudding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out borrowing one of the Parſon's old wigs to hang in the chimney, firmly believing there were no other means to preſerve them from burſting. She would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go to bed on Midſummer eve without ſticking up in her room the well known plant called Midſummer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as the bending of the leaves to the right or to the left, would not fail to tell her whether Jacob, of whom we ſhall ſpeak preſently, was true or falſe. She would rather go five miles about than paſs near a church yard at night. Every ſeventh year ſhe would not eat beans becauſe they grew downward in the pod, inſtead of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and ſhe would rather have gone with her gown open than have taken a pin of an old woman, for fear of being bewitched. Poor Sally had ſo many unlucky days in her calendar, that a large portion of her time became of little uſe, becauſe on theſe days ſhe did not dare ſet about any new work. And ſhe would have
<pb facs="unknown:035296_0349_1001C290DFB30550"/>refuſed the beſt offer if made to her on a Friday, which ſhe thought ſo unlucky a day that ſhe often ſaid what a pity it was there were any Friday in the week! Sally had twenty pounds left her by her grandmother. She had long been courted by Jacob, a ſober lad, with whom ſhe lived fellow-ſervant at a creditable farmer's. Honeſt Jacob, like his nameſake of old, thought it lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to wait ſeven years to get this damſel to wife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the love he bore her, for Sally had promiſed to marry him when he could match her twenty pounds with another.</p>
                  <p>Now there was one Robert, a rambling, idle young gardener, who, inſtead of ſitting down ſteadily in one place, uſed to roam about the country, and do odd jobs, where he could get them. No one underſtood any thing about him, except that he was a down-look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fellow, who got his bread nobody knew how, and never had a penny in his pocket. Robert, who was now in the neighborhood, happened to hear of Sally Evans and her twenty pounds. He conceived a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſire for the latter. So he went to his old friend Rachel, told her all he had heard of Sally, and promiſed if ſhe could bring about a marriage between them, ſhe ſhould go ſhares in the money.</p>
                  <p>Rachel undertook the buſineſs. She ſet off to the farm-houſe and fell to ſinging one of her moſt enticing ſongs juſt under the dairy window. Sally was ſo ſtruck with the pretty tune, which was unhappily uſed to ſet off ſome very looſe words, that ſhe jumped up, dropped the ſkimming diſh into the cream and ran out to buy the ſong. While ſhe ſtooped down to rummage the bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket for theſe ſongs which had the moſt tragical pictures, for Sally had a tender heart and delighted in whatever was mournful, Rachel looked ſtedfaſtly in her face, and told her ſhe knew by her art that ſhe was born to good fortune, but adviſed her not to throw herſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. "Theſe two moles on your check," added ſhe,
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:035296_0350_1001C2929FE8D6A8"/>"ſhew you are in ſome danger." "Do they denote huſbands or children?" cried Sally, ſtarting up and letting fall the ſong of the children in the wood; "hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands," muttered Rachel, "Alas! poor Jacob!" ſaid Sally mournfully, "then he will die firſt, wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>'t he?" "Mum for that," quoth the fortune teller, "I will ſay no more." Sally was impatient, but the more cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhe diſcovered, the more myſtery Rachel affected.— At laſt ſhe ſaid, "if you will croſs my hand with a piece of ſilver I will tell you your fortune. By the power of my art I can do this three ways; by cards, by the lines of your hand, or by turning a cup of tea grounds: which will you have?" "O, all! all!" cried Sally, looking up with reverence to this ſun-burnt oracle of wiſdom, who knew no leſs than three different ways of diving into the ſecrets of futurity. Alas! perſons of better ſenſe than Sally have been ſo taken in; the more is the pity! The poor girl ſaid ſhe would run up ſtairs to her little box where ſhe kept her money tied up in a bit of an old glove, and would bring down a bright queen Ann's ſix-pence very crooked. "I am ſure," ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhe, "it is a lucky one, for it cured me of a very bad ague laſt ſpring, by only laying it nine nights un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my pillow without ſpeaking a word. But then you muſt know what gave the virtue to this ſix-pence was, that it had belonged to three young men of the name of John; I am ſure I had work enough to get it. But true it is, it certainly cured me. It muſt be the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence you know, for I am ſure I did nothing elſe for my ague, except indeed taking ſome bitter ſtuff every three hours, which the doctor called bark. Indeed I lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t my ague ſoon after I took it, but I am ſure it was owing to the crooked ſix-pence, and not to the bark. And ſo, good woman, you may come in if you will for there is not a ſoul in the houſe but me." This was the very thing which Rachel wanted to know.</p>

<pb n="257" facs="unknown:035296_0351_1001C299C87089A8"/>the beaufet, and clapped it into her pocket. Sally ran down lamenting ſhe had loſt her ſix-pence, which ſhe verily believed was owing to her having put it into a left glove inſtead of a right one. Rachel comforted her by ſaying, that if ſhe gave her two plain ones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead, the charm would work juſt as well. Simple Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought herſelf happy to be let off ſo eaſily, never calculating that a ſmooth ſhilling was worth two crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſix-pences. But this ſkill was a part of the black art in which Rachel excelled. She took the money and began to examine the lines of Sally's left hand. She bit her withered lip, ſhook her head, and bade her poor dupe beware of a young man, who had black hair.—"No ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed," cried Sally, all in a fright, "you mean black eyes, for our Jacob has got brown hair, 'tis his eyes that are black." "That is the very thing I was going to ſay," muttered Rachel, "I meant eyes though I ſaid hair, for I know his hair is as brown as a ches<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut, and his eyes are as black as a ſloe." "So they are, ſure enough," cried Sally, "how in the world could you know that?" forgetting that ſhe herſelf had juſt told her ſo. And it is thus that theſe hags pick out of the credulous all which they afterwards pretend to reveal to them. "O, I know a pretty deal more than that," ſaid Rachel, but you muſt be aware of this man. "Why ſo," cried Sally with great quickneſs. "Becauſe," anſwered Rachel, "you are fated to marry a man worth a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of him, who has blue eyes, light hair, and a ſtoop in the ſhoulders." "No, indeed, but I can't," ſaid Sally, "I have promiſed Jacob, and Jacob I will mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry." "You cannot child," returned Rachel, in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn tone; "it is out of your power; you are fated to marry the grey eyes and light hair." "Nay, indeed," ſaid. Sally, ſighing deeply, "if I am fated, I muſt; I know there is no reſiſting one's fate." This is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cant with poor deluded girls, who are not aware that they themſelves make their fate by their folly, and
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:035296_0352_1001C29F1D36FD18"/>then complain there is no reſiſting it. "What can I do?" ſaid Sally. "I will tell you that too," ſaid Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel. "You muſt take a walk next Sunday afternoon to the church-yard, and the firſt man you meet in a blue coat, with a large poſy of pinks and ſouthernwood in his boſom, ſitting on the church-yard wall, about ſeven o'clock, he will be the man." "Provided," ſaid Sally, much diſturbed, "that he has grey eyes, and ſtoops." "O, to be ſure," ſaid Rachel, "otherwiſe it is not the right man." "But if I ſhould miſtake," ſaid Sally, "for two men may happen to have a coat and eyes of the ſame color?" "To prevent that," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Rachel, "if it is the right man the two firſt let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his name will be R. P. This man has got mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney beyond ſea." "O I do not value his money," ſaid Sally, with tears in her eyes, "for I love Jacob better than houſe or land; but if I am fated to marry another, I can't help it. You know there is no ſtruggling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my fate."</p>
                  <p>Poor Sally thought of nothing, and dreamt of noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the week but the blue coat and the grey eyes.—She made a hundred blunders at her work. She put her rennet into the butter-pan, inſtead of the cheeſe tub.—She gave the curd to the hog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and put the whey into the vats. She put her little knife out of her pocket for fear it ſhould cut love, and would not ſtay in the kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen, if there was not an even number of people, leſt it ſhould break the charm. She grew cold and myſterious in her behavior to faithful Jacob, whom ſhe truly lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the more ſhe thought of the fortune-teller, the more ſhe was convinced that brown hair and black eyes were not what ſhe was fated to marry, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though ſhe trembled to think it, Jacob could not be the man.</p>
                  <p>On Sunday ſhe was too uneaſy to go to church; for poor Sally had never been taught that her being unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy was only a freſh reaſon why ſhe ought to go thither.
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:035296_0353_1001C2A304DE7D90"/>She ſpent the whole afternoon in her little garret, dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in all her beſt. Firſt ſhe put on her red ribbon, which ſhe had bought at laſt Lammas fair; then ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected that red was an unlucky color, and changed it for a blue ribbon, tied in a true lover's knot; but ſuddenly calling to mind that poor Jacob had bought this knot for her of a pedlar at the door, and that ſhe had promiſed to wear it for his ſake, her heart ſmote her, and ſhe laid it by, ſighing to think ſhe was not fated to marry the man who had given it to her. When ſhe had looked at herſelf twenty times in the glaſs, for one vain action always brings on another, ſhe ſet off, trembling and quaking every ſtep ſhe went. She walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eagerly towards the church-yard, not daring to look to the right or left, for fear ſhe ſhould ſpy Jacob, who would have offered to walk with her. As ſoon as ſhe came within fight of the wall, ſhe ſpied a man ſitting upon it. Her heart beat violently. She looked again; but alas! the ſtranger not only had on a black coat, but neither hair nor eyes anſwered the deſcription. She happened to caſt her eyes on the church-clock, and found ſhe was two hours before her time. This was ſome comfort. She walked away and got rid of the two hours as well as ſhe could, paying great attention as ſhe went not to walk over any ſtraws which lay acroſs. While the clock was ſtriking ſeven ſhe returned to the church-yard, and, O! the wonderful power of fortune tellers! there ſhe ſaw him! there ſat the very man! his hair as light as flux, his eyes as blue as buttermilk, and his ſhoulders as round as a tub. Every tittle agreed to the very noſegay in his waiſtcoat button-hole. At firſt indeed ſhe thought it had been ſweethrier, and glad to catch at a ſtraw, whiſpered to herſelf, it is not he, and I ſhall marry Jacob ſtill; but on looking again ſhe ſaw it was ſouthernwood plain enough, and that all was over. The man accoſted her with ſome very non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentical, but too acceptable compliments. Sally was
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:035296_0354_1001C2A9B8D1F988"/>naturally a modeſt girl, and but for Rachel's wicked arts, would not have talked with a ſtrange man; but how could ſhe reſiſt her fate you know? After a little diſcourſe, ſhe aſked him, with a trembling heart, what might be his name? "Robert Price, at your ſervice," was the anſwer. "Robert Price! that is R. P. as ſure as I am alive, and the fortune-teller was a witch! It is all out! it is all out! O the wonderful art of fortune-tellers!"</p>
                  <p>The little ſleep ſhe had that night was diſturbed with dreams of graves, and ghoſts, and funerals; but as they were morning dreams, ſhe knew thoſe always went by contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ies, and that a funeral denoted a wedding.—Still a ſigh would now and then heave, to think that in that wedding Jacob could have no part. Such of my readers as know the power which ſuperſtition has over the weak and credulous mind, ſcarcely need be told, that poor Sally's unhappineſs was ſoon compleated.—She forgot all her vows to Jacob; ſhe at once forſook an honeſt man whom ſhe loved, and conſented to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of whom ſhe knew nothing, from a ridiculous notion that ſhe was compelled to do ſo by a decree which ſhe had it not in her power to reſiſt. She married this Robert Price, the ſtrange gardener, whom ſhe ſoon found to be very worthleſs, and very much in debt.—He had no ſuch thing as "money beyond ſea," as the fortune-teller had told her; but he had another wife there. He got immediate poſſeſſien of Sally's 20 <abbr>l.</abbr> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel put in for her ſhare, but he refuſed to give her a farthing, and bid her get away or he would have her taken up on the vagrant act. He ſoon ran away from Sally, leaving her to bewail her own weakneſs; for it was that indeed, and not any irreſiſtible fate which had been the cauſe of her ruin. To compleat her miſery, ſhe herſelf was ſuſpected of having ſtolen the ſilver cup which Rachel had pocketed. Her maſter, however, would not proſecute her, as ſhe was falling into a deep
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:035296_0355_1001C2AFA62A8DB8"/>decline, and ſhe died in a few months of a broken heart.</p>
                  <p>Rachel, whenever ſhe got near home, uſed to drop her trade of fortune-teller, and only dealt in the wares of her baſket. Mr. Wilſon, the clergyman, found her one day dealing out ſome very wicked ballads to ſome children. He went up with a view to give her a repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but had no ſooner begun his exhortation than up came a conſtable, followed by ſeveral people.—"Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

She may tell fortunes and find pots of gold in Taunton gaol, for there ſhe will have nothing elſe to do." This was that very farmer Jenkins, whoſe wife had been cheated by Rachel of the five guineas. He had taken pains to trace her to her own pariſh: he did not ſo much value the loſs of the money, but he thought it was a duty he owed the public to clear the country of ſuch vermin. Mr. Wilſon immediately committed her. She took her trial at the next aſſizes, when ſhe was ſentenced to a year's impriſonment. In the mean time the pawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broker, to whom ſhe had ſold the cup, which ſhe had ſtolen from poor Sally's maſter, impeached, and as the robbery was ſully proved upon Rachel, ſhe was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced for this crime to Botany Bay; and a happy day it was for the county of Somerſet, when ſuch a nui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance was ſent out of it. She was tranſported much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame time that her huſband Giles loſt his life in ſtealing the net from the garden wall.</p>
                  <p>I have thought it my duty to print this little hiſtory as a kind warning to all you young men and maidens not to have any thing to ſay to cheats, impoſtors, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning women, fortune-tellers, conjurers, and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of dreams. Liſten to me, your true friend, when I aſſure you that God never reveals to weak and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed women thoſe ſecret deſigns of his providence, which no human wiſdom is able to foreſee. To conſult theſe
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:035296_0356_1001C2B8F83B7648"/>falſe oracles is not only fooliſh, but ſinful. It is fooliſh, becauſe they are themſelves as ignorant as thoſe whom they pretend to teach, and it is ſinful, becauſe it is pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into that futurity which God, as kindly as wifely, hides from men. God indeed orders all things; but when you have a mind to do a fooliſh thing, do not fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy you are fated to do it. This is tempting providence, and not truſting him. It is indeed <hi>charging God with folly.</hi> Prudence is his gift, and you obey him better when you make uſe of prudence under the direction of prayer, than when you madly run into ruin, and think you are only ſubmitting to your fate. Never fancy that you are compelled to undo yourſelf. Never believe that God conceals his will from a ſober chriſtian who obeys his laws, and reveals it to a vagabond gipſey, who runs up and down, breaking the laws, both of God and man. King Saul never conſulted the witch till he had left off ſerving God. The bible will direct us what to do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any conjurer, and no days are unlucky but thoſe which we make ſo by our own vanity, folly, and ſin.</p>

                  <head>THE EXPLANATION OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.</head>
                  <head type="sub">PART I.</head>
                  <p>WE all of us are taught to ſay the ten command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but there are few of us I am afraid who
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:035296_0357_1001C2BADB61D788"/>rightly underſtand them, and fewer ſtill who walk by them and try to practiſe them. I may add that there are none who do not break, more or leſs, one or other of the ten, and that therefore there is no man living who could bear to be judged by them.</p>
                  <p>We read in the 20th chapter of Exodus (from whence the commandments are taken) that God ſpake all theſe words, ſaying, <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, and out of the houſe of bondage.</hi> God was here ſpeaking to the Jews, who were of old his favorite people. The ten commandments were firſt given to them, and through them to us. We muſt not wonder, therefore, if we find a few expreſſions which mited the Jews better than they will ſuit us.—Let us now proceed to the explanation.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="commandment">
                     <head>
                        <hi>FIRST COMMANDMENT.</hi> Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me.</head>
                     <p>This means that we muſt have, or chuſe to ourſelves, the one true and only God of the Scriptures. Now in order to know who this God of the Scriptures is, it is plain that we muſt read the Scriptures, and eſpecially the New Teſtament. He was the God who appeared to Moſes, at Mount Sinai, and gave him all theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. He was the God of Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets and holy men that lived on the earth. He afterwards was ſtill more plainly made known as the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt whom he ſent into the world to die for our ſins, and he now ſends his holy ſpirit into the hearts of thoſe who call upon him. It would take too much time to enter here fully into the character of God; let us therefore only repeat ſhortly a few of the many things which the Scriptures have ſaid concerning him. He is <hi>the high and lofty one who inhabiteth eternity. From ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erlaſting to everlaſting he is God.</hi> He is the <hi>Almighty. His wiſdom is infinite: the light and the darkneſs are
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:035296_0358_1001C2C146D659D8"/>both alike to him. He ſearcheth the hearts of all the children of men. By him actions are weighed</hi>—yea, he <hi>judgeth the ſecrets of men's hearts. Our God ſhall bring every work into judgment, whether it be good or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be evil,</hi> for <hi>he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteouſneſs by that man whom he hath ordained;</hi> and <hi>then the wicked ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment, but the righteous into life eternal.</hi> He is at the fame time a God of compaſſion and of tender mercy. What can more ſtrongly prove it than his ſending Chriſt to die for us, and to offer ſalvation to us. <hi>God is love. Not that we loved him,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be a propitiation for our ſins.</hi> He deſcribed himſelf to Moſes as being <hi>the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, and of great goodneſs, keeping mercy for thouſands;</hi> yet at the ſame time he will by no means excuſe or clear the unrepenting and the guilty. Moreover let us remark that he is the God of nature and providence; he made the world and he now governs it. <hi>Not a ſparrow falls to the ground without his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</hi> He orders the events of nations and of individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. He doth all things both in heaven above and in earth below, <hi>according to the council of his own will,</hi> being righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.</p>
                     <p>Now, therefore, let us ſeriouſly apply this ſubject to ourſelves, and firſt as to our knowledge of God.— Is it then in the God of the Scriptures that we believe, or in ſome falſe kind of Supreme Being whoſe charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is more ſuited to our inclinations, and more indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to our ſins? Do we believe in a God who will inflict puniſhment on the diſobedient, as well as ſhew mercy to them that love him and keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments—who on the one hand is ready to pardon, and <hi>willeth all men to be ſaved,</hi> and who on the other will ſurely condemn <hi>the unbelieving,</hi> as well as <hi>plentifully
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:035296_0359_1001C2C3B2F9BA78"/>reward every wicked doer?</hi> Oh! how do men often miſtake the whole character of God; ſome in one way ſome in another, according to their various tempers, paſſions, intereſts, prejudices, and conceits.</p>
                     <p>But having learned to know God aright, do we in the next place alſo reverence him, and fear him, and truſt him, and love him and ſerve him? Do we carry about with us at all times, a holy reverence and regard to God? And as to our fear of God, I would aſk, is it greater in us than our fear of man? When men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire or expect us to do a thing which God has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us not to do, whom do we obey, God or man? that is the queſtion. In vain do we flatter ourſelves that we keep the firſt commandment if the fear of man is greater in us than that of God. Do we truſt him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo? Do we truſt him, for inſtance, both in our proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and in our adverſity, and whatever befals us do we ſay that it is the Lord who hath done it, looking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at the fame time to his help in all the future cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of our lives; or are we truſting in ourſelves and in an arm of fleſh?</p>
                     <p>And here, above all, let us examine whether we love God: Do we love him as our Saviour, in ſpeaking of this commandment, expreſsly ſays that we ought to do. I mean, do we love him <hi>with all our heart, and ſoul, and ſtrength:</hi> Do we love him more than we love our wealth, our pleaſure, our intereſts, our earthly friends, or any worldly things whatever? <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee,</hi> ſaid the pious pſalmiſt, <hi>and there is none upon earth that I deſire in compariſon of thee.</hi> Do our hearts cleave to God as our beſt and moſt deſirable portion? Is his favor all in all with us, and do we therefore ſeek it carneſtly by prayer, and by all the means through which the Scriptures teach us that it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? And to crown all, do we obey him and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſerve him? <hi>If ye love me,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, <hi>keep my commandments</hi> When we ſay that we love a perſon, and
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:035296_0360_1001C2C6B5690110"/>yet refuſe to do the things he deſires us, it is loving him in word only, not in deed, or in truth. Nor is it one commandment only that we muſt obey. If a man <hi>keepeth the commandments of God, and yet offendeth in one point, he is guilty of all;</hi> for the ſame God that ſaith, <hi>thou ſhalt not commit adultery,</hi> ſaid alſo <hi>thou ſhalt not ſteal.</hi> Nothing more plainly proves men to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and inſincere in their whole religion than their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to ſerve God indeed in ſome things, but refuſing to do it in others. Such men do not truly ſerve God at all.</p>
                     <p>Such is the firſt commandment. It ſays, <hi>thou ſhalt have none other Gods but me:</hi> that is, thou ſhalt ſet up no God in oppoſition to me, neither thy luſts nor thy paſſions, neither the world nor the fleſh, nor yet any of the falſe Gods whom men's own imaginations have formed to themſelves, nor whom the heathen fall down and worſhip.</p>

                        <hi>SECOND COMMANDMENT.</hi> Thou ſhalt not make to thyſelf any graven image, nor the likeneſs of any thing that is in the heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth. Thou ſhalt not bow down to them, nor worſhip them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, and viſit the ſins of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me: and ſhew mercy unto thouſands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.</head>
                     <p>This commandment was directed more particularly to the Jews. God had ſeparated them from the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding nations, who were idolatrous, and had made a covenant with them, that they ſhould not make to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Gods, ſuch as their neighbors worſhipped, but that he ſhould be their God, and they ſhould be his people. He ſays in this commandment, that he is a jealous God, that is, jealous of his honor. It is ſaid in
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:035296_0361_1001C2CE63876DB0"/>another place, <hi>my glory will I not give to another, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my praiſe to graven images.</hi> He will have no ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals in any reſpect. The declaration, that he would viſit the ſins of the fathers upon the children even to the third and fourth generation, is to be underſtood as a part of that national covenant which God made with the Jews. If the fathers worſhipped and ſerved him, then the children alſo would continue to have him in like manner, for their God: but if the fathers went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, and did as the heathen, then alſo the children for generation after generation were to be involved in the conſequences. Somewhat in like manner indeed it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happens now, that children ſuffer through the crimes of their parents, which ſhould be an argument with all parents both to avoid ſinning themſelves, and to take care leſt they draw their children into ſin and miſery alſo.</p>
                     <p>Let us then abhor this ſin of idolatry. It was one into which the Jews were continually falling; and let it be our prayer, as well as our endeavor, that all the nations of the earth, who are now ſunk in idolatry, may be recovered out of it; for it is a ſin highly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to God.</p>
                     <p>Let us ourſelves keep at the greateſt diſtance from this ſin, and for this purpoſe it ſeems prudent not even to adorn our churches with images, leſt any of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who ſee them there, forgetting that God is a ſpirit, ſhould pay undue honor to the repreſentation.</p>

                     <p>To take the name of God in vain is, in the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and worſt ſenſe of the words, to call on God to witneſs a thing that is falſe, or in other words, to take a falſe oath. In many caſes men are required by law to
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:035296_0362_1001C2D4130F6118"/>make oath of the truth of what they ſay. Now what ſolemnity and fear of God ſhould there be in our minds on ſuch occaſions! The judge and the jury indeed may poſſibly not find us out, but <hi>the Lord our God will not hold us guiltleſs if we thus dreadfully take his name in vain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may here remark by the way, that it is this fear of God therefore, which is the chief ſecurity of the lives and properties of people in ſociety. Now I think it cannot be too ſtrongly inſiſted on, that it is a very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn thing to call on God to witneſs any thing we are at but to utter, and that therefore, all restleſsneſs and in conſideration in taking eaths, even though the oaths ſhould not be falſe, are very ſinful. There are ſome who take cuſtom-houſe oaths in a very ſlovenly manner, and who ſay, "O it is only a cuſtom-houſe oath."— Others take oaths of office juſt as lightly, and I believe there are ſome who now and then take oaths of a grave and ſolemn nature in their paſtimes and in mere ſport. But let all ſuch weigh well thoſe awful words, <hi>the Lord will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his name in vain.</hi>

                        </gap>, uſe the name of God to expreſs
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:035296_0363_1001C2D678C26158"/>their ſurpriſe, or to make their converſation, as they think, more entertaining. Ah! how dreadful will it be for ſuch perſons to have all theſe words brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, as ſo many unexpected ſins, on the day of judgment.</p>
                     <p>But it is neceſſary to be ſtill more plain and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar on this head, for the very perſons who are moſt guilty of this ſin oftentimes cannot, or will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that what is ſaid is addreſſed perſonally to them. To prove the juſtice of what we are about to add, I would here firſt call to my render's recollection what our Saviour himſelf has obſerved on the ſubject of this commandment. <hi>Ye have heard,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>how it hath been ſaid by them of old time, thou ſhalt not for ſwear thyſelf, but ſhall perform unto the Lord thine oaths; but I ſay unto you, ſwear not at all, neither by heaven, for it is God's throne, nor by the earth, for it is his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool.</hi> To ſay by heavens, or good heavens (the very expreſſion which ſome people uſe now) is thus expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbid by our Saviour. But not only this one phraſe which happened to be the one in common uſe in Chriſt's time, but all others of a like kind are of courſe by the ſame precept forbidden. It is painful to mention the various ways of being profane, which irreligious men from time to time have invented; but for the ſake of being underſtood, it ſeems neceſſary here in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to do ſo. I would obſerve therefore, that ſuch phraſes as the following: "Bleſs me," meaning Lord bleſs me, "Mercy on me," meaning Lord have mercy on me, "By Jove," meaning by the heathen God Jove or Jupiter, "Upon my ſoul," "Faith," and a variety of others appear all to be forbidden. <hi>Let your communication,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>be yea, yea, nay, nay,</hi> that is, let your aſſertions be plain and ſimple, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane or violent. Let them conſiſt as much as poſſible in a ſimple yes and no; <hi>for whatſoever is more than this cometh of evil.</hi> Sin begins whenever we depart
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:035296_0364_1001C2D824C09D78"/>from this ſimplicity and purity of ſpeech, and it ſeems even to be declared, that all thoſe profane expreſſions which our Saviour alludes to, come from the wicked one.</p>
                     <p>We will cloſe this ſubject with two remarks—the firſt is, beware of all violence and paſſion. Men ſwear often through paſſion. To cure men's paſſion is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to take away one cauſe of their ſwearing; nay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member alſo that even all violent affirmations, all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to God or to religion which are needleſs, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences againſt our Saviour's rule. It is a rule which calls us all to peculiar ſimplicity and ſelf-command, in our converſation. Be calm, therefore; be not loud and boiſterous, but mild and gentle in your ſpeech, and in order to keep your tongue, learn alſo to keep your heart.—Learn, therefore, in ſhort, thoſe doctrines of the goſpel which go to the correction of the heart.</p>
                     <p>My laſt obſervation is, be ſerious. The world is full of people, who in one way or other are taking God's name in v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>in, and who do it, as was obſerved before, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thinking of it; and the reaſon of it is, they are not ſerious. They have no awe of the divine majeſty, or of the divine preſence. They have not felt the power of religion in their hearts. They have no reverence for God and divine things, and hence it is that they ſpeak ſo lightly of them. In vain do we multiply di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, not to uſe this or the other word, becauſe it is profane; a profane mind will be ever coining new words inſtead of the old ones which are forbidden, and will betray a perſon into profaneneſs a hundred times a day without his being once a ware of it.</p>

                     <p>In the New Teſtament we find our Saviour obſerving that <hi>the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath,</hi> that is, the Sabbath was made to be a benefit to man, and not a burthen to him.

                        </gap>rt, ſhare in the benefit, for this commandment mercifully provides a day of reſt for the ox and the aſs alſo.</p>
                     <p>It is proper here to remark, that ſome alteration has taken place in reſpect to the Sabbath, ſince this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment was given. The day has been changed, for we keep now not the ſeventh day of the week, which is Saturday, but the firſt, which is Sunday, becauſe our Lord roſe from the dead on the Sunday, and the name of the <hi>Lord's day</hi> has for that reaſon been given to it. We therefore unite two purpoſes together, for we both reſt every ſeventh day as the Jews did, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation of God, who made the world in ſix days, and then reſted or ceaſed from his work on the ſeventh, and we alſo commemorate the glorious reſurrection of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who, as on this day was raiſed from the dead, after having died for our ſins and obtained eternal redemption for us.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the difference in the day it is natural that there ſhould now ariſe ſome circumſtances of difference
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:035296_0366_1001C2E18DCBDC40"/>in the manner of keeping Sunday. The Jews, who often indeed miſinterpreted their own law, thought it wrong to pluck ſo much as an ear of corn, or to heal a perſon of his diſeaſe on the Sabbath day, and in many other points they were extremely ſtrict. But we have been taught by our Saviour, that this commandment ought not to be conſtrued ſo ſeverely by us, and it is now generally agreed among the moſt ſerious chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, that both works of mercy, and alſo works of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity are perfectly lawful on the Sabbath-day.</p>
                     <p>But let us next endeavor to explain diſtinctly in what manner it ſeems to us that a chriſtian Sabbath ought, under our preſent circumſtances, to be kept.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, it ſhould be conſidered by us as a day of reſt from our common labor. The very laws of the land require this, by forbidding ſhops to be opened, and common employments to be followed on the Lord's day, and all magiſtrates are obliged by their oath, to ſee the laws of their country executed in this reſpect. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry individual therefore is bound to abſtain from the open violation of the Sabbath provided he reverences the laws or the public religion of his country, even ſuppoſing that he is not a chriſtian himſelf.</p>
                     <p>But chriſtians are called upon to keep the Sabbath holy in a much higher ſenſe. The word holy means ſeparate or ſetapart from others, in order to a religious uſe. We ſhould therefore conſider the Sabbath as a different day from other days, and ſhould carry that feeling habitually about with us through all the hours of it. Even if neceſſity ſhould oblige us to do ſome things which make a part of our common work, yet even then we ſhould endeavor to bear in our minds all the while that it is the Sabbath. I urge this learing in mind that it is the Sabbath, becauſe I know that if this ſentiment is in the heart needleſs work will be generally avoided, but that without this a man will not eaſly be kept from breaking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e Sabbath in one way or other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="273" facs="unknown:035296_0367_1001C2E62B5F8FB8"/>
Remember then that all common work, which can as well be ſhifted to the Saturday or the Monday, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſinful if done on the Sunday. Cleanlineſs muſt no doubt be attended to on the Sunday, but this is to be done by the preparation of Saturday. Our food muſt be got ready; but this may be managed with very little trouble even in the largeſt families, if there is but a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to ſpare all kinds of labor on the Sabbath-day. There are many houſes, I grant, which muſt not be leſs quite empty during civine ſervice; but it is in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noral enough if one perſon is leſt at home, who may take turns with others, ſo that the fan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e individual need not always be hindered from attending public worſhip. There ſhould be an univerſal agreement among mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and ſervants, and among ſervants alſo with one another, each not only to obſerve the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>bbath himſelf, but to promote the obſervation of it among thoſe around him.</p>
                     <p>But now, to ſpeak of what is ſtill more material.—It It is of little uſe to abſtain from bodily work, if the frame of mind is quite inconſiſtent with a due attention to the Sabbath. This would be a formal and Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath indeed. To comply with the form, but to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the ſpirit, is no true keeping of the chriſtian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. It ſhould even be remembered that if Jewiſh forms are in ſome reſpects left off, it becomes us to be the more careful to attend to the ſubſtance; for we are now placed under a diſpenſation, in which all is expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be <hi>ſpirit and life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Sabbath, as was obſerved before, was made for man. It was made for his good, and more eſpecially for his ſpiritual good. Whatever therefore tends to our ſpiritual benefit is fit employment for the Sabbath. Public worſhip has been appointed on this principle, in all chriſtian countries. But it is neceſſary that we ſhould not only be ſeen attending in our places, but that our minds alſo ſhould be engaged in the ſervice. In
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:035296_0368_1001C2EBE3B5FF90"/>prayer we ſhould feel our need of the mercies we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore; in the confeſſion of ſin, we ſhould be affected with a ſenſe of our unworthineſs, and in offering up our thankſgivings to God, we ſhould pour out our whole hearts before him. And when we hear the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures read, and the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt preached to us, we ſhould liſten with an attentive ear, and receive the truth into an honeſt and good heart. When we are returning from the ſervice, we ſhould not diſcourſe as many are apt to do, about light and trifling things; but we ſhould call up the ſubject which we may have been hearing of at church. We ſhould betake ourſelves alſo at home to the inſtruction of our children, to the reading of the Scriptures, to family prayers, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation that may have ſomething uſeful in it, or if we take our walk abroad, it ſhould be in order to indulge in meditation on divine things, and in order alſo to call perhaps on our more pious friends and kindred, whoſe converſation is likely to turn on topics ſuitable to the day, or to viſit the ſick, to comfort one that is afflicted, to do an act of kindneſs and charity, or to purſue ſome plan of uſefulneſs proper for the Sabbath, and in which we may be then regularly employed.</p>
                     <p>Such are the occup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tions which become a chriſtian on the Sunday, and uniting, as they naturally do, with the exerciſe of the ſocial affections, they may well employ the whole of this ſacred ſeaſon; for that is a poor motley inconſiſtent Sabbath indeed of which one little part on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is ſpent at church, <hi>in building ourſelves up in our moſt holy faith,</hi> while the reſt is given up to ſuch em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments as tend to pull down what we have been building up, and to promote forgetfulneſs of all that we have been hearing. It is the prayer before we go to worſhip, and the reflection after; it is the weekly ſelf-examination which we at this time practiſe; it is the ſecret deſires of the heart after the favor of God; it is the humble and holy contemplation of the life,
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:035296_0369_1001C2F40DEB85B8"/>death, and reſurrection, and aſcenſion of our Saviour; it is, in ſhort, the heavenly mind exerciſing itſelf on ſpiritual objects, and ſhutting out thoſe things that are worldly, which conſtitutes the true keeping of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. It is thus that we acquire a <hi>hope full of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</hi> "All ſorrows mitigated, all cares ſuſpended, all fears repreſſed, every angry emotion ſoftened, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry envious, revengeful, or malignant paſſion expelled:" we become on this day partakers, in ſome meaſure, of the heavenly happineſs, and learn to look forward to that never ending Sabbath, to that ſeaſon of eternal <hi>reſt which remaineth for the people of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now what a privilege is the Sabbath! It is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſo ſpoken of in the Old Teſtament. <hi>I gave you my Sabbaths,</hi> ſays God to the Iſraelites, and then he proceeds to found a claim upon that nation for peculiar gratitude and obedience. Let us be grateful to God that he hath by his good providence, preſerved to us this bleſſed day, while, in many countries in Europe it has been grievouſly profaned, and in ſome entirely overthrown. Let us rejoice that in Great Britain the law of the land ſtill in ſome meaſure maintains it, tho' many of the people are learning to confound it more and more with the other days of the week, and are thus impiouſly caſting off all concern for this command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <p>Godfathers and godmothers alſo have learnt, as well as parents, to be very inconſiderate about this ſacred ordinance. They promiſe, indeed, in the face of God and of the church, <hi>to renounce,</hi> in the child's name, <hi>this wicked world, with all the ſinful luſts of the fleſh,</hi> and they alſo are underſtood expreſsly to undertake that the child ſhall be taught not only <hi>the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments,</hi> but alſo, <hi>all oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er things which a chriſtian ought to know and believe for his ſoul's health;</hi> and yet the moſt of them have no ſooner made this vow than they think they have done with it; they reflect not whether the parent be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who is likely to pay that attention to the child's ſoul for which they have been engaging, nor do they ever afterwards beſtow a ſingle thought on its religious education themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Some there are, indeed, who do not act quite ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly about baptiſm, nor think quite ſo lightly of it as many others, and yet are far from turning it to a truly religious uſe; they are aware, in part, of the profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it which is ſo common, but they have not the courage to differ from the general cuſtom. They dare not refuſe, for inſtance, to ſtand godfather or godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whenſoever ſome one expects or requeſts it of them. To do ſo is a bad cuſtom, they allow, but ſince it is a cuſtom they muſt comply with it. Ah, how little do they reflect, that in that very vow which in the child's name they are about to take, there is contained a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <hi>to renounce the world;</hi> in which promiſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of its ſinful cuſtoms is no doubt included; and I therefore aſk ſuch perſons, whether the cuſtom of undertaking, lightly, the duty of godfathers and godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:035296_0372_1001C2FE48115690"/>is not one of thoſe ſinful cuſtoms which the very ceremony of baptiſm pledges them to renounce.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, then it muſt be acknowledged, that baptiſm is on all ſides neglected and profaned, and that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come now little, elſe than a convenient ceremony, by which people beſtow a name upon their children.</p>
                  <p>But is this all that was intended by it? It ſurely needs no argument to prove, that it was never meant by the founder of it to ſerve merely as a national cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, by which we were to regiſter ages, or to give names to our children. It cannot be that a Sacrament ordained by him who died for us, enjoined upon his diſciples nearly in his laſt words, and emphatically ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon us in thoſe remarkable expreſſions, <hi>he that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> I ſay, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be that a Sacrament thus ſolemnly appointed can deſerve to be lightly treated. Depend upon it, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made light of without affronting him who was the founder of it. It cannot be made light of without making light of Chriſt; without making light of him who is the hope of fallen man, and the only Saviour of our ſouls.</p>
                  <p>Let us then proceed reverently to enquire what is the true meaning and nature of it.</p>
                  <p>And here I would firſt remark, that long before baptiſm was appointed there prevailed among the Jews the ceremony of circumciſion, which had nearly the ſame uſe and deſign. Abraham was the firſt perſon on whom circumciſion was enjoined. Abraham was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the divine goodneſs from a ſtate of ignorance and idolatry, he was bleſſed alſo with many great and glorious promiſes; he was made the father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and was himſelf adopted into the family of God; in token whereof circumciſion was required of him as a ſign, the ſame thing being required alſo of his children the Jews, who became the peculiar people of God; not that the mere ſign or ceremony could bring any one
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:035296_0373_1001C300112F5E48"/>into God's favor, for the apoſtles tell the Jews, that if they did not alſo <hi>keep the law, verily their circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was made uncircumciſion.</hi> And again it is ſaid, <hi>for in Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion availeth any thing nor uncircumciſion, but a new creature.</hi> The being <hi>a new creature</hi> was therefore the great point: and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion ſeems to have been intended to repreſent to men in thoſe early ages, that new and holy ſtate into which they muſt be brought in order to their being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into the favor of God, uncircumciſion repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting on the other hand that ſinful condition in which we are born, and in which we all naturally are, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that expreſſion of the apoſtle, <hi>and you who were dead in your ſins, and in the uncircumciſion of your fleſh yet now hath he reconciled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus made it appear what circumciſion meant of old, let us next ſhew from the ſame word of God what baptiſm ſignifies now.</p>
                  <p>When Nicodemus came to Jeſus by night in order to enquire (as it ſeems) into the nature of that new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of which he had heard, Jeſus ſays to him, <hi>verily, verily, I ſay unto you, except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</hi> Nicodemus not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what was ſpoken, our Saviour declares again, <hi>except a man be born of water and of the ſpirit he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the kingdom of God.</hi> What is it to be born of water and the ſpirit? The anſwer I think will be found eaſy, eſpecially if we take advantage of the information given us in other parts of Scripture. Water, we there find, is the ſign ordered to be uſed in baptiſm on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its cleanſing whatever is dirty or defiled; the holy ſpirit however is the thing ſignified by the water; for as it is the buſineſs of water to cleanſe the defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the body, ſo it is the office of the Holy Spirit to cleanſe the corruption of the heart of man. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore, of our Saviour's ſpeech to Nicodemus
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:035296_0374_1001C307458446F8"/>ſeems to be as follows, "Except a man be renewed, or born again, and not by the outward baptiſm of water only, but alſo by the effectual inward baptiſm or puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Holy Spirit—<hi>except a man be</hi> thus <hi>born, both of water and of the ſpirit,</hi> he cannot ſee (that is, he cannot rightly underſtand, nor is he qualified to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into) the kingdom of God. <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> ſays our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> It is our hearts then, and not our bodies only, that muſt be baptized and purified. We are naturally corrupt, indiſpoſed to ſerve God, and to obey his will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. <hi>We are all,</hi> ſays Scripture, <hi>gone out of the way. Behold,</hi> ſays David, <hi>I was born in ſin and ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me. And you,</hi> ſays the apoſtle, <hi>hath he quickened who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins wherein in times paſt ye walked according to the courſe of this world—and were by nature the children of wrath even as others.</hi>—We are therefore exhorted not to be conformed to this preſent world, but to be transformed in the renewing of our minds. And the Scripture accordingly ſpeaks of true chriſtians as <hi>being cleanſed by the waſhing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and of their being <hi>waſhed and cleanſed, and juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> The neceſſity then of his death unto ſin and new birth unto righteouſneſs is plain and evident; for how can an unholy creature obtain the favor of a holy God, and become fitted for a holy heaven, without undergoing this change ſo juſt, ſo rational is that ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>ye muſt be born again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are many other paſſages of Scripture which equally ſhew that to be a chriſtian is to undergo a great change in the natural diſpoſition of our minds, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that baptiſm is intended to ſet forth to us this change. <hi>As many of you,</hi> ſays St. Paul, <hi>as have been baptized into Chriſt have put on Chriſt;</hi> that is, ye have put on
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:035296_0375_1001C30B8656DD20"/>the ſame diſpoſitions that were in your Saviour, ſuch as his humility, meekneſs, love to God and man, devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, heavenly-mindedneſs; and again, <hi>for we are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by baptiſm into his death, that, like as Chriſt was raiſed from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life.</hi> When Paul himſelf firſt became a chriſtian, Ananias ſaid to him, <hi>ariſe and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins.</hi> Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias does not merely ſay, <hi>ariſe and be baptized.</hi> No, theſe words are introductory to the words that follow. And ſo is it in our caſe. <hi>Waſh away thy ſins,</hi> is an addition which we alſo muſt make to our form of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. Nay, I will venture to remark, that baptiſm without this is not only uſeleſs, but it is even worſe than uſeleſs. It does but aggravate our guilt; juſt as in the caſe of any other promiſe, he who promiſes, but does not perform, not only makes his promiſe void, but is even in a worſe caſe than if he had never made any promiſe at all.</p>
                  <p>The bleſſings of the goſpel, it is true are, on that part of God, conveyed over to us in baptiſm, but they are conveyed over to us only on the ſuppoſition, that we alſo on our ſide repent earneſtly of our ſins, have faith in Chriſt, become regenerate, or born again, and walk in newneſs of life. If all theſe things are left undone, and are forgotten by us, our baptiſm is then like an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement as yet unfulfilled. It is like a contract or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, which has been made, but which one of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties has afterwards rendered void, through his having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected to fulfil ſomething that he promiſed in the very body of the deed. The other party is therefore let looſe of courſe. For let not the reader ſuppoſe that there is any charm in baptiſm, and that on the ſaying over of certain words by a regular prieſt, the gates of heaven fly open to him, his heart being now renewed and made regenerate of courſe. Let not any one, I ſay, preſume to ſtake his ſalvation on the truth of ſo abſurd a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:035296_0376_1001C30D397EE328"/>as this. A perſon is admitted, I grant, at the time of baptiſm into the church of Chriſt, but it is only into the viſible church; for an outward form can only admit into the outward church; and it is alſo in the way of charity ſuppoſed (according to the form now in uſe in the church of England) that the baptized perſon both does and will fulfil his part, ſo as to avail himſelf of the chriſtian privileges held out to him.</p>
                  <p>Let us then beware of this as well as every other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and as the Jews were continually warned by Chriſt and his apoſtles not to truſt in the form of circumciſion, but to remember the thing ſignified, ſo let us take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to truſt in the form of baptiſm, but to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what baptiſm ſignifies; for <hi>he is not a Jew,</hi> ſays the apoſtle, <hi>who is one outwardly;</hi> and in like manner, he is not a chriſtian who is one outwardly, <hi>neither is circumciſion</hi> (nor baptiſm neither) <hi>that which is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the fleſh, but it is that of the heart and of the ſpirit, and not in the letter, whoſe praiſe is not of man but of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is proper that ſomething ſhould here be added, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the particular expreſſions which our Saviour uſed when he appointed the ordinance of baptiſm. When he had now finiſhed his work, when he had died for our ſins on the croſs, and had alſo riſen again, and was about to aſcend into heaven, <hi>go ye,</hi> ſaid he to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>into all the world, and preach the goſpel to every creature! Go ye and baptize them in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſame ſacred names of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt (or Spirit) all chriſtians are now bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Let us therefore cloſe the preſent ſubject, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring to explain, in an eaſy and familiar manner, what it is that a true chriſtian, who is baptized, may be ſuppoſed to mean by each of theſe three ſtriking expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                  <p>To be baptized into theſe three ſacred names may
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:035296_0377_1001C30F3221D8D8"/>be conſidered then as ſaying, in the firſt place, "I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God, the Father Almighty, who made and who now governs the world, and orders all things by his continual providence." It is to ſay, "I believe in that God of whom the Scriptures ſpeak, and not in thoſe falſe gods which vain men have imagined to themſelves, whether they be gods of wood and ſtone, or gods whom their own reaſon hath ſet up in oppoſition to the one true and only God of the Scriptures." It is to ſay ſecondly—"I believe alſo in Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Son of God, and who for us men and our ſalvation came down from heaven, who was crucified, dead, and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and who on the third day roſe again from the dead and aſcended into heaven. I renounce, therefore, the vain hope of being my own Saviour; I own my guilt and unworthineſs. I truſt in the merits of my Saviour's death, and in his power to ſave that immortal ſoul which I have committed to him." It is to ſay thirdly—"I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve alſo in the Holy Ghoſt. I believe in the miracles which he wrought in the days of the apoſtles, whereby he teſtified of Jeſus Chriſt. I believe in him alſo as my ſanctifier. I depend on his help for that change in my corrupt nature of which I feel the need, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd while I am ſtriving earneſtly againſt my ſins, I implore the grace of this Holy Spirit, without which I know that I can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing." It is to ſay alſo, that "I believe in him as my comforter. I draw my beſt conſolations not from the world, nor from the ordinary ſatisfactions of this life, ſtill leſs from the indulgence of my pride or of my pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; but my higheſt comfort ſprings from thoſe holy doctrines of the goſpel which the Divine Spirit has, I truſt, impreſſed on my heart; and from that humble perſuaſion which he hath given me, that, for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt, God even now admits me into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, and will hereafter receive me into his glory.</p>
                  <p>Such is the true meaning of our being baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt.
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:035296_0378_1001C316B60F7658"/>It is to renounce the Devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and all the ſinful luſts of the fleſh, ſo as no longer to follow nor be led by them. It is to chuſe inſtead of theſe, and as it were in defiance of them, and in direct oppoſition to them, that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit which have been ſpoken of. It is to profeſs to live all our days in this faith, perſevering in it through all the changes and chances of this mortal life, in ſpite of all the revolutions which may happen in the faith of our own country, or in that of ſurrounding nations. It is to determine to hold faſt this faith, into whatſoever new place we go, and among what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever company we may chance to dwell, amidſt the ſcoff of infidels, amidſt the gainſaying of heretics, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt all the diſcouragements or perſecutions that may riſe up againſt it in the world, amidſt the evil example of degenerate and corrupt chriſtians, and amidſt the united enmity and oppoſition of all wicked men. And laſtly, to take on ourſelves the chriſtian name in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is to profeſs that in this faith having lived, in this faith we truſt we ſhall not be afraid to die, ſince we are well perſuaded that we ſhall not be aſhamed of having confeſſed this faith on the great judgment day.</p>
                  <p>Having ſpoken hitherto of baptiſm in general, I now mean to make the following</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Addreſs to thoſe Parents who are about to bring a Child to be Baptized.</head>
                     <p>A general queſtion might indeed be aſked—"But why ſhould infants be baptized at all? Why ſhould they be made to promiſe that which, on account of their tender age, they cannot perform." To this objection the church of England gives the following anſwer:—"Becauſe the children promiſe, by means of their ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which promiſe, when they come to age, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are bound to perform." Now, I cannot help
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:035296_0379_1001C31AB3C21770"/>here remarking, that although the godfathers and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers may be the perſons in this place alluded to, yet parents alſo muſt of neceſſity be conſidered as ſureties, and even as principal ſureties for the religious education of their children; for, not to mention the duty that ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from the very relationſhip between parent and child, is it not the parents who bring the child to be baptized? Does it not depend on the parents' will whether the child ſhall be baptized or not? The baptiſm of the child being then the parents' act, the parents certainly muſt be conſidered as approving of the baptiſmal vow, and as approving it both with reſpect to their children and themſelves alſo.</p>
                     <p>You then that are parents, and that are about to bring a child to be baptized, aſk yourſelves ſuch queſtions as the following. Firſt, am I ſerious in what I am do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Baptiſm you have juſt ſeen is a ſolemn thing.—It is not that light matter which ſome people make of it. Indeed, the manner in which parents are uſed to bring their children to be baptized, may ſerve as a teſt or proof by which we may try the reality of their whole religion. They who treat chriſtian baptiſm lightly, we may depend upon it, are altogether light and giddy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; nor is this all; to be light and giddy in a caſe of this ſort, is to be profane and wicked alſo.</p>
                     <p>There is ſomething indeed particularly aggravated in the guilt of thoſe parents who come in a trifling ſpirit to attend their child's baptiſm. When the mother has juſt eſcaped from the pains and perils of child-birth; when the father has had the life of his beloved wife pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to him, and when they both are made the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py parents of a living infant, then is the time for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and offering up to God, who is the deliverer, and in the name of Chriſt, who is their Saviour, their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and tender offspring. Is this then the time for light and giddy mirth? or for luxury, and vanity, and oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? or for giving way to the evil cuſtoms of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:035296_0380_1001C31F9F455F00"/>world? and above all, is this a time for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning one of the moſt ſacred ordinances of Chriſt? No; it is the time rather for the parents to think of their ſins, and to examine into all the errors of their own paſt life. And as the right education of their new-born in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant will now become the object of their thought, it ought certainly to occur to them, and to impreſs itſelf very ſtrongly on their mind, that an immortal being is now committed to their care, a being whoſe ſoul is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſaved or loſt, according as it receives from them a good or a bad education, influence, and example.—To have brought an immortal being into the world is, to every conſiderate mind, in itſelf no light matter; and for the parents to be the means not of ſaving, but of damning the child to which they have given birth, is a thought too horrible to be borne. Many, therefore, who neglect their own ſouls cannot endure the idea of neglecting the ſouls of their children, and they are for doing ſomething at leaſt towards what they call, the right education of their offspring; but let all parents remember that if they are light and profane, inſtead of being ſerious and devout in preſenting their child to God in baptiſm, the child is then introduced into life by an act which amounts to a ſolemn mockery of God. And alas, is there not then too much reaſon to fear leſt (to borrow ſome words of the church of England ſervice) "the child ſhould lead the remainder of his life, but too truly, according to this beginning."</p>
                     <p>But now to be more particular. Firſt, then, before the time of baptiſm comes, be ſure that you offer up to God in ſecret the moſt fervent prayers on the behalf of your infant. What is baptiſm? It is a Sacrament ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Chriſt, in order to remind us that the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hearts both of parents and children need to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized or cleanſed by God's Holy Spirit; and how is this gift of the Holy Spirit to be obtained? By prayer; for God hath ſaid, he will give his Holy Spirit to them that
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:035296_0381_1001C321DBD15680"/>aſk it. As then by prayer you are to ſeek this gift for yourſelf, ſo are you to ſeek it for your children alſo.—Pray then, I ſay, that God will give to your child <hi>that thing which by nature he cannot have;</hi> that he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow him not only with kind and amiable tempers, but alſo with the ſtill greater gift of his heavenly grace.—Pray that he may not only be reſpectable, ſo as to do credit to his family, in the eyes of men, but that he may have the fear of God alſo in his heart. Pray that he may be eſtabliſhed in the faith of Chriſt, and that he may be one of thoſe who ſhall one day fight manfully under Chriſt's banners againſt Sin, the World and the Devil, and who ſhall not be aſhamed to confeſs the faith of Chriſt crucified in the midſt of a proud, a careleſs, and a wicked world.</p>
                     <p>Let me remark next, in reſpect to godfathers and godmothers, that it will be your endeavor if you are at all impreſſed with the important nature of baptiſm, to chuſe them from among the moſt religious perſons of your acquaintance, and not merely from among thoſe who may be moſt likely to help foward your child in his worldly intereſt; for, in a caſe of this ſort, you muſt caſt aſide the principle of worldly policy, and you may alſo have to act againſt the rules of civility, and common cuſtom. It is probable, indeed, if you have hitherto been a thoughtleſs, irreligious perſon, that your religious friends, if you have any, will be very ſhy of ſtanding godfathers or godmothers to your children. In order then to take away their objections, explain to them how ſeriouſly you now intend to bring up your offspring. Aſſure them that you account baptiſm a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſolemn thing, that you wiſh them to undertake for the religious education of your child on ſerious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and alſo that you ſhall be glad to take advice from them from time to time on this ſubject.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, on the day of baptiſm, be careful to avoid all extravagant feaſting and ſhew, as well as
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:035296_0382_1001C32450C61910"/>levity. Do not prepare a vaſt expenſive dinner, but a decent and moderate meal, and beware of inviting a croud of irreligious people to be your gueſts. Do not dreſs out the little infant in expenſive finery, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that you are about to dedicate him to one, who, when he gave a feaſt to his followers, was pleaſed to offer them nothing but a few fiſhes and barley-bread, who had not himſelf a houſe where to lay his head, and who, when he was nearly of the age of your child, was laid even in a manger.</p>
                     <p>And when the day of baptiſm is over, begin imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to prepare for the good education of your child, by taking all thoſe ſteps which now become you. If there is any thing in your character and conduct which will reflect blame on you in the eyes of your offspring, and thus leſſen their reverence for you, endeavor to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all ſuch things now. Are there any wrong habits which you are living in, be ſure to change them now. Have you any friends, whoſe principles are ſuch as to make them dangerous companions for your child, part them from all ſuch friends now, and begin immediately to form ſuch connections, and to eſtabliſh ſuch religious cuſtoms in your family, as may be of ſerious uſe to your children.</p>
                     <p>Above all, laſtly, take this occaſion of examining whether you have ever yet fulfilled your own vow in baptiſm; for if you have not, it is in vain to expect that you will do your duty religiouſly by your children. Examine, then, whether the great end of baptiſm has been fulfilled in you; whether you have ever repented of your ſins, have turned to God, have learnt to deny the ſinful inclinations of your heart, have refuſed to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the evil cuſtoms of the world, and have become holy, as your profeſſion of chriſtianity requires you to be. Examine, in ſhort, whether you have got a chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian name only, or a chriſtian nature alſo. If you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer theſe queſtions ſatisfactorily, do not run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:035296_0383_1001C3279E6FE2A8"/>from the ſubject altogether, but rather take the opportunity which the affecting circumſtance of a child's birth affords you of conſidering over all your own ways and let the ſeaſon of your child's being born into a new world be the ſeaſon of your own death unto ſin, and new birth unto righteouſneſs.</p>

                  <p>WILLIAM was a lively young ſervant who lived in a great but very irregular family. His place was, on the whole, agreeable to him, and ſuited to his gay thoughtleſs temper. He found a plentiful table and a good cellar. There was indeed a good deal of work to be done, though it was performed with much diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and confuſion. The family in the main were not unkind to him, though they often contradicted and cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, eſpecially when things went ill with themſelves. This, William never much liked, for he was always fond of having his own way. There was a merry, or rather a noiſy and riotous ſervant's hall; for diſorder and quarrels are indeed the uſual effects of plenty and unreſtrained indulgence. The men were ſmart but idle, the maids were ſhowy, but licentious, and all did pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty much as they liked for a time, but the time was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſhort. The wages were reckoned high, but
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:035296_0384_1001C3298B98AC78"/>they were ſeldom paid, and it was even ſaid by ſober people, that the maſter was inſolvent, and never fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led any of his flattering engagements, or his moſt poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive promiſes; but ſtill, notwithſtanding his real pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, things went on with juſt the ſame thoughtleſsneſs and ſplendor, and neither maſter or ſervants looked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the jollity of the preſent hour.</p>
                  <p>In this unruly family there was little church-going, and ſtill leſs praying at home. They pretended, indeed, in a general way, to believe in the bible, but it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an outward profeſſion, few of them read it at all, and even of thoſe who did read it ſtill fewer were governed by it. There was indeed a bible lying on the table in the great hall, which was kept for the purpoſe of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtering an oath, but was ſeldom uſed on any other occaſion, and ſome of the heads of the family were of opinion that this was its only real uſe, as it might ſerve to keep the lower parts of it in order.</p>
                  <p>William, who was fond of novelty and pleaſure, was apt to be negligent of the duties of the houſe. He uſed to ſtay out on his errands, and one of his favorite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements was going to the parade to ſee the ſoldiers exerciſe. He ſaw with envy how ſmartly they were dreſſed, liſtened with rapture to the muſic, and fancied that a ſoldier had nothing to do but to walk to and fro in a certain regular order, to go through a little eaſy exerciſe, in ſhort, to live without fighting, fatigue, or danger.</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" ſaid he, whenever he was affronted at home, "what a fine thing it muſt be to be a ſoldier! to be ſo well dreſſed, to have nothing to do but to move to the pleaſant ſound of fife and drum, and to have ſo many people to come to look at one, and admire one. O it muſt be a fine thing to be a ſoldier!"</p>
                  <p>Yet when the vexation of the moment was over, he ſound ſo much eaſe and diverſion in his maſter's houſe, ſo ſuited to his low taſte and ſenſual appetites, that he
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:035296_0385_1001C32B8DE3FFF0"/>thought no more of the matter. He forgot the glories of a ſoldier, and eagerly returned to all the mean gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications of the kitchen. His evil habits were but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle attended to by thoſe with whom he lived; his faults, among which were lying and ſwearing, were not often corrected by the family, who had little objection to thoſe ſins which only offended God, and did not much affect their own intereſt or property. And except that William was obliged to work rather more than he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, he found little, while he was young and healthy, that was very diſagreeable in this ſervice. So he went on, ſtill thinking, however, when things went a little croſs, "what a fine thing it was to be a ſoldier!" and at laſt one day as he was waiting at dinner, he had the misfortune to let fall a china diſh, and broke it all to pieces. It was a curious diſh, much valued by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, as they pretended; this family were indeed apt to ſet a falſe fantaſtic value on things, and not to eſtimate them by their real worth. The heads of the family, who had generally been rather patient and good-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored with William, as I ſaid before, for theſe vices, which, though offenſive to God, did not touch their own pocket, now flew out into a violent paſſion with him, called him a thouſand hard names, and even threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to horſewhip him for his ſhameful negligence.</p>
                  <p>William, in a great fright, for he was a ſad coward at bottom, ran directly out of the houſe, to avoid the theatened puniſhment, and happening juſt at that very time to paſs by the parade where the ſoldiers chanced to be then exerciſing, his reſolution was taken in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He inſtantly determined to be no more a ſlave, as he called it; he would return no more to be ſubject to the humours of a tyrannical family; no, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be free, or, at leaſt, if he muſt ſerve, he would ſerve no maſter but the King.</p>
                  <p>William, who had now and then happened to hear, from the accidental talk of the ſoldiers, that thoſe who
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:035296_0386_1001A38FDEB63690"/>ſerved the <hi>great family</hi> he had lived with, were ſlaves to their tyranny and vices, had alſo heard, in the ſame caſual manner, that the ſervice of the <hi>King</hi> was <hi>perfect freedom.</hi> Now he had taken it into his head to hope that this might be a freedom to do evil, or at leaſt to do nothing, ſo he thought it was the only place in the world to ſuit him.</p>
                  <p>A ſine likely young fellow as William was, had no great difficulty to get enliſted. The few forms were ſoon ſettled, he received the bounty-money as eagerly as it was offered, took the oaths of allegiance, and was joined to the regiment, and heartily welcomed by his new comrades. He was the happieſt fellow alive. All was ſmooth and calm. The day happened to be very fine, and therefore William always reckoned upon a fine day. The ſcene was gay and lively, the muſic cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, he found the exerciſe very eaſy, and he thought there was little more expected from him.</p>
                  <p>He ſoon began to flouriſh away in his talk; and when he met with any one of his old fellow-ſervants, he fell a prating about marches, and counter-marches, and blockades, and battles, and ſieges, and blood, and death, and triumphs, and victories, all at random; for theſe were words and phraſes he had picked up without at all underſtanding what he ſaid. He had no knowledge, and therefore he had no modeſty; he had no experience, and therefore he had no fears.</p>
                  <p>All ſeemed to go on ſwimmingly, for he had as yet no trial. He began to think with triumph what a mean life he had eſcaped from in the old quarrelſome family, and what a happy honorable life he ſhould have in the army. <hi>O, there was no life like the life of a ſoldier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a ſhort time, however, war broke out, his regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was one of the firſt which was called out to actual and hard ſervice. As William was the moſt raw of all the recruits, he was the firſt to murmur at the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and hardſhips, the cold and hunger, the fatigue
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:035296_0387_1001C14307DC0620"/>and danger, of being a ſoldier. O what watchings, and perils, and trials, and hardſhips, and difficulties, he now thought attended a military life! "Surely," ſaid he, "I could never have ſuſpected all this miſery, when I uſed to ſee the men on the parade in our town."</p>
                  <p>He now found, when it was too late, that all the field-days he uſed to attend, all the evolutions and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes which he had obſerved the ſoldiers to go through in the calm times of peace and ſafety, were only meant to fit, train, and qualify them, for the actual ſervice which they were now ſent out to perform by the command of the <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The truth is, William often complained when there was no real hardſhip to complain of; for the common troubles of life fell out pretty much alike to the <hi>great family</hi> which William had leſt, and to the ſoldiers in the <hi>King's army.</hi> But the ſpirit of obedience, diſcipline, and ſelf-denial of the latter, ſeemed hardſhips to one of William's looſe turn of mind. When he began to murmur, ſome good old ſoldier clapped him on the back, ſaying, "cheer up lad, it is a kingdom you are to ſtrive for; if we faint not, henceforth there is laid up for us a great reward, we have the <hi>King's</hi> word for it man."—William obſerved that to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> who truly believed this, their labors were as nothing, but he himſelf did not at the bottom believe it; and it was obſerved of all the ſoldiers who failed, the true cauſe was that they did not really believe the <hi>King's</hi> promiſe. He was ſurprized to ſee the then ſoldiers, who uſed to bluſter, and boaſt, and deride the aſſaults of the enemy, now began to fall away; while ſuch as had faithfully obeyed the <hi>King's</hi> orders, and believed in his word, were ſuſtained in the hour of trial. Thoſe who had truſted in their own ſtrength, all fainted in the ſlighteſt attack, while thoſe who had put on the armour of the <hi>King's</hi> providing, <hi>the ſword,</hi> and <hi>the ſhield,</hi> and <hi>the helmet,</hi> and <hi>the breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate,</hi> and whoſe <hi>feet were ſhod</hi> according to order, now
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:035296_0388_1001C14B96841D48"/>endured hardſhips as good ſoldiers, and were enabled to <hi>fight the good fight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An engagement was expected immediately. The men were ordered to prepare for battle. While the reſt of the corps were ſo preparing, William's whole thoughts were bent on contriving how he might deſert. But, alas! he was watched on all ſides, he could not poſſibly deviſe any means to eſcape. The danger increaſed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment—the battle came on. William, who had been ſo ſure and confident before he entered, flinched in the moment of trial; while his more quiet and leſs boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful comrades, prepared boldly to do their duty. William looked about on all ſides, and ſaw that there was no eye upon him, for he did not know that the <hi>King's</hi> eye was every where at once. He at laſt thought he ſpied a chance of eſcaping, not from the enemy, but from his own army. While he was endeavoring to eſcape, a ball from the oppoſite camp took off his leg. As he ſell, the firſt words which broke from him were, "while I was in duty I was preſerved, in the very act of deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I am wounded." He lay expecting every moment to be trampled to death, but as ſoon as the confuſion was a little over, he was taken off the field by ſome of his own party, laid in a plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The ſkirmiſh, for it proved nothing more, was ſoon over. The greater part of the regiment eſcaped in ſafety, while the few who fell, rejoiced that they fell in their duty. William in the mean time ſuffered cruelly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"O," cried he, "why was I ſuch a fool as to leave the <hi>great family</hi> I lived in, where there was meat and drink enough and to ſpare, only on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a little quarrel? I might have made up that with them as we had done our former quarrels. Why did I leave a life of eaſe and pleaſure, where I had only
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:035296_0389_1001C150A4A84ED0"/>a little rub now and then, for a life of daily diſcipline, and conſtant danger? Why did I turn ſoldier? O, what a miſerable animal is a ſoldier!"</p>
                  <p>As he was ſitting in this weak and diſabled condition, uttering the above complaints, he obſerved a venerable old officer, with thin grey locks on his head, and on his face deep wrinkles engraved by time, and many an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſcar inflicted by war<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> William had heard this old officer highly commended for his extraordinary courage and conduct in battle, and in peace he uſed to ſee him cool and collected, devoutly employed in reading and praying, in the interval of more active duties. He could not help comparing this officer with himſelf. "I," ſaid he, "flinched and drew-back, and would even have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the moment of peril; and now, in return, I have no conſolation in the hour of repoſe and ſafety. I would not fight then, I cannot pray now. O, why would I ever think of being a ſoldier?" He then began afreſh to weep and lament, and he groaned ſo loud that he drew the notice of the officer, who came up to him, kindly ſat down by him, took him by the hand, and enquired with as much affection as if he had been his brother, what was the matter with him, and what particular dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, more than the common fortune of war, it was which drew from him ſuch bitter groans? "I know ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſurgery," added he, "let me examine your wound, and aſſiſt you with ſuch little comforts as I can."</p>
                  <p>William at once ſaw the difference between the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in the <hi>King's</hi> army, and the people in the <hi>great family;</hi> the latter commonly withdrew their kindneſs in ſickneſs and trouble, when moſt wanted, which was juſt the very time when the others came forward to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. He told the officer his little hiſtory, the manner of his living in the <hi>great family,</hi> the trifling cauſe of his quarrelling with it, the ſlight ground of his entering into the <hi>King's</hi> ſervice. "Sir," ſaid he, "I quarrelled with the family, and I thought I was at once fit for the
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:035296_0390_1001C154F4076D70"/>army: I did not know the qualifications it required.—I had not reckoned on diſcipline, and hardſhips, and ſelf-denial. I liked well enough to ſing a loyal ſong, or drink the King's health, but I find I do not reliſh work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fighting for him, though I raſhly premiſed even to lay down my life for his ſervice if called upon, when I took the bounty money and the oath of allegiance.—In ſhort, Sir, I find that I long for the eaſe and ſloth, the merriment and the feaſting, of my old ſervice; I find I cannot be a ſoldier, and, to ſpeak truth, I was in the very act of deſerting, when I was ſtopped ſhort by the cannon ball. So that I feel the guilt of deſerting, and the miſery of having loſt my leg into the bargain."</p>
                  <p>The officer thus replied, "your ſtate is that of every worldly irreligious man. The <hi>great family</hi> you ſerved is a juſt picture of the WORLD. The wages the world promiſes to thoſe who are willing to do its work, are high, but the payment is attended with much diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nay, the world, like your great family, is in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf inſolvent, and in its very nature incapable of making good the promiſes, and of paying the high rewards which it holds out to tempt its credulous followers. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly world, like your family, cares little for church, and ſtill leſs for prayers; and conſiders the bible rather as an inſtrument to make an oath binding, in order to keep the vulgar in obedience, than as containing in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a perfect rule of faith and practice, and as a title-deed to heaven. The generality of men love the world as you did your ſervice, while it ſmiles upon them, and gives them eaſy work, and plenty of meat and drink; but as ſoon as it begins to croſs and contradict them, they get out of humour with it, juſt as you did with your ſervice. They then think its drudgery hard, its rewards low. They find out that it is high in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from them, and ſlack in its payments to them. And they begin to fancy (becauſe they do not hear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious people murmur as they do) that there muſt be
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:035296_0391_1001C156F2938280"/>ſome happineſs in r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>gion. The world, which takes no account of their deeper ſins, at length brings them into diſcredit for ſome act of imprudence, juſt as your family overlooked your lying and ſwearing, but threatened to drub you for breaking a china diſh; ſuch is the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, it particularly bears with thoſe who only break the laws of God, but ſeverely puniſhes the ſmalleſt negligence by which property is injured. The world ſooner pardons the breaking ten commandments of God, than even a china diſh of its own.</p>
                  <p>"After ſome croſs or oppoſition, worldly men, as I ſaid before, begin to think how much content and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they remember to have ſeen in religious people.—They therefore begin to fancy that religion muſt be an eaſy and delightful as well as a good thing. They have heard that <hi>her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace;</hi> and they perſuade themſelves that by this is meant worldly pleaſantneſs and ſenſual peace. They reſolve at length to try it, to turn their back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world, to engage in the ſervice of God and turn chriſtians; juſt as you reſolved to leave your old ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to enter into the ſervice of the King and turn ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier. But as you quitted your place in a paſſion, ſo they leave the world in a huff. They do not count the coſt. They do not calculate upon the darling ſins, the habitual pleaſures, the eaſe and vanities, which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake by their new engagements to renounce, any more than you counted what indulgencies you were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give up, when you quitted the luxuries and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your place to enliſt in the ſoldier's warfare.—They have, as I ſaid, ſeen chriſtians cheerful, and they miſtook the ground of their cheerfulneſs; they fancied it aroſe, not becauſe through grace they had conquered difficulties, but becauſe they had no difficulties in their paſſage. They fancied that religion found the road ſmooth, whereas it only helps to bear with a rough road without complaint. They do not know that theſe chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:035296_0392_1001C161DD1CBE58"/>are of good cheer, not becauſe the world is free from tribulation, but becauſe Chriſt, their captain, has <hi>overcome the world.</hi> But the irreligious man, who has only ſeen the outſide of a chriſtian in his worldly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, knows little of his ſecret conflicts, his trials, his ſelf-denials, his warfare with the world without, and with his own corrupt deſires within.</p>
                  <p>The irreligious man quarrels with the world, on ſome ſuch occaſion as you did with your place. He now puts on the outward forms and ceremonies of religion, and aſſumes the badges of chiſtianity, juſt as you were ſtruck with the ſhows of a field day; juſt as you were pleaſed with the muſic and the marching, and put on the cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade and the red coat. All ſeems ſmooth for a little while. He goes through the outward exerciſes of a chriſtian, a degree of credit attends his new profeſſion, but he never ſuſpects there is either difficulty or diſcipline attending it; he fancies religion is a thing for talking about, and not a thing of the heart and the life. He never ſuſpects that all the pſalm-ſinging he joins in, and the ſermons he hears, and the other means he is uſing, are only as the exerciſes and the evolutions of the ſoldiers, to fit and prepare him for actual ſervice; and that theſe means are no more religion itſelf, than the exerciſes and evo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of your parade were real warfare.</p>
                  <p>At length ſome trial ariſes. This nominal chriſtian is called to differ from the world in ſome great point; ſomething happens which may ſtrike at his comfort, or his credit, or ſecurity. This cools his zeal for religion, juſt as the view of an engagement cooled your courage as a ſoldier. He finds he was only angry with the world, he was not tired of it. He was out of humor with the world, not becauſe he had ſeen through its vanity and emptineſs, but becauſe the world was out of humor with him. He finds that it is an eaſy thing to be a fair weather chriſtian, bold where there is nothing to be done, and confident where there is nothing to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:035296_0393_1001C168EDD35A90"/>Difficulties unmaſk him to others; temptations unmaſk him to himſelf; he diſcovers that though he is a high profeſſor, he is no chriſtian; juſt as you found out that your red coat and your cockade, your ſhoulder knot, and your muſket, did not prevent you from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a coward.</p>
                  <p>Your miſery in the military life, like that of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal chriſtian, aroſe from your love of eaſe, your cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice, and your ſelf-ignorance. You ruſhed into a new way of life, without trying after one qualification for it. A total change of heart and temper were neceſſary for your new calling. With new views and new princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the ſoldier's life would have been not only eaſy but delightful to you. But while with a new profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion you retained your old nature, it is no wonder all diſcipline ſeemed intolerable to you.</p>
                  <p>The true chriſtian, like the brave ſoldier, is ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under dangers by a ſtrong faith that the fruits of that victory for which he fights will be ſafety and peace.—But, alas! the pleaſures of this world are preſent and viſible; the kingdom and the crown for which he ſtrives are remote. He is therefore apt to think them uncertain. He is therefore apt to fail, becauſe nothing ſhort of a lively ſaith can outweigh the preſent tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>EVER ſince ſin entered into the world and death by ſin, this earth has been a vaſt grave-yard, or burying place for her children. In every age, and in every country, that ſentence has been executing, <hi>Duſt thou art, and unto duſt thou ſhalt return.</hi> Mankind at firſt conſiſted only of one pair, but how inconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly numerous are now the ſons of Adam! One ſingle nation commonly contains many millions of men, and theſe millions form only one generation. How many, then, muſt be the millions that have appeared on the earth in the long run of near ſix thouſand years!—Let imagination cal lup this vaſt army; infants that have juſt lived to ſee the light, multitudes of the young and middle aged, and all the old and grey-headed alſo—perſons of all countries and of ſucceſſive generations—let them all paſs in review before us, and now vaſt and aſtoniſhing is the multitude! If the poſterity of one man, Abraham, by one of his ſons was, according to the language of divine promiſe, <hi>as the ſtars of heaven and as the ſand by the ſea-ſhore, innumerable,</hi> who can compute the multitudes that have ſprung from all the different patriarchs?

There has hardly, perhaps, been one moment of time, during the ſpace of many thouſand years, in which one perſon or other has not been dropping into the grave: and in ſome ſeaſons, through the ſword of war, the devouring peſtilence, or rather viſitations of God, thouſands have been mowed down at once, and have formed one undiſtinguiſhed heap of dead. The greater part of mankind beyond compariſon, are now ſleeping under ground. There lies beauty, mouldering into duſt, a prey to the vileſt worms; there lies the mean and humble beggar; and there lies the head that once wore a crown. There lie the mighty giants, the Sampſons, and the Caeſars of the world. There lie the wiſe and the learned, as weak and helpleſs as the fool. There lie ſome with whom we ourſelves have converſed, and who were once our dear friends and our companions; and there lie our fathers and mothers; and there perhaps alſo lies a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wife or huſband, a child, a ſiſter, or a brother.</p>
                  <p>And ſhall they lie there always? Shall this body, that curious wormanſhip of God, <hi>ſo fearfully and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made,</hi> continue always in theſe ruins, and ſhall it never be reſtored? This we know, that <hi>it is not a thing impoſſible with God to raiſe the dead.</hi> He that could firſt form our bodies out of nothing is juſt as able to form them anew, and to repair the waſtes of time and death. But what has he declared to be his intention in this caſe? for on this the matter turns; and it is a point which is fully revealed in the Scriptures. <hi>The hour is coming,</hi> ſays that ſacred book, <hi>when all that are in the grave ſhall hear the voice of the Son of Man, and ſhall come forth; they that have done well, to the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life; and they that have done evil, to the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:035296_0396_1001C36D47AA3FF0"/>of damnation. Behold,</hi> ſays St. Paul, <hi>I ſhew you a myſtery; we ſhall not all ſleep,</hi> (that is, mankind will not all be ſleeping in deat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Should this alarm burſt over our heads this moment, with what terror would it ſtrike many a one who read this deſcription of it? How dreadful, then, will be the ſurpriſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation when this event ſhall actually come to paſs! Now, indeed, there are many who ſtop their ears:—Now, though the voice of mercy calls, though reaſon pleads, and conſcience warns, yet multitudes will not hear; but then there ſhall be no one among the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of mankind that ſhall be able to diſobey the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, for the living ſhall ſtart, and be changed, and the dead riſe at the ſound.</p>
                  <p>But for what purpoſe ſhall they riſe? It is in order that they may come to judgment. <hi>For we m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

And I ſaw,</hi> continues the ſame apoſtle, <hi>a new heaven and a new earth, for the firſt heaven and the firſt earth were paſſed away. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, ſaying, behold the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:035296_0398_1001C373E2F28880"/>there ſhall be no more death, nor ſorrow, nor crying, for the former things are paſſed away. And he that ſat on the throne ſaid, behold, I make all things new.</hi> In like manner we are told in another place, that <hi>the heavens and the earth are but kept in ſtore until the day of deſtruction and perdition of ungodly men;</hi> and that when this <hi>great and terrible day of the Lord</hi> ſhall come, then <hi>the very elements ſhall melt with ſervent heat—the earth alſo, and all the works thereof ſhall be burnt up—the heavens ſhall depart as a ſcroll—they all ſhall wax old as doth a garment, and as a veſture ſhall be changed;</hi> and there ſhall then he <hi>new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs.</hi> Well might the apoſtle ſay, <hi>Seeing then that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, what manner of perſons ought we to be in all holy converſation and godlineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are many things ſpoken of in Scripture that ſhall follow the grand ſcene of the reſurrection, which remain to be deſcribed; but we ſhall ſpeak in this place only of one further point, and that is of the perſon who is to be our judge. It will be Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>for the Father,</hi> ſays the Scripture, <hi>judgeth no man, for God hath committed all judgment to the Son, becauſe he is the Son of Man. This ſame Jeſus,</hi> ſaid the angels, juſt after his reſurrection, <hi>which is taken up from you into heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner as ye have ſeen him go into heaven.</hi> Once he was <hi>deſpiſed and rejected of men; he was led as a lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a ſheep before his ſhearers is dumb, ſo he opened not his mouth;</hi> he was <hi>mocked, and buffeted, and ſpit upon;</hi> he was himſelf arraigned before the bar of Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and he was hung upon the Croſs as if he was the vileſt malefactor, the whole multitude having joined in the cry, crucify him, crucify him. But now, <hi>behold he cometh in the clouds, and every eye ſhall ſee him, and they alſo which pierced him, and all nations of the earth ſhall wall becauſe of him. For the Lord Jeſus ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:035296_0399_1001A434B3263530"/>from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the goſpel of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> now alſo he is <hi>come to be glorified in his ſaints, and to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in all them that believe.</hi> Some men think that to forget or to diſobey Chriſt is no great matter; they are good, as they call it, in their own way, and therefore they are ſatisfied.

The Lord's prayer is undoubtedly a moſt excellent pattern for our daily prayers, but it does not appear to have been given by Chriſt as the only form of prayer that was to be uſed; and it is worthy of remark that when he uttered it, he took occaſion to warn his diſciples againſt the vain repetitions uſed in prayer by the Phariſees. It is to be feared that even the Lord's prayer has become a vain repetition in theſe days, not through any fault in the prayer itſelf, but through the unthinking, and perhaps, over frequent way in which ſome people uſe it.

The maſter of a family (or the miſtreſs in his abſence) by devoutly reading a morning and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning prayer to his family, inſtructs both his children and ſervants in their duty, accuſtoms them to prayer, makes an open profeſſion of his own religion, brings himſelf under an obligation to obſerve a conſiſtent, that is, a religious conduct during the day; and above all let it be remarked, he draws down the bleſſing of God on himſelf and his houſehold. Four prayers are here offered to maſters and miſtreſſes of families, and they who have not yet been uſed to family prayer, have now therefore, an opportunity of beginning this good cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and in doing it may God grant them his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing!</p>

<pb n="309" facs="unknown:035296_0403_1001C37E08C51E00"/>coldneſs and indifference while engaged in prayer, and there are few who are not conſcious of this in a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or leſs degree. Let all them begin, by imploring God's Holy Spirit to aſſiſt them in praying as they ought. There cannot be a better introduction to every kind of prayer, than a few ſecret words firſt uttered to this effect from the heart.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, beware of wandering thoughts when enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in prayer. To this end let every ſtruggle be made, and let it be ſeriouſly impreſſed upon you, that God is now preſent in an eſpecial manner, and that all abſence of mind which is allowed and indulged is a great affront to his majeſty.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, but beſides being attentive, take care that you are alſo ſincere in your prayer. Aſk yourſelf often whether you mean what you ſay while you are praying and whether you ſincerely and earneſtly wiſh the thing that you aſk. Accuſtom yourſelf not to attend to the mere ſound of your words, but to the ſenſe; and if you do not well underſtand any part of the prayers here of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered you, endeavor to get what is difficult explained before you repeat it. Some perſons have been known to ſay prayers day by day, almoſt every word of which they have contradicted by their whole converſation and conduct. What a terrible hypocriſy is this! A man's prayers may either be the greateſt bleſſing to him or the moſt grievous ſin, according to the manner in which he performs them.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, endeavor not only to be ſincere in your prayers at the moment when you offer them, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor alſo, that the ſame ſpirit which animates your prayers, may animate your whole life. To this end, examine your life often by means of your prayers. Try whether all your maxims in life, your common ſpeech, and your ſeveral tempers, as well as your open conduct agree with the prayers which you uſe. The ſincerity which God requires of you is not a momentary ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:035296_0404_1001C382F94DFBA0"/>it is not a ſhort lived and changeable feeling which is forgotten when you go into the world. The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of what you have been praying for in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould follow you into the field or the ſhop, and ſhould influence your conduct all the day long.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, conſider whether God anſwers your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. If you pray aright, depend upon it your prayers will be heard and anſwered; your tempers will be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, your temptations weakened, and your whole mind will be rendered pious if you really pray that it may be ſo; and if this be not the caſe, you may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſuſpect that your prayers have not been ſuch as they ought. If you pray aright, depend upon it, you will improve in every reſpect; you will gain more humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, more tenderneſs of conſcience, more fear of God, more pleaſure in his worſhip, and more happineſs in his ſervice, and alſo more confidence in Chriſt, and probably more hope of ſalvation in proportion to the earneſtneſs and ſincerity of your prayers to God to this effect, for theſe are all the gifts of that holy ſpirit which God hath promiſed to them that aſk it.</p>

                     <p>O Lord God of Heaven, Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, giver of every good and perfect gift, we thank thee for all thine unmerited mercies beſtowed upon this family, and we pray thee by thy grace to preſerve eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of us from ſinning againſt thee.</p>
                     <p>Defend us through this day by thy mighty power, ſave us from the temptations of the world, the fleſh, and the devil, put into our hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ts good deſires, and help us to fulfil all thy precepts and commandments. And ſince thou haſt ſent thy Son Jeſus Chriſt into the world to die for our ſins, and to become the Saviour of our ſouls, O Lord, give us grace, day by day, to thank thee for this unſpeakable gift, and help us to remember that we are not our own, but are bought with a price, and make us willing therefore both to do and ſuffer all things to which thou mayeſt be pleaſed to call us; teach us to be this day patient and humble, and thankful, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with our lot, often lifting up our thoughts to heaven, having our chief deſires fixed on a better world.</p>
                     <p>And make us holy in all manner of converſation as becometh the diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt; make this
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:035296_0412_1001C397DBE119A8"/>houſehold, we pray thee, to be a houſehold that feareth God; may we be delivered from the corruption that is in the world, and may we alſo dwell together in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. May we put away from us all bitterneſs and wrath, and anger, and evil ſpeaking, and all malice, and may we be kind one towards another, forgiving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even as we hope that God, for Chriſt's ſake, heath forgiven us. And help us to know our ſeveral duties in life that we may fulfil them. May we be upright and diligent, may we waſte no time, and neglect no opportunity of doing good that is afforded us. May we be ready to every good work.</p>
                     <p>And teach us to be ever watchful and circumſpect, and fearful of running into temptation, but if at any time, we are overtaken with a fault, give us grace to confeſs it and repent of it, and to aſk forgiveneſs both from God and man.</p>
                     <p>O Lord, pardon the many ſins which in times paſt we have committed againſt thee. Forgive our forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of thee our God, and our many treſpaſſes againſt our neighbors. Grant unto us all true repentance, and help us day by day to grow in grace, and in the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of our Lord and Saviour.</p>
                     <p>Our Father, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>May the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the fellowſhip of the Holy Spirit be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>

                     <head>Evening Prayer for a Family.</head>
                     <p>O Lord our heavenly Father, we beſeech thee to hear the prayers which we are about to offer up unto thee; deliver us from all wandering thoughts, and help us to remember that we are now in the preſence of that God unto whom all heart are open, and from whom no ſecrets are hid.</p>
                     <p>O God we pray thee to forgive the ſins of the paſt day. We acknowledge that we have this day left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:035296_0413_1001C39F8303F900"/>many things which we ought to have done, and done many things which we ought not to have done. We have treſpaſſed againſt thee in thought, word, and deed, and though we have been encouraged by thy goſpel to repent of our iniquities, and to ſerve God in newneſs of life, yet we have many times returned to thoſe ſins which we profeſs to have repented of, and we have fallen under thy juſt wrath and diſpleaſure.</p>
                     <p>But we pray thee, O thou God of all grace and goodneſs, for the ſake of thy Son Jeſus Chriſt, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all that is paſt, and to take us into thy favor this night, not weighing our merits, but forgiving our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and cauſing us to place our humble truſt in thy mercy. Deliver us, we pray thee, from the troubles of a guilty conſcience, now that we are about to lie down to reſt. Save us, O Lord, from the dread of death, and from the terrors of the wrath to come. Grant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, if it pleaſe thee, a quiet night, and make us all to be at peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time we beſeech thee, not to ſuffer that we ſhould deceive ourſelves by any falſe hope, but give us grace, day by day, to examine ourſelves with care and diligence, that we may diſcover all that is amiſs in us. O Lord deliver us from continuing in any known ſin. Save us from every ſecret iniquity; may we each of us reſolve before we go to reſt this night, to forſake, by thy grace aſſiſting us, every former tranſgreſſion, and may we now devote ourſelves entirely to thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                     <p>We further beſeech thee to bleſs all our relations, friends, and connections; take both them and us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy protection this night. And have mercy on all thoſe who are in pain, ſickneſs, or any other adverſity, do thou lighten their troubles and ſupport them by thy heavenly grace.</p>
                     <p>And accept our thanks for all thy goodneſs vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed

Praiſed be the Lord for all his mercies, for the health and ſtrength, and food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and comforts of every kind which we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. But above all we deſire to bleſs thy name for the gift of Jeſus Chriſt, thy Son, for the inſtructions of thy ſacred word, and for the hope of everlaſting life.—O Lord, grant unto us grace to receive theſe, and all thy bleſſings with a thankful heart, and let us ſhew forth thy praiſe, not with our lips only, but with our lives. Accept, we beſeech thee, our imperfect ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications and prayers, for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt, our only Lord and Saviour.</p>

                     <p>O Lord God Almighty, Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we bleſs thy name for all thy mercies vouchſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us the children of men.</p>
                     <p>We thank thee, O Lord, for all the bleſſings of this life, but eſpecially we praiſe thee for giving us thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly word, for ſending to us the miniſters of thy goſpel, and for appointing the Sabbath to be a ſeaſon of reſt for our bodies, and to be a day on which we may alſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the ſalvation of our immortal ſouls.</p>
                     <p>O Lord, grant we beſeech thee, that we may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe the religious opportunities which we enjoy.—Preſerve us from thoughtleſſneſs and inattention dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy public worſhip. In prayer may we feel our need of the mercies we implore. In the confeſſion of ſin, may we be affected with the ſenſe of our unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in offering up thankſgivings to God, may we pour out our whole hearts before thee. We pray alſo, that when we ſhall hear thy word read, and the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt preached to us, we may liſten with an attentive ear, and receive thy truth into an honeſt and good heart.</p>

And we beſeech thee to preſerve in us a right frame of mind throughout the day that is now before us.—May we remember that this is the day on which our Saviour roſe from the dead, having by his death ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained eternal redemption for us. May we therefore think of our aſcended Lord, and may we put away from us all folly and vanity, as well as vice and wickedneſs, and all eager deſires after the things of this life, and all anger and paſſion, and envy, and malice, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver elſe is either unſuitable to this ſacred day, or is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming the followers of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>O Lord, we lament that in paſſing through the week we are ſo often entangled by the cares of this life, and overpowered by temptations which come upon us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares. But we pray thee now to call away our tho'ts from earthly things, and to fix them on thoſe unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able joys which are at thy right hand for evermore.—We pray thee on this day to ſtrengthen our faith, to encreaſe our hope, and to fill our hearts with love to thee, and with fervent charity towards our neighbor. Help us alſo to repent of our ſins, examining carefully our conduct during the week, and thus may we learn to amend our lives, and to run with patience the race that is ſet before us.</p>
                     <p>And, together with theſe prayers for ourſelves, we offer up our ſupplications in behalf of all chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. Give thy grace to all the miniſters of thy goſpel, and enable them every where this day to preach thy word with faithfulneſs to the ſouls of men. Make thy goſpel effectual, to pull down the pride of the high minded, to alarm the careleſs, and convince the waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to encourage them that are as yet weak in faith, and to give peace and conſolation to every troubled heart.</p>
                     <p>And, O Lord, we beſeech thee, to ſend thy goſpel to the nations which now ſit in darkneſs. Put an end to all falſe religion, and idolatry, and ignorance, and
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:035296_0416_1001C361C961DEE8"/>error; and give thy bleſſing to thoſe who, in diſtant lands, are making known the light of thy truth.</p>

                     <p>O Lord God Almighty, Father of Mercies we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, for Chriſt's ſake, to hear the prayers which we are now about to offer up unto thee.</p>
                     <p>We pray thee, O Lord, to give thy bleſſing to the inſtruction which we have this day heard, and to grant that it may be ſo grafted inwardly in all our hearts, as to bring forth in us the fruits of good living, to the praiſe and glory of thy name. Pardon alſo whatſoever thou haſt ſeen amiſs in our worſhip and ſervices on this day.</p>
                     <p>And accept, O Lord, our humble confeſſion of all thoſe great and manifold ſins, which, from time to time both in thought, word, and deed, we have committed againſt thee: for we have left undone thoſe things which we ought to have done, and we have done thoſe things which we ought not to have done, and there is no health in us. We have ſinned, O Lord, by our pride and vanity, by our indulgence of many ſinful paſſions, by our fretfulneſs, impatience, and diſcontent, by our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, our ambition, and our covetouſneſs. We have ſinned alſo by our ſloth and negligence, by our forgetfulneſs of many duties of our calling, by our too great love of this preſent world, and by our careleſsneſs in following many of thoſe evil customs which we have found in it. More eſpecially we have ſinned by our inattention to thy written word, to thy preached goſpel and to all the means of thy grace.</p>
                     <p>For theſe, and all our numberleſs offences, we here
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:035296_0417_1001A4332DEBF370"/>implore thy pardon and forgiveneſs, in the name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; at the ſame time we thank thee for ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully providing the Saviour for us, who came down from heaven and died for our ſins, and who now ſitteth at thy right hand making interceſſion for us.</p>
                     <p>We alſo beſeech thee, for Chriſt's ſake, to grant unto us the help of thy holy ſpirit, that we may now forſake every evil way, and may amend our lives according to thy holy word. O Lord, preſerve us through the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing week from ſinning againſt thee. Save us from the world, the fleſh, and the devil. Carry us through all our temptations and dangers. Fit us for whatſoever duties are before us, and when we have fulfilled thy will on earth, receive us to thine eternal kingdom, through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And the ſame things which we have been imploring for ourſelves, we humbly aſk in behalf of our dear friends and relations. Grant unto them pardon of their ſins, an humble faith in Jeſus Chriſt their Lord, and grace to walk in the way of thy commandments. Be merciful to the land in which we live. Bleſs our king and all in authority. Give thine eſpecial grace to the miniſters of thy goſpel, that they may both preach thy true and lively word, and may alſo be examples to their flock of all virtue and goodneſs. Let thy bleſſing alſo deſcend on all the faithful followers of Jeſus Chriſt. Save them from the temptations which are in the world: ſtrengthen their faith and hope, and unite them in the bonds of chriſtian charity with each other; and have pity on all thoſe who neglect thy goſpel, and profane thy Sabbaths, and live as if there was no God in the world. Convince them of their ſins before it is too late, and incline them to ſeek for mercy, through that Saviour whoſe grace they now deſpiſe. And O Lord, deliver every one of us from all hardneſs of heart and contempt of thy word and commandments. Make us to lie down this night thankfull for the opportunities of
