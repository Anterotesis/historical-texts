            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>We may here remark,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Character of the <hi>Perſons</hi> concerned, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> and the <hi>Levites:</hi> On both ſides <hi>Perſons of Diſtinction,</hi> the <hi>One</hi> in Civil, the <hi>Other</hi> in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Office. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was no leſs than the <hi>King of Judah,</hi> the Supream Civil Ruler: the <hi>Levites</hi> were

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us attend unto the <hi>thing related</hi> as paſſing between them, which is the <hi>Kings</hi> ſpeaking Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably unto the <hi>Levites.</hi> The like we read in the 35. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> of <hi>Joſiah, that he ſet the Prieſts in their charges, and Encourag'd them to the Service of the Houſe of the Lord.</hi> His Dignity made this Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention in the ſight of men, yet was it but ſtrict Piety and Duty to God. He might have requir'd 'em only with the ſtern Majeſty of a King, but as became his Devotion he mildly &amp; kindly beſpoke 'em, with a ſweet and gracious Affability. His Countenance, his Behaviour, and all his Words did abundantly expreſs his Royal Favour &amp; Grace toward 'em, for their Incouragement in their Holy Miniſtrations. Nor are we to interpret theſe Comfortable Expreſſions of <hi>Good Words</hi> only, <hi>Be ye warmed, be ye filled;</hi> without the ſubſtantial fruits of a <hi>Princes</hi> Favour &amp; Care. Much leſs may we think them like the <hi>Empty Reſpects,</hi> flatteries &amp; promiſes of <hi>Modern Courtiers;</hi> but all was Cordial, unfeigned &amp; from the Heart: As we may read in the 31. <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> that <hi>in every work, which he began in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Houſe of God, and in the Law, and in the Commandments to ſeek his God, he did it with all his heart, and proſpered.</hi> Wherefore,</p>

               <hi>King</hi> is ſubjoyned, and that is, <hi>the Levites teaching the good Knowledge of the Lord.</hi> The <hi>Reaſon</hi> is taken partly from their <hi>Office,</hi> more eſpecially from their <hi>Fidelity</hi> therein: And ſo it anſwers the <hi>Apoſtolick Precept, Eſteeming them very highly in Love for their Works ſake.</hi> It was one part of the <hi>Levites</hi> Office to <hi>inſtruct</hi> the People in the Knowledge and Fear of God: their work was to <hi>teach:</hi> which reproves and condemns the <hi>Idle Paſtor,</hi> who <hi>Labours</hi> not <hi>in the Word and Doctrine,</hi> to feed their Flocks with Saving Knowledge, And <hi>King Hezekiahs</hi> regard to the <hi>Teaching Levite</hi> may well call to Mind the like <hi>Royal Examples,</hi> which have blazon'd the <hi>Britiſh Throne,</hi> in our late <hi>Sovereign Princes,</hi> who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd their <hi>Higheſt Prelates</hi> to be frequent in Preaching the <hi>Word</hi> Themſelves; promoting at the ſame time ſuch unto their Richeſt and Nobleſt <hi>Sees,</hi> as were deſirous of teaching the People the Knowledge of God. In the day when <hi>Popery ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated the Throne, Princes</hi> like holy <hi>Hezekiah</hi> aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and they <hi>ſpake Comfortably,</hi> and to this day continue the ſame Gracious Expreſſions to all the <hi>Levites</hi> that teach the Good Knowledge of the Lord.</p>

               <hi>The Good Knowledge:</hi> Knowledge is Good: <hi>Prov.</hi> 19 2. <hi>That the Soul be without Knowledge is not Good:</hi> But of all Knowledge none is like that which we have of the <hi>Bleſſed GOD</hi> from his <hi>Word:</hi> Of <hi>this</hi> we may ſay, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaid of <hi>God, Why call</hi> we <hi>any</hi> other <hi>Good? there is none Good ſave</hi> that <hi>One, which is</hi> of <hi>GOD.</hi> They that teach this good Knowledge faithfully, are to be held among Men eminently Good, <hi>Worthy of double Honour,</hi> meriting to be
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001346_0008_0FB2C72590A12808"/>ſpoken <hi>Comfortably</hi> unto by their <hi>Princes</hi> &amp; <hi>Rulers:</hi> Each of them ſingly, and all of them together, do merit this treatment and a ſingular Regard: And accordingly, tho' the <hi>Text denies not</hi> but that the <hi>King</hi> might <hi>frown</hi> upon the <hi>Idle and Vicious Levite,</hi> if there were any One ſo; yet is it <hi>expreſs</hi> on the other hand, that he ſpake comfortably to <hi>all</hi> thoſe <hi>Levites,</hi> that did <hi>faithfully</hi> teach the Good Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord.</p>
            <p>The DOCTRINE I wou'd offer from the <hi>Words</hi> is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is a very Noble &amp; Pious Diſpoſition in Civil Rulers, and their Incumbent Duty, to Comfort and Encourage the faithful Miniſters of</hi> CHRIST <hi>in their Holy Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I add a Word more, I have a double <hi>Preſumption to Apologize</hi> for; that I ſhou'd preſume to <hi>Preach</hi> to, or to <hi>plead</hi> for, my <hi>Superiors</hi> of <hi>both Orders.</hi> I am very ſenſible that a <hi>Concio ad Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtratum</hi> calls for Learning, Gravity &amp; Authority much beyond my Years, and that the <hi>Noble Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject (Pro Clere)</hi> does equally require the ſame. Yet I hope it will not be unacceptable at this time to Either <hi>Order,</hi> if I eſſay with all poſſible Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Humility, to aſſert the <hi>Honours</hi> which it has pleaſed God to entitle his <hi>Miniſtry</hi> unto, &amp; which it will be the Care and <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of pious <hi>Rulers</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to pay unto them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I beg the leave of this <hi>Honourable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to perſue a little theſe two <hi>Enquiries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>How</hi> Civil Rulers are to endeavour the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001346_0009_0FB2C7267291FBE0"/>and Encouragement of the Goſpel Miniſtry?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Why</hi> they ſhou'd do it, or what are their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations hereunto. The <hi>Enquiries</hi> are both <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious,</hi> and being to get <hi>haſtily</hi> thro' them I muſt be brief and <hi>general.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>How, or which way, are Civil Rulers to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Comfort of the Miniſtry?</hi> or, What is <hi>the Comfort</hi> which the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> craves or challenges of them by the Laws of the Goſpel? What is it that will comfort the faithful <hi>Diſpenſers</hi> of the Word, and what are the <hi>Regards</hi> which for this end the <hi>Civil Ruler</hi> owes unto the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Order?</p>
            <p>To apprehend this aright, we muſt conſider our <hi>Rulers</hi> in their <hi>Legiſlative</hi> Power or Truſt, and in their <hi>Executive,</hi> and finally in a <hi>Perſonal</hi> and more <hi>Private</hi> Character, as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of a <hi>Superior Degree</hi> only.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>In their Legiſlative power and truſt,</hi> it belongs to the Civil Ruler to ſpeak comfortably to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, <hi>by Enacting Good LAWS for the Honour and Eſtabliſhment of Religion within their Government.</hi> This lies near the heart of every good man; and one of the greateſt Comforts he can have that wiſhes well to the Religion of a Place, aiming at the Glory of God and the Salvation of Souls, is to ſee a <hi>Bulwark of good Laws</hi> for the defence &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Truths and Laws of God.

1. The Comfort of the Miniſtry depends very much on good and right <hi>Laws reſpecting the Publick Worſhip of God, and that both Natural &amp; Inſtituted:</hi> that the <hi>Holy Ordinances</hi> of God be duly adminiſtred and attended according to His Appointment in His Word. Indeed <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> may not <hi>frame</hi> and invent at their pleaſure <hi>Modes</hi> and Exerciſes of Divine Worſhip for their People: GOD by whom They rule has given Them &amp; Us a <hi>Law</hi> how He will be Worſhip'd: to <hi>alter</hi> this or to <hi>add</hi> unto it were to offer <hi>Strange Fire</hi> for hallowed Incenſe and with the face of Homage manifeſtly to kick at his Soverain Authority, deſpiſing his moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Word. Nor may the Ruler <hi>invade the Prieſt, Office to Officiate in their Holy Miniſtrations,</hi> unto which they are <hi>Ordain'd.</hi> It was unto <hi>Uzziahs</hi> deſtruction that his <hi>heart was lifted up to tranſgreſs againſt the Lord his God,</hi> when he went into the Temple of the Lord <hi>to burn Intenſe upon the Altar of Incenſe:</hi> 2 Chron. xxvi. 16,—21. Nor was it Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty or Rebellion in <hi>Azariah the Prieſt</hi> and his valiant <hi>Brethren</hi> when they <hi>withſtood</hi> him, and ſaid unto him, <hi>It pertaineth not unto thee Uzziah to burn Incenſe unto the Lord, but to the Prieſts the Sons of Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, that are conſecrated to burn Incenſe: Go out of the Sanctuary, for thou haſt treſpaſſed, neither ſhall it be for thine Honour from the Lord God:</hi> And when he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis'd the faithful admonition, being <hi>Inrag'd</hi> at it, <hi>The Lord ſmote him beſide the. Altar, with the Cenſer in his hand; the Leproſie roſe up in his forehead,</hi> and he <hi>haſted</hi> to leave the Sacred place he had invaded, <hi>being a Leper to the day of his death,</hi> and ſo cut off from the Houſe of the Lord, whither he had gone
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001346_0011_0FB2C72972B86FA0"/>ſo preſumptuouſly. Now tho' this <hi>Inſtance</hi> alone be eno' to warn the <hi>Higheſt Perſons</hi> unto all poſſible caution, not to treſpaſs upon the <hi>Incloſures of Gods Miniſtry,</hi> conſecrated to <hi>Divine Service;</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we muſt by no means think that the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> has nothing to do, or to concern himſelf <hi>ex Officio,</hi> about the <hi>Inſtitutions of God.</hi> The <hi>Civil Powers</hi> may Enact the very Laws of God about his own Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip under temporal <hi>Penalties,</hi> preſerving an <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> unto tender Conſciences: They may take Laws out of the Word of God and make 'em their <hi>Own,</hi> Commanding People to <hi>regard</hi> the holy <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> of God, to <hi>get</hi> &amp; <hi>uphold</hi> his <hi>Worſhip</hi> among them, to <hi>Sanctifie the Sabbath,</hi> to <hi>reverence</hi> Gods <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> to <hi>build</hi> themſelves <hi>decent places</hi> for the Publick Worſhip, and <hi>frequent</hi> them in the ſtated ſeaſons thereof with Solemnity.</p>
            <p>It belongs alſo to the Rulers Province, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide that <hi>Miniſters do their Duty</hi> in the Publick Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations that pertain unto their Office; that neither by <hi>groſs Neglects,</hi> Unreaſonable <hi>Abſence</hi> from their <hi>Charge, Non-reſidence,</hi> open <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> or any Scandalous courſe of <hi>Vice,</hi> they <hi>do not defeat</hi> the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Deſign of their Miniſtry: in all which <hi>Caſes</hi> the Civil Cognizance is merited, and needed to rebuke and remedy the Evil; and Rulers ought to provide accordingly in ſubordination to the Laws of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> provided in that caſe already. So that if the <hi>Sons of Eli</hi> will make themſelves <hi>Vile,</hi> to cauſe men to <hi>abhor</hi> the Offering of the Lord, it is duty of the <hi>Judge in Iſrael,</hi> tho' he be their <hi>Father,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them not only a <hi>light</hi> Rebuke, but a ſevere Cenſure, Degradation and Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:001346_0012_0FB2C72AF3D8BC50"/>
In all ſuch Caſes both Miniſters and People <hi>owe Obedience and Submiſſion</hi> to the Civil Ruler, as in our <hi>Context</hi> the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and the <hi>Levites</hi> obeyed the Summons of the <hi>King,</hi> and did the thing which he requir'd in the cauſe of God and agreeable to his Will: xxix. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>v. And they gathered their Brethren, and Sanctify'd themſelves, and came according to the Commandment of the King, by the Word of the Lord.</hi> Being that the Kings Commandment was according to and grounded on the Law of God, they conſcientiouſly obey'd it, in deference both to God and the King.</p>
            <p>Nor are the Holy Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> duly <hi>comforted</hi> in the work of the Lord, in their Serving at the Tabernacle and Temple, unleſs the Civil Power do thus engage on their ſide. For as the World goes, 'tis neceſſary for the Powers' on Earth to enforce that under preſent <hi>bodily Pains</hi> &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Penalties, which the Great GOD has more awfully commanded on pain of <hi>Eternal Damnation:</hi> that bold Sinners who have no regard to their <hi>Souls</hi> may be reſtrain'd however by what they have for their <hi>Bodies,</hi> their <hi>Name, Eſtates</hi> and outward Intereſts; and that men who will not <hi>Fear God</hi> ſo as to be religious in ſecret and in heart, may how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever for <hi>Fear of Man</hi> at leaſt not be Audacious and Inſolent, blaſpheme the Name of God, nor ſpit at his Altars; which many profane Wretches wou'd do, if the Civil Sword did not defend and do Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Comfort of the Miniſtry depends very much on Good and Right Laws with reſpect to <hi>the Peace &amp; Order, Diſcipline and Government of the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001346_0013_0FB2C72D4A962CB0"/>Churches.</hi> It is true, that the <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> are not to aſſume to themſelves the Adminiſtration of <hi>Church Cenſures,</hi> but to preſerve inviolate unto the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> the Power of <hi>Judgment,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> has lodg'd in them: Yet is it not to be tho't that the Magiſtrate muſt ſit by <hi>Unconcerned,</hi> and quietly ſee things run to <hi>Confuſion,</hi> and the wounds of Churches to <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green</hi> and grow Incurable: Or if the State of the Church be viſibly <hi>Conſumptive,</hi> and it be ſenſibly pining and languiſhing away, the <hi>Paſtors</hi> not eno' laying it to heart, and the <hi>People</hi> thro' Inadvertence willing to have it ſo; Is it not <hi>Laudable</hi> &amp; a Duty for <hi>Rulers</hi> in ſuch a caſe to take Care? to iſſue out their <hi>Authoritative Orders,</hi> to ſtir up Miniſters and People to their Reſpective Duties? for the <hi>Revival</hi> of dying <hi>Church Order,</hi> and the Spirit of true <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi> with practical Godlineſs, which depend ſo much thereupon.</p>
            <p>As therefore it is the worthy Care of Rulers to <hi>Admoniſh the Churches</hi> of any groſs defects and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences, hazards and dangers, maladies and diſtempers, which they diſcern upon us at any time in Spiritual Reſpects; So alſo their Wiſdom and Piety wou'd be greatly diſplay'd at this day, and they wou'd do much to comfort the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt thro' the Land, if they cou'd any way provide to heal the long <hi>Unſettlement of bereaved Churches,</hi> together with the criminal ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Quarrels</hi> that occaſion it; to give <hi>Authority al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to Eccleſiaſtical Councils</hi> in their Determinations; and to make People know <hi>that there muſt and ſhall be ſome End</hi> to their Strifes &amp; Diſcords, the Parents of every <hi>Confuſion &amp; Evil Work,</hi> the <hi>bane</hi> of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:001346_0014_0FB2C7326599A028"/>
It belongs alſo to the Civil Powers <hi>to call Synods</hi> upon Occaſion for theſe Ends, and then to give their <hi>Sanction</hi> to their juſt and approved <hi>Reſolutions.</hi> Nor are the hands of <hi>Aaron</hi> ſtrong, but when <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> his Brother and his Lord, ſtands by and aſſiſts him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Comfort of the Miniſtry depends very much on Good and ſufficient Laws <hi>for the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Support and Maintenance thereof,</hi> and that in <hi>a Wiſe and Right Manner.</hi> So <hi>Hezekiah</hi> comforted the <hi>Levites</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> as we read in the xxxi. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v. Moreover, he commanded the People that dwelt at Jeruſalem, to give the portion of the Prieſts and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, that they might be Encouraged in the Work of the Lord.</hi> The <hi>Wiſe King</hi> knew that they cou'd not chearfully, diligently, wholly devote themſelves to the <hi>Study</hi> of the Law, the Inſtruction of the People, and the Miniſtrations of the Sanctuary, without that Honourable <hi>Subſiſtence,</hi> which God had provided for them.</p>
            <p>I need not ſay how <hi>Noble the Proviſion</hi> was that God made for the <hi>Tribe of Levi,</hi> nor how plain the <hi>Goſpel Inſtitution</hi> is, <hi>That they that Preach the Goſpel ſhou'd live of the Goſpel.</hi> So hath the <hi>Lord Ordained,</hi> even as we know that under the <hi>Law,</hi> They who did Miniſter about Holy things, <hi>lived of the things of the Temple,</hi> and they that waited at the Altar <hi>were Partakers with the Altar.</hi> 1 Cor. ix. 13, 14. Which Inſtitution has its foundation in ſtrict E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity &amp; Righteouſneſs <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>For who goeth a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare at his own Charges? who planteth a Vineyard and eateth not of the Fruit thereof? or who feedeth a Flock and eateth not of the Milk of the Flock?</hi> Nay, the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001346_0015_0FB2C734BB94BF20"/>Advantage of the <hi>Exchange</hi> is ſo much on the ſide of the <hi>People,</hi> that after all they do by no means pay the Labours of their Faithful <hi>Paſtors,</hi> nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for the Profits received by thoſe Labours if it be not their own fault: <hi>v.</hi> ii. <hi>If we have ſown unto you ſpiritual things, is it a great thing if we ſhall reap your carnal things?</hi> No truly, 'tis a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for People to ſubſiſt them in a few outward things, whom God has ſeparated wholly from worldly things, to Serve them in their Spiritual and Soul concerns.</p>
            <p>Now I need not labour much to prove to You, that <hi>there can be no great Comfort</hi> in the Miniſterial Work without a decent outward Subſiſtence: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the <hi>Angels of the Churches</hi> were already <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>as the Angels of God</hi> above, as the Saints will be in the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> State; when as they ſhall no more <hi>Marry,</hi> ſo neither ſhall they need <hi>Food</hi> or <hi>Raiment</hi> for the Body. But while this <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> (the Goſpel Miniſtration) is in <hi>Earthen Veſſels;</hi> and Spirits in Fleſh, of as many neceſſities and bodily wants as their Nei'bours, are imploy'd in theſe holy Services for your Souls, there muſt be a laudable Proviſion for their Bodies and Families, or they muſt be left deſolate and <hi>Comfortleſs.</hi> There can be no Comfort to be ſure in <hi>Pinching</hi> and Starving Circumſtances, in <hi>Rags</hi> and Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the <hi>Cryes</hi> of hungry Children, or in the proſpect of meaneſs and want for their Families after them. If it was Infamous in <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to make Prieſts of the <hi>Loweſt of the People,</hi> 'twill be no leſs in us to degrade the <hi>Sacred Order</hi> to the <hi>loweſt,</hi> by one <hi>Method</hi> or another, whether by Maintaining
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001346_0016_0FB2C73640B9DE08"/>the Miniſtry ſo <hi>Meanly</hi> that none but the <hi>Loweſt</hi> will come into it; or if they do, that according to humane proſpect they ſhall be ſure to have their Families among the <hi>leaſt in Iſrael.</hi> [Which were as if all the <hi>Sons of Aaron</hi> were for ever to inherit the Curſe of <hi>Eli's Houſe, crouching for a piece of Silver and a Morſel of Bread, and ſaying, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the Prieſts Offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Had I time I ſhould here have added, <hi>that</hi> the Miniſtry alone is <hi>a ſufficient Care and Labour for the whole Life: that</hi> our whole Time &amp; Strength is too little for it to diſcharge it faithfully: <hi>that</hi> we need no <hi>Avocations</hi> or hindrances from the wants of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, or from Worldly Secular Buſineſſes: <hi>That</hi> the Office is <hi>Generous</hi> &amp; Noble, as well as the Work Great and Heavy: <hi>that</hi> the <hi>Minds</hi> imploy'd in this Sublime and Holy Service ſhou'd be ſuppos'd <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,</hi> and improved by a Learned Education: <hi>that</hi> their <hi>Rank</hi> and Place among men has always been next to the Civil Magiſtrate; and this not only by the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> of all Nations, but by the <hi>Grant</hi> of God Himſelf, and therefore it is not of meer <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy,</hi> but of <hi>Right</hi> and Natural Decency: <hi>that</hi> where there has been any <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> whether of Gods Ordination among the <hi>Jews,</hi> or of Humane Eſtabliſhment (we ſay) among <hi>Chriſtian Nations,</hi> not to name the <hi>Orders</hi> of old in the Idolatrous <hi>Heathen</hi> World; I ſay, where-ever any <hi>Hierarchy</hi> has been ſet up in the World, diſtinguiſhing the <hi>Clergy</hi> into divers Orders &amp; <hi>Degrees,</hi> the Superiour Order has been ever grac'd in the firſt <hi>Rank of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:</hi> I might add, <hi>That</hi> the Miniſterial Work is
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001346_0017_0FB2C737B8D20540"/>not to be levell'd wich <hi>Mechanic</hi> Labours, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,</hi> nor other more <hi>Liberal</hi> Imployments nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Practice of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> or the teaching of <hi>Phyloſophy,</hi> not excepted: [To acknowledge which is but a meet Reſpect to the <hi>Great God,</hi> in whoſe immediate Service we are; as alſo 'tis but a decent reſpect to our own <hi>Souls,</hi> for the Improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which in Spiritual Knowledge, their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, Converſion &amp; Salvation, we are imployed; And ſurely, <hi>to teach the Good Knowledge of the Lord</hi> is of more Excellency &amp; Uſe, than to be <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of any <hi>Secular Science,</hi> ignorant of which we may live and dy and yet be Saved.] Now if the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice be ſo Superior, the Maintenance ſhou'd be alſo Honourable, or it is very Indecent and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſightly.</p>
            <p>I muſt needs add one thing more here: That the want of a Comfortable Support for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel is <hi>a great Wrong to Souls.</hi> It is ſo very often to the Souls of your <hi>Miniſters:</hi> they can't be ſo faithful as they deſire to be. I have heard ſome of our <hi>Reverend Brethrer</hi> complain of this with great Affliction, "That they have not Time to <hi>Study</hi> as they wou'd, "That they can't make the <hi>Paſtoral Viſits</hi> which they gladly wou'd to the Families under their Watch; becauſe their own Families being Numerous, and their income Small, they muſt ſpend a great part of the Week in Secular Affairs. Thus they are bereaved of the Comfort of the Senſe of having done their Duty to your Immortal Souls. <hi>Again,</hi> It is a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the Souls of <hi>People,</hi> the precious Souls of your Families &amp; <hi>Children.</hi> Theſe ſuffer in Spiritual
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001346_0018_0FB2C739615153D0"/>reſpects, by Miniſters ſuffering in temporal things: They are not ſo <hi>fed</hi> and <hi>watch'd</hi> over as elſe they might be: <hi>And ſo in pinching their faithful Paſtors, People do eventually Starve the Souls of their Houſeholds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Conclude, I know not how the <hi>Publick can be Innocent,</hi> if <hi>Lawgiver;</hi> do not make a juſt Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the Maintenance of the Miniſtry: In a great part they muſt expect to anſwer to God for the Neglect there is in the <hi>Land</hi> as to the Care of Souls; and if Religion and Learning be loſt, and our Souls after them, it will be in a great meaſure owing to this, <hi>That we have not hearts big eno' to part with a few Carnal things to Save all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>And Laſtly,</hi> The Comfort of Gods Faithful Miniſters does very much depend on the Proviſion of a ſufficient Body of Laws, <hi>with reſpect unto Peoples Morals.</hi> This is a very wide and extenſive <hi>Head;</hi> Namely, the Sobriety &amp; Righteouſneſs, Purity and Blameleſsneſs of People in Word and Action, in their whole Conduct and Behaviour, in every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Circumſtance of Life. The Religion of a People appears in Practice, in Obedience to the <hi>Moral Law.</hi> If this is religiouſly obſerved, if men lead Sober, Righteous and Godly Lives, then have Miniſters the Conſolation of their Labours, then have they not <hi>ſpent their Strength for nought and in vain;</hi> but they behold the fruits of the Grace of God in their Hearers hearts, <hi>ſhown out of a Good Converſation:</hi> Then is the Goſpel of <hi>God our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> viſibly Adorned, and your <hi>Apoſtolick Paſtors</hi> have <hi>no greater Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the Laws of a <hi>Land</hi> do not provide againſt all <hi>Scandalous Immoralities,</hi> Rulers do not ſpeak

               <hi>Comfortably</hi> to any that have the leaſt Reſpect for Religion: they are grieved, ſcandaliz'd, offended at bold and lawleſs Vice defying our Holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: their righteous Souls are <hi>vexed</hi> at the filthy unreſtrained Converſation of the Wicked.

I have done with the <hi>firſt thing</hi> wherein Civil Rulers are to endeavour the Comfort of thoſe that teach the good Knowledge of the LORD, <hi>Namely, In their Legiſlative power and truſt,</hi> by <hi>Enacting</hi> good Laws for the Honour and Eſtabliſhment of Religion within their Government. I will be more <hi>brief</hi> in the other <hi>Inſtances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. It belongs to <hi>Rulers,</hi> and all <hi>Publick Officers, Superior or Inferior,</hi> in their <hi>Executive</hi> truſt &amp; power, to Comfort all thoſe that ſtand up for GOD or are more immediately related to his Service, by the <hi>Faithful Execution of thoſe good Laws, that relate to Religion,</hi> the Honour of God, the Obſervation of the Divine Law, and the Proſperity of the <hi>Church of Chriſt.</hi> We have <hi>Good Laws</hi> againſt Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Contempt of the Divine Ordinances; herein the <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> have endeavour'd our Comfort: It now and always lies with the <hi>Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Judges,</hi> the <hi>Worſhipful Gentlemen in Commiſſion for the Peace,</hi> with <hi>Inferior Officers</hi> in every degree of Power or Truſt, to the faithful diſcharge of which Reſpective Truſts they are <hi>Sworn</hi> and under the <hi>Oath of God,</hi> as <hi>Revengers to execute Wrath upon him that doth Evil:</hi> without which the Magiſtrate does at laſt <hi>hold the Sword in vain,</hi> and the <hi>Penalties</hi> threatned in the Law prove an <hi>Empty Noiſe</hi> and a <hi>Lye.

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001346_0021_0FB2C73DF7BEE3A8"/>Peculiarly the Care of the Civil Sword,</hi> to protect them from all Open Wrongs and Affronts; the wicked in the World being ready to trample them in the duſt, and with-hold their <hi>Legal Rights:</hi> And the more <hi>backward</hi> they are to <hi>Aſſert</hi> 'em, and fill their Superiors Ears with <hi>Complaints;</hi> of <hi>Them</hi> eſpecially to whoſe Service in Spiritual Reſpects they are devoted; in this caſe the Magiſtrate ſhou'd not always <hi>wait for a formal Complaint,</hi> but find a Tongue for the <hi>Dumb</hi> and an Arm for the <hi>Meek,</hi> be Eyes to the <hi>Blind,</hi> and Feet to the <hi>Lame,</hi> and <hi>Search out the Cauſe</hi> Himſelf. For there is a <hi>Modeſty in Superior Minds</hi> which reſtrains them from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and cauſes 'em <hi>rather to ſuffer wrong:</hi> And there is a Regard to Mens Souls in many of Gods Servants ſo Superior to their Care about their own Temporal Concerns, <hi>Seeking not theirs but them,</hi> that they had rather Silently Suffer at home than their holy Miniſtrations ſhou'd ſuffer with unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable men abroad.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>And Laſtly,</hi> Much is Incumbent on Civil Rulers for the Comfort and Encouragement of the Miniſtry, <hi>in a Perſonal and more Private Character, as Chriſtians of a Superiour Degree only.</hi> And under this Conſideration of Themſelves, they ſhou'd hold Themſelves obliged to comfort the faithful Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the good Knowledge of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In taking care to give a Vertuous and Religious Example in their own Converſation, both Private and Publick.</hi> Authority and Dignity carries ſo much of the Stamp and Image of God upon it, that tho' it receives its higheſt Grace and Luſtre from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001346_0022_0FB2C73FF1076828"/>yet to the Eyes of Inferiors it reflects back alſo a great honour on Religion, and the Doctrine of God our Saviour is Eminently Adorn'd thereby. 'Tis a Comfortable thing to ſee Thoſe, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Ye are gods,</hi> paying the profoundeſt Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and Homage to the Great GOD <hi>by whom they Rule;</hi> and they that give Laws to others paying Themſelves the moſt careful Obedience to the Divine Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> when we come into your <hi>Preſence,</hi> your Wife and Grave, your Pure and Devout <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> may be long remembred with Reverence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> the Vertue and <hi>Order</hi> of your Families, may like that of <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſhow the whole Land what the Fear of the Lord is.</p>

            <p>For which End I cannot but wiſh, and with the loweſt Deference wou'd earneſtly commend it to the Conſciences of Some whom I greatly honour in their Civil Character, <hi>That all our Rulers might ſtand compleat in their Chriſtian Profeſſion:</hi> And while they fill our Conſpicuous <hi>Seats</hi> at the <hi>Council Board,</hi> in <hi>Courts of Juſtice,</hi> and in the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, their <hi>Place</hi> might not be left empty at <hi>the Table of Chriſt:</hi> An Example that muſt needs hurt our Churches, and the Souls of the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> from <hi>Perſons</hi> of your Knowledge, Gravity, and believed Piety.</p>
            <p>Magiſtrates ſhou'd be among the firſt at the Temple, and there and every where their <hi>Lights</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:001346_0023_0FB2C741858E87F8"/>ſhou'd <hi>Shine before Men;</hi> Not in the vain Spirit of <hi>John,</hi> who ſought <hi>Fame</hi> from a <hi>falſe Blaze, Come, ſee my Zeal for the Lord:</hi> [Tho' it muſt be ſaid, that it is as <hi>Impolitick</hi> as it is profane for Rulers to live in Irreligious Courſes: And yet a meer <hi>Mask</hi> of Religion is a <hi>Mean Diſguize,</hi> as well as <hi>horrid;</hi> to ſeek to eſtabliſh our Power by abuſing &amp; affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Glorious and Fearful Name of God.]</p>
            <p n="2">2. It beſeems the Chriſtian Magiſtrate to ſpeak Comfortably to the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, <hi>by giving open Reſpects and Honours to their Perſons, treating one always with diſtinction before the People.</hi> As <hi>Fathers,</hi> ſays the <hi>Apoſtie;</hi> as <hi>Children,</hi> tho't the good King <hi>Hezekiah, Chap.</hi> xxix. <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>My Sons,</hi> ſaid he to the <hi>Levites,</hi> My Sons, <hi>be not negligent.</hi> And it is Remarkable with what Affability, Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Love the <hi>Pious Kings of Iſrael</hi> were wont to treat the <hi>Prophets of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A pious Ruler will never be a Stranger to his faithful <hi>Paſtor,</hi> if it be not <hi>his</hi> own Will and Fault, which is not to be ſuppoſed neither. [Nor is it the ſingle Comfort of a Venerable Superiors Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, that we have in the Friendſhip of a Pious Ruler; but as <hi>King Saul</hi> himſelf once askt of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> it honours us before the People, and moſt effectually teaches them to venerate their <hi>Teachers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly our <hi>Gracious</hi> QUEEN has taught all in <hi>Subordinate Place</hi> their true Honour and Duty, promiſing in Her <hi>Proclamation</hi> againſt Vice, a <hi>Diſtinction in Her Royal Favour to Perſons of Piety and Vertue.</hi> No Earthly <hi>Prince</hi> can go by a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Rule, than this by which GOD governs His own Regards, which is <hi>His Own Moral Image and Grace.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:001346_0024_0FB2C74729EDDB30"/>
3. It is expected of the Civil Ruler to ſpeak Comfortably to thoſe that teach the good Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, <hi>by excelling others in a chearful Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Support the Divine Worſhip with their outward Eſtate.</hi> 'Tis ſuppoſed, that generally they are diſtinguiſh'd by Providence with <hi>Riches</hi> as well as Honour and Power; and if ſo, they are <hi>Poor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi> at laſt to their Reſpective Churches if they do not <hi>lead in a Generous Contributing</hi> to the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Miniſtry. If a rich Magiſtrate is ſeen to <hi>Pinch,</hi> what will not others do, who are of Eſtate as mean as their Quality? When the Building of the <hi>Temple</hi> was to be provided for, <hi>King David</hi> firſt exhauſted his own <hi>Royal Treaſures,</hi> and then the People gave largely. This alſo was one way wherein <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſpake ſo comfortably to the <hi>Levites</hi> and the <hi>Prieſthood, v.</hi> 24. He gave <hi>a Thouſand Bullocks and Seven Thouſand Sheep, and the Princes gave a Thouſand Bullocks, and Ten Thouſand Sheep, and a great number of Prieſts Sanctify'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi> And in the xxxi. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> we read fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that <hi>Hezekiah appointed the Kings portion of his Subſtance for the Burnt-Offering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God has honour'd Rulers above others, and He expects that they do more than others to honour Him. Where He gives Riches in Abundance, He looks that Men do proportionably caſt into his <hi>Treaſury</hi> out of their Abundance; or elſe let the <hi>Poor Widow</hi> throw in her <hi>Single Mite,</hi> and Heaven will account that ſhe has <hi>done more than all</hi> the Great and the Rich.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:001346_0025_0FB2C749024E87C8"/>
Having urg'd You ſo far, I will not Suppreſs two Tho'ts more, wherein the <hi>Rich and Honourable</hi> may greatly comfort the Churches &amp; Miniſtry of Chriſt. The <hi>One</hi> is, <hi>By devoting a Select Son</hi> to the Service of the Temple, &amp; leaving him an Inheritance equal with his <hi>Brethren.</hi> The <hi>Other</hi> is, That you wou'd employ ſome ſuitable parts of your <hi>Eſtates</hi> as a <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute</hi> to God and his Miniſtry in <hi>Founding, Endowing, Eſtabliſhing</hi> and <hi>Securing Schools for Literature and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi> More eſpecially, our fair and lov'd <hi>Mother</hi> the COLLEDGE, which <hi>Happy Foundation</hi> God has ſignally bleſs'd and made the Great Glory of the <hi>Land;</hi> filling every <hi>Chair of Honour</hi> almoſt with her <hi>Worthy Sons.</hi> The flouriſhing of that <hi>Society</hi> is the Great Joy and Comfort of the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> and ſo is the preſent <hi>happy Settlement</hi> thereof, as was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly teſtify'd to the <hi>Honourable</hi> COURT in the <hi>united Addreſſes</hi> of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> the <hi>laſt year.</hi> And whatever it ſhall pleaſe God to direct the GREAT and GENERAL COURT further to do, in their preſent <hi>Seſſion</hi> or hereafter, for the <hi>Security</hi> of that <hi>Body</hi> and the more Honourable Support of the <hi>Reverend Preſident,</hi> it will greatly comfort the hearts of the preſent <hi>Miniſtry:</hi> So great a part of Whom muſt always own Him, with great Reverence and Love, a Wiſe and Careful <hi>Eather</hi> to them, in their happy Education under his <hi>Immediate Inſpection and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have done with the <hi>Firſt Enquiry,</hi> and it may be, almoſt preſum'd too far on your Candour and Indulgence in ſome particulars; wherein at laſt I wou'd by no means be underſtood to pretend to direct my <hi>Superiours.</hi>

               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:001346_0026_0FB2C74A86408E30"/>
I will not enter on the <hi>Second</hi> thing propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, left I treſpaſs Egregiouſly on your Patience, Namely.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>To give the Reaſons of the Doctrine,</hi> or to prove it to be the Rulers Incumbent Duty, to Comfort and Encourage the faithful Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in their holy Work. The <hi>Word</hi> of God <hi>requires</hi> this of Magiſtrates, [cenſures the wont of it, and brands thoſe <hi>Reigns</hi> wherein Religion was not cared for, perverted, depraved, and the <hi>Prophets</hi> ill treated.] Miniſters <hi>need</hi> this Comfort and Help in their hard &amp; difficult Work, [to oppoſe mens Luſts, &amp; bear up under the double meaſure of Trouble that falls to their ſhare.] The <hi>Efficacy</hi> and. Succeſs of the Miniſterial Labours does under God very much depend on the Rulers Countenance and Influence. The <hi>Nature of Magiſtracy</hi> ſpeaks it to be the Rulers incumbent Duty to encourage the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of God, being the <hi>Ordinance of God,</hi> to rule and judge for Him, and accountable to Him, the Supream Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Judge of all the Earth. Not to add, that a Land has no more faithful <hi>Friends</hi> and richer <hi>Bleſſings</hi> in it, than the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt: Nor the Magiſtracy any <hi>ſurer Support</hi> than the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Religion; their Power being from God, the Reverence of Whom once failing the foundation of Government is ras'd.</p>

1. <hi>It addreſſes to our, Civil Rulers, that Religion may always have this Countenance and Comfort from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We cannot but own the Piety of our Rulers in their open and avowed Reſpects unto the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the holy <hi>Paſtors</hi> of them. We give thanks to God, for the Great Comfort we have in the <hi>Devotion</hi> and bright <hi>Vertue</hi> of many of our <hi>Magiſtrates;</hi> for the Good <hi>Laws</hi> we have in defence of the Faith and Worſhip of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and againſt Scandalous Immoralities; and that the <hi>Seats of Judgment</hi> are fill'd with Men of known Integrity and Religious Zeal.</p>
            <p>We have Great <hi>Conſolation</hi> in <hi>His</hi> EXCELLEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIES <hi>Noble Example;</hi> His Wiſe, Grave, and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally Religious Converſation; the viſible Order and Devotion of his Houſe, and his tender Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Carriage, toward the <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt;</hi> Of the Body of <hi>Whom</hi> I have this moſt ſure and certain Knowledge, that they are greatly comforted in Him.</p>
            <p>In the Times of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Superſtition, I am told, it was the firſt Propoſal or Enquiry at the opening of the <hi>Parliament, What more is to be done for the Holy Mother the Church?</hi> Far be it, that in our happyer Days of <hi>Reform'd Religion,</hi> the Miniſtry and <hi>Pure</hi> Worſhip of God ſhou'd have leſs of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators</hi> Care. Suffer me then to pray that the Comfort of theſe Churches may always lye near Your hearts, and have ſome Conſideration with You in every Seſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:001346_0028_0FB2C74DDB906580"/>
More eſpecially, the more Honourable Support of <hi>Miniſters</hi> thro' the Land wou'd be one moſt worthy Care of the <hi>Aſſembly.</hi> I ſpeak not from Want, or for any <hi>Self-Intereſt,</hi> being by the good Providence of God, and the Care of my <hi>Beloved Church,</hi> equal in <hi>Salary</hi> with any of my <hi>Brethren:</hi> But I ſpeak from a tender feeling of the <hi>Slender</hi> Circumſtances of Many (my <hi>Betters</hi>) in other Places; and from an eaſy fore-ſight of the Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that muſt come unto our Churches, if there be not an Inlargement in the Maintenance of the Miniſtry in moſt Places. For as this is in the People a too palpable Evidence of a <hi>Lean</hi> Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I mean of their not profiting by the Word; So is it the ready way to make lean and <hi>Poor</hi> Preaching, by Starving mens <hi>Parts</hi> &amp; Oppreſſing their <hi>Graces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Poverty of the Land is no Objection</hi> againſt doing more than is done for the <hi>Miniſtry.</hi> People might do much more and not feel it. Nay it were the way to grow Rich, if we did our Duty in Supporting Honourably the Worſhip of God. For as it is the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of God that maketh rich, ſo He has told his People that their defrauding Him is their own Impoveriſhment: <hi>Mal.</hi> iii. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Ye have robbed ME, — in Tithes and Offerings: Ye are curſed with a curſe. — Bring ye all the Tithes into the Store-houſe, that there may be meat in my Houſe, and prove me now here-with, ſaith the LORD of Hoſts, if I will not open you the Windows of Heaven, and pour you out a Bleſſing, that there ſhall not be room eno' to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:001346_0029_0FB2C7523825FE30"/>
Again, <hi>There is no fear of the Idleneſs, Pride or Luxury of the Clergy,</hi> from that decent and juſt Maintenance I am pleading for. I plead for no Sumptuouſneſs or Exceſs, but bare Convenience. And if Profeſſors of the Goſpel are againſt this, their Devotion is too much like what the <hi>Fable</hi> tells of the <hi>Illiberal Biſhops</hi> Bleſſing, not amounting in real Value unto the price of a <hi>Farthing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ought with Thankfulneſs to acknowledge the Piety of the <hi>Government,</hi> in the good Proviſion made to Pay out of the <hi>Publick Treaſury</hi> the <hi>Dues</hi> of Miniſters wrongfully detained from them; and to Tax the reſpective <hi>Towns</hi> or <hi>Precincts</hi> in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And we may lay it down for a <hi>Rule</hi> to us, that the Miniſtry can never be Comfortable, while in the Settlement of <hi>Miniſters</hi> there continues a neceſſity of <hi>driving Sordid Bargains about a Salary,</hi> or while after ſettlement they are forc'd either <hi>abjectly to beg</hi> and entreat, or <hi>reſolutely to ſcuffle</hi> and fight for their Dues by ſolemn Engagements.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not need to addreſs You again about the <hi>Colledge;</hi> to ſpeak comfortably always to <hi>the Sons of the Prophets at Bethel,</hi> which has indeed been to Us as <hi>the Houſe of GOD and the Gate of Heaven,</hi> for the Heavenly <hi>Iſſues</hi> thence, which have refreſhed the City of our God.</p>
            <p>I will rather mention with great Honour the preſent Care that the <hi>Governmen</hi> is ſhewing, with reſpect unto the <hi>Miſerable Places of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Irreligion,</hi> that have hitherto <hi>Shut out</hi> the Miniſtry and Ordinances of <hi>Chriſt</hi> from among them, counting themſelves unworthy of Eternal Life, Your Deſires and Labours after a <hi>Miſſion</hi> of

            </p>
            <p>And now, <hi>Finally,</hi> Need I again <hi>Exhort You, Much Honoured, to be Religious Your Selves,</hi> to fear the GOD by whom You rule, and to Serve Him who honours You among His People? You muſt needs think Your Selves Obliged to ſhine before Us, in all Vertue, in Devotion, in Faith, in Zeal; in a Publick reſpect to the Inſtitutions of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and in an Abhorrence of all Immoral Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; more eſpecially let me ſay, of <hi>Frauds</hi> and diſhoneſty, of nauſeous <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> of <hi>Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking,</hi> of <hi>Unnatural Strifes</hi> in Churches, and the <hi>Contemptuous Spites of many againſt their holy Paſtors.</hi>

            <p n="2">II. My next Addreſs is unto <hi>my Reverend Fathers and Brethren in the</hi> MINISTRY. If it be our <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> Duty and Piety to comfort <hi>Us,</hi> we muſt needs think it <hi>Our Own,</hi>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>To endeavour in our Places to comfort our Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Rulers.</hi> The Obligation is certainly mutual, and 'tis but a grateful Return unto the <hi>Good and Gentle,</hi> nay a Duty even to the <hi>Froward.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us fervently <hi>Pray</hi> for our Rulers, which is <hi>Good and Acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 1, 2, 3. Let us be <hi>Examples to our Flocks of Loyalty,</hi> Humility, Peaceableneſs, Meekneſs, Love, Honour, Obedience and Submiſſion in all juſt Caſes: that if we are at any time falſly Accuſed, we may be able with Truth &amp; Aſſurance to make
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001346_0031_0FB2C7562EA7D518"/>the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Noble Defence, <hi>Act.</hi> xxv. 8. <hi>Neither againſt the Law, nor the Temple, nor yet againſt</hi> CESAR <hi>have I offended any thing at all.</hi> Finally, let us be <hi>Juſt to do our Rulers Honour</hi> wherein they do well; owning it with Pleaſure, and bleſſing God for it; influencing our reſpective <hi>Charges</hi> to do ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. We have no Liberty to grieve or diſreſt them, if They are bound to ſpeak comfortable to <hi>as.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us be comforted in the Countenance of our Rulers.</hi> This is a Duty alſo which we owe unto GOD and <hi>Them.</hi> Let us take the Comfort which God gives us; <hi>This alſo is the Gift of God.</hi> We have our <hi>precious Opportunities</hi> of Service: We enjoy great <hi>Quietneſs;</hi> and may be <hi>as Good</hi> and <hi>do</hi> as much good as we will, and have <hi>Praiſe</hi> of the <hi>Powers that are:</hi> This ſhou'd make us the <hi>Eaſier</hi> under our Difficulties, and the more <hi>Chearful</hi> in our Work. So were the <hi>Levites</hi> whom <hi>Hezekiah</hi> comforted, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>The Prieſts,—the Levites,—and all the Congregation—rejoyced. So there was great Joy in Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If it is the Duty of the Civil Ruler to ſpeak comfortably to the <hi>Miniſtry of Chriſt,</hi> Then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>it is the Duty of Miniſters to comfort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> You muſt needs confeſs this <hi>Inference</hi> to be very <hi>Juſt and Natural,</hi> and alas! it is no leſs <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</hi> We do not comfort and aſſiſt one another thro' this <hi>Land</hi> as we ought: Some thro' <hi>Negligence,</hi> ſome thro' <hi>Diſaffection, prejudices,</hi> and <hi>divers Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts.</hi> Our <hi>Independency</hi> in this ſenſe, is our <hi>Woe</hi> already, and will be our <hi>Ruine</hi> if it be not remedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, We ſhou'd <hi>Uni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

We ſhou'd <hi>Viſit</hi> one another oft'ner, and be more <hi>Open</hi> and very <hi>ſafe</hi> in Communicating our Tho'ts to one another. We ſhou'd tenderly <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize</hi> with one another under Difficulties, and be ready to <hi>Succour</hi> under Wrongs. We ſhou'd freely <hi>Adviſe</hi> and <hi>Hearten</hi> one another when Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved, and above all men <hi>Bear</hi> with and <hi>Forgive</hi> one another, and he that is <hi>Chief</hi> ſhou'd be <hi>Servant</hi> of all. We ſhou'd rejoyce in one anothers <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces, Credit</hi> and <hi>Eſteem, Uſe</hi> and <hi>Serviceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> and whether we think the ſame thing in Smaller points of <hi>Church Order,</hi> yet ought we to appear <hi>One</hi> in <hi>Faith,</hi> in <hi>Charity,</hi> &amp; <hi>Zeal</hi> for practical Holineſs. Finally, we ſhou'd beware of the Evil Spirit of <hi>Credulity</hi> againſt <hi>Elders,</hi> lightly taking up Accuſations againſt <hi>them;</hi> but let our Religious Zeal be under the Reſtraints of the Law of Charity.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I will <hi>Conclude,</hi> with a brief <hi>Exhortation to the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To Imitate their Good Rulers,</hi> wherein They are Exemplary in their Regards to the <hi>Miniſtry of Chriſt. Inferiour People</hi> muſt needs hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged in their Places to be <hi>Comforts</hi> to their <hi>Miniſters,</hi> ſince the <hi>Higheſt Orders</hi> of Men are bound to be ſo. Wherefore People ought conſcientiouſly to <hi>Love their Miniſters,</hi> to <hi>Pray</hi> for 'em, to aſſiſt and <hi>Support</hi> 'em. They ſhou'd be very Careful not to <hi>grieve</hi> 'em, <hi>contemn</hi> or <hi>wrong</hi> 'em, in <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Deed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Obey the juſt and wiſe Laws made for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Miniſtry.</hi> As for <hi>Inſtance,</hi> Do but be <hi>Juſt</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:001346_0033_0FB2C7591F26BB40"/>to your <hi>Agreements</hi> with your <hi>Miniſters.</hi> If we cou'd but obtain this in many Places of the <hi>Land,</hi> it were a Great Point. Yet ſhou'd <hi>Chriſtians</hi> bluſh to need this <hi>Exhortation.</hi> Read how the <hi>People of Judah</hi> obey'd the Command of the <hi>King</hi> in giving the <hi>Levites</hi> chearfully their <hi>Portion:</hi> xxxi. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>verſes. As ſoon as the Commandment came abroad, the Children of Iſrael bro't in Abundance the Firſt-fruits of Corn, Wine and Oyl, and Honey, and of all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Field, and the Tithe of all things bro't they in Abundantly: — the Tithe of Holy things, which were Conſecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Let People learn from our <hi>Doctrine,</hi> to know <hi>their own Happineſs</hi> when they have <hi>Rulers</hi> that ſet Themſelves to Encourage the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> and Service of God. None but a <hi>Sanballat</hi> or <hi>Tobiah</hi> can be grieved at it, to ſee the <hi>Civil Ruler</hi> ſeeking the <hi>Welfare of Iſrael.</hi> It ſhou'd raiſe our Value, Eſteem and Love, and put us on doubling our Prayers for, and our Endeavours to comfort Such <hi>Rulers.</hi> The <hi>Good Job</hi> was ſuch a <hi>Ruler; He choſe out their Way, and ſat Chief, and dwelt as a King in the Army; as one that Comforteth the Mourners:</hi> and he tells us how it endear'd him to his People: <hi>Job</hi> xxix. 23, 24. <hi>They waited for me as for the Rain, and they op'ned their Mouth wide as for the latter Rain: If I laughed on them they believ'd it not, and the light of my Countenance they caſt not down.</hi> They were <hi>refreſh'd</hi> by ſuch a Rulers Preſence and Countenance, Wiſdom and Care, even as the <hi>Thirſty Earth</hi> is by the Showers of <hi>Rain:</hi> They priz'd his <hi>Favour,</hi> and were Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous <hi>not to loſe the light of his Countenance</hi> ſhining
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001346_0034_0FB2C75E27A78CE0"/>upon them: They <hi>Preſum'd not</hi> upon his <hi>Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcentions</hi> to diminiſh his Authority, and to <hi>blow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> the <hi>Light</hi> that cheriſh'd 'em: They were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to <hi>Grieve</hi> him, to make his <hi>Countenance to fall,</hi> or to make him <hi>Change</hi> his Looks and Carriage toward 'em: <hi>The Light of my Countenance they caſt not down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavour'd to go thro' our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective <hi>Duties</hi> from the <hi>Text,</hi> and now will diſmiſs the <hi>ASSEMPLY</hi> as the <hi>Levites</hi> did the <hi>Great Congregation of Iſrael and Judah,</hi> in the <hi>laſt Verſe</hi> of the <hi>Chapter. Then the Prieſts the Levites aroſe, and bleſſed the People: and their Voice was heard, and their Prayer came up to His Holy Dwelling-place, even unto Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even ſo <hi>Comfort</hi> the Hearts of your faithful <hi>Paſtors,</hi> and you will inherit their <hi>louder and more fervent Bleſſing:</hi> Their <hi>Invigorated Prayers</hi> for You and your Poſterity will come up to the <hi>Holy dwelling-place</hi> of GOD, even unto <hi>Heaven,</hi> obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Effuſion</hi> of every <hi>Sort,</hi> and every <hi>Meaſure,</hi> of <hi>Spiritual Bleſſing,</hi> from on <hi>High.</hi>
