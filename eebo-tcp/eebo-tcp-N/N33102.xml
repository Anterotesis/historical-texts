            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PROV. 13th. 34th.</bibl>
               <q>RIGHTEOUSNESS EXALTETH A NATION.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THERE is no principle of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is, in a general way, more powerful than a principle of honor. When a man apprehends his honor at ſtake, he will readily riſque every thing that is dear to himſelf to defend it; and will even ſacrifice his life in the cauſe. This is, moſt commonly, at the bottom of all the wars, commotions, and bloodſhed, that are at any time in the world. In the ſupport and defence of this, thouſands have bled and are ſtill bleeding. To aſſert and maintain, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and defend the pretended honor and dignity
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:043429_0004_101CED71DECDC9B8"/>of the crown of Great-Britain, they have already expended millions, and have hazarded the lives of thouſands; yea, thouſands and thouſands have already fallen in the field of battle; and they have ſpread deſolation, ruin and diſtreſs amongſt numbers of the innocent inhabitants of America. If we enquire, how it can be poſſible that a nation can be ſo void of natural affection, and can conduct as tho' they were deſtitute of all feelings towards their fellow creatures and their brethren according to the fleſh, beſides thoſe of malice and rancour; we ſhall find that it is a principle of honor that continually impels then, that it is a principle of honor that overpowers every other affection of the mind, and hurries them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> such acts of outrage, cruelty and vengeance. Surely we might be ready to think that if a principle of honor will produce ſuch bitter fruits as theſe,—it is will overpower the principles of compaſſion and benevolence in mankind towards their fellow creatures, and event thoſe of their own kindred; that if a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of honor will operate in this manner, it is an evil and pernicious principle.</p>
            <p>BUT mankind are moſt evidently actuated by a falſe principle of honor, in purſuing ſuch a line of conduct. What they aim at as their honor, is indeed their greateſt reprouch, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates in their burning ſhame. A principle of true honor is a moſt excellent principle—
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:043429_0005_101CED75B7034850"/>It is truly laudable and well pleaſing in the ſight of God. When a perſon or a people are ambitious of that wherein their true honor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, they are then engaged in a moſt laudable and excellent purſuit. So it is pointed out by the obſervation of the wiſe man in our text, <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a nation.</hi> He meant, moſt ſurely, to mention this as a powerful motive to exite a people to follow after righteouſneſs. It is as tho' he had ſaid, What nation or people are ambitious of true honor? let them ſeek after righteouſneſs, and this will be a dignity and an honor unto them.</p>
            <p>AND now to trace the deſign of theſe words, and to improve them in a manner ſuitable to the occaſion before us, I would here endeavor by the divine aſſiſtance,</p>
            <p n="1">I. To ſhew what the wiſe man means by that righteouſneſs which exalteth a nation.</p>
            <p n="2">II. POINT out the reaſons why this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs will exalt a nation.</p>
            <p n="3">III. CONCLUDE with thoſe addreſſes that will naturally ariſe out of my ſubject.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I AM to ſhew what the wiſe man means by that righteouſneſs which exalteth a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:043429_0006_101CED7DE8E8BF70"/>WHEN the wiſe man ſpeaks of righteouſneſs exalting a nation, he has a moſt evident refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the general character of that people of which the nation conſiſts. That righteouſneſs may exalt a nation, the generality of the people of which the nation conſiſts muſt be viſibly poſſeſſed of it; ſo that it may be ſaid of ſuch a nation, that it is a righteous nation, a nation that loveth righteouſneſs and ſeeketh after it. This is of abſolute neceſſary, in order that righteouſneſs may exalt a nation. Righteouſneſs muſt form their general character. It will be of no avail to any ſuch a purpoſe for many individuals among a nation or people to purſue after righteouſneſs, whilſt the nation in general, and the people at large do viſibly give a looſe to ſin, and iniquity reigns triumphant amongſt them. In ſuch a caſe, altho' as to individuals there may be <hi>ſeven thouſand</hi> amongſt that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that <hi>have not bowed the know to the image of Baal,</hi> yet as a people they are deſtitute of that righteouſneſs which exalteth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> and are <hi>a ſinful people, a people ladem with iniquity.</hi> And now that righteouſneſ which exalteth a nation, taken in this view of it, implies</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT the people, as ſuch, do pay a ſacred regard to the worſhip and ordinances of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:043429_0007_101CED7F6C1C5FA8"/>THIS is one eſſential token and teſt of a people's being God's viſible people. It is ſuch an eſſential teſt and token of it, that without it a people cannot be ſaid to be God's viſible people. When it once comes to this among a people that they openly forſake the worſhip and ordinances of God, they do then openly caſt off the badge of their being his viſible people; they openly renouce their viſible relation to him as their God, and declare, as in open language that they <hi>will not have him to reign over them.</hi> When God inſtituted his woſhip to be obſerved by his people, he inſtituted it as a ſign and token that his people were viſibly his, that he was their king and lord, and that they were his ſubjects and ſervants. So it is expreſſed in Exod. 31.16, 17. <hi>Wherefore the children of Iſrael ſhall keep the ſabbath, to obſerve the ſabbath thro' out their generation for a perpetual covenant. It is a ſign between me and the children of Iſrael forever.</hi> This was the deſign of the inſtitution of the ſabbath. It was to be a ſign between God and his people; a token and pledge that they were his viſible people; that he was their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme King and Lord, and that no other lords beſides him had the dominion over them. And now if this is what is enjoined upon a people by the ordinance and appointment of God as an eſſential taken and pledge of their being his viſible people; then ſurely it is eſſential that a people do ſacredly obſerve the worſhip and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:043429_0008_101CED813B364F58"/>ordinances of God, in order that they may be viſibly poſſeſſed of that righteousſneſs which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth a nation.</p>
            <p>IT is evident from the very light of nature, that the worſhip of God is a duty of ſacred importance. Hence the Apoſtle obſerves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the very heathens, that <hi>becauſe they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, and neither would worſhip and glorify him as God; but turned the glory of the incorruptable God into an image made like unto corruptable man, and ſerved the creature more than the Creator, who is God over all bleſſed forever</hi>;—that <hi>for this cauſe God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do thoſe things which are not convenient.</hi> Which evidently implies that the very light of nature laid the heathens under ſacred obligations, to obſerve the worſhip of God. They were viſited with the moſt awful judgments, becauſe they did not worſhip and glorify God as God. But ſurely they were never puniſhed by a righteous God for violating thoſe obligations they were not under. Foraſmuch then as they were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in ſuch an awful manner as to be given up of God to a reprobate mind, becauſe they did not worſhip and glorify him as God, it is a full demonſtration that they were under moſt ſacred obligations to obſerve the worſhip of God, and to glorify him as God. And now ſurely if thoſe that had no other than the light of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:043429_0009_101CED848F5811F0"/>nature were under ſuch ſacred and inviolable obligations to worſhip and glorify God, as that their wilful neglect of this did provoke God to give them over to a reprobate mind; much more is that people under the moſt ſacred obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to this, to whom God has made known has will by <hi>ſhewing them his judgements, and giving them his ſtatutes.</hi> God has enjoined upon his people in his word, by all that is ſolemn and ſacred, as a duty of the higheſt importance, <hi>that they ſhould have no other God before him.</hi> This is the firſt law of his kingdom. And this command does, by clear implication, carry in it, a moſt ſacred injunction to obſerve the worſhip of God, and to pay our homage unto him according to his inſtitution and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When the will of God is ſo clearly made known unto us in reference to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that people do ſurely bring the moſt awful guilt upon themſelves who neglect the worſhip of God, and who do openly refuſe to glorify him as God. The worſhip of God is an open practical acknowledgement that he is our only ſupreme lord and King; and of conſequence for a people to refuſe to worſhip and glorify him as their only ſupreme lord and king, is an open renunciation of their allegiance unto him; it is an open declaration that they will not be in ſubjection to him, and <hi>will not have him to reign over them.</hi> Under this view of the matter, we need not wonder that God ſhould declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:043429_0010_101CED8629083620"/>ſo awfully diſpleaſed with his people of old, whenever they forſook his ordinances, and turned their backs upon his worſhip. This is ever mentioned by God as an iniquity of the deepeſt dye; and for this he ever manifeſted his and anger againſt his people in a ſeries of the moſt awful judgments. And hence, whenever a pious king came upon the throne of Iſrael, and ſet himſelf to bring on a reformation among the people, his firſt care was always exerciſed in rectifying the abuſes of God's worſhip. Never was there a reformation bro't about amongſt that people where this one thing was neglected. 'And in proportion as a reformation ever takes place among any people in any age of the world; and to the ſame degree as true religion does viſibly prevail among them, it will be ſeen in that people's paying a ſacred regard to the worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>WE are under the ſame obligations to the worſhip of God as the children of Iſrael were. For the grand reaſon why they were under ſuch obligations was becauſe <hi>God was their God and redeemer.</hi> And if he is <hi>our God and redeemer,</hi> we are under the ſame obligations to worſhip and glorify him as God; and our forſaking his worſhip will be equally odious in his ſight. If we do, in this manner, diſown and renounce our viſible relation to God; he will diſown and renounce his viſible relation to us as his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:043429_0011_101CED8F2440EA10"/>and as he has done to his people of old, to the ſeven churches of Aſia, and to all that eaſtern world where chriſtianity once flouriſhed in its glory; ſo will he do unto us, by viſiting us with one judgment upon the back of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, until he has caſt us off from being his people.</p>
            <p>I proceed to add,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT that righteousſneſs which exalteth a nation implies that a people do ſet themſelves to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance and bear down all fraud and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.—Every degree of fraud and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion among men is an abomination unto the Lord; becauſe it is a moſt flagrant violation of thoſe obligations mankind are ever under to each other. Mankind are under the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred obligations to conduct towards one another under the influence of a temper of univerſal love and benevolence, by <hi>doing to others as they would that others ſhould do unto them. This is the law and the prophets.</hi> It is what the law en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins, and the prophets have conſtantly taught. And there is no way in which mankind can be guilty of more flagrant and daring violations of this command and injunction than by acts of fraud and oppreſſion. And hence, when fraud and oppreſſion become general among a people, It is moſt evident that that people are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of that righteouſneſs which exalteth a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:043429_0012_101CED90B982DAC8"/>The character that evidently belongs to ſuch a people, is that of <hi>a ſinful people, a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple laden with iniquity.</hi> And hence, if a people would be characteriſed a righteous people; it is of abſolute neceſſity that they ſet themſelves to diſcountenance and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ar down all fraud and oppreſſion among them.</p>
            <p>Now this implies,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT ſuch a people are always regulated and governed by a ſyſtem of laws that are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>IT implies that the legiſlative rulers among them are themſelves careful to frame ſuch a ſyſtem of laws as are in their nature calculated to diſcountenance and prevent all unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, fraud and oppreſſion among a people. For this purpoſe it is always a matter of the moſt ſacred importance that the rulers of a people be <hi>juſt men, that fear God and hate co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs.</hi> For if they that rule a people be men that love the pleaſures of ſin or the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of unrighteouſneſs, it will be in vain to expect that they will make it their aim to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh a ſyſtem of laws to diſcountenance ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and bear down vice and oppreſſion. The ſtate of that people will immediately repreſent that ſpoken of by the wiſe man, Eccl. 3.16. <hi>Moreover I ſaw under the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And if they frame a ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of laws that have any aſpect upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting virtue and religion, and bearing down vice and immorality, they will be careful to frame them in ſuch a manner that the force of them may be eaſily evaded, that they may not be as ſhackles upon their own fuel to hamper them in their purſuit after the objects of their luſts. And hence if righteouſneſs ever reigns among a nation do as to form the general cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a people; we may be ſure that ſuch a people are always under the government and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:043429_0014_101CED97B24E4008"/>
regulation of a ſyſtem of laws that are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in righteouſneſs; that the rulers of ſuch a people are <hi>men that fear God and hate covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And moreover,</p>
            <p n="2">2. It implies that every one is faithful in his proper ſtation and capacity, to put ſuch laws into execution.</p>
            <p>OF what avail can it be at any time for the rulers of a people to frame the moſt whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome laws for the health of a ſtare, and to bear down all unrighteousſneſs and oppreſſion, if at the ſame time, theſe laws are not put into execution? To frame a ſyſtem of laws for this purpoſe, and not put them into execution, is the moſt direct way to bring a people to a ſtate of anarchy and confuſion. For when ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers have in this manner, taught a people to caſt contempt upon a certain ſet of laws, they will ſoon learn to caſt contempt upon all laws and government. Some times it is notoriouſly the caſe that rulers will live in the open vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of thoſe laws which they themſelves have framed to bear down all open iniquity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs. They themſelves lead the way in caſting contempt upon law and government; and no wonder that in ſuch a caſe the people ſoon learn to pattern after the example of their
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:043429_0015_101CED9936BBC3B8"/>
leaders, and trample under foot all law and authority amongſt them. It is in reference to ſuch conduct of rulers as this that the wiſe man ſays, <hi>Woe unto thee, O land, when they king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning.</hi> That is, when thy rulers are given to gluttony, and a round of carnal pleaſures. For when this is their aim, and what they are reſolved upon, the reigns of government will be let looſe, and will be thrown upon the necks of a people, and a ſtate of anarchy, diſorder and confuſion will ſoon take place, and every one will learn <hi>to do what is right in his own eyes.</hi>—Some times it is owing to a ſtate of inveterate and abandoned wickedneſs amongſt a people that the moſt wholeſome laws cannot be put into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, notwithſtanding the rulers of a people may be over ſo faithful. If a people are generally agreed, at all hazards, to have open wickedneſs reign triumphant amongſt them, it will be to no purpoſe to have the moſt righteous ſyſtem of laws eſtabliſhed amongſt them. Let the laws be ever ſo well conſtructed to bear down all open wickedneſs, yet in vain may the rulers endeavour to put them into execution againſt ſuch univerſal oppoſition. When this becomes the ſtate of a people, and they are thus abon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned in wickedneſs, <hi>their diſeaſe is inveterate, and their wound is incurable.</hi> Anarchy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion will reign among them till they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to utter deſtruction. That righteouſneſs
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:043429_0016_101CED9B00AC8BE0"/>
therefore / may reign among a people, it is of abſolute neceſſity, not only that a ſyſtem of laws be eſtabliſhed among them that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to bear down all open wickedneſs; but alſo that every one is faithful, in his proper ſtation and capacity, to put ſuch laws into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, <hi>to the terror of evil doors, and to the praiſe of thoſe that do well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ADD once more,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THAT the righteouſneſs ſpoken of in the text implies that a people do ſet themſelves to diſcountenance all open wickedneſs in the tenor of their conduct.</p>
            <p>If <hi>ſin is a reproach to any people,</hi> then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that people among whom righteouſneſs reigns, will account a reproach, and endeavor to diſcountenance it in the tenor of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. They will treat thoſe as ſcandalous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who live in the open practice of any kind of wickedneſs. They will avoid their company, and withdraw from their ſociety and fellowſhip. So they treat a notorious thief. The genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a people do ever hold him as a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous perſon, and are aſhamed to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with him. And if righteouſneſs did reign triumphant amongſt a people, they would be as much aſhamed to countenance or keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with vain ſwearers, with ſabbath-breakers.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:043429_0017_101CEDA1AB6BC4B8"/>
with defamers and backbiters, with ſuch is made it their practice to over-reach and defraud, to grind and oppreſs their fellow creatures in their dealings with them; I ſay, they would be as much aſhamed to countenance or keep company with any of ſuch a character, as they would with an open and notorious thief. For theſe iniquities are, in their nature, as really ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as theft. They are as truly an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſight of God, and as diametrically contrary to that righteouſneſs which exalteth a nation. When therefore a perſon can live in the open practice of any of theſe iniquities, and yet not become a ſcandalous perſon among the people where he dwells; when he can live in the open practice of theſe iniquities, and yet preſerve his reputation, and his company is not avoided; can it be imagined that ſuch a people do look upon thſe iniquities as being any wiſe ſcandalous? Nay verily. Inſtead of purſuing after that righteouſneſs which exalteth a nation, they are haſtening to that ſtate of abandoned wickedneſs deſcribed by the Prophet in that ſolemn interrogation, <hi>Were they aſhamed when they had committed abomination? Nay, they were not at all aſhamed, neither could they bluſh</hi>!—Enough has been ſaid to lay open to view what is implied in that righteouſneſs which exalteth a nation.</p>
            <p>I COME now,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:043429_0018_101CEDA5A3412198"/>
II. TO point out the reaſons why this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs will exalt a nation.</p>
            <p>AND in illuſtrating this head, I would here ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT this righteouſneſs is that wherein the real dignity and honor of a people conſiſts.</p>
            <p>SOME are ready to eſteem a nation or people honorable in proportion as they are wealthy and powerful. But this of itſelf is ſo far from ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering a people honorable, that on the contrary, if they make uſe of their power and wealth in an unrighteous manner, their being poſſeſſed of wealth and power does but ſerve to render them the objects of the moſt ſolemn contempt and abhorrence. Let a nation be poſſeſſed of ever ſo much wealth and power, and let them make uſe of theſe to ſpread devaſtation and ruin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt mankind, and to reduce their brethren to a ſtate of ſlavery to their lawleſs tyranny and dominion; in ſuch a caſe as this, will any one be wild enough to imagine that ſuch a nation or people are poſſeſſed of true honor, meerly becauſe they are wealthy and powerful? Nay verily.—True honor and real dignity is ever founded in that righteouſneſs which conſiſts in a conformity to the laws and commands of the great Lord of all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:043429_0019_101CEDACABA35B30"/>WHEN a people do evidently appear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verencce the rights of conſcience,—to pay a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred regard to the worſhip of God,—to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by a pious zeal in bearing down all fraud and oppreſſion, and diſcountenancing all vice and immorality of every kind; when it is thus with a people, there is nothing that can be a greater honor and dignity to them. The moſt unbounded wealth and power is as nothing when compared with this, to render a people honorable. Each one will account it his honor and dignity to be in due ſubjection to the higher powers, and with alacrity of mind will be careful to <hi>render unto all their dues; tribute to whom tribute; cuſtom to whom cuſtom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.</hi> The wheels of government will perpetually move on in the utmoſt harmony, and without any jar or diſcord. And of ſuch a people it may be juſtly ſaid, in relation to their civil ſtate, <hi>How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy dwellings, O Iſrael!</hi>—This righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs then is that wherein the real dignity and honor of a people conſiſts.—But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS righteouſneſs exalteth a nation, as it brings a ſeries of the ſmiles and bleſſings of heaven upon them.</p>
            <p>GOD always deals with his viſible people according to their viſible conduct. Never was it known, from the beginning of the world,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:043429_0020_101CEDAE48997250"/>either under the law, or under the goſpel, that God ſuffered his viſible people to be ruined, until they had openly departed from him, and had turned aſide from the way of his ſtatutes. No inſtance can be produced where God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the enemies of his people to triumph over them whilſt they continued to put their truſt in his name, and to walk in his ways. When our forefathers firſt came over into New-England, they had ſuch difficulties to encounter, and ſuch formidable dangers were impending over them on every ſide, that it might ſeem at firſt view that nothing but perfect phrenzy and madneſs could induce them to believe it poſſible for them to ſurmount the difficulties and eſcape the dangers that lay in their way. But they found that <hi>the name of the Lord</hi> was <hi>a ſtrong tower, that the righteous run into it and</hi> were ſafe. Righteouſneſs was their glory; it was a <hi>crown and a diadem upon their head.</hi> They made God their refuge, and <hi>his own right hand, and his holy arm</hi> was their ſafeguard and their defence in all ſcenes of danger, and under every trial. Had they caſt off the fear of God, and openly departed from him, we may with confidence, affirm that they would ſoon have become a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach among the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p n="3">3. RIGHTEOUSNESS exalteth a nation, as it is the only thing that can be a firm bond of union among them, and will inſpire univerſal confidence in them.</p>
            <p>WHEN a nation or a people as ſuch are evidently void of principle, and abandoned in wickedneſs, there can be no confidence had in the publick faith. Their luſt of power, their unbounded avarice will readily induce them, upon almoſt every occaſion to violate the moſt ſolemn compacts and covenants, in the moſt fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant and daring manner. But if a people are united together upon the principles of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, this bond of union is like the <hi>threefold cord that is not eaſily broken.</hi> It is a bond of union that will render a people faithful to each
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:043429_0022_101CAD88637D8E58"/>
other in all ſcenes of danger, and under eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trial. And when they are viſibly actuated by ſuch principles as theſe in the tenor of their conduct, the utmoſt confidence will ever be had in the public faith; and every nation will be ready to ſay of ſuch a people, <hi>Surely they are children that will not lie.</hi> And under this view ſuch a people will ever be moſt honorable in the eſteem of all to whom their character is known, and to their enemies they will be <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible as an army with banners.</hi>—Upon theſe accounts then it moſt evidently appears that righteouſneſs exalteth a nation, and is like a <hi>crown of diadem and glory to</hi> any people. The time being far ſpent requires that I haſten to the last thing propoſed from the text which is,</p>
            <p n="3">III. To conclude with thoſe addreſſes that naturally ariſe out of my ſubject, and are ſuitable to the occaſion before us.</p>

Had I departed from the line of my duty, and acted ſo much out of the character of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of Chriſt, as to have conſumed the proceeding hour in treating the rulers of this people with an empty round of fulſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements; I had juſtly rendered myſelf an object of your compaſſion and reſentment. I would ever regard it as a duty of ſacred importance in relation to myſelf, and urge it upon others, as occaſion may offer, to render that honor to the higher powers which God in his word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. It is eſſential to the health and well being of a ſtate, that ſuch be had in honor and reverence by the people whom they govern. And I would to God that this honor and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to the rulers of this people, may ever be founded on that ſacred regard to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and true piety that ſhall be viſible and evident in the conſtant tenor of their conduct. This will command that reſpect and reverence, that honor and eſteem, which is real and ſolid; and which will have an extenſive influence in forming the manners, and regulation the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a people. You will conſider yourſelves as the leaders of this people; that your example in your public department will ever carry much weight and energy in it; that it will have an almoſt irreſiſtable power to leaven the manners
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:043429_0024_101CEDBE0E8AB3B8"/>
and form the character of this people. A peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will follow the example of their leaders; and under this view a ſett of vicious rulers are in a great degree, accountable for that flood of wickedneſs that does at any time overſpread a country. <hi>We unto thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning.</hi> You will then conſider yourſelves as being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to God, and to this people another day, for the execution of the important truſt committed unto you; and with a view to this, will gird up the lions of your mind to execute juſtice and judgment; to bear down all vice and immorality; to promote the intereſt of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the proſperity of Chriſt's kingdom among the people whom you govern. This will lay the moſt effectual foundation for your ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this people with comfort and in peace, till you and they are gathered together into that kingdom of righteouſneſs above, where each one ſhall reign in life by Jeſus Chriſt!</p>

            <p>WHAT has now been delivered is what you have a moſt particular and intimate concern in. If righteouſneſs exalteth a nation; if it be that

But I may, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, affirm, that never was civil authority more honored and revered, than when they have had the intereſt of religion at heart, and made it their aim to promote it in their public de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment; and that never was it rendered more contemptable than when they ſuffered vice and immorality to reign triumphant. Thus it has been in every age, and thus it will ever be.—<hi>Thoſe that honor God, be will honor; and they that deſpiſe him ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi>—We have now an opportunity to be the happieſt people on the continent.
