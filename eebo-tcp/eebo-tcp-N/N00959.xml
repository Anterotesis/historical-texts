            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Mr. Pitt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have not only seen your Book against Mr. <hi>Wright</hi> and considered the Weakness of it, (to say no worse) but have been told by some Quakers, that when I was left at <hi>Norwich,</hi> you sought me with design to dispute me in defence of Quakerism, and it so (which I much question) this is to let you know, that I am now at the <hi>George Inn</hi> in <hi>Norwich<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And also, that on Condition the Quakers will depute you under the hands of Six or more of them, promising to assent to, and stand by your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Principles laid down in their Books, as their Act and Deed. That I will then give you a Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. In order to which, let us meet this Evening, or on <hi>Monday</hi> night next, to appoint time and place, and adjust Preliminaries. The Charge I offer to prove upon them out of their Books wrote by <hi>Fox, Whitehead, Penn, B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rrough, Smith,</hi> &amp;c. their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Authors, that consist of these six particulars fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, which if <hi>I</hi> make full proof of, I hope you will grant that their Doctrine tends to subvert Christianity, viz.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>By their contempt of Holy Scriptures, calling them Dust, Death, Serpents Meat, Beastly Ware, an Idol</hi> &amp;c. saying, <hi>it is the highest Blasphemy to call them the Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That they deny the ever Blessed Trinity, in a Blasphem<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us as manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That they deny Jesus to be Christ, the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>That they neglect, contemn and deny the Sacred Ordinances of the Gospel, namely, Baptism with Water, and the Supper with Bread and Wine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, That they undervalue the Death and Sufferings of our Saviour, by affirming their own Sufferings to be not only greater, but more unjust, than the Sufferings of Christ, his <hi>Holy Apostles and Blessed Martyrs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>That they not only undervalue, utility and contemn the Holy Scriptures, as abovesaid, but they over-value their own Sayings and Writings, as not only to be the Word of God, but also of greater Authority than the Bible, which they say can in no sence be called the Word of God, which so to do</hi> (say they) <hi>is the highest Blasphemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Charge <hi>I</hi> propose to prove, and if you get a Deputation, as abovesaid, let us meet and settle Terms for a Conference; but if they think you not <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I Received yours of the 19th Instant, and perceive you are but a Novice in the Principle of Quakerism except in that of Scurrility, which perhaps your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest Leads you to; you tell us, that what you have affected in their Vindication, is from the words of their approved Authors which is littel to the purpose; for if that were sufficient, you may fi<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ford Conference, &amp;c. p.</hi> 119 to 156 where there is nigh forty instances of the like Nature, all which may serve for a caution <hi>to take heed what we hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>From Reason and Experience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Our Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have all the reason in the World, to believe that our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is true, and founded upon the Divine Authority of the <hi>H. Scriptures,</hi> of which 'tis needless for me to enlarge, since we have so many Excellent Books, wrote by our Divines, Answering all Objections; As well as by Law established; yet the Quakers tell us in <hi>Burrough's Epistle to Fox's Great Mystery.</hi> That they deny our whole Religion, And that our <hi>Service-book,</hi> bottomed on the Divine Authority of the Sacred Word of God, and established by Act of Parliament, is Idolatrous, because we prey saying <hi>O Son of David have mercy upon us.</hi> Nay, they will not joyn with us in any one <hi>Act of Devotion;</hi> for let a Quaker and a Christian happen to Dine together, and if the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, as in Duty bound, shall but say, <hi>Good Lord, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all our sins, and Sanctify these thy good Creatures to our use, and us to thy self and service, and all for Jesus Christ's sake:</hi> The Quaker will sit with his hat on in Testimony against this Known and Common Duty: and the Reason is Twofold, 1st, in that <hi>we beg for pardon of our sins;</hi> 2ly, and <hi>that for Jesus Christ's sake;</hi> for they say, we therein acknowledge our selves Sinners, which they cannot do; 3ly, We pray and petition, and give Thanks, in the Name, and for the sake of a Dead God, as in their Prophet <hi>Burrough's</hi> Books, <hi>p.</hi> 101. 518. Why then shall we hear these Infidels?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They tell us all that Preach Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and bid people believe in him as he is in Heaven above, are false Ministers, Witches Deviles, Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, Blood-hounds, Anti Christs, &amp;c. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon will not for a World come and hear one of them; Why then should we countenance their Heresy, so far as to go and hear them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They not only Testify with Hearts full of Indignation against our Ministers, for thus Preaching, But they Testify against, Villify and contemn the written Word of God, as Death, Dust, Serpents Meat, Beastly ware, as Idol, &amp;c. saying, it is the Highest Blasphemy to call them the Word of God; Why then should we go to hear such implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Christian Religion, taught us by us our Blessed Saviour, his Holy Prophets and Apostles, and practis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all Christian Churches; and now, thanks be to God, Established by Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And since the Quaker-Prophets have plainly declared in Print, their Aversion to give Liberty of Conscience to the Episcopal Church; as in the Works of <hi>R. Hubers<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>, p</hi> 228. <hi>Edw Burrough's Works p.</hi> 635. Why should we so far Countenance them as to hear their vain Bablings?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Nay, They Account us such abominable Idolaters, Heathens, and what not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because we call the Scriptures the Word of God, the Sacraments of Baptism and Lord's Supper, the Institutions of Christ, that they first Separate from us, will not joyn in any act of Devotion with us; nay, they will neither Marry nor Bury with us; And for this they give us the same Arguments <hi>St. Paul</hi> gave to the Believing Gentiles at <hi>Corinth, 2 Cor. 6. 17.</hi> See their Book, <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ites of Retirement,</hi> &amp;c Preface, to which I have reply'd in my Sheet. <hi>The Quaker's Charm Discovered,</hi> &amp;c. Why then shall we hear such as compare us to the Gentile Idolaters, whom 6. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmed Sacrificed to Devils, and not to God; and their Cup and Table was the Cup and Table of Devils; and he would not that the believing Gentiles should have Fellowship with the Cup of Devils and Table of Devils: And how frequent it is with the Quakers to charge our Communion Table to be the Table of Devils, and the Cup we receive the Wine in the Cup of Devils; how then can we, if we have but a spark of Zeal for our Holy Religion which our which our Martyr'd Ancestors suffer'd in the Flames for) go and hear such Blasphemous Wretches?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> And for the like Reasons they account our Christian Kings, Parliament, Judges, Justices, &amp;c. Apostates, Spiritual Egyptians, &amp;c. And if they command a Fast to be kept, they'll take no notice of it; make an Act of Association, they'll not Subscribe it, an Act of Abjuration they'll not join with us in it, nor hear Arms for the Defence of our Religion, Laws and Liberties, No! their Consciences will not suffer them; while their pretence to Conscience is every day more and more discover'd to be made only their Stalking Horse, for all their holy Cheats, their Irreligion, and down-right Blasphemy; why then should we hear such seditious Ringleaders?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> I cannot enlarge, but let them appear, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suant to my Challenge and all these things, and more <hi>I</hi> offer to prove upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you, and much more, which I reserve to the next.</p>
