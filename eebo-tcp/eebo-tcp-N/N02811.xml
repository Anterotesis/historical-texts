         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Title of this Pſalm informs us who was the inſpired Penman, <hi>King David:</hi> In it he encourageth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the LORD under his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme dangers from his Enemies, and eſpecially from <hi>Saul. v.</hi> 1. <hi>The Lord is my light,</hi> the author of my joy, <hi>and my ſalvation, whom ſhall I fear</hi> —: And alſo offers to GOD his earneſt requeſts for help and ſuccour, as in the verſe before my Text. <hi>Hide not thy face far from me — leave me not</hi> —.

            <p n="2">2. We have <hi>his relief under this ſorrow,</hi> Then the <hi>LORD will take me up:</hi> Receive, or gather me. Now we don't read that <hi>David</hi>'s Parents did ever deſert him, tho' we find them ſo unable to help him, and ſo unfit to attend his Marches, that <hi>David</hi> deſires of the King of <hi>Moab,</hi> that they might be with him till he ſhould know what GOD would do for him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.3. Accordingly, ſome Expoſitors take the words as ſignifying all humane helps under the Name of Parents, <q>by which we may underſtand all Councils and Helps for ſafety.</q> Or, as others ſuppoſe, <hi>His Parents had depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this life;</hi> in which ſenſe I wou'd now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the words. However it was, <hi>David</hi> was now like an <hi>Orphan,</hi> in an helpleſs condition as to humane views and means, and accordingly he by faith realizeth GOD's Parental care and love, who, as He is ever able to help His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo hath the bowels of a Father yerning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them under their diſtreſſes; yea, more than the compaſſions of the tender Mother. <hi>Then the LORD,</hi> the Name given to GOD here is <hi>JEHOVAH,</hi> which ſignifies GOD's Eternal Self-exiſtence, and His giving Being to all Creatures. The fathers of our fleſh are Mortal, and muſt in a little time forſake us, if we are not taken from them firſt; but GOD the Everlaſting Father lives for ever to take care of His People. <hi>Shall take me up,</hi> or ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther me. When Parents are remov'd, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily is ordinarily ſcattered &amp; broken up; but

                  <p>GOD alone can ſay to us and fulfil that His word, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> Our choiceſt friends here are, as we, frail, mortal Creatures. For what is your life? it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vaniſheth away. <hi>Your Fathers where are they?</hi> — Zech. 1.5. They are no more in this World; they are gone to their long home, to the houſe appointed for all living; and the Places which once knew them ſhall know them no more. Accordingly, when the godly depart this life, they are ſaid to be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their People. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> died in a good old Age, and <hi>was gathered to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> Gen. 2<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003351_0006_0FF8176BA142ADD0"/>
bury them out of ſight. And as their bodies reſt in their Graves, ſo their Spirits return to GOD who gave them. When they leave our Society on Earth they go to the heavenly Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, to the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, and to Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant. Here a little to confirm &amp; illuſtrate this Head, I may ſay, 1. All Men are ſubject to the law of Mortality, and muſt be remov'd out of this World by Death. 2. According to the courſe of Nature Parents forſake their Children, and leave them behind in this World, when they depart out of it by Death.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>All Men are ſubject to the law of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and muſt be remov'd out of this World by Death.</hi> There is a Statute of Heaven for it, Heb. 9.27. — <hi>It is appointed unto Men once to die</hi> —. Indeed the LORD of Life hath made, and will make exceptions to this general rule. Thus <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> under the old Teſtament, were tranſlated, that they ſhould not ſee death. (And ſurely it was a great favour of GOD to the departed Spirits of the Saints, ſo early to give them an Example of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious beauty and perfection which their bodies ſhould be advanced to at the Reſurrection <note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Enoch</hi> was tranſlated, A. M. 987. <hi>B. Uſuer.</hi>
                     </note>.) And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> informs us that the People of GOD, who ſhall be found alive at our Saviour's coming to raiſe the dead, <hi>Shall not ſleep,</hi> (i.e. die) <hi>but be changed,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.51, 52. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this is the common lot. Pſal. 89.48. <hi>What man is he that liveth, and ſhall not ſee death?</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="unknown:003351_0007_0FF8176F30E28AA8"/>
No ſooner had Man ſinn'd but Death had power over him, and began to work towards a diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this earthly frame. Gen. 2.17. — <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhall ſurely die.</hi> And it is plain from Scripture that this Threatning Extends to <hi>Adam's</hi> Poſterity: Rom. 5.12. <hi>Wherefore, as by one man ſin entred into the World, and death by ſin; and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned.</hi> Men are various ways diſtinguiſh'd in the World into high and low, rich and poor, young and old, <hi/> but in this reſpect they are all upon a level, equally ſubject to death. And this the Experience of all Ages teacheth. <hi>One Generation paſſeth away, and another cometh;</hi> — Eccl. 1.4. Rom. 5.14. — <hi>Death reigned from Adam to Moſes, even over them that had not ſinn'd after the ſimilitude of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam's tranſgreſſion</hi>—. As <hi>infants</hi> who have not been guilty of Actual tranſgreſſion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in their own perſons, and yet the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the law takes hold of them, an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diable evidence that <hi>Adam's</hi> firſt ſin is imputed to them; and that we all bring a corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into the World with us. It is true, the Children of GOD are deliver'd from the ſting and curſe of death by JESUS CHRIST, who by dying hath conquered this laſt Enemy; ſo that they ſhall all Triumph, and ſay, <hi>O death, where is thy ſling? O grave, where is thy victory?</hi> 1 Cor. 15.55. However, GOD will have them alſo taſte of this bitter cup as a teſtimony of His displeaſure againſt their ſin, and as a means of purging away the remains of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003351_0008_0FF81771F55B5510"/>
it, that they may be preſented without ſpot before Him. They muſt paſs thro' this <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> before they obtain Reſt in the heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> Their Faith in JESUS CHRIST, and other Graces may help them to die well; but will not exempt them from the ſtroke of death: Heb. 11.13. <hi>Theſe all died in faith</hi> —. They muſt this way, thro' the valley of the ſhadow of death, follow the Captain of their Salvation to Glory. They muſt be bro't down to the duſt in order to their being exalted to ſit with Him on Thrones in His Fathers King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Their warfare is not accompliſhed till they have encountred this Enemy, nor can they ſay, It is finiſhed, until, with our Saviour, They give up the Ghoſt. Thus died <hi>Moſes</hi> the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the LORD. Thus <hi>David</hi> after he had ſerved his generation according to the will of GOD, <hi>fell a ſleep, &amp; was laid to his Fathers</hi> —. The matter of Fact which the Jews alledged was true, tho' miſapplied, Joh. 8.52. — <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham is dead, and the Prophets</hi>—. Accordingly, when our Saviour aſſerts, <hi>If any man keep my ſaying, he ſhall never ſee death,</hi> v. 51.

We read that of old, <hi>Haran died before his Father Terah,</hi> i. e. "In his ſight and preſence, he being yet alive, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 28. Thus <hi>Aaron, Job, David,</hi> &amp;c. ſurviv'd to bewail the loſs of Children. And alas! how common is this in our day? Upon this account among others the land of darkneſs may be ſaid to be <hi>without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> Job 10. 22. The young and ſtrong have the precedency oftentimes, and go to the Grave before the aged and infirm. The lamp of life is not ſeldom blown out. Diſeaſes &amp; Accidents, as we call them, tho' all under the government of GOD's Providence, often put a period to lives which might endure much longer. We die ſooner or later according to the will of the Sovereign GOD, who hath determined our Days on Earth in His Decree, &amp; appointed our bounds which we cannot paſs. Job 14.5. <hi>Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou haſt appointed his bounds that he cannot paſs.</hi> However, according to the courſe of Nature, as Parents are born into the World firſt, ſo they die out of it before their Children. The decays of Nature
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003351_0010_0FF817772E876468"/>
and infirmities of Age gradually grow upon them; we ſee them decline and wear away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fatigues and burdens of life, until, as the Candle burns down and goeth out, ſo the vital heat and moiſture being conſum'd, they expire. Pſal. 90.10. <hi>The days of our years are threeſcore years and ten; and if by reaſon of ſtrength they be fourſcore years, yet is their ſtrength labour and ſorrow: for it is ſoon cut off, and we fly away.</hi> This hath been accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Age of Man ſince <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time. Here alſo we may obſerve, That it is no ſtrange thing for Parents to be taken away in their full ſtrength, yea, even before middle Age, and ſo to leave their Children Young, ſometimes not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of underſtanding the greatneſs of their loſs; but then, others by the favour of GOD continue till their Children are grown up, and after that they have for ſome time experienc'd the great benefit of their Preſence, Counſels and Prayers, the Parents die and leave them to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their loſs. And the pious Parent may when leaving this World, ſay to ſurvivours, ſomething as our Saviour to the daughters of Jeruſalem; — <hi>Weep not for me, but for your ſelves</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Luck 23, 28.</note>. For when ſuch depart, they go to be with CHRIST, which is far better; they go out of a World of ſin and ſorrow to that better Country, which is an heavenly, where they are comforted in the glorious Preſence of the Lamb, having all tears wiped from their Eyes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made perfect in holineſs. The Day of their

death is better to them than the day of their birth. But then, by ſuch a bereaving Providence, GOD calls us to lament and mourn; for they are gone from us, and that not to return again to converſe with us here. We ſee their faces no more; we behold their exemplary Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation no more, receive their Inſtructions and help no more. And therefore ſuch a Bereave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be lamented, even tho' our Parents ſhould live to a good old Age: When their hoary heads which were a Crown of Glory, being found in the way of righteouſneſs, are laid in the duſt, We may well take up a lamentation, and ſay, the <hi>Crown is fallen — for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of children are their fathers,</hi> Prov. 17.6.

               </p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>To Parents,</hi> in a few particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be Exhorted, <hi>Early to Pray for your Children, and in this way commend them to be Care &amp; Bleſſing of the Everlaſting Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is one great Privilege which belongs to the Relation of Parents in Covenant with GOD, bleſs their Children in the Name of the LORD, by asking His Bleſſing for them. And ſurely the conſideration of your Mortality ſhould quicken you to begin this Duty ſo ſoon as you know they begin to live, and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue inſtant in it with all perſeverance; for when you are remov'd, you will not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their condition as now you are, and if faithful, will be taken up from them to Praiſe GOD in His Temple above. Now then, lay up a ſtock of <hi>Prayers</hi> for them which may come down in <hi>Bleſſings</hi> upon them, even after your deceaſe. You have been inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of conveying ſin and death to them. Pſal. 51.5. <hi>Behold, I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my Mother conceive me.</hi> O cry to GOD then that they may experience the power of the <hi>New Birth,</hi> and that being cleanſed from their ſins by the Blood and Spirit of CHRIST, they may live to GOD here, and be prepared to follow you to Heaven, Thus
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003351_0028_0FF817A187BECDA8"/>
                  <hi>David</hi> pray'd for <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Chron. 29.19. <hi>Give unto Solomon my ſon a perfect heart to keep thy commandments</hi> —. Seeing you know not the day of your death, how ſoon and ſuddenly it may come upon you; attend this Duty daily, <hi>in ſecret,</hi> and <hi>in your families;</hi> yea, <hi>take them with you</hi> ſometimes in your <hi>Retirements,</hi> and let them ſee your concern for them in your ſervent Prayers to GOD on their behalf. Thus to attend your duty will be one likely way of enjoying them as Bleſſings of GOD to you while you live; and in this way, you may with the more comfortable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance commit them to the care of the ever-living GOD, when you leave them at death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Give them up to GOD in Baptiſm,</hi> and thus do your endeavour to bring them under the wing and bleſſing of the everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant eſtabliſh'd with GOD's People, and their Seed in CHRIST JESUS.</p>
               <p>As Children are virtually in their Parents before they are begotten and born into the World, ſo it hath pleaſed GOD to include Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents together with their Children in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Thus it was under the firſt Covenant, the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> made with <hi>Adam,</hi> "not for himſelf only, but for his Poſterity". And thus it is under the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> the Covenant of Grace. GOD promiſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17.7. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee, in their generations for an everlaſting covenant;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003351_0029_0FF817A49E6E5050"/>
to be a God unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee.</hi> Which bleſſing is come on the believing Gentiles thro' JESUS CHRIST, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. Let Parents then under the realizing view of the frailty of this life, make haſt to lay hold of GOD's Covenant, and to give up themſelves and their Seed to Him as their GOD, and that with their whole hearts; that whatever changes paſs over your Houſes, you may rejoyce with <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.5. <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God; yet he hath made with me in everlaſting covenant, ordered in all things and ſure: for this is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire, although he make it not to grow.</hi> In this way, <hi>devote them to GOD,</hi> that He may own them as His Children, and take them up when you forſake them: In this way, <hi>bring them to CHRIST</hi> for His bleſſing, who ſaid, <hi>Suffer little Children, and forbid them not to come unto me: for of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven,</hi> Mat. 19.14. In this way, <hi>ſeek to</hi> GOD that they may be <hi>Saved by the waſhing of Regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Indeed, we can't ſay that all who are viſibly in Covenant obtain the inviſible Grace and ſaving Bleſſings of the Covenant: <hi>For they are not all Iſrael, which are of Iſrael,</hi> Rom. 9.6. Sad experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us that not a few have with profane <hi>Eſau</hi> deſpiſed the <hi>Birth-right.</hi> However, this is one of the means of Grace which that GOD hath appointed who alone can command the Bleſſing; and the conſideration of the uncertainty of our own lives as well as the lives of our Children,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003351_0030_0FF817A74D233478"/>
ſhould make us ſpeedy and very ſerious in this Covenant tranſaction with GOD on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, that we may in faith plead the Promiſes of GOD's Covenant for them, when we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to be taken from them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Teach them the Will of GOD, and call upon them to Chooſe that good Part which can't be taken away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All fleſh is as graſs,— but the word of the LORD endureth for ever</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Pet 1.24, 25.</note>. O do your utmoſt then that they may know the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from their childhood, and have the laws of GOD written upon their hearts. Labour to inſtill the principles of Religion into them, and teach them early how they muſt fear and ſerve the LORD, while you look to GOD to fulfill His promiſe: Iſai. 54.13. <hi>All thy children ſhall be taught of the LORD</hi>—. Shew them their ſin and miſery by the Fall, and the only remedy provided in JESUS CHRIST, the only Name given among Men whereby we can be ſav'd. Call upon them to know the GOD of their Fathers, and to chooſe Him as their GOD. Urge them to make ſure of an Intereſt in CHRIST, and the Bleſſings of the Covenant; to Repent of their Sins, and make haſte to keep GOD's Commandments; that He may never leave them, and that in Him the unchangable GOD, they may have an unfailing Friend and everlaſting Portion. You

know not how ſoon you may be ſilent in the Grave: O do not delay then to ſpeak to them about the concerns of their Souls, and to teach them the good knowledge of the LORD, that they may be wiſe for Eternity &amp; to Salvation!</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Go before them,</hi> while GOD continueth you with them, <hi>in an holy Exemplary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walk before GOD</hi> within your houſe with a <hi>perfect heart,</hi> and <hi>before them,</hi> in a <hi>perfect way;</hi> for it is natural and common for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to imitate their Parents. It is true, they ſtand in need of <hi>ſupernatural Grace,</hi> to enable them to follow your pious Examples; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the duty is your's, and you muſt diſcharge it, looking to GOD to turn their feet to His Teſtimonies. Be exhorted then to ſet the great and weighty matters of GOD's law before your Children, not only in <hi>verbal Inſtructions,</hi> but in a <hi>living Pattern;</hi> that they may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to <hi>follow your faith, conſidering the end of your converſation.</hi> It may be you have but a little time to be with them, O endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour then to do much, by living much to the honour of GOD, the little time that remains! Take heed you do not lay a ſtumbling-block before them by living in the <hi>Omiſſion of Duty,</hi> of Family-prayer, of the ſtrict Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord's-day, of a devout Attendance on the Lord's Table, &amp;c. Or, <hi>in the Commiſſion of Sin,</hi> of profaneſs, of intemperance, lying, diſhoneſty in dealing, &amp;c. left they fall after

your Example, and GOD <hi>viſit the iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children.</hi> O do not walk in that broad way which leads to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, left they follow you, and you have a dreadful meeting in Hell; but in that narrow way which leads to life, that you may have a joyful meeting in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Endeavour to leave your Children with GOD, when you forſake them; and do what you can that they may live in Peace among themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The great work we have to do when we come to die, is to commit our departing Spirits into the Hands of JESUS CHRIST, and ſo to reſign our lives to GOD by Him as a free-will Offering; but this is not all, we ſhou'd alſo commit our dear Relatives, and in particular our Children, to the care of the living GOD, when we are leaving them. If you underſtand that word as an exhortation and promiſe to GOD's People, it may be fitly applied here, Jer 49.11. <hi>Leave thy fatherleſs children, I will preſerve them alive, and let thy widows truſt in me.</hi> Now then commend them to GOD in a ſolemn manner, and if GOD give you the opportunity, Charge them to keep His Covenant, that they may happily find that GOD is the GOD of His People, and of their Seed in their Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And in order to their obtaining the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Preſence of GOD with them, you ſhou'd do what you can that they may dwell together in Unity; for thus runs the promiſe, 2 Cor

13.11. —<hi>Live in Peace: and the God of love and peace ſhall be with you.</hi> And here it may not be amiſs to ſay, prudently and ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably ſettle your Affairs, that there may be no occaſion of unhappy diviſion and alienation upon temporal accounts.</p>
               <p>In a word, <hi>Whatever your hand finds to do</hi> for the welfare of your Children, <hi>do it with your might;</hi> for there is no work nor knowledge in the Grave whither you are going. If there be any Commands or Charges needful for you to give, and them to receive, delay them not, left you be prevented by Death. If you are middle Aged, you may not preſume you have time enough before you; for not a few die in their full ſtrength: And if GOD hath ſpared you to old Age, you had need make haſte to attend your duty in theſe &amp; other reſpects, that when Death comes, you may take leave of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with a comfortable hope that GOD will take them up and bleſs them, as He did <hi>Iſaac</hi> after his Father's death, Gen. 25. 11. <hi>And it came to paſs after the death of Abraham, that God bleſſed his ſon Iſaac;</hi> and that you ſhall have a Seed to <hi>ſerve</hi> GOD on <hi>earth,</hi> when you are <hi>call'd</hi> up to <hi>Praiſe</hi> Him in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
