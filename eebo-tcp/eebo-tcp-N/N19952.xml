            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HAVING publickly aſſerted, that I believed our late Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic Fever to have been generated in our city, I here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with encloſe you my reaſons for that opinion, accompanied by a wiſh that they may be laid before the public; for I conceive they are extremely intereſting, both to our city, and to the United States.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe reaſons are, as follows:—</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Yellow Fever in the Weſt Indies, and in all other countries where it is endemic, is the offspring of vegetable putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſame cauſes (under like circumſtances) muſt always produce the ſame effects. There is nothing in the air of the Weſt Indies above other hot countries, which diſpoſes it to produce a yellow fever. Similar degrees of heat acting upon dead and moiſt vegetable matters, are capable of producing it, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all its various modifications, in every part of the world. In ſupport of this opinion, I ſhall tranſcribe a part of a letter I received a few weeks ago from Dr. Miller, of the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware ſtate—a gentleman whoſe authority in medicine is ſecond to no man's in the United States.</p>

                     <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>Since the middle of laſt July, we have had a Bilious Colic epidemic in this neighborhood which exhibits phoenomena very ſingular in this climate; and ſo far as I am informed, unprece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented in the medical records, or popular tradition of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. To avoid unneceſſary details, it will ſuffice at preſent to obſerve, that the diſeaſe, on this occaſion, has aſſumed not only all the eſſential characters, but likewiſe all the violence, obſtinacy and malignity deſcribed by the Eaſt and Weſt Indian practitioners. If any difference can be obſerved, it ſeems here to manifeſt higher degrees of ſtubbornneſs and malignity, than we uſually meet in the hiſtories of tropical writers. In the courſe of the diſeaſe, not only extreme conſtipation, frequent vomiting, and the moſt excruciating pains of the bowels and limbs, harraſs the unhappy patient; but to theſe ſucceed paralyſis, convulſions, &amp;c. and almoſt always uncommon muſcular debility,—oppreſſion of the praecordia, &amp;c. are the conſequence of a ſevere attack. Bile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged in enormous quantities, conſtantly aſſumes the moſt corrupted and acrimonious appearances, commonly aeruginous in a very high degree, and ſometimes quite atrabilious.</p>
                  <p>The inference I mean to draw from the phoenomena of this diſeaſe, as it appears in this neighborhood, and which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume will alſo apply to your epidemic, is THIS, that from the uncommon protraction, and intenſeneſs of our ſummer and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal heats, but principally from the unuſual drought; we have had ſince the middle of July, a near approach to a TROPICAL ſeaſon, and that of conſequence we ought not to be ſurpriſed if tropical diſeaſes, even of the moſt malignant nature, are ANGEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERED amongſt us.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:026111_0005_0FCFB18F954392B0"/>To the above information, it may be added, that the bilious fever and dyſentery, which prevailed during the late autumn in ſeveral of the villages of Pennſylvania, particularly in Harriſburgh and Hummilſtown, were attended with a malignity and morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity unknown before in any part of the ſtate. I need not pauſe to remark, that this dyſentery aroſe from putrid exhalations, and that it is like the bilious cholic, only a modification of one ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Genus of bilious fever.</p>
            <p>But further—a malignant fever, reſembling that which has prevailed in our city, has appeared on Penſocken and on Walkill creeks, in New-Jerſey; at NewGalloway, in the ſtate of New-York—and at Weathersfield in Connecticut, during the late autumnal months, into none of which places was there a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of the diſeaſe having been imported from abroad, or convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an intercourſe with the city of Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>It is no objection to the inference which follows from theſe facts, that the common remitting fever was not known during the above period in the neighborhood of this city, and in many other parts of the ſtate, where it had uſually appeared in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal months. There is a certain combination of moiſture with heat, which is eſſential to the production of the remote cauſe of a bilious fever. Where the heat is ſo intenſe, or of ſuch long du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as wholly to diſſipate moiſture, or when the rains are ſo great as totally to overflow the marſhy ground, or to waſh away putrid maſſes of matter, no fever can be produced.</p>
            <p>Dr. Dazilles, in his treatiſe upon the diſeaſes of the negroes in the Weſt Indies, informs us, that the RAINY ſeaſon is the moſt healthy at Cayenne, owing to the neighboring moraſſes
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026111_0006_0FCF8DD7289E48F0"/>
being DEEPLY overflowed—whereas at St. Domingo, a DRY ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is moſt productive of diſeaſes; owing to its favouring thoſe degrees of moiſture which produce morbid exhalations. Theſe facts will explain the reaſon why, in certain ſeaſons, places which are naturally healthy in our country, become ſickly, while thoſe places which are naturally ſickly eſcape the prevailing epidemic<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Previouſly to the diſſipation of the moiſture from the putrid maſſes of vegetable matters in our ſtreets, and in the neighbourhood of the city, there were (as ſeveral practitioners can teſtify) many caſes of mild remittents, but they all diſappeared about the firſt week in September.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A quantity of damaged coffee, was expoſed at a time (July the 24th) and in a ſituation (on a wharf, and in a dock) which favoured its putrefaction, and exhalation. Its ſmell was highly putrid and offenſive, inſomuch that the inhabitants of the houſes in Water and Front Streets, who were near it, were obliged in the hotteſt weather to exclude it, by ſhutting their doors and windows. Even perſons, who only walked along thoſe ſtreets, complained of an intolerable foetor, which upon enquiring was conſtantly traced to the putrid coffee. It ſhould not ſurprize us, that this ſeed, ſo inoffenſive in its natural ſtate, ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, after its putrefaction, a violent fever. The records of medicine furniſh inſtances of ſimilar fevers being produced, by the putrefaction of many other regetable ſubſtances. Fourteen men out of ſixteen, periſhed by a malignant fever, a few years ago, at the iſland of Tortola, from the effluvia generated by ſome putrefied Potatoes, which were taken out of the hold of a Liverpool veſſel. "The effluvia (ſays Dr. Zimmerman) from a little heap of flax, has been known to occaſion a malignant fever, which proved fatal to the family, in which it firſt began, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026111_0007_0FCFB18D30C83478"/>
afterwards ſpread its <hi>contagion</hi> through a whole country." Dr. Rodgers in his treatiſe upon the diſeaſes of Cork, mentions a malignant fever which ſwept away a great number of the Students of Wadham College in Oxford. "The ſingularity of the caſe (adds the Doctor) engaged all the gentlemen of the faculty, in a ſerious inquiry into the cauſes of ſo remarkable an effect, and all agreed that the <hi>contagious</hi> infection aroſe from the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of a vaſt quantity of Cabbages thrown into a heap out of the ſeveral gardens near the College." Lanciſſi relates, that one end of the city of Rome was nearly deſolated by the effluvia of ſome rotted hemp, which lay in the neighbourhood of the city. The ſame author remarks, that "fevers often prevail at Conſtantinople, which owe their origin to the hemp which is brought from Cairo, and which is put wet into the public grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſuffered to ferment during the ſummer. It is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſold, and the ſeeds of thoſe diſeaſes are afterwards ſpread among the people."—Many other facts might be addu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of radiſhes, turnips, garlic, and ſundry other vegetables, generating by putrefaction, fevers, ſimilar to thoſe which have been mentioned.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The rapid progreſs of the fever from Water ſtreet, and the courſes through which it travelled into other parts of the city, afford a ſtrong evidence that it was at firſt propagated chiefly by exhalation from the putrid coffee. It is remarkable that it paſſed firſt through thoſe alleys and ſtreets, which were in the courſe of the winds that blew acroſs the dock and wharf where the coffee lay, and that perſons were affected at a much greater diſtance from Water ſtreet by that means, than was afterwards known by means of the contagion which was generated by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected perſons.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:026111_0008_0FCFB184C64D9DF0"/>5. Many perſons who had worked, or even viſited in the neighbourhood of the exhalation from the coffee, early in the month of Auguſt, were indiſpoſed afterwards with ſickneſs, puking, and yellow ſweats, long before the air of Water ſtreet was ſo much impregnated with the contagion, at to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch effects; and ſeveral patients whom I attended in the yellow fever declared to me, or to their friends, that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions began exactly at the time they inhaled the offenſive effluvia of the coffee.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſtricteſt inquiry, accompanied with the greateſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude for proofs, has not been able to diſcover any other cauſe of our late Epidemic. Every account of the importation of the diſeaſe, has been diſcovered upon examination to be inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate, contradictory and without foundation. The firſt caſes of the yellow fever have been clearly traced to the ſailors of the veſſel who were firſt expoſed to the effluvia of the Coffee. Their ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs commenced with the day on which the coffee began to emit its putrid ſmell. The diſeaſe ſpread with the encreaſe of the poiſonous exhalation. A journeyman of Mr. Peter Brown's, who worked near the corner of Race and Water ſtreets, caught the diſeaſe on the 27th of July. Elizabeth Hill the wife of a fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was infected by only ſailing near the peſtilential wharf, about the firſt of Auguſt, and died at Kenſington on the 14th of the ſame month. Many other names might be mentioned of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who ſickened during the laſt week in July or the firſt week in Auguſt, who aſcribed their illneſſes to the ſmell of the coffee. From two of thoſe perſons who came under my notice, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was evidently propagated by contagion: from one of them, to nearly a whole family—and from the other to a girl of eight years old, who was led by curioſity to examine the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026111_0009_0FCFB18370EFADF0"/>
low colour which it was ſaid had appeared in the face of the infected perſon, after death.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It has been remarked that this fever did not ſpread in the country, when carried there by perſons who were infected, and who afterwards died with it. This I conceive was occaſioned, in part by the contagion being deprived of the aid of miaſmata from the putrid matter which firſt produced it in our city, and in part, by its being diluted, and thereby weakened by the pure air of the country. During four times in which it prevailed in Charleſton, in no one inſtance, according to Dr. Lining, was it propagated in any other part of the ſtate.</p>
            <p n="8">8. It is very remarkable that in the hiſtories of the diſorder which have been preſerved in this country, it has <hi>ſeven</hi> times appeared about the firſt or middle of Auguſt, and declined, or ceaſed about the middle of October—viz. in 1732, 1739, 1745 and 1748 in Charleſton—in 1791 in New-York, and in 1762 and 1793 in Philadelphia. This frequent occurrence of the yellow fever at the uſual period of our common bilious remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, cannot be aſcribed to accidental coincidence, but muſt be reſolved in moſt caſes into the combination of more active miaſmata with the prediſpoſition of a tropical ſeaſon. In ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a tropical ſeaſon, I include that kind of weather in which rains and heats are alternated with each other, as well as that, which is uniformly warm.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Several circumſtances attended the late epidemic, which do not occur in the Weſt-India yellow fever. It affected chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as well as adults in common with our annual bilious fevers. In the Weſt-Indies Dr. Hume tells us it never attacked any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon under puberty. It had moreover many peculiar ſymptoms
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026111_0010_0FCFB181C6460C70"/>
(as I hope to ſhew in a future publication) which are not to be met with in any of the hiſtories of the Weſt-India yellow fever.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Why ſhould it ſurpriſe us to ſee a yellow fever generated amongſt us? It is only a higher grade of a fever which prevails every year in our city, from vegetable putrefaction. It conforms, in the difference of its degrees of violence and danger, to ſeaſon, as well as climate, and in this reſpect it is upon a footing with the ſmall-pox, the meaſles, the ſore throat, and ſeveral other diſeaſes. There are few years paſs, in which a plethoric habit, and more active but limited miaſmata, do not produce Sporadic Caſes, of true yellow fever in Philadelphia. It is very common in South and North Carolina and in Virginia, and there are facts which prove, that not only ſtrangers, but native individuals, and in one inſtance, a whole family have been carried off by it in the ſtate of Maryland. It proved fatal to One hundred perſons in the city of New-York, in the year of 1791, where it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently generated by putrid exhalation. The yellow color of the ſkin, has unfortunately too often been conſidered as the characteriſtic mark of this fever, otherwiſe many other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of its prevalence might be diſcovered, I have no doubt in every part of the United States. I wiſh with Dr. Moſely, the term <hi>yellow,</hi> could be aboliſhed from the titles of this fever, for this color is not only frequently abſent, but ſometimes occurs in the mildeſt bilious remittents. Dr. Haller in his pathology de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes an epidemic of this kind in Swiſſerland, in which this colour generally attended, and I have once ſeen it almoſt univerſal in a common bilious fever which prevailed in the Americam army in the year 1776.</p>

of our late fever having been imported, in ſpite of every poſſible evidence to the contrary, it would be, the opinion which has been publickly delivered by ſeveral medical gentlemen <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap>tion had ever been contagious. The fevers generated by putrid cabbage mentioned by Dr. Rodgers, and by putrid flax mentioned by Dr. Zimmerman, were both contagious. The late Dr. Wilſon of Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estown, in Delaware ſtate, in his hiſtory of a malignant fever, in Suſſex county, publiſhed in the United States Magazine for April, 1775, after tracing its cauſe to exhalations from ſavannahs or ponds, after a dry ſeaſon, expreſsly mentions that it was contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. "Some (he ſays) were taken ill a few days after they had ſeen the ſick, but eſpecially after they had been at the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the dead. Some went a week, and ſome perhaps a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and a few took it from the air, without going nigh the ſick." I have ſeen a bilious fever, received by contagion, in a caſe which came under my notice in September, 1778; and there are many facts which make it probable, that the bilious, or, as it was commonly called, the break-bone-fever of 1780, was propagated, in many inſtances, through our city, by means of contagion. The malignant fever, which was lately generated at Wethersfield, in Connecticut, it is ſaid was evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious.—Even the intermitting fever, according to Doctor Clarke, has, in ſome inſtances, generated a morbid matter which has produced the diſeaſe in perſons who had not been expoſed to the uſual remote cauſe of that diſorder. A ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar inſtance of an intermittent being propagated by conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in Virginia was communicated to me a year ago by a medical gentleman in that country. In all the five laſt mentioned caſes, the original diſeaſe which produced the contagion was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by exhalations from putrid vegetable matters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:026111_0012_0FCFB17E1EBAF180"/>I am far from denying that this diſeaſe, has not ſometimes been imported into our country. From the authority of Dr. Lind, and Dr. Mitchell, it appears that this has been the caſe in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtances. In this reſpect, it is upon a footing with the plague, which is both an imported and a generated diſeaſe, in the cities of the Eaſt. I am diſpoſed however to believe that the inſtances of the yellow fever, being imported, are very few compared with thoſe of its being generated in our country. What makes this opinion probable, is, that neither Great Britain, nor Ireland, have ever to my knowledge been infected by this fever, notwithſtanding their long and frequent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial intercourſe with the Weſt-India iſlands. The ſummers in each of thoſe countries, though ſedom <hi>hot</hi> enough to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a contagious yellow, or bilious fever, are notwithſtanding <hi>warm</hi> enough, to favour the propagation of an imported con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of that diſorder. The jail fever which has more than once been introduced into our city in crowded ſhips from Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, I ſuſpect has been ſometimes miſtaken for the yellow fever of the Weſt-Indies.</p>
            <p>I am aware that the opinion and facts which I have ſtated, are not popular with our citizens; but I have not concealed them during the whole courſe of the diſeaſe, nor ſhall I ceaſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them upon the public mind at every hazard, not only as the reſult of my judgment, but as the dictates of my conſcience, for I am perſuaded they involve in their conſequences the lives of millions that are yet unborn.—Commerce can no more be endangered than Religion, by the publication of Philoſophical truth. On the contrary it muſt ſuffer moſt by the adoption of the traditional error which I have endeavoured to refute; for
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026111_0013_0FCFB17CB880CC48"/>
while the cauſe of a malignant fever is obvious to the ſenſes, it will be eaſy to guard againſt it; but while it is believed that the diſeaſe may be imported, and no body know from what <hi>place,</hi> at what <hi>time,</hi> and in <hi>what manner;</hi> we ſhall not only be careleſs in the midſt of filth and danger, but our city will always hold its character for health by a timid and precarious tenure. I am the more diſpoſed to expect forgiveneſs from my fellow citizens for this attempt to ſerve them, by the recollection of the ſudden change in the health of our city which followed the arching the offenſive dock between Front and Third ſtreets in the year 1782. By adviſing that meaſure (in which I ſtood nearly alone) I incurred the cenſure of ſeveral valuable citizens. The bills of mortality however ſoon ſhewed that the meaſure was right, and I have ſince ſeen with great pleaſure, the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary healthineſs of our city, aſcribed by indifferent people, to that, among other cauſes.</p>
            <p>The climate of our country can no more ſuffer than the commerce of our city, by this inveſtigation, for it fixes the late fever, and all the other malignant fevers of the United States, upon putrid vegetable exhalation. Without the matrix of putrid vegetable matters, there can no more be a bilious, or yellow fever generated amongſt us, than there can be vegetation without earth, water, or air. To aſcribe our late diſeaſe therefore to the excluſive influence of the atmoſphere, is a reflection upon our climate, which is equally unphiloſophical and unjuſt.</p>
            <p>Let it only be clearly proved, and boldly aſſerted, that a bilious yellow fever has been, and may be generated in our country, under the circumſtances before mentioned, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn

of it, at alſo of common bilious; and intermitting fevers may every where be prevented by a due attention to the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the wharves, and Suburbs, as well as the ſtreets of our cities, and towns; by draining and cultivating marſhy grounds in their neighbourhood, and in the neighbourhood of farm houſes,—and where the laſt cannot be done, by ſhelter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from the current of vegetable exhalations by means of a body of trees that are of ſpeedy growth. In this manner, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant and deadly fevers have been baniſhed from moſt of the cities in Europe.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid, that the opinion I have delivered upon the origin of our late fever has been accommodated to my mode of treating it: this is not true: my treatment of it would have been the ſame had I believed it to have been an imported diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this long letter with two obſervations.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The principle of ſelf love which is ſo extenſive in its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon human actions, has unhappily corrupted the ſcience of medicine; hence we find dangerous and loathſome diſeaſes are conſidered by all nations, as of foreign extraction. Even the yellow fever itſelf in ſome parts of the Weſt Indies, is denied to be a native of the Iſlands. It is ſaid by many of their writers to have been imported from Siam in the Eaſt Indies.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Medical, like religious ſuperſtition cleaves ſo cloſely to the human mind, that it often exiſts under new forms, and names, in ſpite of the cultivation and progreſs of reaſon: hence we find that malignant fevers, which in former ages were aſcribed to celeſtial, planetary and demoniacal influence, are now with
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026111_0015_0FCFB179DDC78518"/>
the ſame ſuperſtitious indolence, and with as little truth, aſcribed to <hi>importation,</hi> or to an <hi>unknown ſomething</hi> in the air.</p>
            <p>With great reſpect, and eſteem, I am, Dear Sir, your ſincere friend and former pupil,</p>
