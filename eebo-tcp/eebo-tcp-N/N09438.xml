            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>FROM the time that I entered into the practice of medicine, and ſaw the danger to which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of thoſe who had the ſmall-pox in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural way, were expoſed, I could not but ſincerely wiſh, with every ſenſible perſon of the faculty, that ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation might become general.</p>
            <p>A conſiderable ſhare of employment in this branch of my profeſſion has for upwards of twenty years occurred to me; and altho' I have been ſo fortunate as not to loſe a patient under inoculation, except one perſon, about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years ago, who after the eruption of a few diſtinct puſtules died of a fever, which I eſteemed wholly inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant of the ſmall-pox, yet I muſt acknowledge that in ſome caſes the ſymptoms have coſt me not a little anxiety for the event.</p>
            <p>Nor have the ſubſequent effects of this practice always been ſo favourable as one could wiſh; and tho' far from equalling thoſe which too often follow the natural ſmall-pax, either in reſpect to difficulty or number, yet they ſometimes gave no ſmall uneaſineſs to the operator.</p>
            <p>It cannot likewiſe, it ought not to be concealed, that ſome of the inoculated have died under this proceſs, even under the care of very able and experienced practitioners. But this number is ſo ſmall, that, when compared with the mortality attending the natural ſmall-pox, it is reduced almoſt to a cypher.</p>
            <p>Theſe circumſtances, however, tended to diſcourage the operation in ſome degree. Practitioners were cautious of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012028_0003_0F89435B2D13B7F8"/>
urging a proceſs, of whoſe event they could not be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: and parents who were ſenſible enough to obſerve, that tho' the chance was greatly in their favour, yet as a blank might caſt up againſt them, they engaged in it with heſitation.</p>
            <p>Humanity, as well as a wiſh to promote the honour and advantage of the art I profeſs, made me ever attentive to the improvement of this part of my employment. Diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the common methods, I had carefully attended to the circumſtances that ſeemed to contribute to the good or ill ſucceſs of this practice in the courſe of my own buſineſs, as well as to the beſt information I could get of the ſucceſs of others.</p>
            <p>Many facts had induced me to think, that regimen, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and management would do much: that as the diſeaſe was of an inflammatory kind, a cooling regimen muſt certainly for the moſt part be reaſonable. Some faint eſſays were made to try how far this ſentiment might be juſt. But thoſe who are the beſt acquainted with the firſt aphoriſm of Hippocrates, will be the firſt in juſtifying a cautious procedure, where the object is no leſs than the life of an individual.</p>
            <p>In this ſituation I firſt heard, and with the utmoſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, that in ſome parts of the nation, a new and more ſucceſsful method of inoculating was diſcovered, than had hitherto been practiſed. The relators gave incredible accounts of the ſucceſs, which was the more marvellous, as the operators were chiefly ſuch, as by report could lay but little claim to medical erudition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:012028_0004_0F89435BE9610098"/>Knowing that improvements which would do honour to the moſt elevated human underſtandings, are ſometimes ſtumbled upon by men of more confined abilities; and that in medicine, as well as in every other circumſtance in life, it is our duty to avail ourſelves as much as poſſible, of all diſcoveries tending to the common benefit, I embraced every <hi>juſt opportunity</hi> of informing myſelf of facts, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and events, that either public fame, or more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe relations brought to me. I uſe the term <hi>juſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,</hi> becauſe, if I am not miſinformed, endeavours have been uſed, inconſiſtent with equity and candour, to rob thoſe who are intitled to our gratitude for aſſiſting us in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant proceſs, of that ſhare of private emolument which is their due, let their title to the diſcovery be ever ſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxical.</p>
            <p>To expoſe patients, even in the inoculated ſmall-pox, to all weathers, was a thing unheard of. To permit them through the whole progreſs of the diſeaſe to go abroad, and follow their uſual vocations, and that they ſhould neither ſuffer any preſent evil, nor experience any diſagreeable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, was ſtill more ſurprizing; yet an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of inſtances have confirmed all this; and ſome of theſe inſtances will appear in the ſequel of this performance.</p>
            <p>The deſign of this treatiſe is to bring the practice ſtill one ſtep nearer to perfection, and leſſen the ravages of a diſtemper, which is not a native of Britain, but, like the plague, has been imported from a foreign country, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the exertion of all the powers we are poſſeſſed of, either to exterminate it from amongſt us, which perhaps is not practicable, or to render it leſs unſafe, if not wholly without difficulty or danger.</p>
            <p>

               <head>Of the <hi>AGE, CONSTITUTION</hi> and <hi>SEASON</hi> of the Year proper for <hi>INOCULATION.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BEFORE I proceed to deſcribe the regimen and preparatives, it may not be improper to mention what has occurred to me in reſpect to the moſt ſuitable age and conſtitution for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculation, and likewiſe what ſeaſons ſeem to be more or leſs favourable for the practice.</p>
               <p>In regard to age, where it is left to my choice, I decline inoculating children under two years old. I know the common practice is againſt me in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; but my reaſons for rejecting ſuch are founded on obſervation and experience. I have, indeed, lately inoculated many under this age, at the preſſing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties of their parents, and they have all done well. But it muſt be conſidered, that young children are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to all the hazards of dentition, fevers, fluxes, convulſions, and other accidents, ſufficiently difficult in themſelves to manage in ſuch tender ſubjects, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſcarce two in three of all that are born, live to be two years old, as is demonſtrable from the Bills of Mortality.</p>
               <p>Beſides convulſive paroxyſms often accompany the variolous eruptive fever in children; and tho' generally looked upon in no unfavourable light, as often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding a diſtinct kind of ſmall-pox, yet they are at all times attended with ſome degree of danger; nay, many, it is well known, have expired under them, while others, who have ſtruggled through with great difficulty, have been ſo debilitated, and their faculties ſo impaired, that the effects have been perceptible during the remaining part of their lives.</p>
               <p>And even admitting the eruption to be favourable, and not attended with any ſuch alarm, yet ſhould a larger number of puſtules than uſual appear, or any
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012028_0007_0F89435EEA78D938"/>
untoward ſymptom happen, and require medical help, the unhappy ſufferer is much too young to be prevailed on to take unpalatable medicines, or ſubmit to other neceſſary meaſures, by perſuaſions, menaces or bribes. I have often been preſent at afflicting ſcenes of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and have reaſon to think that many children have died of the ſmall-pox in the natural way, merely from the impoſſibility of prevailing upon them to comply with what was proper in caſes where little or no danger was diſcoverable, either from the number or ſpecies of the puſtules, the degree of fever, or any other appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent cauſe.</p>
               <p>It muſt likewiſe be taken into conſideration, that young children have uſually a larger ſhare of puſtules from inoculation, than thoſe who are advanced a little farther in life; and that under this circumſtance it is well known many have died; and the proportion of theſe, ſo far as I can learn, is too great to encourage a continuance in the inoculation of young children; ſo that it ſeems moſt prudent to wait till this dangerous period be over, eſpecially as its duration is ſo ſhort, that the danger of their receiving the ſmall-pox therein in the natural way is very little; and it is at this time much more eaſy to preſerve them from it, than when they are left more to themſelves, and may be more in the way of infection. But children above this period may be inoculated more freely; nor does there appear any reaſon to exclude healthy adults of any age, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſeventy having paſſed thro' this proceſs with the utmoſt eaſe, and without occaſioning the leaſt painful apprehenſion for the event.</p>
               <p>In reſpect to conſtitution greater liberties may be taken than have heretofore been judged admiſſible: perſons afflicted with various chronic complaints, of ſcrophulous, ſcorbutic and arthritic habits; perſons of unwieldy corpulency, and of intemperate and irregular lives, have all paſſed through this diſeaſe, with as much eaſe and ſafety as the moſt temperate, healthy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular. But thoſe who labour under any acute or cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical diſeaſes, or their effects, are obviouſly unfit and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012028_0008_0F89435FACFCFBA8"/>
improper ſubjects. So likewiſe are thoſe where there are evident marks of corroſive acrimonious humors, or where there is a manifeſt debility of the whole frame from inanition or any other cauſe; all theſe ſhould be treated in a proper manner previous to the introduction of this diſeaſe. Conſtitutions diſpoſed to frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of intermittens, ſeem likewiſe juſtly exceptionable, eſpecially as the preparatory regimen may in ſome ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits increaſe this tendency. I have known, however, inſtances of ſevere ague fits attacking perſons between the inſertion of the matter and the eruption of the pock, and even during maturation, when the bark has been given liberally and with ſucceſs, the principal buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the mean time, ſuffering no injury or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
               <p>Among the circumſtances generally conſidered as more or leſs propitious to inoculation, the ſeaſon of the year has hitherto been deemed a matter of ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. Spring and autumn, for the moſt part, have been recommended as being the moſt temperate ſeaſons; the cold of winter, and the ſummer heats, having been judged unfavourable for this proceſs. But experience does not juſtify theſe opinions; for according to the beſt obſervation I have been able to make, inoculated perſons have generally had more puſtules in ſpring than at any other time of the year; and epidemic diſeaſes being commonly moſt frequent in autumn, eſpecially fluxes, intermittens and ulcerated ſore throats, all which are liable to mix more or leſs with the ſmall-pax, the autumn, upon this account, does not ſeem to be the moſt favourable ſeaſon in general.</p>
               <p>My opinion is, that, conſidering the ſurprizing and indiſputable benefits ariſing at all times to patients in the ſmall-pox, from the free admiſſion of freſh cool air and evacuations, which will appear from ſome caſes hereafter ſubjoined, we may ſafely inoculate in all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, provided care be taken to ſcreen the patients as much as poſſible from heat in ſummer, and to prevent them from keeping themſelves too warm, and too much ſhut up, as they are naturally diſpoſed to do, from the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012028_0009_0F89436069A14D88"/>
weather in winter. And it is well known, that many have been inoculated in the depth of winter, and ſome during the greateſt heat in ſummer, without ſuffering any injury or inconvenience from either.</p>
               <p>When ſeaſons, however, are marked with any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar epidemics, of ſuch a kind eſpecially as may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a mild diſeaſe more untractable, it may perhaps be moſt prudent not to inoculate while ſuch diſeaſes are prevalent.</p>
               <p>An eminent phyſician of my acquaintance in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, at that time in conſiderable buſineſs, informed me, that in the year 1756 the ſmall-pox were very rife, in the ſummer of that year eſpecially. That in moſt of them the throat was ſo much affected, that about the ſeventh day from the eruption, when they ought to have taken liquors in abundance, they could not ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a drop. The ptyaliſm was in the mean time co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious; and the kind being for the moſt part confluent, they died on the tenth or eleventh day; and thoſe who periſhed of this diſtemper, and much the majority pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, all ſuffered from this cauſe. This inſtance is only given to ſhew the neceſſity of regarding the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſtate of epidemics when we go into this opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to excite thoſe who are friends to this moſt beneficial diſcovery, to uſe every means in their power to provide againſt a ſingle inſtance of ill ſucceſs.</p>

               <head>Of the <hi>PREPARATION.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN directing the preparatory regimen, I principally aim at theſe points: to reduce the patient, if in high health, to a low and more ſecure ſtate; to ſtrengthen the conſtitution, if too low; to correct what appears vitiated, and to clear the ſtomach and bowels, as much as may be, from all crudities and their effects. With this view, I order ſuch of my patients, as conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the firſt claſs, and who are by much the majority, to live in the following manner: to abſtain from all animal food, including broths, alſo butter and cheeſe, and from all fermented liquors, excepting ſmall beer,

which is allowed ſparingly, and from all ſpices, and whatever poſſeſſes a manifeſt heating quality. The diet is to conſiſt of pudding, gruel, ſago, milk, rice-milk, fruit pyes, greens, roots, and vegetables of all the kinds in ſeaſon, prepared or raw. Eggs, tho' not to be eat alone, are allowed in puddings, and butter in pye-cruſt; the patients are to be careful that they do not eat ſuch a quantity as to overload their ſtomachs, even of this kind of food. Tea, coffee, or chocolate are permitted for breakfaſt, to thoſe who chooſe or are accuſtomed to them.</p>
               <p>In this manner they are to proceed about nine or ten days before the operation; during which period, at nearly equal diſtances, they are directed to take three doſes of the following powder, either made into pills, or mixed with a little ſyrup or jelly, at bed-time, and a doſe of Glauber's ſalt, diſſolved in thin water-gruel, each ſucceeding morning.</p>
               <p>The powder is compoſed of eight Grains of calomel, the ſame quantity of the compound powder of crabs claws, and one eighth part of a grain of emetic tartar. Inſtead of emetic tartar, I have ſometimes ſubſtituted two grains of precipitated ſulphur of antimony. In order to facilitate the diviſion of the doſes, a large quantity is prepared at once, and great care taken that the mixture is well performed.</p>
               <p>This quantity is uſually ſufficient for a healthy ſtrong man; and the doſe muſt be leſſened for women or children according to their age and ſtrength, as well as for perſons advanced in years.</p>
               <p>The firſt doſe is commonly ordered at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the courſe; the ſecond, three or four days after; and the third, about the eighth or ninth day; and I chuſe to inoculate the day after the laſt doſe has been taken. On the days of purging, broths are allowed, and the patients are deſired to abſtain from unprepared vegetables.</p>
               <p>What has hitherto been ſaid concerning the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt be conſidered as proper only for the young or middle aged, in a good ſtate of health; but among
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012028_0011_0F894361E9B71B90"/>
thoſe who are deſirous of inoculation, are often found tender, delicate and weakly women, men of bad ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina, valetudinarians by conſtitution, by illneſs, or intemperance, alſo aged perſons and children; and for theſe a very different treatment is directed; a milder courſe of medicine, rather of the alterative than purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive kind, is here preferable; and in many inſtances, an indulgence in ſome light animal food, with a glaſs or two of wine in caſe of lowneſs, is not only allowable, but neceſſary to ſupport a proper degree of ſtrength, eſpecially in advanced age.</p>
               <p>Children, whoſe bowels are often tender, and ought not be ruffled by ſtrong purges, yet require a mild mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial, and bear it well: beſides emptying the bowels of crudities, it is a good ſecurity againſt worms and their effects, which are ſometimes of themſelves per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing enough, and produce very alarming and even fatal diſorders.</p>
               <p>Indeed the particular ſtate of health of every perſon entering upon the preparatory courſe ſhould be inquired into and conſidered. Inattention to this has, I am ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, done great miſchief, and particularly the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet uſe of mercurials, whereby a ſalivation has often been raiſed, to the riſque of impairing good conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the ruin of ſuch as were previouſly weak and infirm. The diſtinctions and treatment neceſſary, will be obvious to thoſe who are acquainted with the animal oeconomy and medical practice.</p>
               <p>The time of menſtruation has generally been the guide in reſpect to the inoculation of women; that the whole of the diſeaſe might be over within the menſtrual period. This I commonly obſerve, when I can chuſe my time without any inconvenience, and inoculate ſoon after the evacuation ceaſes: tho' I have no reaſon to decline performing the operation at any time, as I can produce many examples in which no inconvenience has ariſen, nor any difference been obſervable, when this circumſtance has been diſregarded.</p>
               <p>Women with child have likewiſe been inoculated and done well, yet ſome particular emergency ſhould
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012028_0012_0F894362A9C3C9A8"/>
be pleaded in excuſe for it in their ſituation, as it may be attended with ſome hazard. I have not inoculated any women whom I knew to be pregnant; but ſome who concealed their pregnancy, have been inoculated by me, who, I fancy, hoped for an event that did not happen, I mean miſcarriages; one of theſe had a child born nine weeks after inoculation, at the full time, with diſtinct marks of the diſeaſe, tho' the mother had very few eruptions.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE manner of communicating this diſtemper by inoculation in this country, has of late been the following: A thread is drawn thro' a ripe puſtule, and well moiſtened with the matter: a piece of this thread is inſinuated into a ſuperficial inciſion made in one or both arms, near the part where iſſues are uſually fixed; this thread is covered with a plaiſter, and there left for a day or two. This is the moſt uſual way, tho' others have been practiſed by ſeveral in the profeſſion.</p>
               <p>At preſent, very different methods are pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ued; two of which, that vary in ſome reſpects, I have frequently practiſed, and ſhall deſcribe; but the following has been ſo invariably ſucceſsful as to induce me to give it the preference.</p>
               <p>The patient to be infected being in the ſame houſe, and, if no objection is made to it, in the ſame room, with one who has the diſeaſe, a little of the variolous matter is taken from the place of inſertion, if the ſubject is under inoculation; or a ripe puſtule, if in the natural way, on the point of a lancet, ſo that both ſides of the point are moiſtened.</p>
               <p>With this lancet an inciſion is made in that part of the arm where iſſues are uſually placed, deep enough to paſs through the ſcarf ſkin, and juſt to touch the ſkin itſelf, and in length as ſhort as poſſible, not more than one eighth of an inch.</p>
               <p>The little wound being then ſtretched open between the finger and thumb of the operator, the inciſion is
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012028_0013_0F8943636A9F4CF8"/>
moiſtened with the matter, by gently touching it with the flat ſide of the infected lancet. This operation is generally performed in both arms, and ſometimes in two places in one arm, a little diſtant from each other. For as I have not obſerved any inconvenience from two or three inciſions, I ſeldom truſt to one, that neither I nor my patient may be under any doubt about the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the operation from its being performed in one place only.</p>
               <p>I have alſo tried the following method, with the ſame ſucceſs as that above deſcribed, but do not ſo well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it, becauſe I have been credibly informed that it has ſometimes failed in the practice of others. A lancet being moiſtened with the variolous fluid in the ſame manner as in the other, is gently introduced in an oblique manner between the ſcarf and true ſkin, and the finger of the operator is applied on the point, in order to wipe off the infection from the lancet, when it is withdrawn. In this method, as well as in the former, a little blood will ſometimes appear; but I neither draw blood with deſign, nor do I think it neceſſary to wipe it off before the matter is introduced.</p>
               <p>In both theſe ways of inoculating, neither plaiſter, bandage or covering is applied, or in any reſpect ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
               <p>Theſe methods of producing the diſeaſe never once have failed me: and experience has ſufficiently proved, that there is no danger from additional infection by the natural diſeaſe at the ſame time. I therefore make no ſcruple of having the perſon to be inoculated, and the patient from whom the infection is to be taken, in the ſame room; nor have ever perceived any ill conſequences attending it. But I adviſe the inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated patients (tho' perhaps there is no neceſſity for that precaution) to be afterwards ſeparated from places of infection till certain ſigns of ſucceſs appear, when all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint is removed, there being no danger from accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.</p>
               <p>It ſeems to be of no conſequence whether infecting matter be taken from the natural or inoculated ſmall-pox,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012028_0014_0F8943642AF98E70"/>
I have uſed both, and never have been able to diſcover the leaſt difference, either in point of certainty of infection, the progreſs, or the event; and therefore I take the infection from either, as opportunity offers, or at the option of my patients or their friends.</p>
               <p>Nor is it of conſequence whether the matter be taken before or at the criſis of the diſtemper. It is, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, generally ſuppoſed, that the ſmall-pox is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious till after the matter has acquired a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of maturity; and in the common method of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculation, this is much attended to; and when the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration has failed, it has commonly been aſcribed to the unripeneſs of the matter.</p>
               <p>But it appears very clearly from the preſent practice of inoculation, that ſo ſoon as any moiſture can be taken from the infected part of an inoculated patient, previous to the appearance of any puſtules, and even previous to the eruptive fever, this moiſture is capable of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating the ſmall-pox with the utmoſt certainty. I have taken a little clear fluid from the elevated pellicle on the inciſed part, even ſo early as the fourth day after the operation; and have at other times uſed matter fully digeſted after the criſis, with equal ſucceſs. I chuſe, however, in general, to take matter for infection during the fever of eruption, as I ſuppoſe it at that time to have its utmoſt activity.</p>
               <p>In all caſes when I take matter from an inoculated perſon, it is from the place where it was inſerted; as I am always ſure to find infection there, if the diſeaſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, and always of ſufficient energy.</p>
               <p>It may appear ſtrange, that no bandage, dreſſing or application whatſoever is made uſe of to the part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; but that, the moſt ſimple inciſion being made, and moiſtened with the ſmalleſt particle of the recent fluid matter, the whole is committed to nature. This method is however perfectly right, becauſe the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of either plaiſter or unguent, as is the uſual practice, will occaſion an inflammation on ſome ſkins, and in all tend to diſguiſe the natural appearance of the inciſion, and prevent our forming a proper judgment
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012028_0015_0F894364EB35DFD8"/>
of the progreſs of the infection, which will afterwards appear to be a matter of much importance.</p>
               <p>If neither an inoculated patient is at hand, nor any one in the neighbourhood has a diſtinct kind of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural diſeaſe, a thread may be uſed as in the common manner, provided the thread be very recently infected, but I think it ought to be uſed as ſoon as poſſible, after being charged with infecting matter.</p>
               <p>The following method of introducing the diſeaſe has likewiſe been found effectual, but I have never practiſed it myſelf. Dip the point of a lancet in variolous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let it be held in the air till it is dry, after which it may be cloſed and kept in the common caſe without any further care; and with this prepared lancet raiſe the ſcarf ſkin obliquely, and keep the lancet a little time in motion between the two ſkins, that part of the matter may be mixed with the animal juices; then withdraw the lancet, and leave the inciſion uncovered as before.</p>

               <p>HITHERTO very little regard ſeems to have been paid to the progreſs of infection diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the part where the operation was performed. But it will appear in the ſequel, that an attention to this circumſtance is very neceſſary, becauſe a juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſtick may thence be ſometimes formed of the future ſtate of the diſtemper, and indications may be taken from the different appearances on the arm, that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to prevent inconveniencies.</p>
               <p>The former method of covering the place of inciſion with a plaiſter, and continuing upon it dreſſings of one ſort or another, prevented much uſeful information of this kind. They prevented any judgment by the touch, and ſometimes rendered that by the eye equivocal.</p>
               <p>The day after the operation is performed, though it takes effect, little alteration is diſcoverable. On the ſecond day, if the part is viewed with a lens, there ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally appears a kind of orange-coloured ſtain about the inciſion, and the ſurrounding ſkin ſeems to contract.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012028_0016_0F894365AA9876F8"/>
At this time I uſually give the following medicine at going to bed, either mixed with a little of any kind of jelly, or more frequently made into a pill:</p>
               <p>Calomel and compound powder of crabs claws, of each 3 grains, emetic tartar one tenth of a grain.</p>
               <p>A quantity of this medicine ſhould be carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared at once, in order to make the diviſion more exact.</p>
               <p>On the fourth or fifth day, upon applying the finger, a hardneſs is to be felt by the touch. The patient per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives an itching on the part, which appears ſlightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, and under a kind of veſication is ſeen a little clear fluid, the part reſembles a ſuperficial burn. About the ſixth, moſt commonly ſome pain and ſtiffneſs is felt in the axilla; and this is a very pleaſing ſymptom, as it not only foretells the near approach of the eruptive ſymptoms, but is a ſign of a favourable progreſs of the diſeaſe. Sometimes on the ſeventh, oftener on the eighth day, ſymptoms of the eruptive fever appear; ſuch as ſlight remitting pains in the head and back, ſucceeded by tranſient ſhiverings and alternate heats, which in a greater or leſs degree continue till the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is perfected. At this time alſo it is uſual for the patient to complain of a very diſagreeable taſte in his mouth, the breath is always fetid, and their ſmell dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what I have even obſerved in any caſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the variolous eruptive fever.</p>
               <p>The inflammation in the arms at this time ſpreads faſt, and upon viewing it with a good glaſs, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, for the moſt part, appears ſurrounded with an infinite number of ſmall confluent puſtules, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in ſize and extent as the diſeaſe advances. On the tenth or eleventh day a circular or oval effloreſcence is uſually diſcovered, ſurrounding the inciſion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſometimes near half round the arm, but more frequently to about the ſize of a ſhilling, and being under the cuticle, is ſmooth to the touch, and not pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. This appearance is alſo a very pleaſing one; it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies eruption, every diſagreeable ſymptom ceaſes, and at the ſame time it certainly indicates the whole
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012028_0017_0F8943666B531468"/>
affair to be over, the pain and ſtiffneſs in the axilla alſo going off.</p>
               <p>The feveriſh ſymptoms are for the moſt part ſo mild, as ſeldom to require any medicinal aſſiſtance, except a repetition of the ſame medicine that was directed on the ſecond night after the operation; and on the following morning this laxative draught, to procure three or four ſtools;</p>
               <p>Infuſion of ſena two ounces, manna half an ounce, tincture of jalap two drams.</p>
               <p>Theſe are given as ſoon as the eruptive ſymptoms are perceivable, if they ſeem to indicate any uncommon degree of vehemence.</p>
               <p>It has been obſerved, that by attending to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of infection, we may be able to prognoſticate, with ſome degree of certainty, the event of the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in general. Particular incidents will ever happen, but not ſufficient to deſtroy the propriety of general rules.</p>
               <p>If the appearances already deſcribed are obſerved early, a very favourable event is implied: but it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in ſome caſes, although it may be perceived that the inoculation has ſucceeded, yet it is barely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible, the colour about the wound remaining pale, inſtead of changing to red or inflamed; the edges of the inciſion ſpread but little, they remain flat, ſcarcely riſing at all, and are attended neither with itching or uneaſineſs of any kind. Nay, ſometimes on the fifth, and even the ſixth day, the alteration is ſo little, as to make it doubtful whether the infection has taken place.</p>
               <p>When matters are in this ſtate, the appearance is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable, and implies a late and more untoward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe: To prevent which, I direct the powder or pill to be taken each night; and in caſe it fails to operate by ſtool, or there is the leaſt diſpoſition to coſtiveneſs, an ounce of Glauber's ſalts, or more commonly the laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive draught already mentioned, is given in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, once or twice, as the caſe may require. This courſe forwards the inflammation, which I always wiſh to ſee; as I have conſtantly obſerved, that an early progreſs on
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012028_0018_0F8943672B4627D0"/>
the arm, and an early commencement of the eruptive complaints, portend that the diſtemper will be mild and favourable; and on the contrary, where both are late, the ſymptoms are uſually more irregular and untoward.</p>
               <p>Being now arrived at the moſt intereſting period of this diſtemper, the eruption, a period in which the preſent practice I am about to recommend, differs eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially from the method heretofore in uſe, and on the right management of which much depends, it will be requiſite to give clear and explicit directions on this head, and to adviſe their being purſued with firmneſs and moderation.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of confining the patient to his bed, or his room, when the ſymptoms of the eruptive fever come on, he is directed, as ſoon as the purging medicine has operated, to keep abroad in the open air, be it ever ſo cold, as much as he can bear, and to drink cold water, if thirſty, always taking care not to ſtand ſtill, but to walk about moderately while abroad.</p>
               <p>This treatment indeed ſeems as hard at firſt to the patients, as it muſt appear ſingular to the reader; but the effects are ſo ſalutary, and ſo conſtantly confirmed by experience, and an eaſy progreſs thro' every ſtage of the diſeaſe depends ſo much upon it, that I admit of no exception, unleſs the weather be extremely ſevere, and the conſtitution very delicate. And it is indiſputably true, that in the few inſtances where the ſymptoms of eruption have run very high, the patients dreading any motion, and fearing the cold as the greateſt evil; yet, when under theſe circumſtances I have perſuaded them to riſe out of bed and go out of doors, though led ſometimes by two aſſiſtants, and have allowed them to drink as much cold water as they choſe, they have not ſuffered the leaſt ſiniſter accident. On the contrary, after they have been prevailed on, although reluctantly, to comply with theſe directions, they find their ſpirits revived, an inclination for nouriſhment returns; they reſt well; a gentle ſweat ſucceeds, accompanied with a favourable eruption, and the fever ſeems wholly to be extinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:012028_0019_0F894367EA1C6D10"/>In general the complaints in this ſtate are very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and attended with ſo little illneſs, that the patient eats and ſleeps well the whole time: a few puſtules ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, ſometimes equally diſperſed, ſometimes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations on the arms ſpread, and are ſurrounded with a few puſtules, which gradually advance to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; during which time, for the moſt part, the eruption proceeds kindly, and there is much more difficulty to reſtrain the patients within due bounds, prevent them from mixing with the public, and ſpreading the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection (which I always endeavour to prevent) than there was at firſt to prevail upon them to go abroad. During this time, medicine is ſeldom wanted, the cool air ſeems the beſt cordial; and if any uncommon languor happens, a baſon of ſmall broth, or a glaſs of wine, is allowed in the day, or ſome white wine whey at bed time; which are indeed at any time allowed to tender, aged or weakly perſons.</p>
               <p>With theſe exceptions they have hitherto been kept very ſcrupulouſly to the diet at firſt directed. But after the eruption is compleated, if occaſion requires, they are indulged in a little well-boiled meat of the lighteſt kind, as chicken, veal or mutton.</p>
               <p>The regimen above mentioned, the cooling alterative purges, and the free uſe of cool air at the ſeaſon of eruption, almoſt univerſally prevent either alarming ſymptoms, or a large crop of puſtules. A few I have ſeen with ſuch a quantity of puſtules, tho' diſtinct, that I have neither adviſed nor allowed them to go out of the houſe. But the generality of my patients, when the eruptions are few, amuſe themſelves abroad within proper limits, with the puſtules out upon them.</p>
               <p>I neither enjoin this, nor maintain that it is neceſſary; but have not been able to obſerve that any inconvenience has ariſen from it. And how ſtrange ſoever it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, it is true, that thoſe who are moſt adventurous, ſeem to be in better ſpirits, and more free from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, than others who are inclined to keep within doors. And indeed, ſuch of my patients as have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the benefit of this treatment themſelves, ſeldom
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012028_0020_0F894368AB5A4440"/>
permit thoſe who are in the hardeſt part of the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the eruptive, to keep much in the houſe; encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging them to bear a little hardſhip, by recounting to them the benefit they have reaped from the method they are recommending.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who have the diſeaſe in the ſlighteſt manner firſt deſcribed, viz. without any appearance of the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but on the inoculated part, are ſoon allowed to go about their uſual affairs; and many inſtances have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened of very induſtrious poor men, who have inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned to their daily labour, with a caution not to intermix with thoſe who have not had the diſtemper, for fear of ſpreading it, and with directions to take two or three times of the purge already directed, or as many doſes of Glauber's ſalts. Thoſe who have it in a greater degree, are confined ſomewhat longer, and a very mild laxative is now and then exhibited, if there is the leaſt diſpoſition to coſtiveneſs; as the progreſs to maturation appears rather to be advanced than retarded by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>When the maturation is compleated, and it is evident we have nothing further to fear from the diſtemper, I allow my patients gradually to change their courſe of diet, from the perfectly cooling kind, to one a little more generous; recommending ſtrictly to all a return to their ordinary animal diet with much caution and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon their appetites, both in reſpect to food and fermented liquors.</p>
               <p>It is not often that we are under a neceſſity of making any application to the part where the operation was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; it moſt commonly heals up, and is covered with a ſcab, about the time when, in the natural way, all the pocks would have been dried up: But there are ſome caſes wherein the inciſions continue to diſcharge a purulent matter longer; in theſe inſtances it is ſufficient to cover the place with the white cerate, or any other mild emplaſtic ſubſtance, which may at once prevent the linen from adhering to the ſore, and defend it from the air. And as in theſe caſes the part remains unhealed from ſome peculiar cauſe in the habit, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012028_0021_0F8943696B8CC9D8"/>
to give gentle purgatives, and proper alteratives, as particular exigencies may require.</p>

               <p>IN the preceding pages I have preſcribed the uſual progreſs of the ſmall-pox from inoculation. There are, however, deviations from this courſe, and indeed not a few; ſome of the moſt material of which, as they may embarraſs the inexperienced, and create real diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, as well as apprehenſions of danger, it ſeems ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to deſcribe, and the means that experience has ſuggeſted to remove, theſe ſymptoms, or the doubts reſpecting the event.</p>
               <p>The firſt I ſhall take notice of, and which, tho' it very rarely happens, ſometimes gives much trouble, is great ſickneſs accompanied with vomiting, coming on during the eruptive ſtate of the diſtemper. For this complaint it is always neceſſary in the firſt place to clear the ſtomach, which may be effected either by ordering the patient to drink plentifully of warm liquids to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote vomiting, or perhaps more properly, by giving one grain of emetic tartar to an adult, mixed with ten grains of compound powder of crabs claws, taking care to leſſen the doſe for very young and weak ſubjects.</p>
               <p>This uſually throws off ſome bilious matter by vomit, ſometimes procures ſtools, or occaſions a moderate ſweat, and generally adminiſters relief. If, however, no ſtools ſhould follow from this medicine, and the ſickneſs ſhould remain, a gentle laxative almoſt certainly procures a reſpite, and the appearance of the eruption removes the complaint entirely.</p>
               <p>Another deviation, of ſtill more conſequence, which ſometimes happens towards the time of the eruption, and is often, tho' not always, accompanied with great ſickneſs, is an eryſipelatous effloreſcence. This, if it ſhews itſelf on the ſkin partially, and here and there in patches, is not very alarming, and ſoon wears off.</p>
               <p>But ſometimes the whole ſurface of the ſkin is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a raſh intimately mixed with the variolous
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012028_0022_0F89436B718CA1A0"/>
eruption, and ſo much reſembling the moſt malignant kind of confluent ſmall-pox, as ſcarcely to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from it: and indeed ſome caſes of this ſort have happened, where, being accompanied with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiae and livid ſpots, I have been much alarmed; not being able, by inſpection only, tho' aſſiſted by glaſſes, to determine whether what I ſaw was an inoffenſive raſh, or tokens of the greateſt malignity. Very ſtrict atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however, has enabled me to diſtinguiſh the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference clearly; and the following obſervation will, I hope, tend to relieve others from the anxiety they would feel upon ſuch an appearance. The real and eſſential difference then is to be gathered from the concomitant ſymptoms. In the eryſipelatous or variolous raſh, there is not ſo much fever, nor is the reſtleſſneſs, or pain of the head or loins, ſo conſiderable; neither is there that general proſtration of ſtrength, which are almoſt never-failing attendants on a confluent ſmall-pox, eſpecially when accompanied with ſuch putrid appearances; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, upon a careful examination, there may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be diſcerned a few diſtinct puſtules, larger than the reſt, mixed with the raſh, which are indeed the real ſmall-pox. In theſe caſes the patients are ordered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from cold water, or any thing cold; and to keep within doors, but not to go to bed. If any ſickneſs yet remains, a little white wine whey, or other moderate cordial, is adviſed: and this method has hitherto been ſo ſucceſsful, as to prevent any alarming complaint. After two or three days, the ſkin from a florid changes to a duſky colour, a few diſtinct puſtules remain, and advance properly to maturation, without any further trouble enſuing from this formidable appearance.</p>
               <p>This raſh has been often miſtaken for the confluence it ſo nearly reſembles, and has afforded occaſion for ſome practitioners, either ignorantly or diſingenuouſly, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that after a very copious eruption of the confluent pox, they can by a ſpecific medicine diſcharge the major part of the puſtules, leaving only as many diſtinct ones as may ſatisfy the patient that he has the diſeaſe. Such pretenſions have certainly been made, and the patient
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012028_0023_0F89436BABEB2230"/>
who has been deceived in this manner, has contributed to ſpread reports untrue as to the fact, and probably prejudicial to the health of others, who in like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances have been ſent abroad, and other cool means purſued, by which the raſh has been repelled, and the bad effects experienced afterwards.</p>
               <p>I muſt alſo obſerve here, that raſhes of the kind I have deſcribed frequently happen during the preparation (whether owing to the regimen, or medicine, or both, I cannot ſay) and cauſe the operation to be poſtponed: But I have obſerved, that in ſuch caſes they are apt to return at the time of the eruption of the ſmall-pox.</p>
               <p>In general, as has been already ſaid, the ſymptoms which precede eruption, commence at the end of the ſeventh or in the eighth day incluſive from the operation; but it often happens, that they appear much ſooner, and ſometimes much later, than the time above-mentioned. For inſtance, I have ſeen ſome caſes wherein the diſeaſe has happened ſo ſuddenly after infection, and with ſo little complaint or uneaſineſs, that the whole affair has been terminated, purges taken, and the patient returned home perfectly well in a week's time; before others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated at the ſame time, from the ſame patient, and under the ſame circumſtances, have begun to complain. In this caſe the inoculated part ſhews early certain marks of infection, ſometimes on the very next day, or the day after, when the inciſion will often appear conſiderably inflamed and elevated. The patient about this time frequently makes ſome of the following com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, viz. chillineſs, itchings, and ſmall pricking pains in the part, and ſometimes on the ſhoulder, gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, drowſineſs, and a ſlight head-ach, ſometimes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a feveriſh heat, but often without any: the account they themſelves give of their feelings, is in ſome as if they had drank too much, and in others as if they had caught a cold. Theſe complaints ſeldom laſt 24 hours, often not ſo long, and with frequent remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and never, that I remember, riſe to a degree that requires confinement. The inflammation on the arm at the time of the complaints advances apace, and feels
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012028_0024_0F89436C68E1ED58"/>
hard to the touch; but upon their wearing off, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed appearances gradually leſſen, and the part dries to a common ſmall ſcab; the ſkin that was before red, turns livid, and the party is quite well, and nothing more heard of the diſtemper <note n="*" place="bottom">See caſe 1—12.</note>. In ſome inſtances theſe ſymptoms attack much later, even on the 7th or 8th day, when an eruption might be expected in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of them, yet none appears; but the arm gets well very ſoon, and the diſeaſe is at an end.</p>
               <p>In this irregular ſort of the diſorder there have how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever been ſome examples where a few eruptions have appeared, and probably in conſequence of the inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet the puſtules have not looked like the true pocks, nor maturated like them, nor laſted longer than three days; about which time they, for the moſt part, have dried away.</p>
               <p>As I find it difficult to deſcribe the variety and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of ſymptoms that occur in this ſhort way of having the diſtemper, I will give ſome caſes, by way of illuſtrating the matter more to the reader's ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>When ſubjects of this ſort firſt occurred in my practice, I was in doubt whether they were quite ſecure from any future attacks of the diſtemper; and in order to try whether they were ſo or not, I inoculated them a ſecond time, and cauſed them to aſſociate with perſons in every ſtage of the diſeaſe, and to try all other means of catching the infection; and this method has been practiſed with the generality of ſuch patients ever ſince; yet without a ſingle inſtance of its producing any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; ſo that I now make no ſcruple of pronouncing them perfectly ſafe: and experience has enabled me for the moſt part to foretell, in two or three days after the operation, when the diſeaſe will paſs in this ſlight manner.</p>
               <p>Upon the ſecond inoculation, however, the inciſed parts are commonly inflamed for a day or two, juſt in the ſame manner as I have, in numerous inſtances, found them to be as well in thoſe, who, though cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012028_0025_0F89436D679312B0"/>
of having had the ſmall-pox in the natural way, have ſubmitted to be inoculated merely for the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's ſake, that the reſult might be obſerved; as in others, who, being doubtful whether they have had it or not, have been inoculated in order to be ſatisfied. But in all ſuch caſes the parts ſoon became well, nor did any of thoſe appearances which have been deſcribed as the conſtant attendants of inoculation, as pain in the head, giddineſs, marks of infection in the arm, &amp;c. enſue; nor can they ever be produced upon a perſon who has had the ſmall-pox before, either in the natural way or by inoculation.</p>
               <p>And therefore it cannot with reaſon be ſuggeſted that the patients, whom I ſuppoſe to get through the diſeaſe in the very ſlight manner above deſcribed, may poſſibly have had the ſmall-pox unobſerved in ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of their lives.</p>
               <p>Another and leſs favourable appearance to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned under this head, is when the inoculated part, though ſhewing certain ſigns of infection, yet the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colouration round it, inſtead of being florid, is of a pale hue, remains flat, and is very little elevated. This does not promiſe kindly; and therefore I give the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terative pill more frequently; and if it fails to operate by ſtool, I add a laxative.</p>
               <p>By theſe means the advancement of the diſeaſe is uſually forwarded, which I am always pleaſed to ſee, and promote as much as poſſible; for I have conſtantly remarked, that an early ſeizure is one of the beſt ſigns that the whole progreſs will be mild and favourable; and, on the contrary, where it is late, the ſymptoms are often irregular and troubleſome.</p>
               <p>Another irregularity deſerving notice here is, that ſometimes, upon the abatement of the fever and other ſymptoms, after the appearance of ſeveral puſtules, and when the eruptive ſtage of the diſeaſe ſeems completed, it nevertheleſs happens that freſh eruptions come out, and continue doing ſo daily, for 4, 5, or even 6 days ſucceſſively; preceded ſometimes by a ſlight pain in the head, though more frequently they appear without any
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012028_0026_0F89436F0ECC9AD0"/>
new diſturbance. Theſe are generally few in number, ſhort-lived, and ſeldom come to maturity. But I have ſeen four caſes, in each of which, after a ceſſation of complaints, and an appearance of few puſtules, the eruptive ſtage of the diſeaſe was thought to be over; yet in two or three days a freſh fit of fever has attacked the patients, and after a ſhort illneſs a quantity of new puſtules has broke out, far exceeding the firſt number; and theſe remained, and maturated completely. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this kind may be found among the caſes annexed.</p>
               <p>Some of my own patients, and, as I am credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, of other inoculators in this way, have had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable eruptions of this kind after they returned home; which have probably given occaſion for the reports of ſeveral having had the diſeaſe again in the natural way after inoculation. But that theſe reports are ill grounded, will appear from this obſervation, to wit, that in all the caſes of this ſort which have occurred in my own practice, or, as far as I can learn, in that of others, the ſecond or latter crop of puſtules has always happened within the time uſually allowed for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the ſmall-pox from inoculation, and before the inflammation on the arm has ceaſed, and ſooner than they could be ſuppoſed to be produced by infection taken in the natural way; and whenever it has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, it has been to perſons in whom, after a ſlight eruption, and abatement of ſymptoms, the diſeaſe has prematurely been judged to be quite over, and have therefore been permitted to return to their families.</p>
               <p>It will doubtleſs be aſked, how caſes of this kind ſhould ever happen among thoſe who return home as cured? to which I anſwer, that it is no unuſual thing for induſtrious men, after a ſlight eruption, and ceſſation of all complai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>, to aſk leave to return home to their occupations and families; and where it has been thought that no danger would accrue to others, their requeſt has been often granted; for the phyſician no more than the patient can foreſee, when theſe accidents ſhall follow; but it may be obſerved here, that in all theſe caſes of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012028_0027_0F89436F6A08A690"/>
my own knowledge, very repellent methods have been uſed in the beginning, and a more generous diet, or greater exerciſe afterwards, has ſeemed to contribute to this ſecondary eruption.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude this chapter, it may be proper to obſerve, that inoculated patients, in ſome ſtage or other of the diſeaſe, may poſſibly be attacked with diſeaſes altogether independant of the ſmall-pox. Such, for inſtance, as may ariſe from worms, or be the epidemick of the ſeaſon; or ſuch as the patient may by conſtitution be ſubject to; and ſome caſes of this ſort will be found among thoſe annexed.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Shall now conſider the conſequences that follow this very cool and repelling method, and how far the patient's future ſtate of health may be affected by a practice ſo new, and oppoſite to all eſtabliſhed theory.</p>
               <p>I need not ſay how much it has been thought right, in moſt or all eruptive complaints, eſpecially in the ſmall-pox, to forward by every gentle means the efforts of nature in producing an eruption; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, how dangerous to check it, either by cold air, cold drink, or any conſiderable evacuations; or that the uſe of warm diluents therefore, and the lying in bed, eſpecially if the fever and ſymptoms run high, or at leaſt confining to the houſe, have been generally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and recommended for the purpoſe. But when a practice ſo foreign to this, and almoſt totally different, is inculcated, it is no wonder if mens minds are alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thoſe evils expected that were ſuppoſed to be the unavoidable conſequences of it.</p>
               <p>Experience, however, and inſtances of ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ſucceeding by this method, without any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able bad effects from it, either immediate or remote, are irreſiſtible arguments for its ſupport and juſtification, and the beſt proof of its utility and ſafety. I have ſaid, without any conſiderable bad effects, for in reality I have ſeen none that deſerve that name, if compared
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012028_0028_0F8943702965CB28"/>
with what ſometimes follow the natural ſmall-pox, or frequently happen after the old method of inoculation.</p>
               <p>Every one who has had any ſhare in this practice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common or old methods, will allow, that after paſſing through the diſeaſe in a very favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner, their patients (children eſpecially) were frequently liable to abſceſſes in the axilla and other parts, tedious ophthalmies, and troubleſome ulcerations in the place of inſertion, which, though they could not be foreſeen or prevented, yet frequently gave more pain and vexation to the patients, and trouble to the operator, than the diſeaſe itſelf had done: whereas on inquiry into the fate of thoſe who have been treated in the cool way or this new method, I can ſay that in more than 1500 there has been only one who has had ſo much as a boil in the axilla, and that was in a child who had an iſſue in the ſame arm, and which was at that time dried up; and I have only ſeen two very ſmall ſuperficial boils in others near the place of inſertion; and theſe ſeemed rather to be occaſioned by an irritation from the diſcharge, than from any other cauſe, and were all ſoon healed with very little trouble.</p>
               <p>In a few inſtances alſo there has been a ſlough in the inciſed part, which has made a ſore of ſhort duration, but not one inſtance of an ulcer of any continuance. Such little breakings out too and ſcabs, as are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to ſucceed the mild natural ſmall-pox, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, though rarely, happen to thoſe inoculated this way, and as they are of the ſame little conſequence, are generally cured by the ſame method of a few gentle purges.</p>
               <p>With regard to ophthalmies from this kind of practice, I have never had an example of one truly deſerving that name; the coats of the eye have been a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed in a very few, but they ſoon became clear without any means uſed for that purpoſe. And I know but two caſes where I thought the inflammation great enough to require bleeding, and not one where a bliſter was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. So that theſe complaints, heretofore ſo frequent and grievous, ſeem by this new method to be much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced:
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012028_0029_0F894370EA8E12D0"/>
a circumſtance, which, if it does not amount to a proof, admits at leaſt of a fair conjecture, that the ſtate of health is better here, than where thoſe remains of putridity are ſo evidently exiſting in the habit.</p>
               <p>Diſcoveries in phyſic, as in every other ſcience, are in their infancy liable to cenſure and oppoſition; and to one of ſo extraordinary a kind as the preſent ſyſtem of inoculation, it would not be ſtrange if a greater portion of both than uſual ſhould fall to its ſhare; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, ſince no charge of fatality during the diſeaſe, nor inſtances of bad effects ſoon after the recovery, can be produced, recourſe has been had to other meaſures to calumniate and diſcredit the practice. It would be tedious to enter into a detail of the many falſe and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous reports that have been ſpread againſt it. In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral the conſtitution is ſaid to be injured, and the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects are to appear at ſome diſtant period, but at what time, or what kind of diſeaſe, nobody pretends to determine. To theſe general accuſations it cannot be expected I ſhould give other than a general anſwer; which is, that from the ſtricteſt obſervation and inquiry I have been able to make, thoſe who have been ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated in this way, have continued to enjoy as good a ſtate of health as their neighbours; nay, many of them have thought their conſtitution better after the proceſs than before.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems as if theſe oppoſers expected that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculation ſhould not only free the inoculated from the ſmall-pox, and any early bad effects, but muſt preſerve them too from all other diſorders through the reſt of their lives. To ſuch I can ſay nothing; but if others who are more reaſonable, require further ſatisfaction as to the conſequences of this method, I muſt deſire them to make inquiry of thoſe who have been inoculated under my direction.</p>
               <p>Another charge againſt this method of inoculation is, that ſome have had the diſtemper afterwards in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural way. What I have ſaid under the head of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malous ſmall-pox, will, I believe, ſufficiently account for the appearances which have occaſioned theſe falſe
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012028_0030_0F894371AE6BF110"/>
reports; and if that does not ſatisfy, I can only add this poſitive declaration, that nothing of the kind has ever happened to any patient inoculated by me; and I firmly believe, no one has ever had, or can have, the diſtemper a ſecond time, either in the natural way, or from inoculation.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE very great relief which perſons under in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculation experience from freſh air, cold water, and evacuations by ſtool, during the fever preceding eruption, ſoon determined me to make trial, how far the like treatment might be uſeful to thoſe who might be ſeized with the ſmall-pox in the natural way; more eſpecially in ſuch caſes, where from the violence of the ſymptoms, a confluent kind was juſtly to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</p>
               <p>But opportunities of making experiments of this ſort in a ſatisfactory manner are rare. Firſt becauſe a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, or even medical aſſiſtance of any kind, is not often called in till the eruption ſhews itſelf, when it is too late to expect all the good effects that might be hoped for from an earlier trial of this method; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe the firſt attack of the ſmall-pox is ſo much like the beginning of ſome other fevers as not eaſily to be diſtinguiſhed; though a diligent attention to the ſymptoms will generally, if we are called in time, enable us to form a pretty certain prognoſtic. For if the attack of the cold fit be pretty ſevere, and the ſubſequent fever unuſually high; if a nauſea and vomiting ſucceed, together with great pains in the head, back and loins, eſpecially the laſt; if a delirium, great reſtleſſneſs, diſagreeable taſte in the mouth, and a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar fetid ſmell in the breath, or even if ſeveral of theſe ſymptoms are obſerved, the ſmall-pox may with great reaſon be expected; and if upon enquiry, which ſhould always be made, it appears that the patient has
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012028_0031_0F8943726E5E1248"/>
been in the way of infection, there will be little reaſon to doubt of it.</p>
               <p>It may be objected, that notwithſtanding the cloſeſt attention and enquiry, ſymptoms of the like nature may precede fevers of other kinds; to which I anſwer, that ſome ſuch caſes, though few, have happened, and the treatment I am about to recommend, has been practiſed not only without prejudice to the patient, but manifeſtly to his benefit.</p>
               <p>But waving for the preſent all conſiderations reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the treatment of fevers in general, I ſhall only relate what has occurred to me in reſpect to the natural ſmall-pox.</p>
               <p>In ſeveral inſtances where I have been concerned, and where the ſymptoms and other concurring circumſtances induced me to think the ſmall-pox was at hand, I have directed the like management as I recommend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated patients.</p>
               <p>I have been called alſo to others at the time of erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where ſome puſtules having already appeared, made the matter clear; and in every caſe of this kind, I have endeavoured to get the ſick perſon into the open air, have generally given the mercurial and antimonial pill, and directed a laxative to be taken ſome hours after it, in order to procure three or four ſtools; and this method I have more particularly enjoined, and ſometimes repeated where the kind has appeared to be bad, and where little or no relief has been found from the partial eruption, the ſymptoms continuing to be ſuch as por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended great danger. I have followed the ſame method during every part of the eruptive fever, intending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to abate its violence, to check the eruption, and prevent the conflux, and conſequently the danger.</p>
               <p>The ſucceſs attending this practice has hitherto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded my expectations, though it muſt be confeſſed, that as the ſymptoms run much higher in the natural, than they are found to do in the inoculated diſeaſe, the relief has not been ſo conſiderable; and I have found it extremely difficult to perſuade ſuch whoſe complaints have been very ſevere, to quit their beds, and attempt
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012028_0032_0F89437416B45CD8"/>
to go abroad; indeed the exceeding feeble ſtate they are ſometimes in, ſufficiently ſhews that great reſolution is requiſite to put this in practice.</p>
               <p>Among thoſe who have been treated in this manner under my own care and inſpection, not one has died, and the number amounts to about 40. Some of the moſt remarkable caſes will be ſubjoined, which will more ſatisfactorily explain the practice, and demonſtrate its ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>The immediate ſenſible effects of going into the open air, are a very great abatement of heat upon the whole ſurface of the ſkin, which, tho' but juſt before intenſely hot, generally in a ſhort time feels not much warmer than that of a perſon in health. The pulſe from being very ſtrong, full and quick, becomes leſs hard and full, but continues quick; and I have ſometimes obſerved it to intermit; which, however alarming it may ſeem, is not a dangerous ſymptom.</p>
               <p>The pain in the head is always relieved, but that in the back and loins does not abate in proportion; and altho' it coſts no little pain and trouble to perſiſt in moving abroad under ſuch circumſtances, attended for the moſt part with great laſſitude, yet the patients are ſenſible of the benefits they receive, and entertaining a good opinion of the uſefulneſs of the practice, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly behave with great reſolution, and, what is very encouraging, in general think themſelves ſtronger.</p>
               <p>Upon going within doors to reſt themſelves, the pain in the head grows worſe, but is again relieved ſo ſoon as they return into the air.</p>
               <p>The effects of the medicines are uſually theſe;</p>
               <p>If there has been much ſickneſs at ſtomach, a vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frequently happens ſoon after the pill: this the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients ſhould promote by drinking plentifully of ſome warm diluents; and till the fatigue occaſioned by it is over, they certainly ought not to go abroad.</p>
               <p>By this operation, and the ſtools which ſucceed, the feveriſh and internal heat, thirſt, ſickneſs and pains, are for the moſt part conſiderably abated. The patients commonly complain of being very low and faint after
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012028_0033_0F894374AB8F65D0"/>
theſe evacuations; but the moſt urgent ſymptoms being alleviated thereby, a diſpoſition to receive nouriſhment hourly increaſes. They are then allowed to drink thin mutten or chicken broth, milk pottage or tea, as the moſt grateful and refreſhing cordial ſuſtenance they can take; ſleep likewiſe now moſt commonly comes on ſpontaneouſly. But they are only permitted to enjoy this refreſhment by day upon the bed, for I always diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them from going into it till night.</p>
               <p>From the foregoing account it appears, that the fever preceding eruption, and the moſt grievous ſymptoms accompanying it, may often be greatly mitigated by this practice; and I will here add, that the eruption is moſt certainly retarded, that is, it does not appear ſo ſoon after the attack of the diſeaſe, nor come out ſo precipitately when it has begun to appear, as it ſeemed likely to have done if the natural progreſs had not been interrupted; an effect, which, however dangerous it may have been thought, may be done with the utmoſt ſafety, and clearly ſhews the utility of the practice; for it is evident from experience, that the later the eruption ſhews itſelf after the beginning of the diſeaſe, and the ſlower it comes out, the more mild and favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is the ſubſequent diſorder. And I am of opinion, that the eruption is not only retarded and protracted by this method, but likewiſe that it is in ſome degree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, having had ſtrong reaſons to apprehend in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral inſtances, that the number of puſtules which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at firſt, were by ſuch repreſſion actually dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and thoſe that remained ſeemed larger and of a milder kind.</p>
               <p>What has hitherto been ſaid on the ſubject, relates only to the diſeaſe in its eruptive ſtate, which is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very intereſting period; but that which follows, is not leſs ſo, tho' not always attended to ſo much as it deſerves; for when the eruption is compleated, the ſymptoms abate, the patients ſeem relieved, and often to ſuch a degree, that both they and their attendants flatter themſelves with hopes of a happy event, and think, it unneceſſary to apply for any medical aſſiſtance;
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:012028_0034_0F8943756F339A58"/>
yet with all theſe hopeful appearances, the number and kind of the ſmall-pox are frequently ſuch, as would make a judicious practitioner apprehenſive of much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the ſubſequent ſtages.</p>
               <p>And where the practitioners themſelves may ſee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt of the event, yet few or none of them have attempted, I believe, to do much towards preventing the danger; for unleſs ſome preſſing ſymptoms call for immediate relief, it is the general practice to wait till maturation comes on, and brings with it ſuch a train of dreadful complaints, as are more than enough to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, and too often baffle the beſt abilities.</p>
               <p>In this neglected interval, from the eruption being compleated, to the acceſſion of the fever of maturation, and its concomitants (an interval which in point of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is very different in different conſtitutions and kinds of ſmall-pox) I will venture in general to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the ſame mercurial antimonial medicine as was preſcribed in the eruptive fever, to be repeated at pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per intervals, till the maturation advances, at which time it muſt certainly be diſcontinued: and theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances can be regulated only by thoſe who attend according to the urgency of the ſymptoms, and the ſtrength of the patients: A cupful of the following apozem ſhould, if neceſſary, be now and then taken after the mercurial medicine, often enough to procure 3 or 4 ſtools a day, eſpecially if the patient is coſtive.</p>
               <p>Take cream of tartar two drachms; of manna one ounce; diſſolve them in one quart of barley water, or the pectoral drink.</p>
               <p>How far it may be ſafe or adviſeable for the patients to venture out into the open air during this ſtage of the diſeaſe, I will not yet pretend to ſay, but they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be both refreſhed and invigorated, by being kept out of bed as much as they can bear, without being over-fatigued; and by freſh air let in ſometimes through an open window: as the violence of the eruptive fever with its attendant complaints muſt neceſſarily exhauſt the ſtrength and ſpirits, both ſhould in this interval be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited, by as much proper nouriſhment (ſuch as has been
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:012028_0035_0F8943762AB3A018"/>
mentioned in the former part of this chapter) as can be taken down without offending the ſtomach, and alſo, if occaſion requires, with medicines of a cordial and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne quality; for this is the time to recover as much ſtrength as poſſible, in order to be better able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter and bear the pain and fever, which will moſt certainly happen, as the ſtate of maturation advances.</p>
               <p>Medicines, except what have been already mentioned, ſeem at this time unneceſſary, and they would interfere with and prevent the true reliſh for food.</p>
               <p>But for the beſt method of treating the ſmall-pox in its moſt dangerous ſtage, I mean that of maturation, I muſt refer to the ſeveral learned and eminent practition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who have profeſſedly written upon the ſubject, whoſe opinions and practice I neither pretend to correct or amend. I ſhall however take the liberty to recommend one medicine to be uſed in that ſtage of the diſeaſe, which I have found to abate heat, and allay thirſt, in ſuch a manner as to afford a very pleaſing refreſhment.</p>
               <p>Take of the weak ſpirit of vitriol one part, of the ſweet ſpirit of vitriol two parts; mix. Of this the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of half an ounce may be added to a quart, or perhaps three pints of barley water, or the pectoral drink, or any other diluent, and to be drank of at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>I have at preſent nothing farther to recommend; but what has been ſaid will, I preſume, be ſufficient with the caſes annexed (in which the method will be more plainly deſcribed) to juſtify further trials of the cooling, repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and evacuating practice in the beginning at leaſt of the natural ſmall-pox, till the eruption is compleated, eſpecially where the phyſician has an opportunity of making the trial before the eruption appears, and can be pretty certain, or has good reaſon to conclude, that his patient's diſorder is variolous, and the more violent the ſymptoms are in this ſtage of the diſeaſe, the more we ſhall be induced to employ the means which have been attended with ſo much ſucceſs, in the ſame ſtage of the diſeaſe after inoculation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:012028_0036_0F894376E998FCA0"/>But it may be aſked, if I was called to a patient in a bad confluent ſmall-pox, and finding the eruption compleated, whether in ſuch a caſe I ſhould venture to give and continue the uſe of the alterative and purgative medicine, and adviſe the patient to go out, if he can bear it, into the open air, in cold weather, or direct air to be let in thro' a window, even while the mercurial purge may be operating?</p>
               <p>Before I give a direct anſwer to this queſtion, let me firſt aſk the moſt experienced practitioner, whether he knows any method of cure, which may in bad caſes be ſafely relied on, to avert the impending danger, and ſave his patients? The too well known fatality of all kinds of ſmall-pox, very clearly proves that he does not, and that no ſuch method has been yet diſcovered. And if this be the caſe, ſurely, a bold, and even ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous practice is very juſtifiable in any ſuch unhappy patients, who lie as it were under ſentence of a cruel death, not to be prevented by what are called the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and uſual methods. But ſtill it may be urged, that no impending danger, however great, can ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently juſtify the trial of any hazardous experiment, unleſs we can have recourſe to reaſon founded on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: happy, indeed, it is, when we have theſe two guides before us; but when they are ſeparated, the latter is certainly moſt to be relied on, and her I have endeavoured hitherto to follow.</p>
               <p>For in the practice of inoculation experience has taught me, that after as well as before the eruption, perſons may ſafely take mercurial purges, and go out during their operation (though I never adviſed any to do ſo) into the cold air, in inclement weather, without ſuffering the leaſt harm or ſubſequent ill conſequence from it. And by this experience I was led, tho' with great caution, to try, whether the ſame practice might not be ſafely employed in the cure of the natural ſmall-pox, as well as the inoculated; nor have the trials been unſucceſsful; for though among the patients I have treated in this manner, ſome had confluent ſorts, yet were the complaints unuſually moderate throughout the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012028_0037_0F894377A993C0C8"/>
whole progreſs of the diſeaſe, and the maturation was compleated without ſuch troubleſome and alarming ſymptoms and events as might be expected under any other known method of treatment, nor did any ſecondary fever enſue.</p>
               <p>I would not however be underſtood to entertain ſo good an opinion of this method, as to inſinuate that it will ſave all who have the bad confluent kind; too many of theſe are for the moſt part incurable; but I am not without hopes, that it may give a chance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, hitherto untried of, to many; and even if this alterative and evacuating courſe in the early part of the diſeaſe ſhould not ſucceed, ſo as to avert the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing danger, I think there is great reaſon to ſuppoſe that nouriſhment, cordials and opiates, which may be wanted in the ſtate of maturation, will be adminiſtered with more advantage and ſecurity after it, than if that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod had not been previouſly taken.</p>
               <p>It ſeems neceſſary however to declare, that nothing which has been ſaid, is meant to relate to practice in the bleeding or purple ſmall-pox; though very cold repellent methods may perhaps deſerve to be tried in theſe hitherto fatal caſes, provided it can be done early; but the mercurial evacuating courſe ſeems quite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, what has been ſaid on the natural ſmall-pox, muſt wait the award of time and experience, the only teſts of the utility of any practice; for I have lived long enough to have ſeen ſeveral inſtances where very ingenious and well meaning men have been greatly miſtaken, by relying too much on the firſt impreſſions made by a few ſucceſsful experiments.</p>

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>BEFORE I diſmiſs the ſubject, it may not be improper to give ſome account of the motives that induced me to adopt this method.</p>
               <p>During the courſe of many years practice of inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating in the former uſual method, I generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to writing the moſt remarkable occurrences, to have recourſe to. Among theſe, I recorded ſome caſes, which proved that thoſe who had ſuffered moſt, were, in general, ſuch as had been kept warm, and nurſed with the greateſt tenderneſs and care. Theſe facts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed me to think favourably of a cooler manner of treating the diſeaſe, and made me attentive to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, of ſuch a method having been practiſed in ſome parts of this country with great ſucceſs, tho' too extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant at firſt to deſerve credit.</p>
               <p>The reports however of this practice ſtill gained ground; and, upon the ſtricteſt enquiry, I found they were for the moſt part true, and that ſuch who were treated in this way, paſſed thro' the diſtemper in a more favourable manner, than my own patients, or thoſe of the moſt able practitioners in the old method of inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; alſo, that the inoculators in this new way en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined a ſtricter regimen, as to diet, than I had hitherto thought neceſſary; and that they frequently brought their uninfected patients into the preſence of thoſe who had the diſeaſe, and inoculated them immediately with fluid matter, taken on the point of a lancet, and by a very ſlight puncture or inciſion, applying no dreſſing or covering afterwards.</p>
               <p>This way of performing the operation pleaſed me as far as related to the ſlightneſs of the inciſion, and the uſe of freſh matter, for I had (in common with other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculators) ſometimes failed of infecting, by uſing a thread that had been kept too long in a phial; but the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012028_0039_0F8943792A80D818"/>
circumſtance of bringing the perſon to be inoculated into the preſence of one who had the ſmall-pox, ſeemed hazardous, leſt there might be an accumulation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>All doubts, however, were at laſt removed by the authenticated accounts that I received of theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and of the good ſucceſs that attended the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and I began to try it in January 1765; when, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having directed a ſtrict regimen and ſome mercurial purges, I inoculated with fluid matter, proceeding with much circumſpection and attention; my patients being expoſed to the open air in that cold ſeaſon. The great advantage they received from this treatment, was ſoon apparent, and more than ſufficient to encourage my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in the practice, till repeated experiments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to think, that inſtead of ſuppoſing the fever in the ſmall-pox to be the inſtrument employed by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſubdue and expel the variolous poiſon, we ſhould rather conſider it as her greateſt enemy, which, if not vigorouſly reſtrained, is apt to produce much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt and danger; and that all ſuch means ſhould be uſed as are moſt likely to controul its violence, and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the too great fervor of the blood. Purſuant to this opinion, beſides keeping my patients in the open air, which I had learnt from others, I firſt directed the mercurial and antimonial medicine, and the laxative courſe in the eruptive ſtate; the manner of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring which, and the ſucceſs attending, has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready related.</p>
               <p>It may perhaps appear ſingular, that bleeding has neither been once mentioned or directed in the courſe of this work, tho' by general conſent it is allowed to be the moſt efficacious remedy in all inflammatory caſes. To this I can only reply, that the regimen and medicines above preſcribed commonly reduce the patient ſo much as to render bleeding unneceſſary. And in the natural ſmall-pox it ſeemed moſt reaſonable to adhere as ſtrictly as poſſible to thoſe meaſures which had contributed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently ſo much towards paſſing ſo eaſily through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculation. I doubt not, however, that caſes will ariſe
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:012028_0040_0F894379EA7CD0D8"/>
in which bleeding may not only be ſafe, but extremely ſalutary.</p>
               <p>It will probably be needleſs to acquaint the reader, that I have diſcloſed the whole of what I know with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty relative to this proceſs, the regimen, the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, the different types of the diſeaſe, the rules of prognoſtick, and various events. And I believe, if the method now recommended is carefully purſued, it will be found to anſwer with a ſucceſs, at leaſt, equal to any yet diſcovered. Nevertheleſs it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that further experience may produce ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements; yet when it is conſidered how ſhort a time is required for preparation, how few medicines are to be taken, thoſe medicines neither nauſeous in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor violent in their operation, of a kind likely to be beneficial to moſt conſtitutions, and hurtful to none, unleſs injudiciouſly adminiſtered; that the diſeaſe is uſually ſo mild as to require little or no confinement, the complaints of far the greater number being, that they have too little of the diſtemper, and that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable conſequences which ſometimes happened after the former method of inoculation, are likewiſe by this moſt commonly obviated; I do not ſee, that much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration can be even wiſhed for. That which appears moſt likely to be made, is in ſhortening the time of preparation; for as I have often been obliged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculate without any, and have always had the ſame ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, it has inclined me to think, that much, if not the whole, of this proceſs may be diſpenſed with (except in very full habits, or where other particular circumſtances may require it): But in all theſe caſes, from the inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter to the time of the eruptive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, the patients have been kept to a cloſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of diet, and the uſe of the preparatory medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines proportioned as well as I could to their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For I durſt not, by way of experiment, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with the uſe of meaſures that had been hitherto ſo ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>Should it be aſked then, To what particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the ſucceſs is owing? I can only anſwer, that,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:012028_0041_0F89437AAA99CEB8"/>
although the whole proceſs may have ſome ſhare in it, in my opinion it conſiſts chiefly in the method of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculating with recent fluid matter, and in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the patients at the time of eruption. If theſe conjectures ſhould be true, perhaps we ſhall be found to have improved but little upon the judicious Syden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's cool method of treating the diſeaſe, and the old Greek woman's method of inoculating with fluid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter carried warm in her ſervant's boſom.</p>

               <p>On the 12th and 13th he complained of pains in his head and limbs, as alſo of ſtiffneſs under his arms, which I eſteem one of the moſt certain proofs of the infection having taken place. There was no alteration in the pulſe, nor any other ſign of a fever; a few pimples about the neck and arms followed theſe complaints, yet not ſuch as I ſhould have eſteemed variolous on any other occaſion; for ſome ſoon diſappeared, and others, which remained long enough to have a little matter formed in them, proceeded to this ſtate with great irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity.</p>
               <p>He was inoculated again, but without the leaſt effect.</p>

               <p>A man between 50 and 60 was inoculated about four in the afternoon: On the morning of the third day after the inoculation I firſt ſaw his arms, when they ſhewed uncommon ſigns of infection, being already much inflamed; and upon inquiry, I received from him the following account: That on the ſame evening he was inoculated, he felt an uneaſineſs and numbneſs at and near the place of inſertion; and that the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:012028_0046_0F89437F298F30D0"/>
theſe complaints increaſed, and ſpread up to the ſhoulder of one arm, which was very ſtiff and numbed; that the inciſion had itched ſeveral times, and his arms felt as if he had been bruiſed by a blow with a very large ſtick. And on the preceding evening, which was the ſecond from the inoculation, his head had been giddy and in pain, accompanied with ſome chilly fits; but all theſe ſenſations went off without any other illneſs. He had reſted well, and never thought himſelf in better health.</p>
               <p>From this time I ſaw him at different times every day, and he continued in perfect health; only ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, eſpecially towards evening, he ſaid he felt as if he had drank too much. The arms were much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, but on the 6th and 7th day they altered their colour to a darker hue, and the inflammation and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were evidently abating. He now deſired to go a journey of about 20 miles on buſineſs; and this I conſented to, from an abſolute confidence that he was ſecure from any alarming attack; having firſt enjoined him not to go into company where he might riſque ſpreading the infection; for his breath at this time had that peculiar offenſive ſmell which accompanies the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>He returned the following day, being the 8th, in the afternoon, making no complaint but of hunger; yet ſaid his head had aked the preceding night after his journey. His arms were now rather more inflamed, which I attributed to the friction they might have in the chaiſe; but from this time all complaints of every kind ceaſed. His arms ſoon became quite well; he took his firſt purge on the following day, a ſecond on the 11th, and returned home on the 13th from the inoculation, without having a ſingle eruption of any kind.</p>
               <p>It is remarkable in this gentleman's caſe, that bring ſo well, he did not chuſe to live with thoſe who had the diſtemper, but continued in a lodging with his wife, who accompanied him by way of nurſe, upon full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of having had the ſmall-pox many years ſince.

On the 10th a true eryſipelatous ſwelling attacked one arm, and extended from the ſhoulder to the elbow, the other was alſo affected in the like manner, but not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably.

               <p>What I diſtinguiſh by the name of raſh, were pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples much reſembling the confluent pocks, and riſing above the ſkin; the petechial ſpots were interſperſed, and even with the ſkin; ſome of theſe were ſmall like flea-bites, others were near as large as a ſilver penny; ſome were of a very dark purple, and others of a livid colour. I obſerved them carefully, aſſiſted by a good convex glaſs, and found the appearances ſingular and alarming. But as the fever was not high in proportion to ſuch appearances, the head and back free from pain,

and no great weakneſs attended, the event ſeemed to be the leſs doubtful.

               <p>This operated moderately by vomit, diſcharging ſome bile, and alſo twice by ſtool.

What made the caſe more doubtful was, that the fever ſtill remained pretty high; and her head and back were not much relieved by this eruption. In this ſituation I did not think it adviſeable to expoſe the patient to the open air, but directed only a ſaline mixture, with compound powder of crabs claws, and that ſhe ſhould keep her room, but not her bed.</p>

               <p n="11">11th. The blood was ſtill found ſizy, and the fever, cough, difficulty of reſpiration and expectoration, were increaſed. The progreſs of infection in the arm was ſlow, but ſhewed, however, that the eruptive fever would ſoon come on; and I was apprehenſive that it would be ſo confounded with the peripneumonic diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as to cauſe much perplexity. I determined never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs to attempt to relieve the latter by whatever means I could, and wait the event; and therefore ordered more blood to be taken, a bliſtering plaiſter to be applied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſhoulders, and a ſmall quantity of gum am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacum to be added to his pectoral medicines. In the evening I was informed that all the troubleſome ſymptoms were conſiderably abated.</p>
               <p>It muſt here be noted, that all the company, who had been inoculated at the ſame time, were now ill, and moſt of them had ſome eruptions.</p>
               <p n="12">12th. He had had more reſt; but though moſt of his complaints were relieved, yet the fever ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and he expectorated with difficulty ſome very dark-brown phlegm, ſo that no alteration was made in his medicines.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="unknown:012028_0056_0F894386B1AB7828"/>The appearance on the inciſion ſpread, but did not look as is uſual when the eruptive complaints are begun.</p>
               <p n="13">13th. The fever, pain in the ſide, cough, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of expectoration, being again increaſed, I ordered a veſicatory to the ſide, and ſome oxymel of ſquills in a pectoral mixture.</p>
               <p n="14">14th. The fever and pain of the ſide were abated, and he had obtained ſome little ſleep, which was how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever much diſturbed by ſudden <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The ſkin at the inciſions had an unuſual appearance, not eaſily to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; and inſtead of being inflamed, as it uſually is, where the progreſs of the infection is favourable, and not interrupted by ſome extraordinary accident, it was of a pale hue.</p>
               <p n="15">15th. He had reſted ill, and the cough was ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, that I ordered more blood to be taken, and the medicines to be continued. The inciſions this day looked like puſtules irregularly ſhaped, and a fluid ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared under the cuticle.</p>
               <p n="16">16th. All ſymptom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="17">17th. All complaints much eaſier; the puſtules at the inciſions were more elevated, and had matter in them; but the others were but little advanced, and looked pale.</p>
               <p n="18">18th. He was in all reſpects ſo much better, that he ventured to ride out on horſeback, and I was releaſed from my attendance; nor did I ſee him afterwards, till he called at my houſe in good health on the 5th of July. But he then informed me, that in the afternoon of the 19th of June<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the day after I took my leave of him, he had been extremely hot and feveriſh; was relieved on the 20th from all feveriſh ſymptoms, and diſcovered a great number of puſtules, which roſe, filled and ripened without any further illneſs; ſo that he did not think it neceſſary to ſend me any notice of them. Looking in his face, I ſaw about thirty marks of ſmall-pox, which confirmed the truth of his report.</p>
               <p>I have alſo ſince received a very ſatisfactory account that many puſtules in his face and other parts, which
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:012028_0057_0F89438768ABC610"/>
came out after the time I ſaw him, ſtayed a proper time, and maturated completely.</p>

               <p>A middle-aged man, on the ſixth day after he had been inoculated, complained of pain in his head and back, and had a ſlight degree of fever. The complaints remained till the 8th, when there appeared ſome erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the face, which I took to be variolous: but it is to be noted, that having lived pretty freely, his face was very red and full of pimples; and neither the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration nor medicines had much altered that appearance; ſo that it was no eaſy matter to diſtinguiſh between thoſe which were habitual to him, and the freſh ones. The arm at this time was very conſiderably inflamed, as is uſual about the time of eruption.</p>
               <p>On the 9th he was perfectly well, and no more erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhewed themſelves.</p>
               <p>Having had ſeveral patients, who undoubtedly paſſed through the diſtemper with no more illneſs than this man had felt, and ſometimes even without any eruption, I really thought that the affair was over.</p>
               <p>On the 10th he took a laxative draught, eat a piece of mutton, and drank ſome ale. On the afternoon of the ſame day I found him complaining of a pain in his head, which he thought was occaſioned by his venturing abroad during the operation of the purge. He had now more fever than at any other time before; however, as he averred, that his complaints were ſuch as he uſually felt from a ſlight cold, I did not apprehend any thing more.</p>
               <p>On the 11th in the morning he was ſtill much indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and had reſted ill. In the evening of the ſame day I found him much better, but he ſaid there were more puſtules on his back. Theſe I did not ſee.</p>
               <p>Next morning I found he was gone to a friend's houſe, having left word that he was quite well, and I ſhould hear from him, if there was occaſion.</p>
               <p>On the 14th I was deſired to viſit him, when I found a moderate number of freſh puſtules on the face and limbs, and in ſuch forwardneſs, that I was convinced they had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <p>A gentleman's ſon in perfect health, between four and five years of age, on the third day after inoculation voided a long round worm alive, after having taken on the preceding night a doſe of mercurial phyſic. No ſigns of worms had hitherto been obſerved in him, and he afterwards ſeemed to be quite well, till the ſymptoms which uſually precede the ſmall-pox, came on.</p>
               <p>After a very moderate illneſs, an eruption of about twenty puſtules ſucceeded, and all complaints then ceaſed; ſo that on the 4th day after the eruption, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and was permitted, to diſcontinue my viſits for the preſent I called again however on the 6th day, and found him well as uſual, and at play, the puſtules being then nearly maturated.</p>
               <p>I was informed, however, that in the night of the 4th day he had been hot, feveriſh and reſtleſs; was very well the day following, and hot again at night, but in a leſſer degree; ſo that this ſlight illneſs did not then give the leaſt alarm. But on the 7th day early in the morning I was called up to viſit him as ſoon as poſſible, and was informed, that in the beginning of the night he grew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely hot and delirious, and ſoon became ſtupid, drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy and ſenſeleſs, in which condition I found him, grating his teeth, with convulſive motions about the mouth.</p>
               <p>The puſtules were at this time quite ripe, and looked, as they always had done, extremely well. His pulſe was very quick, though the heat was now moderate, and the reſpiration free and eaſy; but he was ſo comatoſe, as not to be rouſed, even ſo much as to open his eyes by any diſturbance that could be given.</p>
               <p>In this alarming ſituation I deſired the aſſiſtance of the phyſician, who on other occaſions had uſually attended the family. At our conſultation, which ſoon followed, it was agreed, that as the ſmall-pox were very few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, had always looked well, and were now completely maturated, the preſent ſymptoms muſt be occaſioned by worms, or ſome irritating cauſe in the bowels.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="unknown:012028_0059_0F894389A959AD98"/>With this view a doſe of rhubarb and calomel was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preſcribed and exhibited, though we were obliged to open the mouth by force, and this not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome difficulty. The operation of this medicine was accelerated by a clyſter, and a large fetid ſlimy ſtool, followed by ſome ſmaller liquid ones, was procured that afternoon.</p>
               <p>The child, however, ſeemed to be almoſt totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible during this time; nor did he yet appear to be in any reſpect relieved by theſe evacuations: bliſters therefore were ſucceſſively applied to the back, head and legs, and ſinapiſms to the feet; leeches were likewiſe fixed to the temples, and rhubarb with calomel, after ſome little interval, again directed; tin medicines being given between whiles.</p>
               <p>By theſe means, though not till a conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſlimy and extremely offenſive faeces had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, ſome ſigns of amendment appeared. But the child ſtill remained in ſome degree comatoſe till the fifth day from this attack, after which the progreſs of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was very quick, and in two or three days he got quite well, and has ſo continued.</p>

               <head>CASE XX.</head>
               <p>In May 1766, I was deſired to viſit a conſiderable farmer, aged 68, to give my advice for a complaint in his legs.</p>
               <p>About two years before he had been ſeized with a numbneſs and coldneſs in both legs and thighs, which it was apprehended would end in a palſy. For this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order he took many medicines, and both his legs were bliſtered, by which he found relief; but from this time the legs were affected with troubleſome itching and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pains, attended with a ſharp ſerous diſcharge thro' innumerable excoriations. Theſe complaints deſtroyed his reſt, and made him unhappy.</p>
               <p>After relating his caſe, he told me, that, as almoſt every body in his neighbourhood, who had not had the ſmall-pox, was either under inoculation, or preparing for it, he could ſcarcely expect to eſcape the infection, and had therefore a ſtrong deſire to be inoculated, and
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:012028_0060_0F89438A698C3B00"/>
that his wife, of the ſame age with himſelf, was likewiſe deſirous of it.</p>
               <p>This propoſal induced me to examine the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his legs more ſtrictly. They were now, he ſaid, in their beſt ſtate; that is, not ſo full of pain as uſual; they were dry and ſcurfy. His face was likewiſe ſcurfy, and of a ſettled deep red colour; the conſequence, as he told me, of a repeated Eryſipelas in it, and not of any intemperance.</p>
               <p>Upon conſidering the caſe, and reflecting that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory courſe of diet and medicine would probably amend the condition of his legs, I encouraged him to purſue his intention, and both he and his wife, after a fortnight's preparation, were inoculated on the 3d of June.</p>
               <p>On the 9th both made ſome ſlight complaints; and on the 12th the wife grew better, on the appearance of a very few diſtinct puſtules, which maturated afterwards in the moſt favourable manner. But the man ſtill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of pain and wearineſs till the 13th, when he grew eaſier in that reſpect, and felt a ſmarting pain in his legs, which were very red, and had ſeveral puſtules on them. Towards evening they grew more painful, more ſwelled, and a further eruption was diſcernible, though not eaſily to be diſtinguiſhed, by reaſon of their diſeaſed ſtate.</p>
               <p>He ſlept very little this night; but on the 14th I found him free from fever, and pretty well in all reſpects, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the pain in his legs: on which, and under the hams, a great number of diſtinct, but almoſt coherent puſtules appeared. There were ſeveral alſo in the neck and face, but very few on the body or arms. He had all along been adviſed not to ſtir much, but had taken greater li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of walking about than I had allowed of.</p>
               <p n="15">15th. He had not ſlept a minute during the night. I found him up, and walking about the houſe, complaining much of pain, but ſaying that in other reſpects he was well; but he was now rather cool than warm, his pulſe very low, his aſpect languid, the colour of the face in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to livid and pale, and he complained of faintneſs and ſickneſs. I could not avoid being alarmed. The legs alſo were ſwelled conſiderably, but not inflamed.
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:012028_0061_0F89438B298CB030"/>
I therefore ordered him inſtantly to bed; and as the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was great, applied a cataplaſm of bread and milk (being what was neareſt at hand) all over each leg, and directed the following medicine to be taken as ſoon as poſſible.</p>

               <p n="17">17th. After a good night, he found himſelf free from complaints, and from this time every circumſtance went on favourably; the pocks maturated on the 7th day, his legs however were both conſiderably ulcerated for a fortnight after, but then ſoon healed.

               <p>A middle-aged woman was inoculated May 15, 1765. She began to complain on the 23d; the fever and other ſymptoms were very moderate. On the 26th an eruption, diſtinct in kind, ſmall in number, ſhewed itſelf; all the eruptive ſymptoms ceaſed, and ſhe ſeemed perfectly well.</p>
               <p>On the 29th ſhe complained that her throat was ſore, felt ſtiff and ſwelled; but as this is not unuſual, little regard was paid to it.</p>
               <p n="30">30th. She reſted ill, her throat was worſe, and it now gave her great pain to ſwallow. She had alſo been taken with a ſhivering fit, ſucceeded by fever. On inſpecting the throat, I could not perceive one puſtule there, but the uvula and tonſils were very much ſwelled and inflamed. An acidulated gargle was directed, and a lenitive purge, which in the evening had operated thrice; the gargle had been frequently uſed, but the difficulty or ſwallowing was
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:012028_0062_0F89438BEA803408"/>
greatly increaſed, inſomuch that ſhe could get nothing down; the fever too was rather increaſed. Further help could not now be expected from internals; for upon making the trial, liquids returned through the noſe. I directed a bliſter to be applied to the throat, and that ſhe ſhould frequently gargle with warm pectoral drink.</p>
               <p n="31">31ſt. She had not ſlept a minute, being diſturbed whenever ſhe attempted it, with ſuch ſudden ſtartings as made her afraid to ſleep. The feveriſh heat was not very great, the pulſe extremely quick, and all the liquids ſhe attempted to ſwallow, ſtill came through the noſe. She could not lie down in bed, and therefore ſat up in an eaſy chair the greateſt part of the night.</p>
               <p>The puſtules, which in the face did not exceed 20, and very few appeared elſewhere, advanced to matura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion kindly, without receiving the leaſt check from this adventitious illneſs. Her ſpeech was ſo much affected as ſcarce to be underſtood. She informed me, however, that ſhe was ſubject to an illneſs of this kind, and had once narrowly eſcaped with her life, but had never been ſo bad before. I directed 12 ounces of blood to be taken from the arm, and that the ſublingual vein ſhould be pricked. But no relief ſeemed to be derived from any of theſe meaſures; and upon inſpecting the throat again, the glands, uvula and fauces were very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed and diſtended. The tonſils were then lanced pretty deep, and a good deal of blood being diſcharged, the ſwelling of the parts ſubſided, ſo as to admit her to ſwallow, though with difficulty, a little pectoral drink, and afterwards a few ſpoonfuls of milk pottage.</p>
               <p>June 1ſt, ſhe had reſted but very little, though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding drowſy, and worn out for want of ſleep; for the ſudden ſtartings, upon cloſing her eyes, ſtill remained, though not in ſo great a degree as the preceding night; but ſhe had ſwallowed ſome liquids, though with great difficulty. The feveriſh heat was not very great, the pulſe quick and more feeble.</p>
               <p>On inſpecting the throat towards noon, the ſwelling, though ſomewhat abated, was ſtill conſiderable enough to prevent much being ſwallowed.</p>

The puſtules, notwithſtanding this illneſs, advanced very kindly to maturation, and turned on the 7th day from the eruption.</p>

               <p>A healthy middle-aged man, rather of a corpulent habit, was inoculated Feb. 9, 1767, had a ſlight cold fit (on the 5th day incluſive after the operation) which laſted but a very ſhort time, and was not ſucceeded by either fever or complaint of any kind.</p>
               <p>His arms at that time ſhewed certain ſigns of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection having ſucceeded, which continued advancing to the 9th day, when the inflammations about the inciſions appeared conſiderably ſpread, and were ſurrounded with confluent cluſters of very ſmall puſtules. In other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects he was perfectly well, and felt not the leaſt ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or pain in the axilla, or elſewhere, inſomuch that he began to be uneaſy leſt he ſhould have no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſmall-pox.</p>
               <p>On the 10th ſeveral ſmall pimples were to be ſeen on the forehead, which I ſhould have thought ſmall-pox, if he had not at this time been quite well, briſk and hearty, without having felt any previous complaint.</p>
               <p>On the 11th in the morning many more were to be ſeen on the face, limbs and body, ſo that he might be ſaid to be very full. I now examined him again very ſtrictly, and could not find that he had been in the leaſt ill; and on enquiring how he had ſlept, he anſwered, never bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for he went to bed about ten, and did not wake till near ſeven in the morning: the eruption on a cloſe inſpection, had ſuch an appearance as would have made me pronounce it the ſmall-pox of an unfavourable kind, if it had been preceded or attended by any feveriſh or other complaints; but I muſt confeſs, that even at this
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:012028_0064_0F89438D699E28D8"/>
time I ſuppoſed it was only an inoffenſive raſh, as the patient was then, and had been, entirely free from any complaint.</p>
               <p>All this day he continued perfectly well, had walked out of his own accord into the fields, and in the evening aſſerted that he never had been eaſier or better in all his life; though, as he confeſſed to me afterwards, he had been in ſome company, where he ſmoak'd his pipe, and drank his ſhare of a quart of ale. Still the puſtules re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, and increaſed in number, though not in ſize; and nothing but the conſideration of his having had none of the complaints which uſually precede even the ſlighteſt kind of ſmall-pox, kept me in any doubt whether they were the ſmall-pox or not.</p>
               <p>The next morning, being the 12th, the attending nurſe told me, that he had paſſed a very reſtleſs night, with much complaint of pain in his head and back; and I found him very uneaſy, with great heat, a quick pulſe, and very full of a ſmall ſort of ſmall-pox, indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putably.</p>
               <p>Theſe complaints coming on at this unuſual time, made me apprehenſive of the conſequences. I gave him directly calom. gr. iij. tart. emet. gr. ⅛, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to get up and go into the air, but not to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue himſelf too much. I alſo directed, that after two hours he ſhould take a purging draught. [It is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that he had had ſtools every day regularly; and remaining perfectly well, had taken no medicine for ſome time.] I called on him again about two, and found him walking about the houſe, when he ſaid he was better, for that the phyſick had worked him five times very ſufficiently, and each time he had been abroad to the privy, though it rained pretty ſmartly.</p>
               <p>I ſaw him again in the evening, and then he made but little complaint of pain in either head or back, but was almoſt inceſſantly teized with a ſhort tickling cough, and complained of his throat being ſore. He then took another pill of the ſame kind as that in the morning.</p>
               <p>Early the next day, the 13th, the nurſe informed me, that he had been very reſtleſs the whole night, had put on
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:012028_0065_0F89438E29805808"/>
his cloaths and came down ſtairs, but was now gone into bed again, in hopes of getting a little reſt. On going into his room, I found him almoſt dreſſed again, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining that he had an almoſt conſtant irritation in the throat, and finding it impoſſible to get any ſleep, was therefore coming down ſtairs. I enjoined him, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to keep within doors.</p>
               <p>About one I ſaw him again; he had had two ſtools, and was better. His cough remained ſomewhat trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and his throat grew ſore.</p>
               <p>In the evening I found him in good ſpirits, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular quiet pulſe, and he had one more purging ſtool. I ordered another pill of the ſame kind to be taken at going to bed, and a baſon of ſmall white wine whey after it, alſo an oily mixture to be taken occaſionally, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his cough, and the tickling ſenſation in the throat.</p>
               <p>The 14th in the morning he had ſome comfortable reſt, and felt himſelf refreſhed; his cough had been much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo that he had taken but once of the oily mixture. This day he had three ſtools from his pill; and the ſmall-pox had advanced in an unexpected kind manner.</p>
               <p>From this time nothing material happened; the cough left him, and his throat gave him no trouble.</p>
               <p>The puſtules filled with good matter in a ſhorter time than I ever ſaw ſuch a number of ſo ſmall a ſort, and many were brown on the 17th day, being the 7th from the firſt appearance.</p>
               <p>On the 19th he took a purge, and was perfectly well.</p>
               <p>To theſe caſes many others of a ſimilar nature might be added. But by ſeveral unforeſeen delays, not in my power to prevent, I have been obliged to treſpaſs ſo much already on the patience of thoſe who wiſhed to ſee ſome account of this practice, that I ſhall only mention a few, which by a partial or untrue relation might poſſibly be conſtrued to the diſadvantage of inoculation; though, when the particular facts are candidly exhibited, every juſt occaſion of prejudice will undoubtedly be removed.</p>
               <p>During the autumn of the laſt year the chin-cough was epidemick at Hertford, and as the winter approached, the ſmall-pox alſo broke out in many places; and almoſt
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:012028_0066_0F89438EEA749B48"/>
every child, who before had the chin-cough, and was ſeized with the natural ſmall-pox, died of a confluent kind. This calamity fell ſeverely among the poor of this place, many of whom earneſtly intreated me to inoculate their families; but this was ſcarce poſſible without ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary proviſion could be obtained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes to which they belonged: I therefore acquainted the clergymen of the reſpective pariſhes, that if proper care was taken that neceſſaries were not wanting, I would freely inoculate and attend all ſuch as I thought were proper ſubjects.</p>
               <p>Both the gentlemen approved the deſign; but after a ſhort conſultation with their pariſhioners, the affair was pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> off, the pariſh-officers alledging they could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide proper places.</p>
               <p>That ſuch a deſign had been in agitation, ſoon became known, and a number of poor people were continually ſoliciting me to inoculate them and their children at all events, promiſing to provide for themſelves to the utmoſt of their power. Some had the diſeaſe already in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. It was ſo much in the neighbourhood of others, that they were in daily fear of taking the infection, and their diſtreſs on this occaſion great. Women with chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at their breaſts in want of all neceſſaries, yet ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous for the ſafety of their offspring, preſſed me to ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate them and their children with an importunity not to be deſcribed. I acquainted them with the danger at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the infant ſtate; but reaſons availing nothing, I yielded to inoculate all who had not the chin-cough, or any other dangerous illneſs, though againſt my opinion and inclination, almoſt againſt my determined reſolution. Amongſt a very great number of ſubjects of all ages and conſtitutions, and where ſome might reaſonably be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to have taken the infection in the natural way, I expected ſome diſagreeable events would happen, but the probability of ſaving the lives of many prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated. The following however are the only caſes that border on the unfortunate, and the reader will, if ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and candid, eaſily place them to the right account.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:012028_0067_0F89438FAAB79F88"/>A mother and three children (one of them at the breaſt) were inoculated. The children had then the chin-cough; but this was carefully concealed from me, as I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed all under ſuch circumſtances. The youngeſt of about five months old had only five or ſix puſtules in the face, and not more, elſewhere proportionably. She lived paſt the criſis; but the cough remained violent, and ſhe was much enfeebled, and died as children do who pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by the chin-cough, and without any one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of danger that could be ſuppoſed to proceed from inoculation.</p>
               <p>Another weakly child, about five months old, I had perſuaded the mother to wean, in order that ſhe herſelf might be inoculated. During the preparation this woman fell ill of a fever, as ſuppoſed; but on viſiting her, I found the confluent ſmall-pox appearing, and that the child had lain with her conſtantly. I was earneſtly ſolicited to ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate this infant, in order to give it a better chance, which with great reluctance I yielded to. It had a very ſmall number of diſtinct puſtules, and paſſed through the diſeaſe ſafely; but not being reconciled to any food but the breaſt, it died ſoon after, languiſhing for want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſuſtenance.</p>
               <p>Another unfortunate ſubject was alſo a child at the breaſt, one of eight children, who with the father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were inoculated together. On the third day from the inoculation this child was ſeized with a fever, which from the ſymptoms I ſuſpected aroſe from worms. I gave it a grain of calomel; a large worm was voided the next day, and the child was ſeemingly better; but the fever returned at night, and continued without remiſſion in ſuch a manner as to be very dangerous in itſelf, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented any diſtinction of the eruptive ſymptoms: at length a confluent kind appeared, though the number was not great; the bad ſymptoms were not alleviated by the eruption, and the child died early in the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>All theſe caſes happened ſince the introduction and firſt chapter was wrote, and have confirmed my opinion, that it is better, both on account of the ſubject and the reputation of the practice, to defer inoculating children till they are about two years old.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:012028_0068_0F8943906984EFD0"/>It ſeems not improper likewiſe to mention the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing caſes; which, if the whole truth is not related, may poſſibly afford matter of cavil againſt inoculation.</p>
               <p>A ſhort, thick ſet, middle-aged man was ſeized with the uſual ſymptoms on the eighth day after inoculation. The eruption was favourable, the crop moderate, the puſtules large and diſtinct, and no peculiar care was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther required or obſerved. The pock maturated in ſeven days; after which he took two purges, and had fixed the day for his return to London.</p>
               <p>Two days before his intended journey I found him in the morning ſitting by the fire, with his hand upon his head; upon enquiring the reaſon, he anſwered, my head feels very queer to-day: a perſon in company added, that he had made to free with mutton the day before; but this he denied. He did not however ſeem much indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; he had taken a purge, and I expected he would be relieved by its operation.</p>
               <p>Next morning he told me he had a good night's ſleep, and was perfectly well; nevertheleſs two hours after he fell down ſuddenly in a fit, and ſenſeleſs. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I found him about ſix in the evening, and ſo he continued till the night of the following day, when he expired, perfectly apoplectick, in ſpite of every means we could attempt for his relief.</p>

               <head>CASE XXIII.</head>
               <p>ONE morning about ten I was deſired to viſit a poor man in a fever. Two days before, in the evening, he had been ſeized with a ſhivering fit, which was then ſuppoſed to be the ague; he ſoon grew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely hot, with pain in his head, back and loins, which continued till I ſaw him, the 24th October; he had kept his bed, had ſcarce any ſleep, his heat great, pulſe ſtrong and quick, and the pain in his loins very ſevere. This man had applied to me to be inoculated a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was taken ill, on account of the ſmall-pox being
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:012028_0069_0F8943912894A818"/>
very much in his neighbourhood; but he had not as yet taken any preparatory ſteps. I made no doubt but he was now attacked with this diſeaſe, and from the ſeverity of the ſymptoms expected it would prove of the confluent kind. As he lived near me, and I could eaſily attend to every circumſtance, I determined to try how far the cooling method might be beneficial in treating the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural pox.</p>
               <p>I found it very difficult to perſuade him to riſe out of bed, as he thought himſelf utterly unable to ſupport himſelf, notwithſtanding he was on other occaſions a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute man. Aſſuring him however, that I would not attend him, unleſs he would comply, he promiſed to uſe his utmoſt endeavours. I left him to put this advice in practice, and ordered him to a carpenter's yard about one hundred yards diſtant, where I promiſed to meet him.</p>
               <p>In about a quarter of an hour I found he had reached the place of appointment, by the aſſiſtance of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and was ſitting on a bench, complaining of great weakneſs, and pain in his loins; which he deſcribed, by ſaying he felt as if he was cutting in two; but allowed that his head was eaſier ſince he had been in the air. Finding that he had had a ſtool the preceding day, but none ſince, I gave him a pill, containing about ſix grs. of calom. and 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> gr. of emet. tartar, immediately; and as he complained of great thirſt, I permitted him to drink half a pint of cold water after it. I adviſed him not to ſit, but to endeavour to walk about a little, though ever ſo ſlowly; this he attempted, but went al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt double. At this time the weather was not very cold, but there was a pretty briſk wind, with ſmall rain.</p>
               <p>About a quarter of an hour after I ſaw him again; he had reſolutely perſiſted in following my directions, and ſaid, his head was greatly relieved, but the pain in his back and loins were much the ſame. His pulſe was now much altered; inſtead of being full and ſtrong, as before, it was low, but quick, and the heat on the ſkin greatly abated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="unknown:012028_0070_0F894392D0F60698"/>As he ſeemed much fatigued, I did not inſiſt on his keeping abroad longer, but permitted him to go home, deſiring him to refreſh himſelf, not to pull off his cloaths, or go into bed.</p>
               <p>At two o'clock I ſaw him again; his pill had then worked twice; he ſeemed fatigued and faint, but was abroad, for he ſaid the air refreſhed him, and his head was eaſier in the air than within, ſo that as ſoon as he was a little reſted, he came out by choice. The pain in his loins ſtill remained very grievous, but his head was much eaſier, and his back and loins became leſs painful towards evening. I allowed him to go to bed about ſeven; but being deſirous of obſerving the full effect of this kind of treatment, I ordered no medicine.</p>
               <p n="25">25th. Had but little reſt, and his complaints nearly the ſame as when he went to bed. His pulſe was now raiſed, and more full than in the evening, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of heat greater than over night. A few ſmall puſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tules were now beginning to ſhew themſelves on his face; I directed a purging draught of infuſion of ſena and manna, quickened with jalap; adviſed him to get out of bed, and venture again into the air. This he did: by two o'clock the purge had worked thrice, and he was freer from the pain in his back and loins: more puſtules now appeared in the face, but ſcarce any on the limbs. He had hitherto taken nothing ſince his firſt ſeizure, but tea with milk, ſage and balm tea, loathing all other nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. He perſiſted in keeping out the greateſt part of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e afternoon; and at ſeven went to bed, when I found the pulſe more calm and regular, and as his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints were leſs violent, he began to think of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="26">26th. I ſaw him at ſeven in the morning; he had ſlept but little, had one purging ſtool in the night, and felt himſelf low and languid; his pulſe was now even, full and regular, and his heat moderate. Many more puſtules were out in the face, though but few on the limbs, and his complaints of pain in the head and back gone off. He took milk pottage with ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and ſpent the greateſt part of the day abroad.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="unknown:012028_0071_0F894393693B6798"/>At three in the afternoon I ſaw him, and was told, that lying down in the bed, he had fallen aſleep, and waked almoſt choaked with blood; that he had vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up a conſiderable quantity, which doubtleſs had been ſwallowed, as he was found bleeding at the noſe. From what I could learn, the whole ſcarcely exceeded ſix or eight ounces. He complained of faintneſs, and ſaid his pains were removed. I ordered him to drink the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral decoction, acidulated with a mixture of equal quantities of ſweet and weak ſpirit of vitriol. The number of puſtules continued increaſing ſlowly on the face and other parts.</p>
               <p>Late in the evening I ſaw him again; two more pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſtools had followed; he complained of being very faint and low, and feared he ſhould have no reſt.</p>
               <p>I now thought it proper to give him an anodyne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, and therefore ordered mithrid. <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs. which he took immediately. By the help of this he paſſed a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing comfortable night, and thought himſelf quite well. The eruption was now completed; the ſmall-pox might be properly called diſtinct: though full in the face, he had only a moderate number of a large ſort on all the other parts; and he went through the ſucceeding ſtages without any difficulty.</p>

               <p>A young woman, who was ſervant in a houſe where a child had the ſmall-pox in the natural way, determined to ſtay there and take her chance.</p>
               <p>December 25th, 1765, I was deſired to ſee her. She had been taken with a cold fit the preceding afternoon, which was ſucceeded by a fever, and the uſual ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms attending the eruption, but in a ſevere manner. I found her in bed, making great complaints of pain in her head, back and loins; her pulſe ſtrong, quick and full; a fluſhing red colour in the face, and the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver very high.</p>
               <p>With much difficulty I prevailed upon her to get up; ordered her to drink ſome cold water, and go abroad into the air, though it was a very froſty morning, with
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:012028_0072_0F89439429B1A138"/>
ſleet. At one o'clock I called again, and found her then below ſtairs walking about. The heat was much abated, her complexion pale, the pulſe ſmall and quick, and all her complaints conſiderably abated.</p>
               <p>The account I received from her, and the perſons who attended her, was, that upon firſt going into the air, ſhe was ſo feeble, that the nurſe, and another to aſſiſt, could ſcarce ſupport her, and it was with much difficulty, that ſhe could walk with this aſſiſtance; that ſhe drank a glaſs of cold water from the pump, and before ſhe had been abroad many minutes, found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf much eaſier, and had remained ſo ever ſince. It now rained pretty hard, which had obliged her to come in; but ſhe ſaid, if her complaints returned, ſhe would certainly go out again, be the weather ever ſo bad, and in this reſolution I encouraged her.</p>
               <p>On the 26th, about 11 in the morning, I viſited her again, found ſhe had paſſed a pretty good night, and had felt no remarkable uneaſineſs; ſhe had been abroad ſeveral times the preceding day, to which ſhe imputed the eaſe ſhe enjoyed. Two puſtules of a diſtinct kind were now out in the face, and ſhe had the diſeaſe in a very favourable manner, without the leaſt bad ſymptom during the progreſs, or any ill conſequence afterwards.</p>

               <p>Jan. 3d, 1766.] A healthy young man was ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated in company with four of his neighbours. On the ſixth, preſuming that none of them would be ill, I went to London on buſineſs. Returning on the 7th in the afternoon, I was met by a ſervant, who informed me, that this man had been taken ill on the 5th in the afternoon, had continued very bad ever ſince, and now had ſomething broke out, which was ſuſpected to be the ſmall-pox, and that I was deſired to viſit him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately: this I complied with, and found him in bed, complaining much of pain in his head, back and loins, with great heat. Some ſmall puſtules were out in his face, which I perceived to be ſmall-pox; this was at five in the evening, and much about forty-eight hours from the firſt ſeizure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="unknown:012028_0073_0F894394E98574A0"/>The weather was at this time exceeding cold, and it froze very hard. I ordered him out of bed immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to drink a glaſs of cold water, and to get ſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and walk abroad in the air. Upon inquiry I found he had paſſed without a ſtool the whole day. Five grains of calomel in a pill were ordered to be taken immediately. He reſted but little this night, and next morning a great many more puſtules were out in the face, ſufficient to ſhew a diſpoſition to flux. As this pill produced no manifeſt effect, I ordered ſal. Glaub. <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vi. diſſolved in water gruel, to be taken im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. The vehemence of the fever and other ſymptoms were ſcarce moderated by this eruption.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the medicine and the ſeverity of the weather, I deſired he would get on his cloths, and go into the air as much as he could poſſibly bear, and in the evening ordered him to be carried in a chaiſe to the houſe provided for him, in caſe he had been ill from inoculation. I examined the inciſions carefully, but there were not the leaſt ſigns of the infection having ſucceeded, either by diſcolouration, hardneſs, or any alteration on the ſkin, nor could he recollect that they had itched or given him the leaſt uneaſineſs.</p>
               <p>In the evening he came to the houſe, as ordered, but was ſo very feeble and full of complaints, that it was with great difficulty he was got to his room. Upon inquiry I found he had vomited up the ſalts ſoon after taking them, and had only one coſtive ſtool; he had complied with my orders about getting into the air ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times in the day, though with great difficulty. His complaints of thirſt, pain in the head and back were at this time very great. I directed him to ſit with his feet in warm water for a ſhort time, and on going into bed to take a few ſpoonfuls of a laxative mixture, which was to be repeated till he had ſtools.</p>
               <p n="9">9th. He had been delirious in the night, but reſted a little towards morning; the number of puſtules was now conſiderably increaſed. This day he had three ſtools from his purging mixture, by which he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and bore ſitting up better.</p>

                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:012028_0074_0F894395AA5B2F78"/>10th. He paſſed the night eaſy, but without ſleep. He was very full in the face, but had a ſmaller number on the body and limbs. No complaint, deſerving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, happened during the progreſs to maturation. He ſat up a part of every day to the eighth from the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when, being blind, and very ſore, he kept in bed: they turned on the eleventh, and he recovered perfectly.</p>
               <p>It was remarkable in this caſe, that the inoculated parts never ſhewed the leaſt ſigns of infection; nor did a greater number of puſtules appear near them than might have been expected, if nothing had been done; nor is there to be ſeen the leaſt mark where the inoculation was performed, though in all other inoculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed patients who have had the diſeaſe, even in the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt manner, there conſtantly remains a ſcar.</p>
               <p>It appeared, on inquiry, that this man had been for a conſiderable time before in a conſtant inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with families in the ſmall-pox, and there ſeems not to be the leaſt doubt but his was the natural diſeaſe.</p>

               <p>A young woman was ſeized with a fever, and the uſual ſymptoms. The next day an eruption appeared, which gave ſome ſuſpicion of the ſmall-pox: on the third day more ſpots were diſcovered, but ſhe was not relieved. The diſorder was now ſuppoſed to be an inflammatory fever, attended with a raſh; and as ſhe was extremely delirious, a bliſter had been applied about two hours before I firſt ſaw her. The face was extremely full of very ſmall puſtules, which indeed were the ſmall-pox, and there was a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber on the neck and limbs; but notwithſtanding this eruption the fever was very high, and the degree of heat ſo exceſſive, that I ſcarce ever felt a perſon hotter; ſhe was ſo far ſenſible as to complain of great pain in her head, ſtomach and loins, though very delirious, and extremely reſtleſs. She was at an inn much uſed by carriers, and it was highly improper ſhe ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main

there. In her preſent ſituation I was ſenſible it might appear very hazardous to move her, but it was evident, that the ſmall-pox would be confluent. I judged from the violence of the ſymptoms, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe would be dangerous, and the event doubtful, and was therefore deſirous of trying how far the ſame method and remedies which were uſed ſo ſucceſsfully in the inoculated ſmall-pox as well as in ſome caſes of the natural diſeaſe, would avail in this. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of removing the patient afforded me a good opportunity, without any imputation of raſhneſs. I therefore propoſed her being taken down ſtairs into a parlour under the room where ſhe then lay, while I was preſent, and ready to aſſiſt, if the fatigue ſhould be too much for her; this was conſented to; the women aſſiſted in getting her cloaths on, which ſhe ſeemed much pleaſed with, being then delirious. She was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unable to ſtand, and was therefore brought down by three perſons in the ſame manner as if ſhe had been dead. She was then placed in a chair, but had not even ſtrength to hold herſelf upright, but was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in that poſture by the women about her.</p>
               <p>The fatigue of moving, and change of poſture oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned a faintneſs, in which ſhe loſt all colour, and the puſtules for a time diſappeared; upon this the chair was leaned quite back, the bed was brought down, and laid on the floor, ſhe was placed on it with her cloaths on, and eagerly drank a glaſs of cold water. Her colour ſoon returned; the puſtules appeared as before; but ſhe was conſiderably cooled, and her pulſe, tho' it retained the quickneſs, was not near ſo ſtrong: I ſtaid with her about half an hour, during which time ſhe was more ſenſible, not ſo reſtleſs, but ſeemed languid and tired. I ordered the window to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the room to be kept cool, and gave her three grains of calomel, tart. emet. gr. 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, in a pill, and directed a purging draught to be taken as ſoon as it could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and as there ſeemed no occaſion for the bliſter, it was taken off.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="unknown:012028_0076_0F8943972A74A700"/>I ſaw her next morning at a houſe to which ſhe had been removed at a ſmall diſtance, and found her almoſt free from complaints; ſhe had reſted moderately well, was perfectly ſenſible. Thoſe about her dated her amendment from the time when the purge (which had procured three ſtools) began to operate.</p>
               <p>She was however extremely full all over of a very ſmall confluent kind; yet theſe inflamed and maturat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a very favourable manner. From the minuteſt obſervation I could make, it ſeemed to me, that by this management the number in the face was leſs than when I firſt ſaw her, conſequently that ſome puſtules were repreſſed after they had appeared.</p>

               <head>CASE XXVII.</head>
               <p>In the beginning of June 66, a young woman was taken with a ſhivering fit, ſucceeded by a fever, and the ſymptoms that uſually precede the ſmall-pox, in a very violent degree; theſe were attended with ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral weakneſs, that in a few hours after the ſeizure ſhe was obliged to go to bed, where ſhe ſoon became de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirious, and afterward inſenſible, her urine paſſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily. In this condition I ſaw her firſt about forty hours after ſhe was taken ill. The heat was exceſſive, her pulſe extremely quick, but not ſtrong, and a few ſmall eruptions appeared on the face, ſufficient to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the diſtemper. Upon raiſing her up, ſhe did not make the leaſt effort to ſupport herſelf, and therefore was permitted to lie down, and as the room was ſmall, the window was ſet open. Five grs. of calomel were with great difficulty got down, and an infuſion of ſena with manna being prepared, the perſon attending was deſired to give a little and often, till ſhe had a ſtool.</p>
               <p>It was very improper, that ſhe ſhould remain in the houſe where ſhe was, on account of the family; yet there was no poſſibility of moving her in her preſent condition. Next morning I was informed ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the ſame ſtupid way the whole night, but was now rather better, and had ſpoke more ſenſibly,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:012028_0077_0F894397EA805F00"/>
had two ſtools, and vomited up ſome bilious matter. The heat was ſtill great, the pulſe quick, and many ſmall confluent puſtules were out in the face and other parts; this was the third day of her illneſs. I adviſed her being got out of bed, and the windows to be kept open; but was in doubt whether ſhe had ſtrength enough to be taken into the open air.</p>
               <p>In the evening the eruption was increaſed conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in number, and ſhe was ſo much eaſier of her complaints as to bear being removed in a cart to a houſe in the neighbourhood, where I gave her calomel three grains, emetic tartar one eighth of a grain.</p>
               <p>She had ſome reſt this night; but the fever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and not having had any more ſtools, I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a laxative potion of inf. of ſena and manna. She had three ſtools before evening, and all her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints abated. She was very full all over of a very confluent kind.</p>
               <p>This young woman ſat up the greateſt part of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days after ſhe was quite blind, by her own choice; and I do not recollect ever ſeeing one with ſo large a crop of puſtules, who went through the diſeaſe ſo eaſily; for ſhe made no complaint but of ſoreneſs, nor took any medicine but a few drops of thebaic tincture at bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, towards the criſis.</p>

               <p>A poor man about 35 years of age, who had gone through the preparatory courſe, came to my houſe in company with ſeveral more, in order to be inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. As ſoon as he came into the room, I perceived he was ill; and on enquiring he told me, that about two hours before he had been taken with a fit of the ague, and that his head, back and loins were in great pain. Feeling his pulſe, I found a good deal of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; his ſkin was alſo very hot. I knew the ſmall-pox was in his neighbourhood, and thence concluded, he was ſeized with ths diſtemper. I adviſed him to keep abroad in the air as much as poſſible, and directed
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:012028_0078_0F894398A88C8610"/>
a pill of the kind already mentioned at night, and a purging draught the following morning.</p>
               <p>Theſe operated four or five times, and he perſiſted in obeying my orders; the fever and other complaints were not ſo high as to give any great alarm; he had a pretty large number of a diſtinct pock, and went through the diſtemper very well.</p>

               <head>CASE XXIX.</head>
               <p>About three in the afternoon I viſited a middle-aged man, who after two days illneſs had an eruption, which the neighbours ſuſpected to be the ſmall-pox; I found him in bed, very hot, and in a ſweat; his pulſe quick, full and ſtrong, his face pretty full of ſmall-pox, which had begun to appear in the morning. I received the uſual account of the preceding ſymptoms, which had been pretty ſevere, and he ſtill made great complaints of pains in his head, back and loins. I immediately gave him a pill, containing cal. gr. v. tart. emet. gr. ⅛, which I had taken with me upon a preſumption that I might want it. I alſo inſiſted on his getting up, and going abroad into the air, notwithſtanding the ſweat he was in, which it was my intention to reſtrain. I met with the uſual difficulty in getting this advice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with; however he was aſſiſted, came down ſtairs, and went abroad, being ſupported by his wife; for he ſeemed very weak, and had not been out of his bed for two days before. As he complained of great thirſt, I gave him a glaſs of cold water, and ſtayed about half an hour to ſee the effect of this treatment. He was at firſt very faint and ſick, and vomited up ſome bilious matter, but not the pill he had lately taken. After this, while I ſtayed, he ſaid his head was better, and allowed he was refreſhed by the air. I deſired him to continue abroad as much as he could, and when he found himſelf tired, to go in and lie down a little; but as ſoon as he was able, to get out again, and if thirſty, to drink as much cold watet as he pleaſed. I then took my leave, ordering a purging draught to be
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:012028_0079_0F8943996CFD22B8"/>
taken as ſoon as he received it, which I concluded would be at leaſt three or four hours from that time.</p>
               <p>Next morning, on viſiting him, I was told, that the purge had operated four times, that he found himſelf conſiderably relieved, both in his head and back, and had reſted better than any time ſince he had been taken ill. The eruption proceeded ſlowly; but many more puſtules now appeared in his face and other parts, than before. He kept abroad, and his complaints continued wearing off. Next morning I found him quite eaſy; he was pretty full of a diſtinct pock, and from this time all went on well, without having occaſion to take any more medicines.</p>
