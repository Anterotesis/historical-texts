            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>WHAT a dark &amp; melancholly, not to ſay diſmal Deſcription is here of the viſible ſtate of the <hi>Dead?</hi> and how are the gloomy words doubled and trebled to repreſent the thick <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> a darkneſs to be felt and ſeen; not by the dead that neither ſee nor feel, but by the <hi>living who lay it to their heart.</hi>

BUT it is not the <hi>darkneſs</hi> of the Grave that I am now to inſiſt on, only as one part of the darkneſs lies in the words of my <hi>Text, Without any Order.</hi> Indeed <hi>Order</hi> is not to be expected in <hi>darkneſs.</hi> Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs implies diſorder, and the place of <hi>Order</hi> is where Light dwelleth. Were the light of the <hi>Sun</hi> put out, what diſorder would preſently follow upon Earth? Such a <hi>Connexion</hi> is there between Order and Light in the nature of things, and between Darkneſs &amp; Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</p>
            <p>BUT to drop the connexion of the words;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>JOB</hi> ſeems to ſpeak here, 1. of the <hi>time</hi> &amp; <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of Deaths coming on one and another, that we can obſerve no <hi>Order</hi> in the thing: 2. of the <hi>viſible State</hi> of the dead, the <hi>Grave,</hi> where we find no Order at all; natural, civil or religious. It is <hi>a land of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without any order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DOCT. <hi>DEATH ſeems not to us to obſerve and keep any Rule &amp; Order in it's taking away one and another; and the viſible State of the dead is without any Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PROP. I. <hi>DEATH ſeems not to us to obſerve and keep any Rule &amp; Order, in its taking away one and another.</hi> I ſay not, that it does not <hi>obſerve</hi> the beſt and moſt exact Order, but that this Order does not <hi>appear</hi> to us.</p>
            <p>IT certainly has its Order from GOD as to every one it takes away, when and in what manner they ſhall die. It certainly proceeds in a wiſe and good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by his Will and Direction. Yet we are not ſenſible of any fixed Rule that it goes by. — To be ſure every one dies in his <hi>own Order;</hi> in his appointed time and hour, which is order'd exactly and performed by GOD as it ſhou'd be: whether in Judgment, or in Mercy.</p>
            <p>DEATH has it's Order from the LORD OF LIFE, the juſt <hi>Rewarder</hi> and the righteous <hi>Judge.</hi> There is <hi>an appointed time to Man upon Earth, the number of his months</hi> and days <hi>are with GOD; his bounds
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003009_0005_0FEFDD6ECC475F20"/>are determined</hi> to an hour and a minute, which <hi>he cannot paſs.</hi> Not <hi>a Sparrow,</hi> and much leſs any Child of <hi>Man, falls to the ground without the will of our</hi> FATHER <hi>in Heaven</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Job vii. 1. Matth. x. 29.</note>.</p>
            <p>AND be ſure the Maker and GOD of our Spirits does all things well, in perfect Wiſdom and Order. Death is kept in GOD'S own hand, or (which is the ſame thing) it is put into the hand of CHRIST, <hi>the Only-begotten of the</hi> FATHER: It is in the beſt Hand: Never the leſs we cannot obſerve the Order that it keeps; either,
<list>
                  <item>1. As to the <hi>Time,</hi> or</item>
                  <item>2. As to the <hi>Manner</hi> of ones dying and anothers.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Time</hi> of Death's coming to one and another, it ſeems <hi>without any Order.</hi> We cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any <hi>natural</hi> Order, nor <hi>moral,</hi> nor <hi>political</hi> in the approach of Death, here or there.</p>
            <p n="1">1. No <hi>natural</hi> Order. By which I mean, according to the courſe of <hi>Nature;</hi> as to us it would ſeem order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the <hi>Elder</hi> to go before the Younger, and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> before their Children. But Death obſerves no ſuch Order of Nature and Age. Younger Perſons do often die <hi>before</hi> their Elders, and Children before their Parents. At the next door again, the Elder dies before the Younger; the Parents before the Children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SIN</hi> that bro't in Death broke in upon this ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing natural Order, and the natural Deſires both of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Children. For <hi>Parents</hi> naturally and ſtrongly deſire, if it may pleaſe GOD, that their Children may out-live them; and <hi>Children</hi> naturally hope and expect to out-live their Parents, by the Will of GOD. But the <hi>firſt Death</hi> we read of broke this Order, namely <hi>Abel's;</hi> and how many more of their Children <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; <hi>Eve</hi> liv'd to bury we know not. But this we know that the <hi>beſt</hi> among their fallen Offspring ſhare in this Grief after them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:003009_0006_0FEFDD71CE91F330"/>
SOMETIMES the youngeſt Children of the Family die firſt, the <hi>Youth</hi> dies before the Adult, the <hi>Adult</hi> before the <hi>Aged,</hi> and the <hi>Hoary Head</hi> follows many an <hi>Infant</hi> to the Grave. But neither is <hi>this</hi> Order kept to by Death, for ſometimes an <hi>Iſaac</hi> and a <hi>Jacob</hi> die in a good old Age, with their Sons about them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. DEATH ſeems not to regard or keep any <hi>Moral Order</hi> in its approch to one and another. The <hi>Good</hi> die before the bad, and the <hi>bad</hi> again before the Good; here the Righteous before the Wicked, and there the wicked before the Godly. Here <hi>the wicked is driven away in his wickedneſs,</hi> and there he <hi>lives old and is mighty in power.</hi> Here the Godly die <hi>young</hi> deſired and lamented, and in the midſt of their uſefulneſs; and there their <hi>hoary head is a Crown of glory in the ways of Righteouſneſs.</hi> The leaſt worthy and fit to live, as we are ready to think, do often out-live their betters; and thoſe of whom the World is not worthy, a <hi>Joſiah,</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> a <hi>Stephen,</hi> are taken away young; lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bewailed. <hi>Good Men</hi> are ready to call this <hi>without any Order,</hi> while they <hi>mourn</hi> the early Deaths of the wiſe and prudent, the pious and godly, the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and profitable; and while they <hi>groan</hi> under the uſeleſs and hurtful prolonged Life of the wicked.</p>
            <p n="3">3. DEATH ſeems not to regard any <hi>Political or Civil Order</hi> among Men, in its approaches to one &amp; another. It regards no Diſtinction, Rank, or Degree of Men, in State or Church. The Noble and Ignoble, the Lord or the Slave, the Maſter and the Servant, are treated juſt alike by Death. There is no <hi>Precedency</hi> kept to. The <hi>Prince</hi> does not go <hi>firſt</hi> here, and his <hi>Nobles</hi> next; nor do they affect or deſire it.</p>
            <p>If the firſt in <hi>Quality</hi> and <hi>Rank</hi> were firſt to die, 'twould ſpoil all the <hi>Order</hi> and State and Glory of the World that now is; and turn it upſide down. <hi>Crowns</hi> would grow cheap, and Men would ſhun the Honours they now court and pride in. The Order that <hi>Courts</hi> and <hi>Parliaments</hi> wou'd be ready to make,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003009_0007_0FEFDD7382059400"/>if they had power to Enact about the Time of Death, would be for the <hi>poor</hi> &amp; <hi>low</hi> to go to the Grave <hi>before</hi> their Superiours. But <hi>Riches profit not,</hi> nor Dignity and Power, in the day of Death. None of 'em can by any means deliver Himſelf, nor redeem his Brother. <hi>Princes die young,</hi> in the midſt of all their Bloom and Hopes, or of their Fame and Glory; and <hi>Peaſants live old</hi> in their low and homely Cottages. This is <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Order,</hi> in the account and eye of this World.</p>
            <p>BUT this for the <hi>Time</hi> of Death's coming to one and another, <hi>without any Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of one and anothers dying, Death keeps to no Order. The rich and the poor, the high and the low, the Parent and the Child, the young &amp; the old, the Friend &amp; the Enemy, they die alike; or quite differing one from the other: ſome a natural Death, ſome a violent, or by evil Accidents. The <hi>moral</hi> Characters of Perſons are no ſecurity here, <hi>All things come alike to all, there is one Event to the righteous &amp; to the wicked, to the clean &amp; to the unclean; as is the good ſo is the ſinner,</hi> Eccl. 9.2. The Sons of <hi>Job,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Aaron</hi> were ſtruck dead, as well as <hi>Onan</hi> and <hi>Ananias</hi> in their Sin. The ſame Fevers or Dropſies, the ſame Conſumptions, or the ſame Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors and Lethargies, ſeiſe and carry off one and another. The ſame Pains &amp; Torments rend and tear Perſons of the moſt different Characters; whether on worldly Accounts, or on moral and religious. And the ſame noiſome Diſeaſes corrupt the Bodies, and deſtroy the Lives of Saints and Sinners; of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and of <hi>Herod.</hi> The hard and the eaſie Death, is common to good and bad, young and old, rich or poor, Parent and Offspring. <hi>Queens</hi> in their Palaces and fine linnen, and <hi>Beggars</hi> on the dunghil and in their rags, die of the ſame Sores and Ulcers. <hi>Kings</hi> die by evil Accidents, and by the hand of Violence, as well as others; and one as well as another prolong their dayes and <hi>die in their neſt.</hi>

ONLY let us except here the <hi>laſt and utmoſt Diſorder</hi> in Death, the <hi>dying as a fool dieth,</hi> wickedly and wilfully by his <hi>own hands,</hi> or impiouſly in <hi>brutal DUELS;</hi> which is but another way of SELF-MUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER. Theſe unnatural and deteſted <hi>wayes</hi> of dying are not to be named or ſuppoſed, when we ſpeak of the <hi>Manner and Circumſtances</hi> of one and anothers Death. Let <hi>theſe</hi> be proper for the <hi>impious</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and to them alone if you will, and <hi>out</hi> of the preſent Argument, as they ought not to be once named in the World; how common ſoever they have been in it.</p>
            <p>BUT this for the <hi>firſt Propoſition: Death</hi> ſeems not to obſerve and keep any Rule or <hi>Order</hi> in its taking away one and another, whether we conſider the <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Manner</hi> of its coming.</p>
            <p>PROP. II. <hi>THE viſible State of the dead,</hi> that is, <hi>the Grave, is without any Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND <hi>this</hi> ſeems to be the meaning of the <hi>Text, A land of darkneſs as darkneſs it ſelf, without any Order.</hi> But here we ſpeak only of the <hi>viſible</hi> State of the dead, not of the <hi>inviſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR if we look by Faith into the <hi>inviſible</hi> World and State, there we behold the moſt perfect and <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Order.</hi> The good and the bad, the godly and the wicked are in their proper place; <hi>Judas</hi> in his, and the repenting <hi>Thief</hi> (thro' Grace) in his; namely the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of CHRIST prepared for <hi>Penitents</hi> from the foundation of the World. The Servants of <hi>Sin</hi> and of <hi>Satan</hi> deceaſed, are gone accurſed <hi>into everlaſting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> but the <hi>Dead in</hi> CHRIST are in the <hi>Manſions</hi> in the FATHER'S <hi>Houſe.</hi> This is moſt <hi>exact Order,</hi> without reſpect of Perſons, every Man according to his Works; the degrees of Reward and Puniſhment bearing a juſt Proportion to the degree, of Grace and labours of Love, and to the meaſures and degrees of Sin and Wickedneſs done in the Body. This is the bright and ſhining Order in the unſeen and eternal State: Matth. 25. ult. <hi>Theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting Puniſhment, but the Righteous
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003009_0009_0FEFDD7787B0BC18"/>into Life eternal.</hi> Dan. 12.2, 3. <hi>And many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the Earth ſhall awake, ſome to everlaſting Life, and ſome to Shame &amp; everlaſting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: And they that be Wiſe ſhall ſhine as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Firmament, and as the Stars for ever &amp; ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT if we look, with theſe mortal Eyes, into the <hi>viſible</hi> State of the dead, both the godly &amp; ungodly, it it is altogether <hi>without any Order.</hi> All go to one place, and all ly mixt and <hi>confuſed</hi> there. All turn to <hi>duſt</hi> again, and ones duſt has no Preheminence to ſight and ſenſe above anothers, no Diſtinction from the others: Alike do they <hi>ſleep</hi> in the duſt, and are covered in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>INDEED a Grave-ſtone may here and there inform you whoſe Body was laid in this place, and whoſe in that; that this was once <hi>Noble</hi> or <hi>Royal,</hi> and that <hi>vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> and <hi>common,</hi> but take away the <hi>Monument</hi> and no appearance remains of Family and Blood, nor of Order civil or ſacred among the dead. There <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Counſellors</hi> of the Earthly in their deſolate Places, and there lies the hidden and <hi>untimely Birth,</hi> that never faw the light: There lies the <hi>Tyrant</hi> and Oppreſſor, and there his <hi>Priſoners</hi> are at reſt together by him: <hi>The ſmall and the great are there, and the ſervant is free from his maſter,</hi> Job 3.18, 19. There ly the Aſhes of the <hi>wiſe,</hi> the learned, the virtuous and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and there the <hi>fool and brutiſh Perſon,</hi> that had neither Head nor Heart for any thing great and good, <hi>Like Sheep they are laid in the Grave, Death feeds on them,</hi> and the <hi>Worm</hi> is the only <hi>Relative</hi> that remains to them.</p>
            <p>YET again, The Order of the <hi>Univerſe</hi> ceaſes in the Grave. There is neither Light nor Darkneſs, Heat or Cold, Day or Night, Summer or Winter known there. There is no <hi>Knowledge, Work or Device the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> no Good or Evil, Joy or Sorrow done or felt there: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there Friendſhip or Enmity, Love or Hatred there. Eccl. 9.5, 6. <hi>The dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a Reward, alſo their Love and their Hatred and their Envy is periſhed; neither
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003009_0010_0FEFDD793773A208"/>have they any more a Portion for ever in any thing that is done under the Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, THERE is no <hi>religious Order</hi> in the Grave; no not in the Tomb of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and among the bodies of the <hi>Juſt.</hi> There is no <hi>Worſhip,</hi> no Praiſe or Prayer, in that place of ſilence no <hi>Sabbath</hi> there, tho' a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual <hi>Reſt</hi> &amp; quiet. This was the Darkneſs &amp; <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order</hi> of the Grave to the pious <hi>King,</hi> Iſa. 38. <hi>I ſaid in the cutting off my days, I ſhall no more ſee the</hi> LORD <hi>even the</hi> LORD, <hi>in the land of the living; I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Man no more with the Inhabitants of the Earth:— For the Grave cannot praiſe thee, Death cannot cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate thee, they that go down to the Pit cannot hope for thy Truth: The Living, the living he ſhall praiſe thee, as I do this day; the Father to the Children ſhall make known thy Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>WORSHIP</hi> is the holy <hi>Order</hi> &amp; Beauty both of this World and of that to come: This therefore is the Darkneſs of the Grave, that there is nothing of this holy Order in it, the <hi>Beauty of Holineſs:</hi> Pſalm 30.9. <hi>When I go down to the Pit, ſhall the duſt praiſe thee? ſhall it declare thy Truth?</hi> Pſal. 115. uſt. <hi>The dead praiſe not the</hi> LORD, <hi>neither any that go down into ſilence; but we will bleſs the</hi> LORD <hi>from this time forth and for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE have look'd thus into the <hi>viſible</hi> State of the dead, and we find it <hi>without any Order;</hi> without Sun or Stars, Senſe or Motion, Relation or Condition, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or Sabbath.</p>
            <p>I come now to make ſome USE and IMPROVEMENT of this <hi>Meditation.</hi> And if this be one point in the Darkneſs of <hi>Death,</hi> that it is <hi>without any Order?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, We ſee ſomething very <hi>valuable</hi> in the Land of the living, and that is <hi>Order;</hi> and we learn, on the contrary, that next to <hi>Death</hi> is <hi>Diſorder</hi> and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:003009_0011_0FEFDD63D9C62118"/>
THE Beauty of the <hi>Univerſe,</hi> of the natural and moral World, the Uſefulneſs of things in it and the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of the Creatures, depend upon the excellent <hi>Order</hi> that GOD has conſtituted. <hi>The LORD is a GOD of Order.</hi> His Works declare it, his Word and Law preſcribe and require it. Decency and Order go together, and ſo do Order &amp; Right. Every thing is beautiful and right in its time and order.</p>
            <p>WHAT was the Work of <hi>Creation?</hi> but GOD'S bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Heavens &amp; Earth into that beauteous &amp; uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Order</hi> which we behold, out of a <hi>Chaos</hi> and State of Confuſion? Gen. 1.2. <hi>And the Earth was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out form and void, and Darkneſs was upon the face of it: And the SPIRIT of GOD moved upon the face of the Waters: And GOD ſaid, Let there be Light, and there was Light: — And GOD divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Light from the Darkneſs, and GOD called the light Day, and the darkneſs He called Night: And GOD ſaid, Let there be a Firmament,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lights</hi> therein, <hi>and let</hi> them <hi>be for ſigns, and for ſeaſons, and for Dayes and for Years.</hi> Thus ORDER was the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Work of GOD in the beginning, and by it <hi>all things conſiſt:</hi> the Sun &amp; Moon &amp; Stars, in their various Diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, Magnitude, Motions, Influences and Benefits, are bright and ſhining Inſtances of glorious Order. <hi>Their Line is gone thro' all the Earth, and their Words to the End of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AMONG <hi>Men</hi> on Earth, GOD has appointed <hi>Rule and Order,</hi> and made them neceſſary to our comfort and ſafety, in private &amp; in public Society. Family Order is the foundation of our Peace and Welfare, of good Nei'bourhood, of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly-kindneſs and Charity; of civil Government and of joint publick Worſhip.</p>
            <p>THE whole <hi>Law</hi> of GOD to us is comprehended in this one word <hi>Order;</hi> preſcribing firſt our orderly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and Behaviour towards GOD, and then to one another in our ſeveral places and Relations; as Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, Inſeriors and Equals.</p>

IT is ORDER that requires <hi>Children</hi> to honour their Father and Mother, which is <hi>the firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Promiſe. Order</hi> teaches them to <hi>riſe up before the hoary Head, and to honour the Face of the Old Man. Order</hi> teaches <hi>Servants</hi> to obey their Maſters according to the fleſh, and <hi>Maſters</hi> to give unto their Servants that which is juſt and equal. <hi>Order</hi> teaches Men to <hi>do Juſtice, to love Mercy, and to live Soberly, &amp; Righteouſly; and whatſoever we would that Men ſhould do unto us, to do the ſame unto them. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> teaches <hi>every Soul to be ſubject to the higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to obey Magiſtrates, and to be ready unto every good Work.</hi> And <hi>Order</hi> teaches <hi>Rulers</hi> to be <hi>juſt Men, ruling in the Fear of the</hi> LORD. <hi>Order</hi> teaches all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to <hi>know them that have the Rule over them</hi> in Things ſacred, <hi>and to ſubmit themſelves</hi> as unto them <hi>that watch for their Souls:</hi> The <hi>younger like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that they ſubmit themſelves unto the Elder; yea all of us to be ſubject one to another, and to be clothed with Humility.

            <p>BUT next to <hi>Death,</hi> or worſe than Death is <hi>Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and Confuſion.

               <hi>DISORDER</hi> is as much the <hi>Miſery</hi> &amp; Ruin as it is the <hi>Deformity</hi> of Societies, private or publick, civil or religious.

            <p>WE ſhould be very thankful therefore for the <hi>Order</hi> that there is in the World, as being the wiſe and good Eſtabliſhment of GOD for our preſent &amp; future Well-being: And we ſhould be very careful to preſerve it in our places, and to do what we can to promote it every where.

I might go on and obſerve to you <hi>the dreadful Puniſhment of Sin,</hi> in all the <hi>Diſorders</hi> &amp; <hi>Confuſions</hi> which it has bro't upon Mankind in this wretched and <hi>mortal</hi> State; on Perſons, on Families, on Provinces and Kingdoms; as by <hi>Deaths</hi> common and uncommon, ſo by the great <hi>Tranſgreſſions</hi> that do often bring on ſtrange and tragical Ends.</p>
            <p>I had tho't alſo to call on ſober and thinking Perſons, as well as on the vain and inconſiderate and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, to expect, fear and prepare for unknown and innumerable Diſorders and <hi>Diſaſters</hi> in ſuch a World as this is; and ſometimes for things <hi>worſe than Death,</hi> which come upon one Family and other <hi>without any Order</hi> obſervable to Man; and how often in the moſt ſurprizing and amazing manner.</p>
            <p>O that old and young, high and low, rich and poor together, would conſider ſeriouſly of the <hi>Truth</hi> before us and prepare to <hi>die,</hi> (<hi>without any Order,</hi> ſhall I ſay?) not knowing the <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Manner</hi> of their End!

BUT at the ſame time let the Godly remember for their <hi>Comfort,</hi> that the <hi>Reſurrection-Day</hi> will bring all things into <hi>Order</hi> again. That <hi>Day of the Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of all things,</hi> will put an <hi>End</hi> to all the <hi>Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> that Sin and Death have bro't into the World.— Indeed the Confuſion of the <hi>wicked</hi> will be great in that glorious Day, their Fear &amp; Shame &amp; Anguiſh of heart; and they would rather ſtill have been in all the <hi>diſorder</hi> of the Grave: But this will not at all hinder the ſhining <hi>Order</hi> of the illuſtrious Day. <hi>For the</hi> SON OF MAN <hi>will come in his Glory, with all his holy Angels; then ſhall He ſit upon the Throne of his Glory!

            <p>O in what ſolemn glorious <hi>Order</hi> will the Godly and ungodly then appear before the <hi>Judgment-Seat of</hi> CHRIST, and about his Throne!

            </p>
            <p>BUT the ſad and diſmal DISORDER, which the righteous GOD permitted to fall out among us the <hi>laſt Week,</hi> horrible to mention, and to be bewailed with <hi>Tears of blood,</hi> leads me into a more particular <hi>Addreſs</hi> unto our <hi>Young People,</hi> and to their <hi>Elders</hi> with them; that the like abominable and deteſtable <hi>Diſorder</hi> may never again be heard of among us, by the Will of GOD.</p>
            <p>SEE, ſee my <hi>beloved Hearers,</hi> a criminal <hi>Diſorder</hi> big with the moſt hainous <hi>Guilt,</hi> and tragical <hi>Death!</hi> See the haſty and curſed Fruit of criminal <hi>Diſorders,</hi> in the <hi>double Murder</hi> of a late hopeful and promiſing <hi>Youth,</hi> who was heretofore of Us, a <hi>Child</hi> of great Expectation; but he went out from us, and ran him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the Paths of the Deſtroyer and an untimely Death. See what a diſorderly Conduct may preſently bring the moſt ſober, diſcreet and well tempered of our Children to; if as they grow up they abandon the good Rules and orderly Ways of Virtue and Piety, wherein they have been educated and inſtituted by their good Parents and Guardians, and run themſelves into the Corruptions that are in the World thro' luſt.</p>
            <p>LET me therefore take this ſad Occaſion with a heavy Heart, to warn our Young People in the Name and Fear of GOD, againſt bloody &amp; unnatural <hi>DUELS</hi> and all the train of vicious Courſes that lead to it; to a miſerable End here, and to a fiery Hell for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DUELS</hi> are the <hi>Devil</hi> all over, who was <hi>the Murderer from the beginning;</hi> and as they come of him, ſo they repreſent him to the life, in all his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience and Enmity to GOD, and in all his Pride, Rage, and bloody Hatred of the life of Man. <hi>Duels</hi> are both kinds of <hi>Murder</hi> united: There's the Murder of a Mans <hi>Self</hi> in it, and the Murder of his <hi>Nei'bour</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: And alas! as there is the Murder of the <hi>Body</hi> in

            <p>BUT I hope I need not uſe many words to give our Young People <hi>horror</hi> at the Tho't of this Crime; the <hi>Tragedy</hi> of the laſt week will of it ſelf do this, I truſt.

            <p>AND firſt, <hi>Drinking.</hi> Few of our People are like to fall into any ſuch <hi>Crime,</hi> as DUELS, till they have debauch'd themſelves with drinking Companions. <hi>Wine is a Mocker, ſtrong Drink is raging;</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> admoniſhes us: And in the wiſdom of GOD he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and exhorts the young Man; Prov. 23.19, 20, 29. <hi>Hear thou, my ſon, and be wiſe, and guide thine Heart in the way: Be not among Wine-bibbers, among riotous Eaters of Fleſh: For who hath wo? who hath ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? who hath Contentions? who hath Bablings? who Wounds without cauſe? they that tarry long at the Wine, they that go to ſeek mixt Drink.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>CHILDREN,</hi> Beware of forming your ſelves into nightly or daily <hi>Tavern-clubs;</hi> or even into ſuch weekly or monthly Societies, for meeting &amp; ſpending your Evenings in drinking together and gaming; whether at home or abroad. <hi>It is not for you,</hi> our Sons, <hi>no it is not for you, to drink wine and ſtrong drink; leſt you drink and forget the Law &amp; Covenant of the</hi> LORD <hi>your</hi> GOD, and run into every exceſs and riot. <hi>Give the ſtrong Drink to him that is ready to periſh, and the wine to them that be of heavy Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>GAMING</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> incite and inflame to <hi>Duels.</hi> So it was in the <hi>late</hi> lamented Calamity. What a hideous <hi>Story</hi> is it? for Children that are beginning the World, it may be before they have fifty or ſixty Pounds to ſhow of their own getting, by the favour of GOD in a lawful and induſtrious way; to raffle away
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003009_0018_0FF0282A74CB6568"/>ſuch a Sum in a looſe and careleſs Night! No account can be given for ſuch a piece of Diſtraction, if the <hi>Bottle</hi> did not ſtand by and firſt take away the Senſe &amp; Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And then the <hi>Paſſion</hi> riſes at the Loſs, before or after the Wine is out, and the inward Vexation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces fierce Words, foul Names, Curſing &amp; Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Hatred &amp; Revenge, and the Heat ends in one another's <hi>Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WILL you not ſay, <hi>my Son! Come not into their Company O my Soul, for in their Rage they ſlew a Man.</hi> It is the play of <hi>Abner,</hi> (only they were Enemies in open War) when he ſaid to <hi>Joab, Let the young Men ariſe to play before us,</hi> twelve againſt twelve, <hi>and they caught every one his Fellow by the head, and thruſt his Sword into his Fellows ſide, and fell down together.</hi> Such Murderous Fellows and Companions are <hi>Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> like to prove, if GOD reſtrain not the <hi>Devil</hi> from a full Poſſeſſion of them.</p>
            <p>SAY not, <hi>fooliſh Child,</hi> There is no ſuch danger from <hi>us</hi> and <hi>our</hi> Gaming together: Why not as much as there is found to have been in the late <hi>bloody Game</hi> that has put the Town in Mourning? <hi>Leave off Strife,</hi> and ſo Drinking and Gaming, <hi>before it be medled with;</hi> which is <hi>Solomon</hi>'s advice; meaning <hi>that we never begin</hi> or venture on in ſuch Courſes, whereof we know not the <hi>End,</hi> and think not the <hi>Tendency</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LEWDNESS</hi> often accompanies the Glaſs and the Game. The <hi>harlot's Houſe</hi> may be the place of the Game; and <hi>her Houſe takes hold of Hell, and leads down to the Chambers of Death. Duels</hi> have often been fought in the cauſe of a <hi>Strumpet,</hi> and Blood has been often ſhed and Lives ſacrificed to the fury of Luſt. Prov. 2.28. <hi>Her Houſe inclineth unto Death, and her Paths unto the dead.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Her End is bitter as Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, ſharp as a two edged</hi> SWORD; <hi>her feet go down to Death, her ſteps take hold of Hell.</hi> 7.25. <hi>She hath caſt down many wounded, and ſtrong Men have been</hi> SLAIN <hi>by her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN a word, As you wou'd avoid <hi>Duels</hi> and <hi>Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,</hi> ſhun <hi>Drinking,</hi> ſhun <hi>Gaming,</hi> beware of <hi>Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs</hi> and <hi>Whordom,</hi> beware of <hi>Pride</hi> &amp; <hi>Haughtineſs,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>IN an eſpecial manner, Let the <hi>Sons</hi> of this Country, and of theſe Churches beware of <hi>theſe</hi> Sins of <hi>Sabbath-breaking,</hi> and of <hi>Diſobedience to Parents,</hi> and of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking</hi> the good Ways &amp; Principles wherein they have been educated &amp; inſtitured, either in point of Doctrine, Worſhip or Manners. Let them beware of <hi>forſaking the Guide of their Youth,</hi> and of <hi>fogetting the Covenant of their GOD, leſt Strangers devour them,</hi> and they <hi>give their Years to the cruel.</hi> It is a dreadful word of GOD to the Children of his People, 1 Chron. 28.9. <hi>If thou ſeek him he will be found of thee, but if thou forſake him He will caſt thee off for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YOU ſee <hi>Children</hi> this day, what comes of <hi>leaving theſe Chruches</hi> after an Education in them: Even Duel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling &amp; Bloodſhed &amp; Flight from Country &amp; Friends, may come of <hi>burſting the Bonds of GOD</hi> aſunder, and <hi>going after Strangers,</hi> and into the Manners, Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and impious <hi>Maxims</hi> of the World.</p>
            <p>RETURN, diſtracted and beſotted <hi>Children! return and ſave your ſelves from this untoward Generation. Forſake the fooliſh &amp; live, and walk in the way of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> The ways of Sin are nothing but Diſorder and Miſery, the way of Godlineſs, Righteouſneſs and Sobriety is the Way of Order, Safety and Felicity. <hi>Let Wiſdom enter into thy Heart, &amp; Knowledge be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to thy Soul; Diſcretion ſhall preſerve thee, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhall keep thee: To deliver thee frow the way of the evil Man, from the Man that ſpeaketh froward things, who leave the paths of Uprightneſs, to walk in the ways of Darkneſs; whoſe ways are crooked, and they are froward in their Paths.</hi>

LET <hi>Solomon</hi> tell you the Tendency of wicked Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany unto <hi>Bloodſhed:</hi> Prov. 1.10,—19. <hi>My Son, if Sinners entice thee, conſent thou not: — Their ſeet run to Evil, &amp; make haſte to ſhed Blood: — They lay wait for their own Blood, they lurk privily for their own Lives: ſo are the wayes of every one that is greedy of Gain, which taketh away the Life of the Owners thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I turn me now to the <hi>Elders</hi> of my People, to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> and <hi>Maſters,</hi> and the worſhipful <hi>Juſtices of the Peace;</hi> and alſo to <hi>the Keepers of Public Houſes;</hi> in a few words.</p>
            <p>LET <hi>Parents</hi> carefully educate &amp; inſtruct &amp; charge their Children, reſtrain and govern them, rebuke and correct what is Evil in them, and encourage them in what is virtuous &amp; pious and praiſe worthy. Make'em to know that they depend upon you, and ought to <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> unto you in the LORD; and muſt do ſo if they will have your Favour, Countenance &amp; open Hand. While the <hi>Mother</hi> adjures them from evil Companions, <hi>What, my Son! and what the Son of my Womb! and what, the Son of my Vows!</hi> Let the <hi>Father</hi> command &amp; forbid them on pain of his higheſt Diſpleaſure, and on pain of GOD'S, which is infinitely greater.</p>
            <p>INDULGE not their Vanity &amp; Corruption in ſeeking to feed <hi>as Lambs in a large Place,</hi> which is the firſt ſtep to their running wild into the <hi>Woods,</hi> to be devour'd there by the <hi>Beaſts of Prey.</hi> Have no hand, no not by criminal Eaſineſs &amp; Gentleneſs, like <hi>Eli,</hi> in their <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king themſelves vile;</hi> leſt GOD be provoked to <hi>judge</hi> both You and them. Have no hand (ſhall I ſay) in their <hi>Blood;</hi> that of their Bodies, nor that of their Souls: But if they will come unto dreadful <hi>Ends,</hi> let their <hi>Blood</hi> be upon their own heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>TWO</hi> things let me beſeech of <hi>Parents</hi> &amp; Heads of Families: <hi>One</hi> is that they frequent not <hi>Taverns</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which will certainly encourage your <hi>Sons</hi> to do the like, while they want your Years &amp; Prudence whereby to govern themſelves in ſuch a Liberty. The <hi>other</hi> thing I would entreat is, Not to ſuffer <hi>Cards</hi> or <hi>Dice</hi> in your Houſes, nor take the liberty to play thoſe inſnaring and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003009_0021_0FF02845DDAC3CB8"/>Inchanting <hi>Games</hi> before your Children. You will herein conſult the good Order, Virtue &amp; Religion of your Houſholds, your Happineſs in your Children, their Preſervation from &amp; thro' an evil World, and your own Peace living &amp; dying.</p>
            <p>BUT from <hi>private Houſes</hi> let me ſtep into thoſe that are <hi>public,</hi> and drop a Word of <hi>Counſel</hi> &amp; <hi>Warning</hi> to the <hi>Inn</hi> &amp; <hi>Tavern Keepers.</hi> We beſeech You not to ſuffer Perſons or Companies to ſit <hi>idling, tipling</hi> and much leſs <hi>gaming</hi> and carouſing in your Houſes. You know the <hi>Laws</hi> of GOD, and good <hi>Orders</hi> of Men in this <hi>Caſe;</hi> but if you eſcape the Cognizance of the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> and Officers of our Peace, you cannot eſcape the Notice &amp; Judgment of GOD. May the <hi>Blood</hi> of diſſolute Youths never come upon any of your Houſes, by your indulging them in evil &amp; forbidden Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, and at forbidden Hours. It calls for a great deal more Virtue, Courage and Prudence, to keep a <hi>Tavern</hi> well, then we are ready to think of.</p>
            <p>BUT the Care of <hi>public Houſes</hi> belongs alſo to the MAGISTRATES, <hi>Juſtices</hi> &amp; <hi>Officers</hi> in the <hi>Town,</hi> to whoſe Wiſdom and Prudence, Integrity and Fidelity, I commend it in the Fear of GOD. <hi>The Earth and all the Inhabitants of it</hi> would <hi>diſſolve,</hi> if good <hi>Rulers</hi> did not in their Legiſlative and Executive Power, <hi>hold up the Pillars thereof.</hi> Let it ſtrengthen your Hands to know, that you are miniſtring to the Honour of GOD and the good <hi>Order</hi> of the World; the common Happineſs and Peace of Mankind.</p>
            <p>LET the Wicked be <hi>afraid</hi> of the POWER; for <hi>He beareth not the Sword in vain;</hi> but is <hi>the Miniſter of GOD, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doeth Evil.</hi> But let the lovers of Peace and Right and Order reverence and <hi>love</hi> the POWERS which GOD has <hi>ordained; For Rulers are not a Terror to good Works, but to the evil: Do that which is Good and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame. Wherefore ye muſt needs be ſubject, not only for Wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake.</hi>
