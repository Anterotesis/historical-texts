            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>BRIEF INTRODUCTORY STRICTURES UPON LATE BLASPHEMOUS WRITINGS, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>A PERSONS' raiſing the duſt of controverſy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy ſcriptures, obſcures not their luſtre (however blinded he may be himſelf) but like the Sun they ſhine with unclouded light, far above little emmets encompaſſing themſelves in clouds of duſt.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid; let the potſherd ſtrive with the potſherds of the earth, but woe to him that ſtriveth with his Maker. And whoſe heart can endure, and whoſe hands can be ſtrong, when the woe falls with all its weight? However great a perſon may be thought to be, he is quite unequal to a combat with his Maker, and is but an emmet of a larger ſize.</p>
            <p>The abilities of a writer, and the beauty of his ſtyle go far in gaining him proſelytes. Words are the dreſs of thoughts, whether thoſe thoughts are truths or lies; and the beauty of the dreſs, draws no ſmall ſhare of attention in favour of the writer. An attorney, who in the cauſe of falſehood employs all the force of eloquence, may ſo charm his hearers, that they will have no ear for plain truth, appearing in a plain dreſs, upon the oppoſite ſide; ſhow and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032052_0003_0FF0D990B77B2FA0"/>often captivate the inclination and draw with it the judgment in its favour.</p>
            <p>The force of the language of the Author of the Age of Reaſon is well known. The ſtrokes of his pen are ſufficient to convert many to any falſehood he wiſhes them to embrace. The world not long ſince, has been preſented with a ſpecimen of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, diſplayed againſt Him in whoſe hand his breath is. His pen dipped in the blackeſt falſehood, has ſhed blaſphemies againſt the Lord of Glory, who in the days of his fleſh, bore the blaſphemies of this man's predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>Sordid intereſt actuated his pen; he ſaw that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity was in the height of faſhion, and that blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Jeſus would turn to his worldly advantage; and like an attorney, ready to diſplay his talent in any cauſe whatever, he at once blaſphemes the word of God, trumpets his own fame, and gets his reward. Had he lived where it would have turned to his ignominy, it is preſumed his pieces had never ſeen the light.</p>
            <p>Could he have found his intereſt in painting the Chriſtian Religion in beautiful colours, it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no benefit from it; nor can it receive any dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age from his repreſentation of it. It ſtands on a baſis firm as the everlaſting mountains, the truth of God; and will triumph when men greater than he, and even kings ſhall call on the rocks to fall on them and hide them from the wrath of the lamb.</p>
            <p>Though multitudes are willingly carried away with plauſible language, in a caſe of life and death, and in the concerns of that life whoſe length no pen can deſcribe, yet none of God's deſigns in his word can be fruſtrated.</p>
            <p>The holy ſcriptures declare themſelves to be the word of the living God. No man may preſume to dictate in what way God's word ſhall be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. It muſt be in the way, which he pleaſes, who gives no account of his matters.</p>
            <p>It is written Pſalm 68, 11. The Lord gave out
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032052_0004_0FF0D992642C48D0"/>the word, great was the company of thoſe who pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it. The prophets, and apoſtles, and all that were inſpired, make up this company. Beautiful upon the mountains are their feet, bringing good news from a far country in on hand, and full evidence of their miſſion in the other. The teſtimony they bring is not their's but God's. It is the King's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and they are only heralds. It is written, where the word of a king is, there is power. The teſtimony in the ſcriptures is all divine. It ſtands high above all the aſſaults of the moſt ſubtle and powerful upon earth. The blows men aim againſt it recoll upon themſelves. He that ſits in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, laughs, and hath in deriſion, the moſt combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and malignant force employed againſt it. Pſalm 24.</p>
            <p>The teſtimony of God is not moved by any opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion which either individuals or even whole kingdoms may have about it. Its being the faſhion in France, or any other country, to make it of no effect to themſelves, by tradition, in one age, and in another, to reject thoſe traditions and the ſcriptures with them, does not affect the holy ſcriptures any more than the late convulſions and carnage in France affected the courſe or ſhining of the ſun in the heavens.</p>
            <p>Whole nations diſbelieving the word God, or perverting it from its native ſimplicity, and fathering their favourite plans upon it, does but fulfil its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies; the wiſdom of men plotting againſt it proves their own folly; their power employed againſt it works their own ruin. Great is the truth and will prevail. When the curtain drops, and this world of phantoms diſappears, realities will be brought into full view, to the anguiſh of many.</p>
            <p>Then it will be manifeſt, as if written with a ſun beam, that the ſcriptures are the word of that God whoſe voice ſpake the heavens and earth into exiſtence, and the ſame forcible voice which calls up the dead from their graves.</p>
            <p>Events in Europe, for a ſeries of ages have been a
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032052_0005_0FF0D9971F510B48"/>fulfilment of ſcripture prophecy, as to the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, growth and decline of the man of ſin; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of the preſent age, are a fulfilment of a part of that prophecy yet remaining to be completed. Matters are ripening for an iſſue which is little tho't of; and indeed it is foretold both that men ſhall not expect it, and that in the twinkling of an eye it will fearfully ſurprize them. When they ſay peace and ſafety then ſudden deſtruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child, and they ſhall not eſcape.</p>
            <p>Whether it will be allowed, that the boaſted reaſon of the preſent age hath been truly exemplified, and carried out into practice in France, the centre of it, I ſhall not examine; but it may be boldly affirmed, that the boaſted reaſon of this author leads a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a labyrinth of fond conjectures, and dreams, and there leaves him to periſh, and turn to corruption, in fearful apprehenſions of dreadful wrath beyond the grave; but the glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God aboliſhes death, brings life and immortality to light, plucks out the ſting of death, and preſents, as the only hope of guilty dying man, <hi>Him</hi> who is the reſurrection and the life; in whom he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live; and whoſoever liveth, and believeth in him, ſhall never die.</p>

            <head>LETTER I.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>DEAR SON,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TO deny divine Revelation or to hold the Truths it contains looſely is death. Senſible of your imminent Danger from a Deluge of Infidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and falſe Chriſtianity I addreſs you. But it can only come of God to teach you and me the things which belong to our peace before they are hid from our eyes. What I now write is deſigned as a preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary to other Letters upon the clear light of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation contraſted with the darkneſs of a boaſted age of reaſon. The expreſſion an age of reaſon is plauſible and captivating. The word rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is often abuſed and proſtituted to the vileſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. Men boaſt of reaſon, and every one is fond of being thought to be under its influence. In all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions a man entertains, in all actions which he does, he is ready to be perſuaded himſelf and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade others, that he is under the guidance of reaſon; In all contentions between individuals or bodies of men both oppoſite parties alledge that they are influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by reaſon. The ſame is true of nations at war, and what is called reaſon in one camp paſſes for its oppoſite in the other. The oppoſite opinions of men in religion are all profeſſedly grounded in reaſon on both ſides. In moſt of the practices of men however baſe, and even in the late barbarities in France, the actors no doubt alledged that they were governed by reaſon. Indeed the word reaſon, hath been a ſpecious cover for the vileſt opinions and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032052_0007_0FF0D99C19684D90"/>practices. The boaſted reaſon which men plead for, when examined, turns out to be the inclination of their hearts, or rather their luſts. We may ſee the ſpring and fountain head of this boaſted reaſon in the ſerpent's reaſoning to turn Eve aſide from the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple voice of revelation, and her own reaſoning cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding to his, which cloſes Gen. 3, 6. And when the woman ſaw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleaſant to the eyes, and a tree to be deſired to make one wiſe, ſhe took of the fruit thereof, and did eat. Three reaſons are in her view which encloſe three luſts; the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life, which taking the place of a regard to God's voice, brought ruin. Awful it is to depart in the leaſt from the voice of God, and give ear to our own luſt, under the name of reaſon.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle declares the weapons of their warfare to be mighty through God for caſting down logiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous reaſonings and every high thing which exalteth itſelf againſt the knowledge of God. Reaſonings are to be reckoned among the high things which thus ſtand exalted againſt the knowledge of him. The word rendered caſting down ſignifies utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhing, and in knowing the true God they are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly demoliſhed.</p>
            <p>But to proceed; it will one day appear, that men are as unreaſonable (ſo to ſpeak) in their reaſonings againſt the truth of God's word as they would be in reaſoning againſt the truth of the ſun's ſhining, though in the latter there is not that guilt.</p>
            <p>Should any one chuſe to argue that there was no Sun in the heavens, we ſhould be better employed in enjoying its influence, than in controverting with him. Should he chuſe to argue that there is no God, we ſhould be better employed, in attending to the plain evidence of conſcience, teſtifying that ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery breath we draw, every beat of the pulſe, every motion even of a finger, and every thought of the mind, proclaims a God, in whom we live, move and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032052_0008_0FF0D99DDC3052E8"/>have our being; while every thing above, and around us declares his glory.—So if any one chuſes to reaſon againſt the light of the glorious goſpel; we ſhould be better employed in attending to the clearneſs of that light, and to the Apoſtles, commending themſelves to every man's conſcience in the ſight of God, than in purſuing them, into their labyrinth of reaſonings; knowing that if the goſpel be hid it is hid to them who are loſt, and that the God of this world blinds the minds of them who believe not, leſt the light of the glorious goſpel ſhould ſhine unto them.</p>
            <p>The holy ſcriptures carry in themſelves evidence that God is the ſpeaker, and the truth of this is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced upon illiterate men who have not acceſs to profane hiſtory; and who are incapable of entering into argumentation. Indeed the ſcriptures are nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er believed in truth, but upon the bare teſtimony of God himſelf, ſpeaking in them, aſide from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane hiſtory, and men's reaſonings to prove them true. The Record, or the witneſs of the three in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, 1. John 5.7, 8, 9, is plainly the witneſs of the one God in three perſons, diſtinct from the witneſs of men. And it is there ſaid to be greater than the witneſs of men; and thus it proved among the firſt believers in its great effects, and thus it will prove among all whoſe faith is unfeigned, or who have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained like precious faith with them, through the righteouſneſs of God and their ſaviour.</p>
            <p>While we turn aſide from the common tract of reaſoning, the idea to be kept in full view, is, that the ſcriptures are the witneſs of God himſelf, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in themſelves evidence that they are his truth. This is the only conviction of their truth, that is to any purpoſe. As to any belief men may have, on account of the profeſſed belief of the country they live in, or the belief of their forefathers, or men whom they eſteem for religion; as it reſts on the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of men, it is as different as darkneſs from light from a belief grounded upon the record of God, and may be eaſily ſhaken, by the plauſible reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032052_0009_0FF0D9A1AF08EC90"/>or the ſneers of an infidel. Indeed the ſtep from ſuch faith to infidelity is ſhort and eaſy.</p>
            <p>The ſame ſhift from one to the other, which hath taken place in France, may eaſily take place in any other nation now profeſſing chriſtianity, when their worldly intereſts favours it, and it ſuits the policy of the nation.</p>
            <p>Among ourſelves we ſee thoſe who have received their chriſtianity by tradition, and not upon the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God, holding it by a very ſlender handle. They ſpeak of the ſcriptures as doubtful, dark and inconſiſtent with each other. Indeed <hi>they</hi> are tho't ſcarce able to ſupport any point of doctrine or prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, without the aid of ſome able voucher, and men find little more uſe for them, than to furniſh a jeſt, or ſhew their abilities in argument, and eloquence upon detached paſſages, or advance their intereſt by ſhaping what they profeſs to hold from them ſo as to ſuit the general taſte where they live. More confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is placed in the writings of Seneca, or ſome other wiſe pagan, by many who call themſelves chriſtians, than in the holy ſcriptures. And thoſe who would be eſteemed guardians of the word of God (which ſpurns at ſuch a thought) appear to be only guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of their own intereſts. The chriſtian world, ſo called, whoſe confidence is in the teſtimony of men and not the record of God, ſeeing their teachers ſo divided in opinion, and belief, as well as others, either reſt ſatisfied in utter uncertainty, or anxiouſly grope like men in the dark, not knowing which way to look for truth.—But leaving them I would juſt ſay that where the ſcripture is believed upon the teſtimony of God, it comes not in word only, but in power, and mighty indeed are its effects, which muſt be manifeſt to any one who reads with but ſmall attention, the lives of thoſe who were under its influence in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, which may be ſeen in the Acts of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and elſewhere.</p>

               <salute>DEAR SON,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE holy ſcriptures preſent themſelves, not as the word of man, but the word of God. They bear the ſtamp of divine truth, which accords with every man's conſcience, but is pointed like a ſword againſt every man's natural biaſs, and therefore cannot be the devide of man. Wherever they have had effect they have borne down the reaſonings and luſts of men.</p>
            <p>There hath been an univerſal ſtruggle of mankind againſt the ſcriptures, or the truth of God. The hiſtory of all ages, the hiſtory of all nations, even of the Jews the peculiar people ſhews it. Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in the wilderneſs, and in Canaan, and the united conduct of Jews and Gentiles towards Jeſus Chriſt, and the profeſſion of his name ſhews it. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt not only in perſecutions on account of it, but in corrupting and perverting it. A corruption of the truth is as really a ſtruggle againſt it as a direct oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to it; even as an attempt to take Jeſus by force and make him a King, was oppoſition to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as well as an attempt to root it out of the world. The corruption of the word of God in France in paſt ages was as really an oppoſition to the ſcriptures as their late rejection of them.</p>
            <p>Nations who are now holding the ſcripture cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted cannot boaſt of being leſs oppoſed to the Word of God, than France who has openly rejected it. All the nations who are now holding the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in ſubſerviency to their own luſts, maintain a ſtruggle againſt them as well as France. The oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the world to the truth which appeared in the days of the Apoſtles hath not failed of being kept up to this day, either in rejecting the ſcriptures or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting them. The world hath uniformly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained its oppoſition to the word of God in one way or other.</p>
            <p>The way in which the ſcriptures have gained ground has been by the mere dint of evidence, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12"
                   facs="unknown:032052_0011_0FF0D9A6829550E0"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>down men's reaſonings and inclinations; and this compelled the firſt publiſhers themſelves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſame truth they publiſhed to others, for to them as well as others, it was like a ſharp piercing two edged ſword.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle ſays, 2 Pet. 1, 16, We have not followed cunningly deviſed fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but were eye witneſſes of his majeſty, &amp;c. It cannot be conceived poſſible that Peter and others ſhould invent and publiſh a Fable, which was firſtly contrary to every natural inclination of their own hearts, and ſecondly would deſtroy every thing which they held dear; their intereſt, reputation, and comfort in life; and laſtly would lead them into ſevereſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings from the wrath of the world kindled againſt them, and bring life into the utmoſt danger, yea ſhould periſh in it unto the death. They muſt in ſuch caſe act contrary to every principle that can be in man, and it might as ſoon be expected to ſee the ſtones falling upwards.</p>
            <p>Nothing ſhort of a firm belief of the things they teſtified, could influence them to ſuffer the loſs of all things, and not count life itſelf dear; and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief was firmly grounded upon the divine teſtimony, ſet before them in the moſt convincing manner. The apoſtle ſays, we were eye witneſs of his majeſty. John ſays, 1ſt Epiſtle 1, 1.2, That which we have heard, ſeen and handled of the word of life, that which we have ſeen and heard declare we unto you, &amp;c. And God ſhewed his concurrence with their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by the miracles he wrought by them. And not only the Apoſtles but a multitude of others, ſealed the ſame teſtimony with their blood, in hope of life eternal through that truth; ſo far were they too, from the leaſt apprehenſions of its being a cunningly deviſed fable.</p>
            <p>The Teſtimony of the Apoſtles, and the Prophets alſo, center in one point, the reſurrection of Jeſus, after his being delivered for our offences; from
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032052_0012_0FF0D9A8D5F6DD20"/>whence alone ariſes hope to man. This fact eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the whole; and every part, both of the old teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament and the new, however wounderful, or unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable it may ſeem, is eſtabliſhed with it; and all ſeeming difficulties muſt vaniſh before it like miſts before the Sun. Many have ſcoffed at the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous things reported, ſuch as the account of Jonah, Samſon, &amp;c. but inſtead of being thought incredible to one who knows the ſcriptures and the power of God, they appear wonderful diſplays of the power of that God with whom nothing is impoſſible. They have taken upon them too to ſay that many things aſcribed to God in the ſcripture were unworthy of him, and have ſuppoſed themſelves competent judges what was becoming their Maker. Swelled with ſelf importance they do not conceive the diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and them, is far greater than between themſelves and a worm. A child or an ideot, dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a wiſe general or politician is not to be heeded. The diſparity between the wiſeſt man, and his Maker is far greater; and it is the higheſt preſumption to determine what is fit and becoming him, whoſe ways are as far above ours, as the heavens are higher than the earth.</p>
            <p>While the twelve authoriſed witneſſes of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Jeſus, declared God's teſtimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Son, and men ſaw what an effect it had on them, and beheld the miracles which God wro't by them, they were led to ſay that God was with them of a truth; and this teſtimony is not merely their's, but God's: and they conſidered God himſelf ſpeaking by their mouth. Thus it is ſaid of ſome of them, 1 Theſs. 2, 13, that when they received the word of God which they heard from the Apoſtles they received it not as the word of man but as it is in truth the word of God. In like manner when this teſtimony of God which was firſt communicated by the voice of the Apoſtles, was afterwards commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by their writings, in this way too, the word
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032052_0013_0FF0D9AA70EFE888"/>was received not as the word of man but as it is in truth the word of God. The ſame is true of all the ſacred writings. The holy ſcriptures then preſent themſelves not as the word of man but as the word of God. They point out God to be their author, without a train of reaſoning, as the works of creation point out God to be their creator. He is read in one, as he is in the other.—They draw a black portrait of this lower world as under the curſe, ſhew that every man by nature is a child of wrath, that every mouth muſt be ſtopped, and that the whole world is become guilty before God, and that no fleſh can be juſtified in his ſight in any way but through him who was made a curſe in their ſtead, and thereby redeemed them from the curſe. They give a portrait of the character of Jeſus Chriſt. They preſent to us his features, his likeneſs. He is called the Word of God and there is that in them which bears his reſemblance as the impreſſion does that of the ſeal which makes it. As the world ſtood affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him ſo they are affected to the word of God. Of himſelf he ſays, the world hateth me becauſe I teſtify of its works that they are evil. The ſcriptures fully maintain the ſame teſtimony, and incur the ſame hatred. The profeſſed liking of many is no more than that of the Jews to Jeſus, when they would fain make him a temporal King; which very thing proceeded from a diſreliſh of his real character. Men's hatred of the real truth in the ſcriptures hath been abundantly manifeſt in perverting and putting a falſe meaning to the words, as well as an open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of them. It is natural to all men, though fallen, to ſtand for what they think are their rights before their Maker, and to ſtand oppoſed to what appears to invade them; and as the word of God like a ſharp two-edged ſword gives a fatal ſtab to them, and to every hope of man aſide from the death and reſurrection of Jeſus, leaving nothing but a fearful looking for of fiery indignation; it is impoſſible that the world ſhould receive it, otherwiſe than corrupted
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032052_0014_0FF0D9AD6BE580C8"/>and perverted from its native ſimplicity. It appears impoſſible in the nature of things that any man or number of men ſhould invent a plan of Religion like this, ſo oppoſite to the biaſs of their own hearts; and the hearts of all others, with a view to its ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the world, without either worldly weapons or allurements; and utterly impoſſible it ſhould ſpread if it could be ſuppoſed to be diviſed. Could we make the ſuppoſition that there were no ſcriptures in the world at this time. We cannot conceive it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that they being fabulous ſhould thus ſpread, nor indeed that they ſhould be invented. So it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been the caſe as human nature is the ſame in all ages i. e. oppoſed to them as they alſo teſtify.</p>
            <p>The fact is obvious to all that they actually have ſpread over the world, teſtifying men's guilt, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope, in ſpite of the oppoſition of the world; and it cannot poſſibly be accounted for in any way but this, that they are in truth the word of God; that Jeſus Chriſt the ſon of God, who gave his life a ranſom was raiſed from the dead; and that ocular demonſtration of this led the apoſtles at the riſque of life to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Salvation through him alone, in oppoſition to the world of Jews and Gentiles combined againſt it.</p>
            <p>This teſtimony confirmed by miracles and ſealed with their own blood forced attention in mankind, contrary to their deſire, and made its way againſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent oppoſition of heart, and was mighty through God to the pulling down their ſtrong holds.—This Teſtimony was carried far and wide, and when men in various parts of the world, ſaw the boldneſs of theſe witneſſes, and that their life was embarked in their teſtimony, and beheld their miracles, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſaw their blood ſhed, in full hope of eternal life through the Lord Jeſus, they were awed about that which they ſtood oppoſed to, they had great reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings among them; they wiſhed to appear upon friendly terms with that which exceedingly troubled them. They uſed their arts with profeſſors to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032052_0015_0FF0D9AFFB5A36C0"/>them to lower down the force of the divine teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony ſo to ſpeak, to parley and to league with them. This had its effect on multitudes who had grown weary of the croſs themſelves. This coalition ſpread ſo far that in the days of Conſtantine the great, the minds of his ſubjects were ſo much in favour of chriſtianity thus modified, that it appeared conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with ſound policy to eſtabliſh it, in room of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm as the religion of the Roman empire called the whole world. But before it was eſtabliſhed, it ceaſed to be what it was at firſt. It became another Goſpel or the goſpel of Chriſt perverted. Here was a wide gate and a broad way opened, under the chriſtian name, which they ſuppoſed led to life, and that many were going in thereat. From that day the world has adopted the name of chriſtianity, in ſome form or other. The name has been retained, but the thing was loſt or wrapt in darkneſs. The continuance of the ſcriptures is hence eaſily accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for. From this time being conſtrued to men's liking, they have been forced to become a tool of ſtate, and an inſtrument of gain to prieſts, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times locked them up from the common people, or when they let them out compelled men to take their interpretations of ſcripture, for the ſcripture itſelf. The word of God in their hands foretold, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againſt the corruption which they were bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facedly guilty of, as may be ſeen 2 Theſ. 2 chap. 1. Tim. 4, 1.4. 2 Tim. 3 chap. 2 Pet. 2d and 3d chapters, the Epiſtle of Jude, and the book of Revelations.</p>
            <p>Thus becauſe they knew him not, nor the voices of the apoſtles, they fulfilled them; as the Jews long before had fulfilled the voices of the prophets reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jeſus. Acts 13, 27. The conduct of nations called chriſtian, in every age ſince, in conformity to thoſe mentioned, has been a ſtanding fulfilment of the prophecies above, and an evidence of the truth of the divine teſtimony.</p>
            <p>To return, it appears impoſſible to conceive of the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032052_0016_0FF0D9B420E21358"/>ſcriptures having ſo great a ſpread in any other way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that the mind is as it were reined up to the time when the teſtimony was firſt publiſhed, and led to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to that forcible evidence which had ſo mighty an effect on many, and occaſioned a general awe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, which led them to corrupt and eſtabliſh chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>At this preſent time God is ſtill upholding the ſame teſtimony by the writings of the prophets and apoſtles, though men would fain drown his voice by the noiſy clamour of lo here and lo there, and by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to palm that upon them for his truth, which he has never ſpoken. His voice is ſtill teſtifying to the world that its works are evil, and that there is no hope for any man aſide from Chriſt Jeſus. Its awful repreſentation of the character of mankind or men, of which a ſummary is given in the three firſt chapters of the Romans, is confirmed by the hiſtory it gives of their conduct from age to age; witneſs the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Antideluvians, Babel-builders, Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, Egyptians, Aſſyrians, &amp;c. It is confirmed in the account it gives of the Jews from age to age in the wilderneſs, in Canaan, before and after the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, when the Meſſiah came and was among them, and after his crucifixion till the deſtruction of their city and temple and utter diſperſion.</p>
            <p>The Scripture does not ſtop like the hiſtories of men with informing of events which have taken place, but proceeds to give a hiſtory of the future down to the end of time. It brings to view a conſtant war againſt the truth carried on by the old ſerpent, the devil or ſatan, deceiving and conducting all nations in the conflict, who are made drunk with the wine of the wrath of the fornication of the great whore, who pretending to be the ſpouſe of Jeſus commits fornication with the Kings of the earth who dreſs her out in rich apparel. Strikingly this has been verified in the wealth and honours both clergy and churches have obtained by a cloſe connexion with civil rulers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:032052_0017_0FF0D9B5F1942768"/>
But to return, ſuch is the divine teſtimony of mankind and ſuch the correſponding hiſtory. And there is no room for any to ſtand forth and ſay we are better than they; no in no wiſe, for there is none righteous no not one. In the view of all nations, ages, and of our own characters, the heart of a man muſt die within him, were it not for one character which knew no ſin, but was made ſin for his people that they might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him. The ſcriptures then in all ages and at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, beſpeak themſelves to be the word of the moſt high God. The Book proclaims itſelf divine. It is ſaid John 8.47. He that is of God heareth God's words, which implies that God is heard in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction from any man. And again 1 John 4.8. We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us, he that is not of God heareth not us. The Apoſtles were appointed his ambaſſadors that by their mouth men might hear the words of God, and the words ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or written by them are God's words.</p>
            <p>In confirmation of the divine truth of the ſcriptures I might mention the fulfilment of their prophecy in the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, and various other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. The Jews remaining a diſtinct people among all nations to this day, is a ſtanding evidence of their truth. Another ſtanding evidence is the great whore committing fornication with the kings of the earth which hath lived thus deliciouſly for ages; though it is true ſhe is now declining faſt with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. And this too confirms their teſtimony; and particularly what hath happened in France of late appears a fulfilment of what is ſaid Rev. 17, 16, of hating the whore and making her deſolate and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. The prophecy of Peter 2 Epiſt. 2. 1, 2. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears alſo fulfilled, where ſhewing that falſe teachers ſhould riſe under the chriſtian profeſſion followed by multitudes, ſays by reaſon of them the way of truth ſhall be evil ſpoken of. The People of France in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed at the pernicious ways of the prieſts take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032052_0018_0FF0D9B7C04EC7F8"/>hence to vilify the ſcriptures the way of truth. Although this is more or leſs true in every country yet there it appears in a ſtriking manner. And au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors take occaſion to vilify the ſcriptures in connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with the clergy, as if there had been ſome affinity between them, and the ſhame of their practices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the ſcriptures. Yea they open their mouths in the moſt daring blaſphemies againſt God's Word, and againſt Jeſus Chriſt, who is the brightneſs of his Glory, and the expreſs Image of his perſon. Theſe things inſtead of weakening, confirm the faith of God's people, as they thereby ſee the prophecies ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>

               <salute>DEAR SON,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE ſeparation of the children of Iſrael from all other nations, in conformity to the ſcriptures, and their continuing diſtinct from them, for a ſeries of ages, in the obſervance of laws, which it is the bias of man's heart to break away from; laws which made them a laughing flock to all other people, and their holding that teſtimony ſacred which condemned their own conduct entirely, and left them without hope aſide from mere mercy through the promiſed Meſiah, theſe are a ſtrong evidence of the truth of the revelation which they held to. Here was a whole nation kept together in this manner againſt their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclinations, a whole nation profeſſing a firm belief of a revelation from God, a whole nation wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of miracles, a whole nation to judge whether there were any tricks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or impoſitions, and that not merely for a day or a year, but for a ſucceſſion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, a nation too that often ſhewed their inclination to turn away from God, and to be conformed to other nations, but contrary to their bias were brought
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032052_0019_0FF0D9BBB174FAF0"/>back by threatnings and judgements.—In their courſe for ages they were led contrary to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural bias by the direction of the Lord, as the two milch cows mentioned 1 Sam. 6.10, &amp;c. on whom there had come no yoke, went ſtraight away from their calves tied up at home, drawing the ark of God in a new cart, lowing as they went. As the hand of God was manifeſt, in leading the cows a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their bias, ſo it was manifeſt in leading Iſrael, both in the wilderneſs, and in Canaan; and one is an emblem of the other.</p>
            <p>Iſrael was under the guidance of the lively Oracles of God, though it is true that they often rebelled.</p>
            <p>The oracles to which pagans reſorted for informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, probably took their riſe from what was obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the Jews. But the children of Iſrael had recourſe to an Oracle indeed, and had information from the moſt high God. When an oracle gives information, that voice alone, in diſtinction from all others, is the object of attention. When God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed any thing to Iſrael, every word that he utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, claimed their utmoſt attention. The Scriptures, the lively oracles of God, claim the ſole attention, and are jealous of any voice being attended to aſide from them. There is no attention due to any man whatever, any further than his voice echoes (as I may ſay) the voice of the Oracle.</p>
            <p>When Pharaoh applied for the interpretation of his dream, Joſeph anſwers, it is not in me, God ſhall give Pharaoh an anſwer of peace. And while the anſwer comes from his own mouth, he ſays again, God hath ſhewed Pharaoh what he is about to do. Gen. 41.16, 28. So Daniel ſaith, 2 c. 30 v. on a like occaſion, but as for me this ſecret is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to me, for any wiſdom that I have more than any living; but he aſſerts that there is a God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who revealeth ſecrets.—None of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, or Apoſtles, make any more account of their own voices, when declaring what God ſpake by them.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032052_0020_0FF0D9BE32F93990"/>Paul ſays, 2 Cor. 4.7, But we have this treaſure in earthen veſſels that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. An earthen veſſel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining gold and ſilver is overlooked, the treaſure gains the whole attention. Again he thanks God 1 Theſs. 2, 13, that when they received the word of God by his mouth, they did not receive it as his own word, but as it was indeed the word of God. And he informs, 1 Cor. 1, 1-6, that when he came to them declaring the Teſtimony of God, he came not with excellency of ſpeech, wiſdom, enticing words, but was with them in weakneſs and fear, and much trembling, and it was that their belief ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God. He would be himſelf as it were thrown aſide, as a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed guilty ſinner, that the teſtimony of God, of which he was the bearer, might have all its weight. He alſo tells the Galatians, to hold him accurſed if he ſhould preach any other Goſpel to them, than what God had already declared by his mouth. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo aſſerts the ſame even reſpecting an angel from heaven. The ſcriptures in the plaineſt and moſt expreſs manner hold forth the idea, that God is the ſpeaker in them. Dives in torments, is reminded that if his brethren to whom he wiſhed to give war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, did not hear Moſes and the prophets, they would not be perſuaded by his riſing from the dead to warn them of the horrors of that torment, which he felt, and to which he ſuppoſed them advancing. This implies that God's voice by Moſes and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, was the only means of repentance. A multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of paſſages expreſsly mention God as the ſpeaker in the ſcriptures, it may ſuffice to quote a few only. The apoſtle quoting a paſſage from the Pſalms ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly aſcribes the words to God Heb. 3, 7, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Holy Ghoſt faith to day if ye will hear his voice, &amp;c. The prophet Iſaiah pointing forward to the goſpel day, ſays, chap. 52, 6, Therefore my people ſhall know my name; therefore they ſhall
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032052_0021_0FF0D9C210228DE0"/>know in that day that I am he that doth ſpeak, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it is I. Language cannot more clearly expreſs both that God is the ſpeaker, and that he is alſo known to be ſo by his people. But I would more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly notice Heb. 1.1, 2. God who at ſundry times and in divers manners ſpake to the fathers by the prophets hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken to us by his ſon. Here God is held forth as the ſpeaker in the whole revelation which the Jews ever had by means of the prophets. God hath ſpoken at what time he ſaw fit. He himſelf hath choſen the manner of ſpeaking, whether by a voice himſelf or by a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; whether an Angel or a man; whether by voice or writing. He is above all controul in this matter. And we find even earthly princes claim a right of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing their ſubjects, in the way they themſelves chuſe.</p>
            <p>It hath pleaſed God moſt high, that his revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his people in the ſeveral ages of the world, ſhould be chiefly by writing, and that they ſhould look to the law and teſtimony and reject every voice that ſpake not according to that word. The greateſt ſtreſs is laid upon what was written. The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels each of the temptations of Satan in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſaying it is written thus, &amp;c. Mat. 4 chap. Again he ſays, Luke 24, 44, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer, &amp;c. And Mat. 26, 44, But how then ſhall the ſcriptures or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings be fulfilled, that thus it muſt be.</p>
            <p>Whatever God hath ſpoken by voice or writing hath been attended with evidence that he was the ſpeaker. When Moſes had a meſſage to Pharoah he gave evidence that God ſent him. Exod. 7, 9.10. And ſo it was too in his meſſages to Iſrael. The fame may be ſaid as to all the prophets and all the apoſtles.</p>
            <p>In the beginning it ſeems that divine Revelation was preſerved not by writing, but in the memory of the faithful, which being comprized in few words,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032052_0022_0FF0D9C7C876E690"/>might be more eaſily retained; and the great length of man's age facilitated the preſervation of it in this way. A revelation of the only hope of man was made to our firſt parents immediately after the fall, in the faith of which the ſaints lived. It is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary we ſhould know all the evidence attending its being handed down to poſterity: I would only make one remark here, viz. that the lives of the faithful, and the lives and oppoſition of the ſeed of the ſerpent both, were at this time and in all ages a confirmation of the divine teſtimony, and an evidence of in truth.—We read not of any writing till Moſes. Then whatever he wrote under inſpitation, reſpecting what had paſſed before, or took place in his own time, became a ſtanding revelation for the Church in all ages. Additions were made to the revelation afterwards before their eyes, which when written, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged the book called the ſcriptures. Time after time additions were made, till the whole of the old teſtament was completed, which was probably about the time of Ezra.</p>
            <p>Theſe Revelations were made to God's choſen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the oracles of God in writing were put in their cuſtody; and they were taught to regard them alone as the pure voice of God. A departure from this idea of them gave riſe to the Talmud, a roll of traditions, by which they made the ſcriptures of no effect; as Jeſus charged them with doing and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for doctrines the commandments of men. The Apoſtle Peter points to this, 2. Epis. 2, 1 and ſhews that the ſame thing ſhould take place under the Goſpel, which prediction has ſince come to paſs.</p>
            <p>Through the courſe of revelation the grand point was from time to time more clearly revealed, till the fulneſs of the time was come, and God ſent forth his Son made of a woman. The whole law was a ſchool maſter to lead unto Chriſt, the end of the law for righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>The appearance of the Son of God, was like the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032052_0023_0FF0D9CC77915398"/>riſing of the ſun. We was uſhered in by his forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner John, by the miniſtry of Angels, and by many wonderful things which took place at his birth. His life, doctrine, miracles, death and reſurrection, were a clear revelation to them who ſaw and heard; and when committed to writing by the Apoſtles, became a ſtanding revelation to his Chruch. And what was further communicated to the Apoſtles, to whom God bare witneſs by ſigns, and miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, was a continuation of the revelation, and when written were to be a completion, of the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which began in the days of Jeſus. The Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles did not barely profeſs to be God's ambaſſadors as ſome do at this day, but proved they were ſo by their miracles. They had their credentials to ſhew it with the broad ſeal of heaven affixed to them. And what theſe choſen witneſſes teſtified, finiſhed the whole of God's revelation to man, which cloſes with an awful threatening to any man that ſhall add to, or take from the words of God, Rev. 22.18, 19.</p>
            <p>The divine Record is then cloſed, and as to any new revelations, dreams and viſions, we may cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaunt! It becomes with full purpoſe to turn a deaf ear to the noiſy multitude, crying lo here and lo there, knowing that God is as really ſpeaking, as if he were on earth, and that it is at our peril to have any other reſort. To take our idea of the ſcripture doctrine one from another, is no more than receiving the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man, but we are aſſured, that he who believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not God, hath made him a liar, becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not the record which God gave of his ſon, 1. John 5.10, the Apoſtle ſays, let God be true and every man a liar; and again it is ſaid, curſed be the man who truſteth in man, and bleſſed is the man who truſteth in the Lord.</p>
            <p>The Holy Ghoſt by the apoſtle gives a ſolemn caution, Heb. 12.25. See that you refuſe not him who ſpeaketh; for if they eſcaped not who refuſed him, who ſpake on earth, much more ſhall not we if
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032052_0024_0FF0D9CF15829B68"/>we turn away from him who ſpeaketh from heaven. Fearful will be the conſequence of attending to the words of man, inſtead of the words of God.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this letter with a paſſage of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Heb. 10.28, 31. He that deſpiſed Moſes' law died without mercy under two or three witneſſes. Of how much ſorer puniſhment ſuppoſe ye ſhall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was ſanctified an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite unto the ſpirit of Grace. For we know him that hath ſaid Vengeance belongeth unto me, &amp;c. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>

            <p>THE inviſible things of God from the creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. Conſcience agrees with this teſtimony of the Apoſtle. But while the works of creation enforce the thought that there is an eternal God, they give not the leaſt information, how ſinful man ſhall obtain his favour. It is not in the power of human reaſon to point this out. The reaſonings of the world in all ages, have not afforded the leaſt ſpark of light in this matter. Their oppoſition to each other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims their blindneſs. The whole world is in total darkneſs in this matter, and from the light of divine revelation. It is not uncommon for thoſe at the greateſt remove from light, to think themſelves moſt enlightened. Every age is ready to boaſt of their light in Religion. Many have imagined, that men's light in religion has kept pace with their improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Arts and Sciences; and that thoſe ages
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032052_0025_0FF0D989BA3EC058"/>wherein theſe have flouriſhed moſt, have had moſt knowledge in religion. But there is no period of human Hiſtory which has had any light at all in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, aſide from Revelation. I will mention an age which other ages have agreed to eſteem an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened age of the world. It was the Age when the Lord Jeſus, and his Apoſtles, were on earth. Then the Greeks were in high renown for wiſdom; then the Roman Empire having ſubdued the world, was in all its ſplendor, the Jews at the ſame time boaſted of high improvements in religion.</p>
            <p>I will now introduce what the Holy Ghoſt ſays of it. See Iſaiah 60, 4. ſpeaking of the time when the redeemer ſhould come to Zion, he ſays: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the darkneſs ſhall cover the earth, and groſs darkneſs the people, but the Lord ſhall ariſe upon thee and his glory ſhall be ſeen upon thee and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhall come to thy light, &amp;c. See again Luke 1.78, 79. The day ſpring from on high hath viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, to give light to them who ſit in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the <hi>Shadow of Death,</hi> Acts. 26.17.18. Delivering thee from the people and the nations to whom now I ſend thee to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light and from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Satan to God, that they may receive forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins, &amp;c. We may connect with it Iſ. 42, 6, 7. I the Lord have called thee, &amp;c. and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a light of the Gentiles to open the blind eyes, to bring out the priſoners from the priſon, and them that ſit in darkneſs out of the priſon houſe, &amp;c.—Theſe may ſuffice to point out the horrors of that darkneſs which then overſpread the world, amidſt all their boaſted light. It is pointed out as under the dominion of the prince of darkneſs, as in the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of priſoners in a dark dungeon, and the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſitting in the ſhadow of death is enough to make one ſhudder.</p>
            <p>To paſs by other periods we may juſt notice that
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:032052_0026_0FF0D9D8A95DBCA8"/>the preſent age is ſuppoſed to be very enlightened, and perhaps men never boaſted more of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements and light in religion. But let the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs diverſity of ſentiments, with that profeſſed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for men of almoſt any ſentiment, and doubtleſs in every point of doctrine, ſpeak for itſelf, what light there is in the preſent age. I would only ſay that the preſent time is doubtleſs incloſed within that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod mentioned, Rev. 8, 13. Wo, wo, wo, to the inhabiters of the earth, by reaſon of the other voices of the trumpet of the three Angels, which are yet to ſound. Indeed the whole of that hiſtory of the future, the book of revelations, points out the earth as covered with darkneſs and full of the habitations of cruelty. It is true the ſcriptures are among men, but they cover that light from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, wreſting the ſcriptures to their own deſtruction. They love darkneſs rather than light. The Light ſhineth in darkneſs, but the darkneſs comprehendeth it not.—The pleaſing words with which men have amuſed each other, are like ſiren ſongs to lull to ſleep, and fortify their minds againſt fear of that wrath which they may ſee purſuing man down to the grave, and may well lead to tremble with fearful apprehenſions of what follows after death. Did men ſee their real ſituation with regard to their maker, black deſpair muſt cover the earth, aſide from the knowledge of him, who ſays of himſelf, I am the light of the world. The holy ſcriptures which teſtify of him, diffuſe light abroad, and contain glad tidings of great joy to all ſorts of people. Bleſſed are the people who know the joyful ſound, and who while they have the light, believe in the light, that they may be children of light.</p>

               <salute>DEAR SON,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE voice of God in the ſcriptures, is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain head of all information in religion. If our eyes be turned off from them, to any reaſonings of our own, or reaſonings of others, they meet nothing but darkneſs. While God calls for the ſole attention, he points out the danger of its being turned off any where elſe. He ſays beware of men, and take heed that no man deceive you. The caution is very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that there be no man in whoſe favour you are ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed, who ſhould be ſuffered to inſinuate a thought different from what God has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. Obedience to this command implies a moſt firm and unſhaken reliance on the voice of God alone—As the word of God is the only light, ſo that alone binds the conſcience. So that the conſcience of every man living is ſet at the moſt entire liberty, from every other man in the world, and is ſubjected alone to that God with whom he has to do. Thoſe who in truth hold divine revelation carry this Motto, Let God be true and every man a liar. They contend for the truth of God at all riſques though it ſhould lead to hold their moſt darling friends li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars. This truth is called the faith once delivered to the ſaints, for which Chriſtians are exhorted ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to contend Jude 2. It was once delivered while revelation was compleating, and when that was finiſhed, there is no more delivering of it, but the word the delivered is to run through all the Earth as the witneſs or record of God. It is ſaid I John, 5.7, &amp;c. That there are three which bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in heaven, which three are one, and this wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is ſaid to be greater than the witneſs of men, and 10th verſe, He that believeth not God hath made him a liar, becauſe he believeth not the record which God gave of his ſon. Here is pointed out ſtrongly that God's teſtimony is more forceable, and carries higher evidence than man's; and that
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:032052_0028_0FF0D9DE372BEE90"/>thoſe who do not believe upon his teſtimony, give God the lie. It is only in holding things revealed true upon God's teſtimony, that men hold God true; in holding them falſe, they hold God a liar. All knowledge approved of in Scripture comes from God. It is ſaid, John 6.45, It is written in the prophets they ſhall all be taught of God, every man therefore that hath heard and learned of the father cometh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. So it is ſaid of the holy ghoſt, he ſhall bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I have ſaid unto you. It is by revelation that the father teaches, and it is only truth of revelation which the holy Ghoſt brings to remembrance.</p>
            <p>We have the language of the new covenant, Heb. 8.10, 11. I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts. And they ſhall not teach every man his neighbour and brother ſaying, know the Lord, for all ſhall know me, &amp;c. Here divine rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elation written in the mind by God himſelf is pointed out as the only teaching, inſtead of man's teaching.</p>
            <p>The Lord in oppoſition to the Phariſees in the 23 <abbr>d.</abbr> Mat. 8, 9 verſes ſays, But be not ye called Rabbi, for one is your maſter even Chriſt, and all ye are brethren. And call no man father on earth, for one is your father which is in heaven. The Diſciples caſting their eyes upon the world of Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, ſaw men at that time as we may ſee them now, teaching and taught one of another, in religion (aſide from God's teaching) and placing dependence on one another, as a child upon a father or maſter. But the Lord will not ſuffer it to be ſo among them. There was not a man on earth, whom they were to look up to as a father and maſter, either to teach or govern in religion. While God alone was to be viewed as a father, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a maſter, they were to think of each other merely as brethren. And no man could be conſidered even as a chriſtian brother, only as he appeared ſubject to the ſame father and maker alone. It is added nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ye called maſters, &amp;c. 10th v. How far
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032052_0029_0FF0D9E096CBFFA0"/>they ſhould be from exerciſing authority over one another we read, Mark 10, 42, 44. After ſpeaking of the great ones among the Gentiles exerciſing au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon them, he ſays, ſo ſhall it not be among you. Whoſoever of you will be chiefeſt ſhall be the ſervant of all.</p>
            <p>The voice of God in the beginning called out diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and ſubjected them to him as a father, and to Chriſt as a maſter, and the diſcovery of this ſubjection in each other, brought them together as brethren, ſubject to one father and led them to the mutual of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of brotherly love. Thus Churches were raiſed up, and kept together who are called Chriſt's ſheep, and heard his voice, and followed him. Nor are we allowed to think of Chriſt's diſciples or churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made in any other way.</p>
            <p>But pretended diſciples are influenced by the voice of man inſtead of God's voice. Though they may profeſs ſome regard for God's word, yet they take their underſtanding of Scripture from men, and not from God alone, and the word of God is made of none effect through their tradition. Worldly church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are brought together by human perſuaſion and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oquence, by the faſhion of the country where they live, by worldly allurements, and in ſome caſes by human authority and worldly force; and by the ſame means are they kept together. And it is far from their thought that churches can be formed, and held together by the power of the divine word, aſide from human aid. Yet that muſt hold true ſpoken, Zech. 4, 6. Not by might, nor by power, but by my ſpirit, ſaith the Lord of hoſts. And we are not allowed to ſpeak of any ſpirit but what ſpeaks in the ſcriptures. For the Lord ſays of the Holy Ghoſt he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf—he ſhall take of mine and ſhew it unto you—and whatſoever he hears that ſhall he ſpeak—and the things which Jeſus ſpeaks he brings to remembrance. His agency appears to be entirely in and about the ſcriptures. The words of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:032052_0030_0FF0D9E2D03ACCE8"/>revelation then they are ſpirit and they are life agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to John 6.6, 3.—The effect of God's teaching in revelation at firſt was to make the diſciples of one heart and one ſoul. The effect of man's teaching appears, in the diverſity of opinions at this day, and in the language being divided, and confounded, as in the building of Babel. The miſchiefs which have followed man's uſurping the place of God in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and exerciſing authority, are manifeſt every where, not merely in the mother of Harlots but in her numerous train of proſtitute daughters. Human teaching has led mankind to aſſociate together in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſects, holding doctrines and ways of their own. Each of their ſects hath looked for heads, leaders and teachers, in religion, as in the common arts or profeſſions in life; and have trained up youths to a more thorough knowledge of <hi>their</hi> plan of religion, that they may become teachers, and leaders to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct others, and defend their faith whatever that faith happens to be. And here is ſuppoſed to be the fountain head of information; and here it is judged proper to reſort for inſtruction, as we reſort to men trained up to any art or ſcience, to get informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about it. It is true this is not the only refort for inſtruction, for it is common for every man to teach his neighbour and in his turn to be taught by him. In general there is no dependance on any thing elſe but human teaching in religion, for though ſome individuals profeſſedly reſort to the ſcriptures, yet it appears that they will have no weight with them againſt the peremptory aſſertion of a darling teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in whom the higheſt confidence is placed.</p>
            <p>It is not denied that human teaching has in the concerns of this world contributed greatly to the ſtock of knowledge. This is manifeſt in the mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical arts, in navigation, commerce, huſbandry, &amp;c. So exerciſing human authority has had a ſalutary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the ſocieties of this world, ſecuring life and property and promoting order. But in the concerns
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:032052_0031_0FF0D9E4ACC019B8"/>of that life beyond the grave, they both have had an oppoſire effect.</p>
            <p>In the early days of chriſtianity, it was agreeable to the natural bias of man's heart, (even as it is now) to thirſt for ſome teaching beſide God's, and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from his, and ſo they heaped to themſelves teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, having itching ears who turned them from 'the truth to fables. In like manner they were impatient of being under the entire controul of God in his word, and were deſirous that man ſhould ſhare the authority with him, and their conſciences became ſubjected to human authority. They allowed their biſhops the authority of a father and they were each called Papa, or Pope, in expreſs oppoſition to thoſe words call no man father on earth. Though the name was confined afterwards to the Biſhop of Rome as the general father, yet all the reſt were ſtill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as having the authority of ſubordinate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtants as the name denotes, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt ſome of the enormities of the Church of Rome; ſtill in general they are fond that man's teaching, ſhould take the place of God's teaching by his word, and man's rule and authority, ſhould take the place of his entire ſway. Indeed their not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to ſpeak in his word ſo that he can be well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by men of ordinary capacity, at once robs him of his prerogative of teaching &amp; ruling both, for no one can either teach or rule if his words are unintelligible.</p>
            <p>Men ſlattered themſelves no doubt when they were departing from the authority of God, in his word that they were aiding his cauſe and advancing his kingdom. A grand kingdom has been built up it is true under the chriſtian name as is manifeſt in the Church of Rome, and other national eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Grand temples have been erected, pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous ſervices introduced, which in ſplendor might vie with the ancient pagan temples and ſervices, in whoſe place they came. Theſe have drawn admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032052_0032_0FF0D9E73A16BE28"/>on earth, but none from him who fled; when they would once have taken him by force, and made him a king. When the Supreme God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

            </opener>
            <p>ONE confirmation of the divine truth of the holy Scriptures, is, that inconteſtible facts forcibly ſet forth the ſame teſtimony with the Scriptures, in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances while men practically deny both. I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtance the teſtimony of both ſcripture and fact; as to the wiſdom of this world in matters of religion, which mankind are bent to make high account of, againſt their joint evidence of its vanity. See. 1 Cor. 1.19, 22. It is written I will deſtroy the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the wiſe, and bring to nothing the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the prudent. Where is the wife? Where is the ſcribe? Where is the diſputer of this world? Hath not God made fooliſh the wiſdom of this world? For after that in the wiſdom of God, the world by wiſdom knew not God, it pleaſed God by the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs of preaching, to ſave them who believe, ver. 27. God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe. 3 chap. 19, 20. The wiſdom of this world is fooliſhneſs with God, for it is written
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:032052_0033_0FF0D9EC26C264D0"/>he taketh the wiſe in their own craftineſs; and again, the Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wiſe, that they are vain, 182. If any man among you ſeemeth to be wiſe, let him become a fool that he may be wiſe. The words need no comment. We cannot conceive of language more forceably pouring contempt upon all that wiſdom ſo highly eſteemed among men.</p>
            <p>This teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt concerning the wiſdom of this world, was ſtrikingly illuſtrated by facts, in the Apoſtle's day; and it is not leſs ſo in the preſent day. The more a perſon is informed of the ſeveral religious opinions that have been, or are now in the world, the more full will be his evidence of this truth. The vaſt variety of ſects and plans of religion in the world, which are oppoſite to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have been the product of man's wiſdom; for in the firſt place they originated from wiſe men, who invented and ſet them afoot, for if each ſect was tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to its beginning, it would appear that its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was a wiſe man of more than ordinary capacity. Secondly, wiſe men have been ſelected, as teachers, champions, and defenders of them from age to age; and though there may be a difference as to their wiſdom, yet the ſtreſs of their defence has been upon men that were the moſt wiſe. Thirdly, they have moſtly been under the patronage of civil rulers, who are allowed in general to be of the wifeſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and theſe have exerted their power, in connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with the religious teachers, to build up the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that is in faſhion, among their ſubjects, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be. In this way, moſt, if not all the ſects in religion, have been reared up and ſupported, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting each other. Thus human wiſdom appears in the whole affair, and as it were ſtands proclaiming its own folly, inconſiſtency, and contradiction.</p>
            <p>Should one apply to the wiſeſt man in France, or China, or any other country, for information about religion; each of them might appear to anſwer wife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but no one aſide from revelation could produce
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:032052_0034_0FF0D9EDD25D33D0"/>more than a mere conjecture, couched in wiſdom of words, and probably their anſwers would be all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory.</p>
            <p>Human wiſdom by cooking the ſcriptures for men's palates, hath not only raiſed up a multitude of ſects, called chriſtian, but alſo hath led them mutually to eſteem each other for wiſdom, and piety; while hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doctrines and practices oppoſite to each other. They care not what reputation the truth of God has, and it will be ſuffered to fall in the ſtreet, provided they extract to themſelves a name for wiſdom and piety, with an eaſy living. Here indignation might riſe, but God ſays vengeance is mine! We may be ſure that truth will prevail, and all its purpoſes will be fulfilled. To ſome it will be the favour of life unto life, and to others, of death unto death. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py they who are made partakers of its afflictions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the power of God, who calls them with an holy calling, according to his own purpoſe and grace, given them in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world began.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>DEAR SON,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE may now turn our attention to the ſcriptures as the only ſafe guide in religion, and altogether ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the grand purpoſe of man's ſalvation. Simon Peter upon a particular occaſion ſays, Lord to whom ſhall we go, thou haſt the words of eternal life. The words of Jeſus in the ſcriptures are the words of eternal life. How they are ſo appears Acts 11.14. Who ſhall tell the words whereby thou and all thy houſe ſhall be ſaved. It is ſaid, the excellency of knowledge is, that wiſdom giveth life to them that have it. Eccles. 7.11. It is expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared to be life eternal to know the only true God and Jeſus Chriſt whom he has ſent, John 17.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032052_0035_0FF0D9F083955008"/>This knowledge is conveyed only through the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Jeſus alſo prays, ſanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth. We are told, Pſalm 12. 6. The words of the Lord are pure words as ſilver tried in a furnace, purified ſeven times. The Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt's 19th Pſalm, after pointing to the heavens as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the glory of God, and ſetting before us his handy work, &amp;c. in the 7th verſe, and on, ſhews the far ſuperiour light of revelation as perfect; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the ſoul, making wiſe the ſimple, enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eyes, rejoicing the heart, &amp;c. and then ſpeaks of it as more to be deſired than fine gold, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the honey-comb. Upon a certain woman's crying out, bleſſed is the womb that bare thee, &amp;c. Jeſus replies, yea rather bleſſed are they that hear the word of God and keep it, Luke 11.28. He rather fixes the bleſſedneſs here, than upon even being the parent of the ſon of God. The firſt of his parables, that of the ſower which is recorded by three evangeliſts and cloſes with this cry, he that hath ears to hear let him hear, points out that as the harveſt origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates from the ſeed caſt into the ground ſo his own harveſt which was to be gathered in at laſt, would all originate from that ſeed the word of God. So that whatever is great, good, or deſirable in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom riſes from that ſeed the word of God. He how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhews that where it is not underſtood, is catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away by Satan, or is choaked with cares, the ſeed is made of none effect. It is ſaid Jam. 1.18, of his own will begat he us with the <hi>word</hi> of truth, &amp;c and 2.12. Wherefore lay apart all filthineſs, &amp;c. and receive with meekneſs the <hi>engrafted word</hi> which is <hi>able</hi> to ſave your ſouls. It is well known that a graft inſerted in a thorn buſh will bear fruit parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of its own nature, and not that of the thorn: So the word of God engrafted, bears fruit as it is ſaid, Coloſſ. 1.6. That the word of the truth of the Goſpel bringeth forth fruit. They are ſaid to be begotten by it, and it is expreſsly ſaid to be <hi>able</hi> to
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:032052_0036_0FF0D9F3A3144D08"/>ſave the ſoul.—The Apoſtle Peter ſpeaks of the ſaints as being born again of incorruptible ſeed by the <hi>word of God</hi> which liveth and abideth forever. He then ſpeaks of all fleſh as graſs, and all the glory of man as the flower of graſs, but the word of the Lord endureth forever, and this is the word which by the Goſpel is preached unto you while all fleſh turns to corruption, and all their glory withers, the word of the Goſpel is held forth for dying man to confide in, as everliving, and able to give him life, though he finds his fleſh and his heart are failing. How excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent this word!</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle ſays of Timothy, that from a child, he had known the holy ſcriptures which are able to make wiſe to ſalvation, and then adds, all ſcripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs; that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furniſhed unto all good works, 2 Tim. 3.15, 17. At parting with the elders at Epheſus he ſays, Acts 20.32. And now brethren I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to God, and to the <hi>word</hi> of his grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance among all them who are ſanctified, &amp;c. We may notice three expreſſions quoted above, James ſays it is able to ſave the ſoul. The paſſage from Timothy ſays, it is able to make wiſe to ſalvation, this laſt quoted ſays, it is able to build up and give the inheritance, &amp;c. They are full to one purpoſe. And the Apoſtle commends his brethren only to God and this word as all-ſufficient. There had been no ſafety in commending to any man, however eminent, or to his own ſtrength, or any thing under the ſun but the word of God's grace.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, Deut. 8.3. And he humbled thee, &amp;c. that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread alone, but by <hi>every word</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord, doth man live. Jeſus in reply to the tempter quotes theſe
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:032052_0037_0FF0D9F7912E2D98"/>words, Mat. 4.4. The end of Iſrael's ſevere trials, was to bring to this point of knowledge, that God's word was their life, and as man's natural life muſt fail without ſuſtenance, ſo his life beyond the grave muſt fail but for the word of God. Agreeably we read the juſt or juſtified ſhall live by faith or through the truth believed. The grandeur of the ſubject ſeems to forbid deſcending to any particular notice of the length men have run in vilifying this word, which one would think ſcarcely poſſible had he not daily evidence ſet before him.</p>
            <p>One text more may be noticed, Iſ. 55.10, 11, 12. For as the rain cometh down and the ſnow from heaven, and returneth not thither again but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give ſeed to the ſower and bread to the eater, ſo ſhall my word be which goeth out of my mouth, it ſhall not return to me void, but it ſhall accompliſh that which I pleaſe, and it ſhall proſper in the thing whereto I ſent it. Here we are reminded whoſe mouth it proceeds from to inſpire with awe: it is cloathed with the authority of him who ſpeaks. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain it is like the rain, which fails not to clothe the earth with verdure, and furniſh ſuſtenance for man and beaſt, miniſtering life and vigour. All the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, life, and vigour of Chriſt's kingdom ariſes from the word of his mouth. And this word doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to him void, like a meſſenger unable to perform his errand; but fully accompliſhes the purpoſe for which it is ſent forth. It effects all that God deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it ſhould on the earth.</p>
            <p>The word from the ſame mouth at firſt ſaid, let their be light, and failed not of producing it. It ſaid alſo, let the earth bring forth graſs, and herb, yielding ſeed and the fruit tree yielding fruit, whoſe ſeed is in itſelf, after his kind, and its force continues in vegetation from year to year; as alſo the ſource of that word be fruitful and multiply and repleniſh the earth, continues renewing the face of the earth, though
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:032052_0038_0FF0D9F934EDB690"/>one generation paſſeth away, after another. So his word in the ſcriptures hath had, and ſtill will have its full effect, in gathering in all his choſen people, that not one be loſt. And though an apoſtle may be bound, yet the word of God is not bound. Yea thoſe things which appear like checking its progreſs, often turn out to the furtherance of it. It hath its free courſe, and makes its way through gates of braſs, and bars of iron. Without human aid it will triumph over all the force of men and the powers of hell.</p>
            <p>Its effects are not ſplendid in this world, in the eyes of thoſe who like the Jews, are thinking of a temporal kingdom for the Meſſiah. The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom formed by it, cometh not with obſervation. A bruiſed reed and the ſmoking flax are fit emblems of it. But hereafter it will appear conformable to him, who though once crucified in weakneſs ſhall appear in his glory as the only potentate, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Paint muſt be our conception of the ſplendor of his kingdom at that day, when thoſe whom he calls his ſheep, who hear his voice, and follow him, in ſufferings; are all ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in one general aſſembly, to ſhare in his glory, and ſhall appear as one grand royal family, crowned with glory and honor and immortality. Then the iſſue of hearing God's voice in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will be ſtrikingly manifeſt, while this world is ſmoaking in ruins.</p>

               <salute>DEAR SON,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SUNDRY ſtriking paſſages of Scripture upon the energy of God's word were omitted in my laſt, which I will mention in this, and finiſh with ſome remarks upon the reſiſtance the truth has met with in the world.—It is ſaid, Jer. 23.29. Is not my word like as a fire, ſaith the Lord? and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces? Heb. 4.12. For the word of God is quick (or living) and powerful and ſharper than any two-edged ſword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. It is ſaid of numbers who received it that they were pricked in their heart. While it gives a deadly ſtab, it conveys a ſalutary balſam. While it demoliſhes the hopes of man, it preſents a grand reaſon of hope through the blood of Jeſus.—Its force as the grand weapon of the Apoſtle is expreſſed, 2 Cor. 10.4. For the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God; to the pulling down ſtrong holds, caſting down reaſonings and every high thing which exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth itſelf againſt the knowledge of God, bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt.—This brings to mind the idea of a ſtrong fortreſs demoliſhed by powerful artillery. Mighty were the effects of God's word in the Apoſtle's days. It came not in word only but in power and in the holy ghoſt, and in much aſſurance. It wrought effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in them. They turned from idols to God, to ſerve the living God and wait for his ſon from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, 1 Theſſ. 1.9, 10. The courſe of the whole could of witneſſes mentioned Heb. 11th chap. and the courſe of their followers under the new teſtament was oppoſite to the courſe of this world and to the bias of their own hearts. They were influenced by the word of God and ſomething ſupernatural appears in their courſe all one way, as if a ſtream ſhould turn about and run towards its ſource.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:032052_0040_0FF0D9FEB6E6D710"/>
The two witneſſes which prophecy 1260 days, cloathed in ſackcloth, called the two olive trees, and the two candleſticks ſtanding before the God of the whole earth appear to be the old and new teſtament, and it is ſaid if any man hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies, and they have power to ſhut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy to turn water to blood and to ſmite the earth with plagues as often as they will, as God's word of old did by Moſes, ſee Rev. 11.3, 7. The fulfilment of their prophecy particularly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſeven trumpets and ſeven vials is ſmiting the earth with plagues, and in the juſt judgment of God falls on thoſe who received not the love of the truth. Their ſhutting heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy appears to point to the ſame thing mentioned Rev. 7.1, under the ſimilitude of holding the four winds of the earth, the conſequence of which is dearth and deſtruction. As to fire proceeding out of their mouth and devouring their enemies, it leads us to think of the laſt effect of the ſcriptures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe who abuſe them, and reminds of what Jeſus ſays, John 12.18. He that rejecteth me and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge him at the laſt day. Here we ſee the power of the ſupreme judge as it were attributed to the word of God in the laſt awful deciſion. Then their threatnings will burſt forth like fire which had been long concealed, vom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited from their mouth, and it will appear that heaven and earth ſhall ſooner paſs away than one jot or tittle of them ſhall fail.—The concluſion of the whole book of revelation points out the curſes of the man that ſhall dare to add to or take from the words of God, Rev. 22.18, 19.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, Pſalm 138.2. Thou haſt magnified thy word above all thy name. The voice of the Lord is indeed powerful and full of majeſty. His word called up the heavens and earth into exiſtence,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:032052_0041_0FF0DA0232AB8EC0"/>Heb. 11.3. And the heavens and earth which are now by the ſame word are kept in ſtore reſerved unto fire, 2 Pet. 3.7. And the hour is coming when all that are in their graves ſhall hear his voice and come forth to the reſurrection of life, or reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of damnation. John 5.28, 29.—God's voice in the ſcriptures is from the ſame mouth, and deems it no uſurpation to be counted equal with that voice which raiſes the dead.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of mankind as to believing this holy word, is not unlike that of the Jews, who under clear evidence came round Jeſus ſaying, how long doſt thou make us to doubt, if thou be the Chriſt tell us plainly.</p>
            <p>However light the ſcripture is accounted among men, yet Jeſus Chriſt is ſaid to tremble at this word. For thus ſpeaks he whoſe throne is the heaven, If. 66.2. To this man will I look to him who is poor and of a contrite ſpirit, and <hi>trembleth at my word.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">This paſſage muſt be underſtood to refer to Jeſus Chriſt in whom alone God is well pleaſed.</note> And as to thoſe who tremble at the ſame word in conformity to him it is ſaid, 5th verſe, Hear the word of the Lord ye that <hi>tremble at his word,</hi> your brethren who hated you and caſt you out for my names ſake ſaid, let the Lord be glorified, but he ſhall appear to your joy and they ſhall be aſhamed. Jeſus declares, Mark 8.38, that whoever is aſhamed of his words, of him he will be aſhamed when he comes in his glory. The Saints in every age, afraid of their own luſts under the ſpecious ſhew of reaſon, have thought themſelves bound to believe what they are told by God, and to do as they are bidden by him, wiithout adding or diminiſhing, avoiding vain reaſonings. They have been from age to age in the midſt of an adulterous generation, who under a boaſt of reaſon have always reſiſted the truth. And no doubt but that a boaſt of reaſon hath run through
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:032052_0042_0FF0DA0410636388"/>the whole reſiſtance it hath met with from infidels and corrupters of the truth, whether we think of Pharaoh, Korah and company, the Iſraelites propoſing a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to lead back to Egypt, or oppoſed to the report of the ſpies, or the whole reſiſtance in the wilderneſs and Canaan, by men of their own body or nations round them. No doubt but that the Jews boaſted of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in all their perverſe cavils againſt Jeſus, under the light of ſtriking miracles, and in putting him to death. The ſame is true as to men's conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Apoſtles. The ſame is true as to the church of Rome profeſſing to hold the word of God ſacred, and yet making it of no effect through their traditions (as the Jews had done before) in whom was found the blood of many who were ſlain for the <hi>word of God.</hi> So at this day while multitudes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to hold the ſcriptures to be the word of God, they openly deny its plaineſt truths, even that Jeſus Chriſt is the ſon of God—that there is ſalvation in no other—and that he who believeth not ſhall be damned, contrary to plain aſſertions of the holy Ghoſt. The boaſted light of reaſon has been the dictates of their own luſts, and not the light of their conſcience. As to ſuch unhappy men, the Apoſtle ſays, 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. But if our goſpel be hid, it is hid to them who are loſt. In whom the God of this world hath blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the minds of them who believe not, leſt the light of the glorious goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them. They ſtumble at the ſtumbling ſtone laid in Zion. They ſtumble at the <hi>word,</hi> being diſobedient, whereunto alſo they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed 1 Pet. 2.8. The fearful lengths men have gone, are a fulfilment of ſeveral prophecies, particularly 2 Theſs. 2 chap. which foretels the riſe of falſe chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity under the energy of Satan, and that for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions that they ſhould believe a lie, that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, ſee 2.11, 12 v. Here is alſo mention
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:032052_0043_0FF0E33225C69FB0"/>that this man of ſin ſhould be deſtroyed by the brightneſs of his coming. And from prophetic com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation it appears, that the time of the ſecond viſit of Jeſus is not far diſtant, when we are aſſured it ſhall be as it was in the days of Noah and in the days of Lot. It becomes thoſe who have an ear to hear him ſaying, behold I come as a thief, and to bear in mind that exhortation, Heb. 2.1, 5. Therefore we ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things we have heard leſt at any time we let them ſlip. For if the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion received a juſt recompence of reward. How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them who heard him; God alſo bearing witneſs both with ſigns and wonders, and with divers miracles and gifts of the holy Ghoſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own will.</p>
