            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN defiance of a doctrine which DESPOTS have taught their <hi>Slaves,</hi> that INGRATITUDE is the vice of a REPUBLIC, WE are aſſembled my FELLOW CITIZENS at the recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our GOVERNMENT, to commemorate the virtues and deplore the loſs of the BENEFACTOR of OUR COUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRY—WASHINGTON is no more! The man to whom under GOD, we are indebted for the ineſtimable bleſſings of INDEPENDENCE, <hi>ſleeps the ſleep</hi> of DEATH! The ARM, which has protected from <hi>rapine</hi> the <hi>fruits</hi> of our SOIL, and from <hi>violence</hi> the <hi>chaſtity</hi> of our FAIR, FOW moulders with its kindred duſt! The TONGUE which by its <hi>mildneſs</hi> has ſo often charmed the ſoul of ſenſibility, and by its <hi>energy</hi> has "ſpoken daggers to a tyrant," is huſhed in eternal ſilence! The STAR which guided our watchmen to their political ſalvation has ſet in GLORY.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:036800_0004_100B10C1ADC6FA98"/>
Arrogance would be a mild epithet for the man, who ſhould attempt by his rhetoric or his eloquence to give ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional luſtre to a character already beyond the voice of eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.—Ours is the melancholy, yet pleaſing duty ſimply to record the glorious deeds, and to call into recollection the important ſervices which were performed by this JOSHUA of our land, for the benefit of OUR FATHERS, OURSELVES and POSTERITY.</p>
            <p>In the firſt ſtage of his political career, we find him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the government of Virginia to a truſt honourable and important; and this too at a period of his life when pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic HOPE could ſcarcely be ſuppoſed to have ripened into CONFIDENCE.</p>
            <p>The hiſtory of our warfare on the frontiers with the FRENCH and the NATIVES introduces us to a ſecond acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with our departed FRIEND and warmly engages our feelings in his intereſt, by its recital of the memorable defeat of the brave, but imprudent BRADDOCK. Had this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate General been guided by the advice of the man, though
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:036800_0005_100B10C3A7B90D58"/>
               <hi>young</hi> in ARMS, yet <hi>ſage</hi> in COUNSEL, in all human probabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity the diſaſters of that melancholy day had been averted.— But Heaven allotted a reward to the courage and circumſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of WASHINGTON, to him has juſtly been aſcribed the glory of covering the retreat, and ſaving the remains of that ſlaughtered army. From this period, his talents were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the more particular ſervice of his native ſtate, until his appointment to the command of our confederated troops. —At this <hi>epoch,</hi> ſo diſtinguiſhed in the annals of liberty, the cruel, the unnatural, the damnable arrogation of ſupreme power by the Britiſh government demanded the united and determined oppoſition of our Nation—the demand was not unheard, nor its efficacy unfelt—our Congreſs had modeſtly petitioned, and the petition was diſcarded, it had manful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remonſtrated, and the remonſtrance was ridiculed.—Duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and affectionate as had been the then Colonies to their parent country, it would be impoſſible for the human mind to explore a cauſe for the conduct of the latter, were it not known, that it was governed by a Parliament diveſted of <hi>principle,</hi> and a Monarch deſtitute of <hi>intellect.</hi>—But Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca was not to be lulled into ſlavery—the corruption, which
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036800_0006_100B10C533B78468"/>originated, and the folly which ſupported the deſign of invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our liberties, was early penetrated by the centinels of our freedom. To combat the deſigns of this unprovoked ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, it became neceſſary that an army ſhould be raiſed and of courſe that a leader ſhould be appointed. The GUARDIAN GENIUS of our county ſurely preſided on that auſpicious hour, which depoſited this all-important truſt in the hands of WASHINGTON.—My FELLOW CITIZENS, let the FIFTEENTH DAY OF JUNE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE be <hi>hallowed</hi> in our memories. Reflect, that on that day your EARTHLY FATHER unſheathed his ſword in the defence of your RIGHTS and that it never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to its ſcabbard till your WRONGS were avenged— guided by his "ruling paſſion" the love of his country, he relinquiſhed domeſtic happineſs, and with a nobleneſs of mind peculiar to himſelf, refuſed the pecuniary emoluments of his ſtation.—The acceptance of this important command naturally led him to the ſeat of war, and on the ſecond of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly following, he commenced his official duty at Cambridge— but a few months ſucceeded, and the term for which our lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle army had enliſted expired.—Many of you, my fellow
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036800_0007_100B10C8111CEBA0"/>citizens, can recollect, and thoſe of us who cannot, have been told, that "darkneſs, clouds and ſhadows" then reſted upon our country—patriotiſm had not ſo far gained an aſcendency that a body of naked, unfed, unpaid and undiſciplined troops would patiently ſubmit to the hardſhips of war, and, far from their homes, encounter the inclemencies of an approaching winter—liberty, majeſtic as is her form, ſeemed to faulter in her ſteps at the apparent indifference of her diſciples. Her eye had loſt its luſtre, and her garb was ſackcloth.—This was a <hi>criſis</hi> in our political diſeaſe, which requited the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of a WASHINGTON to ſupport. <hi>His</hi> was framed by Heaven to meet the MALADY, to counteract its <hi>priſon,</hi> and to mock its <hi>terrors.</hi> Neither intimidated by the formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable appearance of a neighboring and a veteran foe, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the diſtracted ſituation of the army which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, he philoſophically planned and calmly purſued thoſe meaſures, which reſtored the inhabitants of our capital to the enjoyment of their former poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>On this occaſion, it muſt be unneceſſary to recapitulate the ſcenes of our revolution, for the purpoſe of pourtraying the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036800_0008_100B10C998C41A68"/>brilliant features of WASHINGTON.—Every father knows, and it is preſumed has taught his children, that dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gloomy periods of the conteſt his courage was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken and his ardour unabated; that in the ſplendid and glorious career of his victories, he never forgot that he was the ſervant of his country—dreary muſt have been his proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects at Long Iſland and through the Jerſies, yet his fortitude did not forſake him—his brilliant ſucceſs at York Town, tho' noticed with religious gratitude, ſeemed little to elate that tranquil mind, which adverſity could not depreſs. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on the juſtice of that Being, whom WE ſacredly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked at the commencement of our hoſtilities, with fervent hope and humble dependence to him, he entruſted the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of that important queſtion, whether "ALL MEN" were, or were not, "born FREE AND EQUAL." The decrees of HEAVEN ſanctioned the declaration of our rights, and the PILOT of our choice having encountered perils and tempeſts, conducted our POLITICAL BARQUE to the haven of INDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENDENCE. Crowned with laurels of unfading luſtre, he left the "tented field," and his pathetic farewell and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn addreſs to the diſbanding army evinced that the wiſdom
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036800_0009_100B10CC288B41D8"/>of the SAGE was not inferiour to the valour of the HERO. The commiſſion which had been reluctantly accepted was cheerfully reſigned, and the MAN who had ſaved an EMPIRE retired to the ſhades of private life.—Had the turbulent ſpirit of a CAESAR or a CROMWELL been implanted in the breaſt of WASHINGTON, what human power could have affixed the limits or preſcribed the terms of his dominion? An army of which he was the Idol, diſaffected with what they conſidered the ingratitude of our government, and irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the artful ſuggeſtions of deſigning incendiaries, was almoſt ripened for revolt and ready to point their weapons at the boſom of their country.—A nod, a ſmile of approbation from their chief would have been ſufficient to have "let looſe the dogs of civil war," and to have placed a fortunate and a favorite commander in any ſtation to which his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might have aſpired. Happy is it for America and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to the cauſe of univerſal liberty, that a "reſtleſs and ungoverned temper" was not WASHINGTON's. As anxious to huſh the murmurs of his fellow-ſoldiers, as he had been eager to lead them to victory and honor, his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036800_0010_100B10CDF71B44F0"/>eloquence and confident aſſurances effectually ſilenced the voice of diſcontent, and diſarmed the Daemons of inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>But a few months of peace and independence had been enjoyed, when experience taught us, that the nerves of our government were too weak for a regular ſyſtem.—The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation, which had been adopted in the exigency of the moment, was mouldering to decay; its ſtrength was inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſupport its own weight, and our young Republic was tottering to its ruin. The elders of our country, the prophets of our land, alarmed at the impending danger, laid the baſis and reared the columns of that glorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution which WE now enjoy, and which, under a wiſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, will effectually ſecure our privilegesi and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect our dignity.</p>
            <p>In the year one thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty-nine, WASHINGTON was elected PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES, and again left the repoſe of private life, for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous and reſponſible duties of that important ſtation. It
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036800_0011_100B10D0D9E42898"/>would be an impeachment of the gratitude of my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to remind them, with what devotion he then dedicated his time and his talents to their ſervice.—It muſt be engraven on every heart, and the recollection can never depart but with the departure of our exiſtence.</p>
            <p>While our feelings are thus gratefully alive, let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the ſacred legacy which he left his conſtituents, at the time of his reſignation of office—ſo long as truth ſhall be believed, and wiſdom revered, ſhall WASHINGTON's "FAREWELL ADDRESS" be claſſed with the firſt of human productions.</p>
            <p>Fatigued with the weight of government, he modeſtly retires again to private life, and is again called forth to the command of our armies. In conformity to the wiſhes of the people whom he loved, he accepted the appointment, and although age had ſcattered its wrinkles on the MAN, the WARRIOR was yet in bloom.—Here the curtain muſt drop! The public life of this GREAT man cloſes, for he pays the <hi>dept of nature.</hi>—This day, had Providence permitted, would
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036800_0012_100B10D2D3836068"/>have completed the <hi>ſixty-eighth</hi> year of a life of unſullied vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and unrivalled glory—but he is gone! His expiring moments witneſſed his FORTITUDE and his RELIGION, and ANGELS now ſmile on their COMPANION.</p>
