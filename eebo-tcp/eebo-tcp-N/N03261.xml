            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

What <hi>Abraham's</hi> Servant propoſed by Way of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Suppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>peradventure the Woman would not be willing to follow him,</hi> verſ. 5. I have Reaſon to uſe as Matter of doleful Complaint and bitter Lamentation over many of you, whom former Attempts have fail'd to perſwade to this Marriage, and alſo as an Excitement to awful fear and paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate concerns now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham's</hi> Servant was engag'd or bound by Oath to be <hi>faithful in the Buſineſs he was ſent about,</hi> vers. 9. And you know Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I am under a ſolemn Ordination Oath, to be faithful to God and you; this I hope will excuſe for my endeavour to deal with you in good earneſt.</p>
            <p>Again in the Context you may obſerve, that if the Servant uſed faithful Endeavours, <hi>and the Woman would not be perſwaded then he was to be clear from his Oath:</hi> So, Friends, if after all the endeavours I can uſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade and reclaim you, ye ſtil continue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, I ſhall be free from the Oath I have taken, and from your Blood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham's</hi> Servant had good Succeſs, the God of his Maſter proſper'd his Way; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beca,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:003965_0005_1003198D92CA2288"/>readily conſented and ſaid <hi>I will go,</hi> vers. 58.

Whoſe great Buſineſs, it is to perſwade poor Souls to conſent to embrace him as their Lord and Huſband, in an everlaſting Marriage Covenant, its hardly credible that this Story would have been Reſolved in ſo minute Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, had not a nobler and more myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Marriage been deſign'd to be repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Under this view the Text preſents to our Conſiderations, the 2. Propoſitions, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>That the Miniſters of Chriſt are Spokeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for the Marriage of their Maſters Son,</hi> —and.</item>

            </list>
            <p>I return to conſider the firſt <hi>Propoſ.</hi> In Explaining of which, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew the Analogy between a Spokeſman in a temporal Marriage, and a Miniſters Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003965_0006_1003198F14B42BC0"/>and practice in negotiating a ſpiritual Marriage, between Chriſt and Souls, and ſo improve it; the Analogy, I think, conſiſts principally in the following Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Spokeſman ſhould be ſkillful, able with apt Expreſſions to ſet forth the Lovers Excellencies; ſo a Miniſter ſhould be no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but like <hi>Apollos, Mighty in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and thereby able in ſome Meaſure to ſpeak forth his Redeemers Praiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Acquainted with his Perſon; for how can they commend him whom they do not know: So ſhould Miniſters know Chriſt and the Truth as it is in him; otherwiſe they ſpeake but faintly for him. <hi>The Secrets of the Lord are with thoſe that fear him, and he will remember his holy Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. True to his intereſt, a Spokeſman ſhould be a familiar Friend of the Lover, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his Cauſe; <hi>Abraham's</hi> Servant was ſuch whom he appointed to get a Wife for his Son: And ſo muſt the Miniſters of Chriſt be, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.14.15. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>And I thank Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, for that he counted me faithful putting me into the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</hi> Jer. 23.31. <hi>I am againſt theſe Prophets, that ſmooth their Tongues,</hi>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:003965_0007_10031990DC57A550"/>
4. A Spokeſman uſeth a Variety of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, to alure the Love of the Perſon he treats with to his Maſter, drawn from his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Merit and great Affluence: So the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt Labour to win the Affections of undone Sinners to him, by ſetting forth his Greatneſs, Goodneſs, Suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, Abſolute Neceſſity, Tranſcendent Excellency, and inexhauſtible All ſuficiency.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A faithful Spokeſman is griev'd to ſee his great Maſter ſlighted, and his moſt preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Arguments, and his perſwaſive Adreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes fail of deſired Succeſs; he can't be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with telling of his Narrative without ſeeing it take Effect, this our Text confirms, — So a godly Miniſter is not ſatisfy'd with the Performance of Preaching as a Taſk, and the Obſervance of Sinners attent upon it, unleſs he can perceive ſome Signs of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his Preaching, ſome Signs of Sinners conſenting to embrace the Redeemer.</p>
            <p n="6">6. A faithful Spokeſman will not only Addreſs the Woman to whom he is ſent, but alſo make Application to Heaven, for Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Succeſs, this did <hi>Abraham's</hi> Servant, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. <hi>And he ſaid, O Lord God of my Maſter</hi> Abraham, <hi>I pray thee ſend me good Speed this Day, and ſhew kindneſs unto my Maſter</hi> Abraham. So do the Miniſters of Chriſt bow their Knees to the moſt high God, of whom the whole Family in Heaven and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003965_0008_10031999671683F8"/>Earth is Named, and vehemently entreat for Guidence and Succe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>. Permit me, kind Hearers, to ſupplicate the ſupreme Majeſty, in the Words of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Servant, with ſome ſmall Variation. O Lord God of my Maſter Jeſus, ſend me good Speed this Day, and ſhew Kindneſs unto my Maſter; in cauſing ſome poor Sinners conſent to a Marriage with him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. A Faithful Servant, if he ſucceeds in his Negotiation, returns the due Honours of his ſucceſſes to God, ſo did <hi>Eliezer,</hi> vers. 27. <hi>And He ſaid, bleſſed be the Lord God of my Maſter</hi> Abraham, <hi>who hath not left deſtitute my Maſter of his Mercy and of his Truth:</hi> So the Heart of a faithfull Miniſter, when he ſees poor Sinners return to their offended Sovereign, and Kiſs the Son with the deepeſt Homage, Affection and Obedience, beats in his Boſom with joyfull Tranſports and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Emotions of undiſſembled praiſe to God, God and the Lamb that fits upon the Throne.</p>

            <p>Behold, poor Sinners, the Stately glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and joyful Triumphs of <hi>Emanuel</hi>'s Country!

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Propoſition, viz. That the faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt, are grieved to ſee the Treaty of their Maſter's Marriage hang in ſuſpence.</hi> This was the ſad ſource of the pious Prophet's mournful Complaints, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 49 4. — <hi>I have laboured in vain, I have ſpent my Strength for nought, Iſ.</hi> 53.1. <hi>who hath believed our Report?</hi> And <hi>to whom is the Arm of the Lord reveal'd?</hi> Micha. 7.1.2. <hi>Wo is me, for I am as when they have gathered the Summer Fruits, as the Grape gleanings of the Vintage: There is no cluſter to Eat. My Soul deſired the firſt ripe Fruit; the good Man is periſhed out of the Earth, and there is none upright among Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to hold any Thing in <hi>Suſpence,</hi> is to remain undetermined in our Choice concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, to <hi>halt between two Opinions,</hi> waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometimes to one Object and ſometimes to another.</p>
            <p>That too many are guilty of this pernicious Practice appears from both Scripture and Reaſon. 1. <hi>King.</hi> 18.21. <hi>And Elijah came
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:003965_0040_10031A05D1BA9300"/>unto all the People, and ſaid, how long halt ye between two Opinions; if the Lord be God, follow him; But if</hi> Baal, <hi>then follow him.</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>I know thy Works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then becauſe thou art luke-warm, and neither cold nor hot, I will ſpue thee out of my Mouth.</hi> Zec. 1.11. — <hi>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all the Earth ſitteth ſtill and is at reſt.</hi> The ſtillneſs of many about the concerns of their Souls, whoſe lives are notwithſtanding very broken and miſerable, their indifference about heavenly Things, both in Speech and Practice and in the mean Time their <hi>eager Purſuit</hi> of Earthly, both by unſeaſonable, yea, everlaſting Diſcourſes, about ſuch <hi>Traſh,</hi> and by their ſinful Contrivances and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Labours to amaſs great worldly Treaſurs, notwithſtanding of their contrary Profeſſion, Pretences, Obligations, are too plain Proofs of the Propoſition, to be denied by any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Man.</p>
            <p>The general <hi>Cauſes</hi> of this <hi>Suſpence,</hi> are theſe following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Ignorance,</hi> both of the Nature of God, true <hi>Religion,</hi> and their own Danger. If Men had juſt Apprehenſions of the bleſſed God, and perceived the beautiful attractive Perfections of his Nature, they could not (even the dulleſt Souls) but be fired and charmed with his raviſhing Glories, and freely chuſe
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:003965_0041_10031A0DD09BF7E8"/>him as their Maſter and Portion; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, had Men but true Notions, of the Nature, Neceſſity, and Excellency of Religion, they would doubtleſs make it the Object of their voluntary Choice and Matter of their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Practice, becauſe its Precepts contain ſuch Beauty and Equity in them, its promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſuch Springs of Sweetneſs, and its threats ſuch Majeſty and Terror. Were unhappy Sinners but thoroughly ſhaken off the Lees of their carnal Security and falſe Hope, and made ſenſible of their preſent danger and miſery, they would no longer be luke-warm and indifferent, but endeavour <hi>to take Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven my Storm.</hi> Mat. 11.12. O Sinner, ſee and conſider the danger of ignorance repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente in dreadful Colours in the following Places of Scripture, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 27.11. — <hi>For it is a People of no Underſtanding: Therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and, he that formed them will ſhew them no favour.</hi> 2. Theſ. 1.7.8.9. — <hi>When the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels in flaming Fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Deſtruction from the Preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Love of Sin, this is conatural to us, becauſe we <hi>were ſhapen in Iniquity. Pſ.</hi> 51.5.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:003965_0042_10031A0F533CCE00"/>
               <hi>Job.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 48.8. <hi>Job.</hi> 11.12. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. Hence we have a ſtrong yea brutiſh proneſs naturaly to commit it in deſpight of Reaſon, and Conſcience. <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Every one turns to his Courſe as the Horſe ruſheth into the Battle.</hi> ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 1.3. This corrupt byaſs being ſo inveterate and ſtrong, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dificultly broken, and ſo a powerful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt the Sinners compliance with the Terms and Performance of the Duties of Religion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Policy</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>The God of this World,</hi> (ſo the Devil is called catchreſticaly becauſe of his uſurped and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive Dominion) <hi>hath blinded the Minds of them which believe not, leaſt the Light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the Image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi> The Devil tells them, that there is no great evil in in ſmall Sins. I mean thoſe that are reckoned ſuch, not that any Sin can be in it ſelf ſmall, no, unleſs there can be found a ſmall or little Deity. The Sins muſt needs be great, that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt him. The Devil will liſten in to their Ears, that there is no great hurt in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting the Hearing of the Word ſometimes, and other Duties of Religion, and in taking worldly Diſcourſe on the Lord's Day, and keeping bad Company. As alſo that there is no ſuch Difficulty in Religion, as ſome ſtrict Preachers and People profeſs. Again,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:003965_0043_10031A10DCE385E8"/>that God is merciful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that Chriſt has died for the worſt of Sinners, that it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for them to take pains about Religion, in their prime and ſtrength (for that he ſuggeſts, would be to bid adue to all Pleaſures) ſeeing they can ſecure their happineſs by a late Repentance. Now after Satan has hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them in Sin after this Manner, if they chance to be awakened by the Word, or Providence, he quickly alters his Note, and tells them that the Day of Grace is over, or that they have committed the unpardonable Sin; their Iniquities are too great to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and therefore that its too late to repent. If they had begun ſooner in the Service of God, or ſinned leſs againſt him they might have expected Mercy from him; but now their Sins are ſo great that they had as good leave of ſtriving, they muſt periſh. To antidote theſe poiſonous deſtructive Deluſions of the Devil. I ſhall referr you to the following Scriptures, which you may read at your lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 58.13. <hi>Pro.</hi> 13.20. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.24. <hi>Ex.</hi> 34.7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.39. <hi>Ecleſ.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.24.28. <hi>Pro.</hi> 29.1. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.11. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 42.3. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 25.11.</p>

Alas there be many <hi>Martha's</hi> now adays (but few <hi>Mary's) who are careful and troubled about many Things. Luk.</hi> 10.41. <hi>(Marimnas kai turbadze peri polla.)</hi> But in the mean Time neglect the one Thing neceſſary, which is infinitly more worth than them all, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſecuring their eternal Happineſs in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Seaſon of it, the Word <hi>Merimna,</hi> imports ſuch cares as divide and diſtreſs the Mind, thus are not the Hearts of many, ſeperated from God and grievouſly perplexed with a Variety of vexations Cares about this vain perriſhing World, while in the mean there is a deep ſilence and unconcerndneſs about their deathleſs Souls.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Rent</hi> your <hi>Hearts and not your Garments, and turn to God with faſting, weeping, and mourning,</hi> Joel. 2.12, 13. Cleanſe your Hands, <hi>ye Sinners,</hi> and purify your Hearts, <hi>ye double Minded,</hi> be afflicted and mourn and weep, let your laughter be turned into mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and your Joy into heavineſs, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.8. — 10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Be diligent and attentive in hearing the Word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10, 25. Frequent and fervent in praying to God for this mercy, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.22. and ſolemn and ſerious, in poring upon your preſent Miſery, and theſe motives I have propoſed in this Diſcourſe, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 50, 22. Which may the all-powerful God bleſs to your ſpeedy Conviction ſound Converſion and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation. I conclude with the Advice of the Apoſtle Paul to the <hi>Philipians</hi> and <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Philip. 2.1. — 6. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7 8. If there be therefore any Conſolation in Chriſt, if any Comfort of Love if any Fellowſhip of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies; fulfil ye my Joy, that ye be like minded having the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:003965_0065_10031969DE3F7438"/>ſame Love, being of one Accord, of one Mind. Let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory, but in Lowlineſs of Mind, let each eſteem other better then themſelves. Look not every Man on his own Things, but every man alſo on the Things of others.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, as the holy Ghoſt ſayeth, <hi>to Day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts.</hi>
