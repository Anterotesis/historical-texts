            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Friendly Readers;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe two following Sermons preached by me lately at <hi>New-York,</hi> some of the Hearers of them, of good Note in the Church, having desired me to publish them for a further Service, I did willingly agree thereunto, and do now publish them with some enlargements on several heads, as is common in such cases, the usual time for Sermons not being sufficient to contain the whole matter of them.</p>
            <p>My intent and end both in the Preaching them, and now in my publishing them, being to confirm such who might be thereby profited in the way of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> with respect to her <hi>Doctrine, Worship, Church Government, Discipline,</hi> and the <hi>Administration</hi> of the <hi>holy Sacraments</hi> of <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and the way and manner as they are administred in the said Church; and especially to establish such of my former Friends (in these <hi>American</hi> parts) who are lately come over to the Church, and to lend a helping hand to any others of them, or any other Dissenters who are well affected to the <hi>Church
<pb facs="unknown:001162_0003_0FB096BA5238B028"/>
of England,</hi> to bring them to joyn in full Communion with her, and to vindicate the same in all these respects above-mentioned, from the false and injurious Aspertions cast upon her by ignorant and prejudiced Dissenters of divers sorts, and more especially those called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and their Teachers, who abound in these <hi>American</hi> parts, and who most insolently, in their Assemblies, traduce and calumniate, villifie and reproach the manner of Worship and Sacraments, as well as that of Doctrine, in the said Church, with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Lyes and Falshoods that the <hi>Quaker</hi> Teachers, (in their Preachings throughout these <hi>American</hi> parts) belch out against her, &amp; especially in their Meetings on <hi>Long-Island,</hi> as one of them has lately done, to the truth of which, some who heard him have given Evidence before two Justices of the Peace. But his practice in this is not singular; for it is their common way (for want of better matter and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) thus to belye and villifie, reproach and calumniate the Church about the Manner of her Administration of the holy Sacraments, and particularly the Baptism of Infants, and the use of God-fathers and God-mothers, whom the Church requires to promise in the Childrens Name, what they ought to perform when they come to Age, which those false Teachers say (according to the Doctrine of the <hi>Church of England</hi>) they do not believe they can perform. Thus not only belying the Doctrine and Practise of the Church, but putting a false signification on the words <hi>God-fathers</hi> and <hi>God-mothers,</hi> and then charging it to be the sense of the Church, as if the words <hi>God-fathers</hi> and <hi>God-mothers</hi> were understood by the Church to signifie that God needed <hi>God-fathers</hi> and <hi>God-mothers,</hi> or that those Persons were <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Mothers of God,</hi> as I have heard some of them Ridicule those words, thus, <hi>What? has God a Father or a Mother, that they call them God-fathers and God-mothers?</hi>
               <pb facs="unknown:001162_0004_0FB096BBA46A9608"/>
As if the Etymology of <hi>God-father</hi> were <hi>God's Father,</hi> and of <hi>God-mother</hi> were <hi>God's Mother,</hi> which is as ridiculous Ignorance and Non-sence in that ignorant Crew of <hi>Quaker</hi>-Teachers, as it is a gross and impudent Lye, wherewith they belye the sence of the Church, as touching the signification of those two words (and as if the God of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was a <hi>strange God,</hi> (and not the true God) <hi>that needed Godfather and Godmother</hi>) The true sence of them, according to the Church, being no other but this, that they are in vice or place of Fathers and Mothers, to the Children that are to be baptized, to promise for them to God, what they are bound to peform when they come to Age, and to be joyntly concerned with their natural Parents, to take care of the Childrens Christian Education, until they be at Age to undertake for themselves; the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantableness of which Practice <hi>I</hi> have sufficiently proved by Scripture-Argument in my second Sermon, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after followeth. And it is also a most abominable Lye that the said Preacher on <hi>Long-Island</hi> did utter, in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meeting there, against the Church and her Ministers, <hi>That they made Christians for a Groat, by sprinkling a little Water in their faces</hi>; and then cryes out, <hi>An easie way of making Christians for a Groat!</hi> as if Baptism in the <hi>Church of England</hi> was bought and sold for Money, either for little or much, and as if nothing were done in the Administration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, but the Ministers sprinkling a little Water on the faces of those they Baptize, and as if that alone did make them <hi>Christians</hi>; all which are notorious Falshoods and Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. And the like Abuse he is guilty of, when he chargeth the use of the Sign of the <hi>Cross,</hi> after Baptism, <hi>to be a piece of Popery</hi>; for it was used in the Church several hundred of years before ever Popery was in the World. Every thing is not Popery that the <hi>Papists</hi> hold, otherwise we should
<pb facs="unknown:001162_0005_0FB096BD6A34E6B0"/>
throw away Faith in Jesus Christ, as he dyed on the Cross for our sins, and rose again and is gone into Heaven, which they profess to hold, though the <hi>Quakers</hi> have thrown it away, and in that respect are worse than <hi>Papists,</hi> for they set up the <hi>Light within to be sufficient to Salvation, without any thing else,</hi> which is a plain excluding the Man Christ without us, from having any share or necessary concern in our Salvation; as also they deny his real Existence without us in Heaven, in our Nature, or that he hath the same Body for substance in Heaven, that was crucified on the Cross. And how much like the <hi>Quakers</hi> are to the <hi>Papists,</hi> in many of their erronious Principles, as namely, their pretences to <hi>Infallibility</hi> and <hi>Iustification by the Merit of inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> with divers others, has been so fully demonstrated by others, and me, else-where, that I need not say any more of it here. Nothing can be said to be <hi>Popery</hi> but what is held by <hi>Papists,</hi> that is forbidden by Gods Word, and is repugnant thereunto, either directly or consequentially, but so is not the <hi>Sign of the Cross</hi> used after Baptism; it is neither commanded in Gods Word nor forbidden, as neither are divers other things used generally by <hi>Protestants,</hi> and even by <hi>Dissenters</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> also; but it being a very antient Rite in the Church of Christ, and the use of it being judged expedient, and for Edification, by the Church, what she enjoyns, (which is not repugnant to Gods Word) her Members ought to obey, in that or in other things, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the warrant of Gods holy Word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.</p>
            <p>Surely whatever favour is shown, or whatever Indulgence or Toleration the <hi>Quakers</hi> lay claim to, by the Act of Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by any other Law or Right whatsoever, they can never, I think, have the Fore-head of Brass to plead Liberty of Conscience thus notoriously to lye, not only against many worthy Persons, but against the whole <hi>Church of
<pb facs="unknown:001162_0006_0FB096C2181200A8"/>
England,</hi> and the <hi>Queens Majesty her Self,</hi> and the generality of the <hi>Nobility</hi> ond <hi>Gentry of England,</hi> who had their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism in the way of the Church of England, and at their Baptism had God-fathers ann God-mothers; for by the like Plea they might plead as much for Liberty of Conscience to <hi>Steal, Rob on the High-way, commit Murder and Adultry:</hi> But as the <hi>Quaker</hi>-Teachers deserve just Censure and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for these abominable Lyes and Calumnies against the Church of England and all her Ministers, so I hope God will put it into the hearts of such Christian Governours and Magistrates, in these Countries where the <hi>Quakers</hi> have their Meetings, to suffer no such things to be said in them; and if the <hi>Quakers</hi> will countenance and allow such Proceedings of their Teachers, that they be duly censured, and that they be Required, according to Law, to qualifie both their Meetings and Teachers, according to the express Terms of the Act of Toleration, otherwise they are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and more like Conventicles and a Vicious and Licentious Rout, than a Meeting of Religious Persons.</p>

            <p>WE have in the words of the Text a most perfect Draught and Description of the Church of Christ, under the New-Testament, having all the true Notes and Marks of the true Church, as it began to be set up by Christ himself, the great Founder of it, through the powerful and effectual Ministry of his holy Apostles and Ministers, as distinguished from the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church, set up under the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Dispensation, and freed from the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Ceremonial Observances, to which the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church was bound, yet agreeing with the same in substance,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001162_0008_0FB096C562B0C0A8"/>
both in Faith and Morals, and in many things also both in manner of Worship and Discipline.</p>
            <p>As likewise, we have in the first Verse of the Text, an account of the great Success and good Effect and Fruit that St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Preaching had upon those who heard him, being his first Sermon after the Miraculous effusion of the holy Ghost, that about three Thousand Souls were converted, and added unto the Church, who having gladly received the Word, were straight way Baptized, by which great Conversion of so many Souls through St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Ministry, we have a solemn Instance of the begun Accomplishment of our Saviours Promise to him, <hi>Follow me, and I will make thee a Fisher of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This most perfect Draught of the Church of Christ, which was the first Christian and Apostolical Church, and which ought to be the <hi>Pattern,</hi> according to which the Church in all succeeding Ages ought to be conformable (excepting what was extraordinary and temporary, or for some time, as the miraculous Gifts of the holy Spirit, and the Community of Goods in the first Church set up at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> (being only for the present necessity and exigency) is set forth to us in the Text, in these five Particulars following.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>They</hi> (to wit, the three Thousand who heard St. <hi>Peter</hi> preach to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) <hi>that gladly received his Word, were Baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>They stedfastly continued in the Apostles Doctrine, as well in that of all the Apostles, as of St.</hi> Peter.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>They continued in Fellowship both with the Apostles and with one another, without Schism or Seperation, being knit together by one Spirit, and serving God with one Heart and
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001162_0009_0FB096C7AFA87080"/>
one Way, according to Gods Promise that so it should be,</hi> Jer. 32.39.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>They continued in breaking of Bread,</hi> i. e. <hi>in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and frequent Vse of the Lords Supper,</hi> as it is generally understood by Expositors on the Text.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>They continued together in Prayers, with one Mind and with one Mouth glorifying God,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Romans, Rom.</hi> 15.6.</p>
            <p>Thus, in short, we have a full Draught and Description of the most antient and primitive Church under the New Testament, which had the Word of God purely preached, and which was received by Faith and Love in the Hearers; in the Faith and Profession of which they stedfastly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. And also, we have in the Text, the two holy Sacraments, the one of Baptism, the other of the Lords Supper, but we find no more here, or else-where in the New-Testament, as either seven (as the <hi>Papists</hi> hold) or any other but those two; and, lastly (which are as necessary as the other) Fellowship and Prayers together, joyntly and with one accord.</p>
            <p>All which are so necessary to a true Church of Christ, that whatever Society, (tho' they call themselves a Church) wants any of the above named, can scarcely be called a Church, or if wanting, (though in some small part or parts,) of any of them, must needs be in so far lame and imperfect; and by how much any Society is nearest to the primitive Pattern, in the above-named particulars, she is the more perfect, and if she come up in full to them all, she is compleatly such</p>
            <p>I shall not need here to show, how deficient the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (as it now is, and hath long been) is in all these

particulars, which has not only added many Innovasions in Doctrine, repugnant to Apostolical Doctrine, but has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, as well as added, and grosly corrupted her self in all the above-named particulars.</p>
            <p>Nor shall I make it any part of my present Work, to show the great Disconformity and Dissimilitude of other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders (who are not in Communion with the Church) to be nearest to the primitive Pattern, which yet can very easily be done.</p>
            <p>But, as briefly as I may, I will show the great Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that the Church to which we belong, <hi>i. e. The Church of England,</hi> as by Law established, hath to the primitive Pattern here delivered in the Text, in the above-named par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. As,</p>
            <p n="1">I. In her stedfast continuance in the Apostles Doctrine, ever since the Reformation from <hi>Popery,</hi> her Faith is the same, (without any Addition or Innovation) both with the Church in the Days of the Apostles, and with the Church as it has been in Succession from the days of the Apostles, during the purest Ages of the Church, for several hundreds of years, summarily contained in the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> which if not composed by the Apostles themselves, yet is exactly conform to the Faith delivered by them, in the Books of the New Testament, whereof the <hi>Nicine</hi> and <hi>Athanasian Creeds</hi> are only further Explanations, without the addition of any new Article. Also the <hi>Doctrine of Repentance</hi> and <hi>Remission of sin,</hi> and <hi>free Iustification by the alone Merits of Christ,</hi> apprehended and applyed by a true and lively Faith, that is operative and productive of good Works, is sincerely taught and stedfastly believed and professed by all her true Members and Children.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:001162_0011_0FB096CAA05F6638"/>II. She doth also well and truly believe and profess the absolute Necessity of the Grace of God, and of the gracious inward Aids and Assistances, Inspirations, Illuminations and Operations of the holy Spirit, to all our Services and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances in the Worship of God, by Prayer and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, to render them acceptable to God, and profitable to our Salvation, and to all our Thoughts, Words and Works of that tendency, and to the begetting and increasing in us a true and lively Faith, Hope, Love, Repentance, Fear, Humility, and all other Christian moral Virtues, which she doth acknowledge to be the Fruits of the holy Spirit, wrought and nourished by the same in us, in our due use of the means of Grace, as particularly mentioned in the Text, such as the Preaching and Hearing Gods holy Word, both by reading and preaching it, and the holy Sacraments of Baptism and the Supper, and publick (as well as private) Prayers, and Fellowship with one accord, in the due use of all and every one of the said Means.</p>
            <p n="3">III. She holds Fellowship and Communion with all the Orthodox and Protestant Churches abroad, tho' differing from her in some particulars that are not Fundamental, nor of that sort as give just occasion of Seperation, and owneth them to be parts of the Catholick Church, whereof she own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her self to be also a part.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. In all our Services towards God, she holds, That both Ministers and People ought continually to pray to God and depend and wait upon him for the constant renewed gracious Aids and Assistances of Gods holy Spirit, given, and daily to be given in and through Jesus Christ, the Head of his Church (who is the Head thereof in respect of all divine

gracious Influence, as both God and Man, yet one Lord Jesus Christ, as well as in respect of Government of the same) to enable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and strengthen us in every Performance: and that how well so ever, and by whatever assistance of Gods Grace and Spirit we are enabled to perform our respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Duties and Services to God, we are still to beg Gods gracious Acceptance of them, through our alone Mediator and Advocate Jesus Christ, together with the confession and asking the forgiveness of our sins, and doing all that we do to the glory of God, in the Name of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p n="5">V. She doth also stedfastly continue in the Apostles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, in relation to the Government of the Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging our Lord Jesus Christ to be the only Head of the Catholick and Universal Church, &amp; owning a Distinction of <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> under him, such as the holy Apostles in their writings of the New-Testament, have delivered to us, and has been continued in the Church in the succeeding Ages, as of <hi>Bishops, Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> with their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Offices and Ministrations. The which distinction of Officers, both superiour and inferior, are as necessary for the good government of the Church, as the distinction of supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour and inferior civil Officers is necessary in the civil State, or of Military Officers in an Army, for the good government of both, and to both which the Church is compared in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Church is a Kingdom, whose King is our blessed Saviour; and shall he have none in his Kingdom to rule and govern under him, of subordinate Rulers, superior and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior (whereas the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church under the Old Testament had a distinction of a three fold sort of Officers, by Gods appointment, to which the distinction of the three sorts of Officers in the <hi>Christian Church</hi> doth answer, as in all other things (excepting the Ceremonial part of the Types and

Figures, and other judicial Laws, peculiar to the <hi>Iewish Nation</hi>) the <hi>Christian Church</hi> did exactly agree to the <hi>Iewish.</hi> The Church is also compared to an Army, and an Army must needs have superior and inferior Officers, for the good government thereof.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. And in her publick Prayers, she agrees, as with the faithful in the antient <hi>Iewish Church,</hi> (who did all worship God <hi>in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> (as all true <hi>Christians</hi> do) yet did also worship him <hi>in set and appointed Forms,</hi> where both Ministers and People prayed vocally together, and praised God with joynt Voices, as well as joynt Hearts) so with the <hi>Christian Church</hi> in the days of the Apostles, where the People joyned in vocal Prayer, with joynt Voice as well as joynt Hearts, in prayer to God, as is evident from <hi>Acts</hi> 4.24. which was the antient way of publick Prayer in the <hi>Iewish Church,</hi> as well as of Praising God with the words of the Psalms of <hi>David</hi> and of <hi>Asaph,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.28, 29, 30. many of which were Prayers as well as Praises; and for which compare the following Texts of Scripture, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.34, 35, 36. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.3. <hi>Psal.</hi> 107.1. <hi>Psal.</hi> 118.1. <hi>Psal.</hi> 136. and throughout <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.7. <hi>Ier.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.17. All which show that there were set Forms of Worship taken out of the Book of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> that both the Ministers and the People used in their Devotion; and tho' but the first Verse of some of the Psalms is mentioned in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. and <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.34. and <hi>Ier.</hi> 11. yet it is not to be thought that they used that Verse only, but rather that they used the entire <hi>Psalms,</hi> which had that beginning, as well as many others, and at times all of them, as they had occasion, as the <hi>Church of England</hi> useth them all Monthly, in her publick Devotions; and that the People in the <hi>Iewish Church</hi> both read in the Law, and confessed their sins vocally, as well as

               </gap>3. and this continued all along to be a Practice in the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church, even in our Saviour's time, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.8. <hi>Mark</hi> 7.6. in which places their praying vocally is not reproved for the matter of it, but for their hypocritical manner of performing it. Also, a set form of blessing the People was given and enjoyned by God to the Priests; and <hi>Moses</hi> himself used a Form of Prayer at the removing and resting of the Ark, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 23, 24, 25, 26. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.35, 36. And surely <hi>Moses</hi> and the holy Ancients had the Spirit of Prayer, as well or more than any can now pretend to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And at the offering up of their first Fruits and Tythe, at the end of every third year, the People were enjoyned Forms of Prayer, by God himself (<hi>Deut.</hi> 26.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, &amp;c.) that the most spiritual among them were to use, at the time appointed. Also, our blessed Saviour taught his Disciples a Form of Prayer, which he commanded them to say, when they prayed, the Matter of which is so excellent and comprehensive, that it suits with Christians of the highest, as well as the lowest state, for Devotion: And that the Church useth it in all her Offices of publick Prayer, once, and once after the General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, is from Christs own Command, <hi>When ye pray, say, Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> for as in all variety of Dishes of Meat, <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi> is used to every Dish, to make it the more healthful, so the Church of God in all Ages, together with her other Prayers, has used this Prayer, taught us by our Saviour, as being the most perfect and comprehensive, in few words. It is granted, that beside the ordinary Forms of Prayer used in the Church, in the Apostles days, and for some time after, some in the Church had an extraordinary Gift of Prayer, by the Spirit immediately dictating to them the words and matter thereof, which we know none can justly now pretend unto; and who did at first pretend to it, were <hi>Popish Emisaries,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:001162_0015_0FB096D471DB2F00"/>
under the disguise of <hi>Puritans</hi> and <hi>Reformers,</hi> as is upon suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Record in <hi>English History.</hi> But let none mistake, as if our Church did not own the Aids of the holy Spirit in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing good Prayers, in suitable words, as well as in exciting spiritual and heavenly Affections, but this is not after that extraordinary way that those Impostors did pretend to, and to which many, as yet still pretend, but by the holy Spirits ordinary assistance, enabling them, by deliberate Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation and deliberate Consideration, to collect and gather out of the rich Treasure of the holy Scriptures, what is most suitable to them. And as private Persons are thus helped, at times, in private to conceive and compose Prayers for their private use and their Families, so the publick Prayers that are used in the Church, were composed by Persons of greater spiritual Attainments and Abilities in the Church, than are common to private Persons, such as of those antient and godly Bishops &amp; Pastors in former Ages, some of whose Compositions are used in the Church Liturgy at this day, but are not borrowed from the <hi>Papists</hi> nor the <hi>Mass-Book,</hi> though some of them are there, as well as the Lords Prayer and the Ten Commands, which are not therefore to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; for they were extant and used in the Church long before <hi>Popery</hi> or the Popish Mass-Book was; and their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Savour as well as excellent Matter be speak them to all spiritually minded, to have been made by the help of the holy Spirit, as well as other parts of the Church Liturgy of later date, by Persons of latter times. And on every new emergent occasion, spiritual Gifts are not wanting in the Fathers &amp; Bishops of the Church (praised be God) to frame and compose suitable Prayers for the present case and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, by the help of Gods holy Word contained in the holy Scriptures, which teacheth us as well what to <hi>Pray,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Will of God, as what to <hi>Believe</hi> and <hi>Practise</hi>; for
<pb n="01" facs="unknown:001162_0016_0FB096D64E8CA7B8"/>
the gift of <hi>Faith</hi> and all holy <hi>Obedience</hi> is the fruit of the Spirit as well as the <hi>gift of Prayer</hi>; and therefore why should <hi>Prayer</hi> be thought to be more immediately given us by the Spirit, than either <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Obedience?</hi> And seeing God speaketh to us by his holy Spirit in forms of words, containing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Promises, Threatnings and Doctrines of Faith deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us in Scriptures, why may we not speak to him in <hi>Forms of Prayer,</hi> such as are given us in his holy Word for our Instruction and Direction, as well what to pray as what to believe and practise? And why it should be thought more inconsistent with the Spirit to <hi>pray</hi> in set Forms, than to <hi>sing</hi> together in set Forms of Psalms of <hi>David,</hi> (as most Dissenters do, who cry out against Forms of Prayer, and yet use Forms in singing) no impartial man can think, and why they may not pray as well as sing with the Book.</p>
            <p>And whereas some object, <hi>That though Forms of divine composure may be used, such as that of the Lords Prayer</hi> (which yet I have known some affirm to be unlawful) <hi>That Forms of mens composing by Study and previous Meditation, are not to be used, as having too much of humane mixture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Answer</hi>; Why their <hi>extempore Prayers</hi> should be wholly divine, and have less of Man in them, than well <hi>premeditated Prayers,</hi> is very improbable: But it is most probable, for the most part, they have much more of Man, and of mans cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature, wherein they too oft vent and give scope to their sinful Passions, and Uncharitableness, Pride and vain Glory, which the use of appointed Forms doth limit and restrain, without limiting the true Spirit of Prayer; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, the Prayer that is <hi>extempore</hi> to the Speaker, is as much a Form to the Hearers, as any other, and less edifying, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as soon forgot as heard, for most part.</p>
            <p>Sure therefore the <hi>Church of England,</hi> to which we belong, is so conform to this primitive <hi>Pattern</hi> described in the Text,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001162_0017_0FB096D77739C1A0"/>
as is above shewed, it concerns weightily two sorts of Persons well and duly to consider how they stand affected towards her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That it concerns all them who are not in any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Communion with her, and yet want not good oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity so to be, well to consider and examine, whether they be not exceeding guilty of that hainous sin of <hi>Schism,</hi> by with-drawing from a Church that has all the Notes and Marks of a true Church of Christ, that the first Primitive and Apostolical Church had, founded by our Lord and his holy Apostles; and which requireth nothing of them, in order to joyn in Communion with her, that is sinful, or any wise contrary to the Word of God. Do they continue in fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with the Church of Christ, which is one of the great things mentioned in the Text, who with-draw from her Communion both in Sacraments and Prayer, as well as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word? As Fellowship with the Church is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Text, so is it oft and very pressingly enjoyned in many other Texts of holy Scripture of the New-Testament, as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.5, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. and what-ever higher Degrees of Spirituality, and of having greater Measures of the Spirit, they pretend to, who seperate from the Church, it may be justly suspected that too many of them are but like them, <hi>Iude</hi> 19. <hi>These be they who seperate themselves, sensual</hi> (or annimal) <hi>not having the Spirit.</hi> So it was in the days of the Apostles, that some on higher pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to Spirituality did seperate from the Christian Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies gathered by the Ministry of the holy Apostles, and so did the <hi>Donatists</hi> of old. So far as any seperate from the Church of Christ, which is his Body, in so far they seperate from Christ, who is the Head of the Body, and from Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with and in the Spirit of Christ; for the Fellowship of the Members of the Church stands not only in the outward
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001162_0018_0FB096D8F0593E38"/>
means of Grace, such as the <hi>Word, Prayer</hi> and <hi>Sacraments</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by and through them, as Pipes and Conduits, their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship is in the Spirit, and of the Spirit, according to <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1, 2. whereby they are knit together, and are of one heart, and of one Soul, and Mind, and mutually partake of one anothers Sufferings and Comforts; and where <hi>Brethren dwell together in Vnity, it is like the precious Oyntment upon the Head, that ran down upon the Beard, even</hi> Aarons <hi>Beard, that went down to the Skirts of his Garments, as the Dew of</hi> Hermon, <hi>and as the Dew that descended upon the Mountains of</hi> Sion, <hi>for there the Lord commanded the Blessing, even Life forever more, Psal.</hi> 133. and who are gathered together in his Name, have the <hi>Promise of Christ to be present in the midst of them; and what they agree to ask in his Name, according to his Will, he hath promised that it shall be done for them, of his Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 18.19, 20. But this gives no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to such as meet together in seperated Societies, not only by forsaking the publick Assemblies of the Church, but by an uncharitable Alienation of their Minds and Affections from them, upon a pretence that they find not that inward Comfort and sence of Christs spiritual Presence in those As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, not considering that the Cause of this is in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, through some ignorant Prejudice or distate, begot in them by wrong Education or the deceitful insinuation of false Teachers, which greatly abound; for, God be praised, such who have no such prejudice against the Church, but are joyned with her in hearty Affection, do find true inward Comfort, and have that true inward sense of Christs spiritual Presence, that their Souls desire, which many that boast so much of their spiritual Attainments above others, have not in reality, but in strong Fancy and Imagination, and in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Likenesses &amp; Resemblances, and which are frequently Impostures and Delusions of Satan, but no true divine En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,

while neither the Faith nor Practice of such high and proud Boasters are agreeable to the Rule of Gods holy Word delivered to us in the holy Scriptures, but contrary thereunto; and that of many such high Pretenders, in the great Fundamentals of the Gospel, their contrariety is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent both from their Words and Writings. Nevertheless, it is owned, that it pleaseth God, at times, to visit such erring Souls with gracious inward Visitations of his Love, by his good Spirit, that have a sensible comfort and sweetness in them, which those erring Souls so far mis-apply and mis-construe, as to take them for Seals of the holy Spirit, given to confirm them in their way, whereas to the plain contrary it is to reclaim and recover them from their Error. For whatever Comforts or Enjoyments erronious Persons pretend to, whether real or imaginary and delusory, they can be no Seals to confirm or assure them that they are in the right, suppose they had something of reality in them, because Thousands of contrary Perswasions, who are extream hot one against another, have laid claim to them, and made them Seals to confirm them, as if their way was the very way of Truth; yea, obstinate <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans</hi> have laid claim to great divine enjoyments, and applyed them as Seals to confirm them in their Way, and so have some bloody Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villac's, professing themselves to be Christians; which ought to be a warning to all, who pretend to divine Comforts and Enjoyments, well and duly to try and examine whether their Faith and Practice be according to the sure Rule of Gods holy Word, delivered by his holy Prophets &amp; Apostles, in the holy Scriptures. <hi>He that knoweth God heareth us, he that is not of God, heareth not us, [i. e.</hi> heareth not our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, so as to believe and obey it] <hi>hereby know we the Spirit of Truth, and the Spirit of Error,</hi> said the Apostle St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> chap. 1.4, 6.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:001162_0020_0FB096DEEBB95818"/>As the <hi>Church of England</hi> has the Preference above all that dissent from her [so as to with-draw from her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion] in the several Contents of the Text, so praised be God, in the Number of hearty and sincere Professors of Christian Religion, sealed by Holiness and Righteousness of Life, in all godly Conversation, and in eminency of divine Gifts of Knowledge, both in Teachers and others, as the many excellent Books of Divinity, published by them, do prove, which many Dissenters use, &amp; profess to reap benefit by them; also, she excells them in that most excellent virtue of Charity and charitable Temper and Judgment towards all other parts of the Catholick Church, whereof she esteems her self but a part.</p>
            <p>It is no ground of Seperation from the <hi>Church of England,</hi> that too many who profess to be of her Communion, do not walk answerable to that holy Profession; for what Society or Body of People is there upon Earth, or ever was for any considerable time, but had too many whose walk and conversation did not agree to the holy Profession of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi>: It was so in the very days of the Apostles, as is evident in many places of the New Testament, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the Churches of <hi>Corinth, Galatia</hi> and <hi>Thessalonia,</hi> and most of the seven Churches that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> writ his seven Epistles unto; and to prevent the scandal of such, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himself gave warning, That in the visible Church, which he calls the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>there will be foolish Virgins and wise, Tares and good Seed until the Harvest,</hi> which is the end of the World; and yet neither Christ nor his Apostles bid them seperate from the Church Assemblies, nor gave them any such Example, but the contrary. Nor did the Prophets seperate from the <hi>Iewish</hi> Worship, when the matter of their Worship was sound, though the lives of many that came to worship, were vicious, both of Priests and People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:001162_0021_0FB096E077792048"/>Besides, many that come frequently to Sermons and to the publick Prayers of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> [tho' baptized Persons] are not properly Members of the Church. Indeed, none can be justly so esteemed but such as are free from all habitual and scandalous sins, and in full Communion with the Church, and joyn in frequent Communion with her, in the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper. One great end and use thereof being to signifie their abiding in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, who receive it, as also nourish and increase, in those who duly receive it, all Christian Graces and Virtues, and that in a special manner and degree; for though Baptism doth initiate such as are baptized into the Church, yet if these baptized Persons, after Baptism, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the Communion, their Baptism is no proof that they are still in the Church, after their with-drawing from her; and though upon their return to the Church they need not a new Baptism, yet they need a new Repentance, for their sinful and unwarrantable Seperation; and the same is to be said of them whose Lives are scandalous, though they have been baptized in the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The above-mentioned Contents in the Text do concern another sort of men, who profess to be in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church, That they well and duly try and examine themselves, both as to their outward Conversation in the sight of men, and their inward Conversation in the sight of God, so as to have (<hi>Acts</hi> 24.16.) a <hi>Conscience void of Offence both towards God and Men</hi>; for as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith, <hi>If I regard Iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me,</hi> Psal. 66.18. It is the heart which God chiefly requires &amp; regards in all our Approaches to him and Performances, whether at the holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper, or at any other Times.</p>

               <hi>Ten Virgins,</hi> that we must not only have the Lamp of an outward Profession, but we must also have the inward Oyl of Grace in our Lamps and Vessels [<hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>divine Vnction</hi>] that our Lamps may burn and shine with light of good Works.</p>
            <p>God Almighty complained by his holy Prophet <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> of Old, against the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> whom yet he called his People, being so by Profession, and by many peculiar Bonds and Tyes of his Favour, That they had committed two great Evils, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.13. <hi>They have forsaken me the fountain of living Waters,</hi> That's the first; and the next was, <hi>That they had hewed them out Cisterns, broken Cisterns that can hold no Water.</hi> But how doth this appear to be two Evils? <hi>I Answer</hi> thus; Whoever worship God in any external Forms and ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Revealed Will in holy Scripture, they commit this second great evil, as well as the first; for all Forms and Ways of Worship, contrary to the revealed Will of God in holy Scripture, are but broken Cisterns of mens hewing out and framing, according to their earthly Wisdom, that will hold no Water; and of this the People of <hi>Israel</hi> were greatly guilty very often, as well as many are at this day under a <hi>Christian</hi> Profession. But with this the <hi>Church of England</hi> is not chargeable, however some in their ignorance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice so charge her. Some few Circumstances and Rites (neither commanded nor forbidden by God Almighty in Scripture) enjoyned by Superiors both in Church and State, (for Order and Decency, and for Edification) are not broken Cisterns; for such were used both by the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church and the <hi>Christian,</hi> without any Offence to God Almighty; and the <hi>Dissenters</hi> from the Church use divers, that they think useful, tho' not commanded; but the changing the Worship of God in any substantial part of it, or any wise contrary to Gods revealed Will in holy Scripture, is certainly to make

broken Cisterns that will hold no Water. But there are too many under the Christian Profession, in all Societies of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> who though they be not guilty of the second evil, <hi>viz.</hi> of hewing out or using broken Cisterns, <hi>i. e.</hi> false ways and forms of Worship, but hold to the true Form, yet inwardly and secretly, in heart, depart from God the Fountain of living Waters, and do not cleave to him with their hearts by a lively faith and cordial love and affection to him, and to his holy ways; but though they be free of outward <hi>Idolatry,</hi> set up secret <hi>Idols</hi> in their hearts, loving Pleasures more than God, adoring the <hi>Worlds Trinity,</hi> The <hi>Lust of the Eye, The Lust of the Flesh,</hi> and <hi>The Pride of Life</hi>; And tho' such partake of the outward Elements of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> yet they neither do nor can, while such, partake of the inward and invisible Graces, which all <hi>sincere Christians</hi> do partake of, to whom the <hi>Bread</hi> that is broken, <hi>is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Body of Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Cup</hi> that is drunk, <hi>is the Communion of his Blood,</hi> with all the spiritual Blessings thereof; so that as they drink into one <hi>outward Cup,</hi> they also drink into <hi>one Spirit,</hi> according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. for as the Idolatrous <hi>Heathens,</hi> who sacrificed to Devils, and did eat of the Meat Offerings, and drink of the Drink Offerings, that they offered to them, had <hi>fellowship with Devils,</hi> or (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Greek) <hi>were Partakers of Devils, i. e.</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired and influenced by them, by means of what they did eat and drink of those Sacrifices, as appears from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20. <hi>The things which the</hi> Gentiles <hi>sacrifice, they sacrifice to Devils, and not to God; and I would not that ye should have fellowship with Devils,</hi> that is, be inspired and influenced by them, as the <hi>Heathens</hi> were at their Idolatrous Feasts. So, (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> shews) the faithful, who did eat of the Bread, and drink of the Wine, in the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> were <hi>partakers,</hi> not only of <hi>Christs Body and Blood,</hi> by faith, but were <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:001162_0024_0FB096E5B9A917D8"/>
of his <hi>Spirit</hi> thereby, more abundantly, as the <hi>Iews</hi> under the Old Testament, which did eat of the Sacrifices, were partakers of the Altar, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.18. <hi>Behold</hi> (said St. <hi>Paul</hi>) Israel <hi>after the Flesh, are not they which eat of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, partakers of the Altar?</hi> And how were they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Altar, but by receiving the spiritual Blessings promised of God, conveyed by means of those Sacrifices, which were offered by a lively faith in him that was signified by those Sacrifices; and their eating of those Sacrifices being a means of conveying those spiritual Blessings unto them, which were not only Remission of Sin by the Body &amp; Blood of Christ (whereof those Sacrifices were the Types) but also divine inward Communications of the Spirit of Christ, divine Inspirations and Influences of the same, conveyed by means of what they did eat of those Sacrifices, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth plainly hold forth the parrallel betwixt the <hi>Iews</hi> partaking of their Altar under the Old Testament, and the <hi>Christians</hi> partaking of a more excellent Altar under the New-Testament, in the participation of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> as is also further illustrated, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10. <hi>We (i. e.</hi> we Christians) <hi>have an Altar, whereof they have no right to eat, which serve the Tabernacle.</hi> And who were these which had no right to eat, who serve the Tabernacle, but the unbelieving <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> who did keep up the Service of the Tabernacle, after Christ (the great and only Propitiatory Sacrifice) was come and offered up, who did put an end to those Typical Sacrifices, which had their service in their Day and Time.</p>
            <p>Thus we plainly see from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine, that as the <hi>Heathens</hi> Sacrifices did defile them who did eat of them, and the <hi>Iews</hi> Sacrifices were a means to sanctifie them, who did eat thereof, and had a lively Faith in Christ Jesus, whom they did represent in Types and Figures; So the the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> that the faithful eat and drink of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

are a means of their Sanctification, <hi>whereby they drink into one Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.13. And therefore the gloss of such who bring an argument against the Spiritual Benefit and Profitableness of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> from our Saviour's words concerning common Meats, <hi>That what entereth in at the Mouth defileth not the Man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>As the</hi> Quaker-<hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers commonly argue both in their Books and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
               </note> &amp; consequently nothing that entereth in at the Mouth doth or can be a means to sanctifie him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no, not the Bread and Wine in the Lords Supper, Is a most perverse wresting of our Saviours words, and a most illogical Consequence to argue from common Bread and Wine, to the Sacramental, and is evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> discourse in the places above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.18, 20. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10. also to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 21. and also to our blessed Saviour's words, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19, 20. And <hi>if nothing that entereth in at the Mouth defileth the Man, in any case,</hi> then St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Assertions were false, <hi>That the Idolatrous</hi> Heathens <hi>by eating of their idolatrous Sacrifices, had fellowship with Devils, and were defiled by that eating.</hi> Also, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>That whosoever eateth this Bread (viz.</hi> in the holy Sacrament) <hi>and drinketh this Cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord; for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh Damnation</hi> [or Judgment, <hi>Gr.] to himself,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11 27, 29. and to be sure that greatly hurteth him that so doth. And here let it be noted, That St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it the <hi>Table of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>The Cup of the Lord,</hi> even when Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Persons eat of that Bread and drink of that Cup unworthily. And it is altogether false, &amp; a wicked Assertion of those false Teachers, who affirm, That when some vicious Persons do, at times, presume to come to the Table in the Sacrament (where the good Discipline according to the

Canons of the Church, is not so duly practised (and who by the said Discipline ought not to be suffered to come) that therefore <hi>the Table is the Table of Devils,</hi> and <hi>the Cup is the Cup of Devils</hi>; for though such want of Discipline was in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that unworthy Persons did partake of the Elements as the worthy did, yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> for all that calls it <hi>The Table of the Lord</hi> and <hi>The Cup of the Lord.</hi> Of which, that we may all Worthily partake, God Almighty grant for the Merits of Jesus Christ, <hi>To whom, &amp;c.</hi>
