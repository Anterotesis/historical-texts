            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE character in which you have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared to the world, as <hi>Preſident of the Grand Continental Congreſs,</hi> has placed you in ſo eminent a point of view, that, like a city ſet on a hill, you cannot be <hi>hid:</hi> Your name, till of late, known compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively to but few, out of your own province, now holds rank with other Chieftains in the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican cauſe, and is, of courſe, in the mouth of every politician, that is, of every man, woman and child, throughout the extended continent of Engliſh America; we all, gentle and ſimple, old and young, bond and free, male and female, fancy ourſelves connected with you by a politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal relation, which entitles us to the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect liberty of ſpeech, to you and of you, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we think the cauſe requires it. You will not then be ſurpriſed at finding yourſel<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

by a <hi>ſtranger,</hi> and through a <hi>news-paper,</hi> the common channel of conveyance for <hi>modern</hi> addreſſes to Governors, Generals and Kings. What your <hi>private,</hi> political ſentiments are, I know not, nor do I conceive the knowledge of them to be material to any but <hi>yourſelf;</hi> it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed whiſpered, that <hi>Mr. Randolph</hi> is very far from approving of many things adopted by <hi>Peyton Randolph, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Preſident of the Congreſs;</hi> if this were a truth, well eſtabliſhed, and univerſally known, <hi>Mr. Randolph,</hi> and the <hi>Preſident,</hi> would have very different ſets of men for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers: But this may be all falſe conjecture, which you will lay to the account of an unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tax upon the <hi>great.</hi> Talked of you muſt be; and it would be ſtrange indeed, if ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors did not creep into the judgments, and ſome falſhoods ſhoot from the lips of three millions of politicians, endowed with the gift of tongues.</p>
            <p>Leaving therefore your private ſentiments to yourſelf, until I am better acquainted with them, I ſhall, in the correſpondence, which I have now the honour to open, addreſs myſelf to you, as <hi>Preſident of the American Congreſs, begun and held at Philadelphia, Sept.</hi> 5<hi>th,</hi> 1774. I do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to take the liberty of modern addreſſers to Sovereigns, and their Repreſentatives, in load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you with ſcurrility and abuſe, where I find reaſon and argument to be wanting; but, on the contrary, it is my determination to reverence yours and my own characters as Gentlemen, and to ſay nothing whereby I may wound the one, or forfeit the other. At the ſame time it is my fixed purpoſe, to deliver my own ſentiments with the freedom of an Engliſhman, nearly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014094_0004_0F92DD6F8A1D91B0"/>
in the important ſubjects upon which they are formed. If the freedom of the preſs is not denied me, I propoſe in a courſe of letters, as health and leiſure ſhall permit, to lay before you, without reſerve, my thoughts on your Bill of Rights, your Liſt of Grievances, your adoption of the Suffolk Reſolves, your letter to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency General Gage, your Aſſociation, and your three very ſingular Addreſſes; and to point out to you, the fatal conſequences of which they have already been productive in this province of Maſſachuſetts Bay; and the ſtill more fatal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, there is reaſon to fear, they will produce to the whole Engliſh America. If, in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this plan, I ſhall preſerve decency and good manners, notwithſtanding we may differ very widely in our notions, I preſume my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of diſquiſition upon the meaſures ſubmitted to the judgement of every individual, by being expoſed to the public eye, will give no juſt cauſe of offence. We are all embarked in one bottom; my life, and the lives of my wife and children, my property, my all, ſtand moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately connected with the loſs or ſafety of the ſhip—the ſtorm is violent; you, Mr. Preſident, have undertaken to pilot her through, to the much wiſhed for haven of peace,—you have taken the helm, and under your direction ſhe is now going at a great rate; but the tempeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes, the heavens lour, the clouds thicken and blacken every moment, the hoarſe thunder very ſenſibly approaches nearer and nearer,—the bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows break on every ſide,—and to compleat the diſmal proſpect, the ſhip is too craſy to afford
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014094_0005_0F92DD7056404DE8"/>
hopes of riding out the ſtorm,—and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are upon the point of mutiny.</p>
            <p>If amidſt all theſe circumſtances of extreme danger, you, through want of ſkill in naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or from being unacquainted with the coaſt, or from any other cauſe, have run us among rocks, ſhoals, and quickſands, far diſtant from our deſired port, you will, moſt aſſuredly bleſs the man, who ſeaſonably points them out, tho' they may have been firſt diſcovered by a <hi>common eye;</hi> an eye, in all other inſtances, much inferior to your own: perhaps it is not yet too late to retrieve our errors; there is a poſſibility that by adopting different meaſures, and purſuing an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite courſe, we may yet be ſaved: and while there is a poſſibility, it is excuſable, it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent duty on every one freely to give his opinion. And on the other hand, if <hi>our</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of danger (for I am not alone) are ill-founded, and our fears proceed from ignorance, and too great caution, ſtill the intereſt we have to riſk, will plead our excuſe with you; and you will kindly compoſe our ruffled ſpirits, by gently explaining our ſituation, and pointing out to us our miſtakes.</p>
            <p>Without confining myſelf to the foregoing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the ſubject, upon which I intend to treat, I will conclude this addreſs, with ſome remarks upon your letter to General Gage the cauſes which lead to it, and the effects it has produced.</p>
            <p>In your firſt letter, you premiſe that, <q>the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the town of Boſton had <hi>informed</hi> you, that the fortifications erecting within that town, the frequent invaſions of private property, and the repeated inſults they received from the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014094_0006_0F92DD7109BBC2A0"/>
had given them great reaſon to <hi>ſuſpect</hi> a plan was formed very deſtructive to them, and tending to overthrow the liberties of America.</q> You then go on to expreſs your deepeſt concern, that whilſt <hi>you</hi> (calling yourſelves the <hi>Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives</hi> of his Majeſty's <hi>faithful ſubjects,</hi> in <hi>all</hi> the <hi>colonies,</hi> from Nova-Scotia to Georgia, <q>were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing every <hi>dutiful</hi> and <hi>peaceable</hi> meaſure, &amp;c. his Excellency ſhould proceed in a manner that bears ſo <hi>hoſtile</hi> an appearance.—You then hold up to his Excellency, open hoſtilities and the horrors of a civil war; and laſtly as the <hi>means</hi> of preventing this, you hope he will diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the fortifications in and about Boſton, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any <hi>further invaſion</hi> of <hi>private property, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain</hi> the <hi>irregularities</hi> of the ſoldiers, and give orders, that the <hi>communications</hi> between town country may be <hi>open, unmoleſted</hi> and <hi>free.</hi>
               </q> This your letter was no ſooner delivered, than by your <hi>order</hi> or <hi>conſent,</hi> as I preſume, it was ſubmitted to the peruſal of every man, by being inſerted in the public news-papers.</p>
            <p>Upon this, give me leave to obſerve, that the profeſſed <hi>deſign</hi> of your <hi>appointment</hi> which was to <hi>deliberate</hi> upon, and <hi>propoſe</hi> to your <hi>conſtituents,</hi> the beſt means for reſtoring <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>harmony</hi> between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her <hi>Colonies;</hi> the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent inflammation to which you knew the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the people were then raiſed; the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with which you knew they looked up to your body, however <hi>unconſtitutional,</hi> and void of <hi>legal</hi> power and authority, it might be; the thorough knowledge, which, from General Gage's long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence on the continent, you muſt many of you, have had of his wiſdom, prudence, hu<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ity, and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014094_0007_0F92DD71CA8C7C38"/>
love of juſtice; theſe all, I ſay, were weighty conſiderations, which ſhould have induced you to the greateſt circumſpection, and caution in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving complaints, and adopting <hi>ſuſpicions,</hi> to the prejudice of ſo good a character, in ſtimulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to acts of rebellion, a people already too much diſpoſed blindly to ruſh into it; and thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating the ſole valuable purpoſe of your aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. But the complaints upon which your letter was founded, were ſo entirely repugnant to the well known truth of facts, that, had a letter appeared in print charging the Congreſs with the open breach of the whole decalogue, it could not have occaſioned more aſtoniſhment among your members, than that with which yours filled the minds of all in and about Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. It is inconceivable how you could be ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the ſituation of things here at that time. The Suffolk reſolves, unhappily, you had ſeen, and (pardon the expreſſion) in a paroxiſm of epidemic madneſs, you had, fatally adopted. Theſe, when cool reflection took place, told you, as plainly as if written with a ſun-beam, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in thunder from a Sinai, that the voice of that leading county, as delivered by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates, was for war. Previous to this four thouſand people had aſſembled at Cambridge, ſome in arms, and others having lodged their arms at a trifling diſtance, oſtenſibly to enquire into the cauſe of grievances, but in reality, to prevent, by force, the execution of acts of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The tranſactions of that day I need not recapitulate; they were not done in a corner, but in the face of open day, with an eclat which muſt have penetrated the moſt ſecret receſſes of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014094_0008_0F92DD7287DB0450"/>
the moſt obſcure corner of Britiſh America. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after this, the deſign of a deſcent from the country, for the purpoſe of attacking the ſmall number of his Majeſty's troops, then ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at Boſton, was publicly talked of, with an aſſurance which would have forced belief upon the moſt obſtinate ſceptic. Major Paddock's field pieces, with other cannon, were ſecretly taken away, and conveyed into the country. Powder, ball, flints, and ſmall arms, were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with unuſual avidity—and a number of aſſailants, who were to make the attack, was publicly and univerſally ſet at thirty-thouſand. A Colonel Putnam, of Connecticut, with a zeal, not according to knowledge, alarmed that, and all the ſouthern provinces, and the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was in motion. Under all theſe hoſtile ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, what was it the duty of a good Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to do? Was it not to ſecure his troops in the beſt manner he could againſt the threatened invaſion? This his Excellency General Gage did, by repairing the old fortifications at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the town, and by throwing up an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment ſtill further from the town, on each ſide of the common road Theſe works were, manifeſtly not offenſive, againſt either town or country, but merely defenſive, againſt invaders; as every man, upon ſight of them, muſt at once perceive, if he can diſtinguiſh the breech from the mouth of the cannon. Beſides theſe works, there was at that time a train of artillery in Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; they were placed at the bottom of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, pointing, as is uſual, towards the front of the encampment, which was on the ſide of the common, next to the town; this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014094_0009_0F92DD735FBB17B8"/>
the inhabitants, in a late town-meeting, have alledged as an inſtance of the General's want of attention, when in his condeſcending anſwer to your letter, he ſaid, <q>not a ſingle cannon is pointed againſt the town.</q> This is ſupporting their complaint by a miſerable quibble; I wiſh I could ſay, it implies nothing worſe. I have been told, that one ſagacious gentleman obſerved with great warmth, that it was ſtrictly true, <q>that every cannon on the neck was point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the town, becauſe the bounds of the town extended half a mile beyond the lines,</q> though let it be obſerved, there are but two houſes in that ſpace—this likewiſe is a circumſtance, to which, I am perſuaded, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral did not advert. By this kind of logic, if his Excellency had been charged with pointing his cannon againſt heaven; and it had happened that one of them had, at any time, been elevated more than forty-five degrees, this would have ſupported the charge. The invaſion of private property, charged upon the General, was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly novel and ſtrange here, with the complaint reſpecting the fortifications; the only colourable pretext for it, that I know or have ever heard of, if this can be termed colourable, is the ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral pieces of cannon, not by the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but by the commander of one of his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's ſhips, for being water-borne; they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ſmuggled into the country; but whether they were private property or not, is unknown, as they were condemned in the Court of Admiralty, for want of a claimant. I have heard mention made of the orders reſpecting the merchants powder, as another inſtance of this
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014094_0010_0F92DD7409F34590"/>
kind; it is very true before the defenſive works at the neck were finiſhed, and while the threats of an invaſion were warm, the General did, for a ſhort time, very wiſely and prudently prohibit the keeper of the magazine from delivering out any powder—but this is, at moſt, only in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an embargo, and is no more an invaſion of private property than an embargo on ſhips is. Theſe are all the pretended inſtances I have ever heard hinted at, in ſupport of this part of the complaint. The ſuggeſtion of the irregularity of the ſoldiers is truly aſtoniſhing; it is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and it is acknowledged by every one out of town-meeting, that the regularity and decent, inoffenſive behaviour has been remarkably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous. The town has inſtanced only in the affair of one gentleman's horſe; and this I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve happened ſince the date of your letter; but by what rule of juſtice does a ſingle inſtance in an individual, ſupport a general charge againſt the whole body of the ſoldiers? Would it be juſt to call the town of Boſton a den of thieves, becauſe one or two of the inhabitants have been guilty of theft? In ſhort, Mr. Preſident, it is truth too glaring to be queſtioned, that his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency the General, has conſtantly given the ſtricteſt orders, and attended with the moſt watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eye, for the preſervation of peace and good order, in conſequence of which the good diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and regular behaviour of the ſoldiery has been without a parallel. Such is the ſandy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, upon which you have adopted and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to this people, ſuſpicions of a plan to overthrow the liberties of America; upon which you have admoniſhed General Gage, in the ſtile
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014094_0011_0F92DD74D1DCE428"/>
of a Roman Emperor, to the governor of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; hoping that he would diſcontinue the fortifications; which he muſt have done at the price of his character and commiſſions, if not of his head; that he would reſtrain the irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſoldiers; which had been uniformly reſtrained almoſt to a miracle; and that he would give orders for opening the communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the town and the country, which had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been interrupted, but had been conſtantly kept open, unmoleſted and free, for all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſubjects to paſs and repaſs, about their lawful buſineſs; as every townſman and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman, who had occaſion to make the attempt, can abundantly teſtify. The conſequence of your publiſhing to the world your miſconceived opinions and cenſures, were the injuring a moſt amiable and worthy character, with thoſe whoſe remote diſtance from Boſton, deprived them of the means of knowing the truth, reſpecting the General's conduct; a character of which I would here with pleaſure attempt a portrait, but that I know would offend the delicacy of his ſentiments; increaſing groundleſs fears and jealouſies in the minds of the people; and ſtimulating them to take up arms againſt his Majeſty's troops; for though this might be far from your intention, yet your authority over their paſſions was ſuch, that your letter ſerved to give ſanction to th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe mad, violent meaſures, to which they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but too much inclined. Theſe were the evil effects of this haſty meaſure; and I mention them, not becauſe I take pleaſure in a fruitleſs recrimination; but becauſe I think it of the laſt importance that the people ſhould be undeceived;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014094_0012_0F92DD76B76219C0"/>
and becauſe you may poſſibly hereafter have it in your power, by retracting and rectifying your paſt errors, to prevent their future ill effects, and thereby, in ſome meaſure, attone for them. I am, Sir, with perfect good will, your moſt obedient ſervant,</p>

            <p>IN my laſt, I did myſelf the honour to addreſs you, on the ſubject of your letter to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency General Gage, to point out to you the real ſituation of things here, previous to, and at the time of your taking that inconſiderate ſtep, and the miſchievous effects it produced in this diſtracted province. I now proceed, with the ſame decent freedom, to animadvert upon ſome other of your meaſures, equally imprudent and impolitic in their nature, and pernicious in their conſequences. If the ſeeming harſhneſs of theſe, and other terms, which in the courſe of my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, may drop from my pen, ſhould kindle any momentary reſentment in your breaſt, you will remember, it is an inhabitant of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay who addreſſed you, not in your private, but in your public character. There are few men who can, with perfect calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impartiality, hear their own ſentiments and conduct arraigned and condemned; but you have ſtiled yourſelf my repreſentative, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by have given me a right to examine, approve or diſapprove of your proceedings in that capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; the reaſonableneſs of this deduction, is ſo ſelf evident—it is ſo clearly implied in the firſt
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014094_0013_0F92DD7731132410"/>
principles of repreſentation among ſocial crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and moral agents, that while you keep it in view, it is impoſſible you ſhould be diſguſted at any thing I have ſaid, or intend to ſay.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed to make any further obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on your meaſures, give me leave to lay before you, my idea of the deſign of your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and what in conſequence thereof, it was your duty to do, and what not to do.</p>
            <p>For ſome conſiderable time before the ſcheme of a grand congreſs was adopted, the minds of the good people of this continent in general, and of this province in particular, were moſt violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agitated, their tempers ruffled, and their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions inflamed; jealouſy, the rage of man, had taken faſt hold on them—they had been repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly told and always too credulous, they believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that plans were formed and proſecuting, for depriving them of their rights as Engliſhmen, and reducing them to a ſtate of the moſt abject ſlavery: With theſe fatal prepoſſeſſions they had been hurried on, in a kind of enthuſiaſtic frenzy, to an undiſguiſed, violent oppoſition, to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority over the whole Britiſh empire; an authority, which, from the firſt moment of their political exiſtence, they had uniformly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized; upon which, as upon a firm baſis all their charter rights were founded, and which had ever been their defence and ſupport; and to a ſavage invaſion of private right and private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, which neither the laws of God or man could warrant or countenance; and ſuch were the popular Rabbies, that lawleſs anarchy, and violence, threatened ſpeedily to deſolate this once happy land. On the other hand, the parliament,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014094_0014_0F92DD79588C12A8"/>
conſcious of the purity and integrity of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, perſuaded that their meaſures, however inexpedient, were conſtitutionally right and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and, that the deſigns of enſlaving the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, or depriving them of any of their juſt rights, had never been entertained; jealous, at the ſame time, of their honour and dignity, and juſtly offended at finding their rightful authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as they conceived, controverted, oppoſed, ſpurned and trampled upon, by their children, from whom they thought obedience was due; impreſſed with theſe ſentiments, the parliament had paſſed ſeveral laws, for the purpoſes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the Boſtonians to make that compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to thoſe whoſe property they had raſhly deſtroyed, which every principle of juſtice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; of ſecuring quiet obedience to their lawful authority, and reſtoring the courſe of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to its conſtitutional channel. Theſe regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, inſtead of producing their deſired effects, had, under the direction of the popular leaders, inflamed the paſſions of the people to a ſtill greater degree; the breach was widened, and ſeemed almoſt irreparable, our political deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was apparently inevitable, and our only hopes of ſalvation were founded in the wiſe, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and healing meaſures which ſome cool, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate mediator might happily project. At this delicate criſis, and for the valuable purpoſe of reſtoring peace and harmony between Great-Britain and her colonies, you were elected and appointed to ſit in congreſs; to your wiſe and calm deliberations, the eyes of the continent were turned; and upon your prudence, as it now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, the hopes of adminiſtration were placed,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014094_0015_0F92DD7A07460B98"/>
that a door might be opened for a compleat and laſting reconciliation: To accompliſh an end ſo ardently wiſhed for by all good men, it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputably your wiſdom, your duty, moſt ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly to avoid every thing that had the remot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt tendency, ſtill further to provoke the parent-ſtate, or to increaſe the flame which was then conſuming the colonies. How far the meaſures you adopted were guided by wiſdom and duty, an impartial review of your conduct, however painful the taſk, may ſerve to convince you.</p>
            <p>I have already mentioned the hoſtile appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the high-handed, riotous proceedings, which took place at Cambridge, on the ſecond of September: After which, on the ſixth of the ſame month, were paſſed the memorable reſolves of the Delegates for the county of Suffolk: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves which, from my ſoul I wiſh could be buried in eternal oblivion; but this is impoſſible; for, unhappily, in the plenitude of popular fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy, they were publiſhed to the whole world. In order to ſet the impropriety of your own conduct, Mr. Preſident, in the cleareſt point of light, it is neceſſary for me to take a curſory review of the principal parts of theſe aſtoniſhing reſolves.</p>
            <p>After an exordium, admirably well calculated to elevate the paſſions of the populace, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate madneſs, they reſolve, "That his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, George the Third, is entitled to the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance of the Engliſh colonies, agreeable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, and that ſaid covenant is the tenure and claim on which are founded our allegiance and ſubmiſſion.—That no obedience is due from this province to either, or any part of the ſeveral acts of parliament there mentioned.—That no regard
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014094_0016_0F92DD7B7225EFB8"/>
ought to be paid by the people of this county to the juſtices of the Superior Court, &amp;c. and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Court of common pleas, ſo long as they are appointed and hold their places by any other tenure than that which the charter and the laws of the province direct.—That they will bear harmleſs all officers who ſhall refuſe obedience to the orders of ſaid courts.—That it be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the collectors of taxes not to pay the monies collected, to the provincial county trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer.—That the Councellors appointed by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a mandamus from the King, in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to a late act of the Britiſh parliament, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign their ſeats at the Council-board, on or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 20th inſtant, or otherwiſe be conſidered as obſtinate and incorrigible ennemies to this country.—That officers of the militia be elected in each town; and, that the inhabitants uſe their utmoſt diligence to acquaint themſelves with the art of war, as ſoon as poſſible. That during the preſent hoſtile appearances, on the part of Great-Britain, we are determined to act merely upon the defenſive, ſo long as ſuch conduct may be vindicated by reaſon, and the principles of ſelf-preſervation, but no longer.—That if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould be apprehended, every ſervant of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be ſeized, and kept in ſafe cuſtody, as hoſtages.—And, that the committee of correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence diſpatch couriers, whenever any ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den manoeuvres render it neceſſary to aſk the aid of our brethren in the country."</p>
            <p>Such were the principles, ſuch the meaſures, recommended to the deluded people of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, at a time when their reaſon was borne down and overwhelmed by an uncontroulable
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014094_0017_0F92DD7BAA3DE378"/>
tempeſt of paſſion: Then it was, that the boſom of every true patriot heaved with ſighs and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent wiſhes, for ſome guardian angel, ſome friendly hand to ſave the foundering ſhip: And where could they look but to you? To you, Mr. Preſident, was every mournful eye caſt; ſuch was the flattering confidence placed in the loyalty, wiſdom, prudence and humanity of the continent, collected and conſolidated in your congreſs, that a ray of hope pierced through the gloom, cheered the deſponding ſpirit of every one who ſincerely wiſhed the ſalvation of his country, and preſerved him from abſolute deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. But, alas! how were all our fond hopes fatally blaſted, when your cruel reſolve, of the 17th of September, was announced! Such a reſolve, as if tears could obliterate, annul and blot it from human remembrance, I could wiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears:</hi> But this would be a wiſh as fruitleſs as were our late miſplaced <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

For God's ſake, Mr. Preſident, reflect on the circumſtances of this province at that time; on your own and the Suffolk reſolves; and aſk yourſelf, whether you were then caſting oil or water on the raging flame? Who can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you ever entertained a wiſh for the reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of peace and harmony between Great-Britain and her colonies, while you were thus irritating the wounded honour and authority of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and cheriſhing and fanning the ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire of the latter! You had now the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt opportunity to ſhow your good will to both countries, by diſcountenancing and diſcouraging the premature, inconſiderate reſolutions of a ſingle county, and thereby preventing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion from extending itſelf throughout this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted province: But, unfortunately for us, you miſſed the opportunity; you embraced an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite conduct; and, you need not be informed, it produced a contrary effect; by thus declaring your own ſentiments, you formed and directed the ſentiments of this province, and led the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant to an approbation and participation of the crime of high-treaſon and rebellion. Happy the man, Mr. Preſident, who wiſely improves his paſt errors; who from a firſt diſaſter takes warning, and ſhuns the rock he ſplit upon,—who, when he has miſdirected the ſimple traveller, and led him into labyrinths and dangers, takes the firſt

            <p>To proceed: In a pamphlet, entitled, "Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts from the votes and proceedings of the American continental congreſs," &amp;c. ſaid to be publiſhed by order of the congreſs, I find, among other matters, ſundry reſolves, paſſed from time to time; the firſt of which carries ſo much of the ſpirit and likeneſs of that on the Suffolk re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, which was the ſubject of my laſt addreſs, that I cannot but believe they are twins, both conceived and brought forth, at the ſame point of time. In this it is reſolved, "That this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs do approve of the oppoſition made by the inhabitants of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the late acts of parliament; and if the ſame ſhall be attempted to be carried into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution by force, in ſuch caſe all America ought to ſupport them in their oppoſition." What! Mr. Preſident,—was it wiſdom,—was it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence—was it ſound policy—was it humanity, to approve of high treaſon and rebellion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by a part of your ignorant, deluded, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy conſtituents? For ſurely your aſſembly, compoſed, in ſo great a meaſure, of gentlemen,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014094_0021_0F92DD8029517038"/>
who had made the law their ſtudy and profeſſion, could not be ignorant that the forceable oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made to the execution of the laws at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, and in other parts of this province; and the riotous aſſemblies for the redreſs of public grievances, amounted indiſputably to high-trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Every writer on crown law, and on the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of treaſons, is ſo clear and explicit on this point, that it leaves no room for decency or charity to ſuppoſe, that lawyers or ſtateſmen could doubt it. Certainly, your aſſembling from all parts of the continent, for the dreadful pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of encouraging and adopting the higheſt and moſt deſtructive of all ſtate crimes, was but a poor expence of time and money; this you might have done and tarried at home: Things could not have been worſe, had none pretended to take the helm, but every man been left to do what was right in his own eyes. Had you, Mr. Preſident, frowned upon theſe violent and very dangerous proceedings; pointed out their certain tendency to defeat the good purpoſes of your meeting:—to provoke, beyond the limits of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, the reſentment of an inſulted parent ſtate; to involve the province in the horrors of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, civil war;—to expoſe the raſh perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to inevitable deſtruction, both in perſon and property;—had you exhorted them, by all they held dear and ſacred, to refrain immediately from every thing which carried the remoteſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of treaſon, rebellion, miſpriſion of treaſon, riots, barbarous inſults, and abuſe of individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als;—had you, I ſay, taken this wiſe, humane courſe, you might have been the happy means of ſaving thouſands from miſeries, which, it is
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014094_0022_0F92DD80C9A4C3E8"/>
to be feared, will ſhortly make your heart to bleed; and generations, yet unborn, would have riſen up, and called you bleſſed. But inſtead of this, when you ſee the dogs of civil war let ſlip, you cry, havock!—and, as if not content with ſo confined a ſcene of horror and deſolation, as a ſingle province could afford, you endeavoured to ſpirit up all America, to ſupport them in their oppoſition: With this view, you ſuppoſe a caſe, which either then really exiſted, or elſe might never happen; for you ſay, "if the ſame (acts of parliament) ſhall be attempted to be carried into execution by force."—What kind of force did you here intend? You knew a fleet of ſhips lay in Boſton harbour, to attempt to carry one act of parliament into execution by force; you knew that General Gage, with a number of regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ſent hither to ſupport the civil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, in the execution of other acts of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but neither of theſe can be the force you intend, becauſe you ſuppoſe an attempt not then made: What other or further force had you any reaſon to expect would be attempted? And why would you, at that critical moment hold up to a blindly enraged people, a caſe which exiſted then only in vague imagination, and which, poſſibly, and moſt probably, would never be realized? How much more amiable would you have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the eyes of all good men, how much more conſiſtent would you have acted with the character of mediators, aiming at the reſtoration of peace and good will between the mother-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and her colonies, if you had, by adviſing to a gentle, diſpaſſionate behaviour, cooled the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated paſſions of the multitude, and reduced

them to ſuch a calm, moderate temper, as would have qualified them for a ſucceſsful negociation? But no; you who were choſen as the perſons in whom was c<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

You, who were ſitting like Gods to compoſe the tumults of contending na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; inſtead of proceeding under the ſure and ſteady guidance of reaſon, catched the firſt flame of inordinate paſſion from the rabble; and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, rebellion, war, carnage, deſolation, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpecies of human miſery, are conſidered in your councils, as trifles, ſcarce deſerving the trouble of an attempt to avoid. Such an expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, ſudden approbation from the Grand Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental Congreſs, had all the effect upon the minds of the infatuated people here, that an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible voice from heaven would have had; and even thoſe who, with ſome remains of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, looked back with trembling upon the ſteps they had but lately trod, now no longer queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the propriety of their conduct; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the wiſdom, prudence and humanity of the commander in chief, ſaved us from being precipitately plunged into remedileſs ruin. It is not my deſign, to enter into the merits of the diſpute between Great-Britain and the colonies; other and more able pens have treated this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in a manner that does them honour.—It is the meaſures you have adopted and recommended with which alone I now have to do, and moſt aſſuredly, the two reſolves I have mentioned, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by all lenient meaſures of accommodation, recommended the point of the ſword, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means of terminating the conteſt: And this, in my opinion, was unwiſe, imprudent, inhuman,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014094_0024_0F92DD8253871D70"/>
barbarous and cruel.—It may perhaps appear in the ſame light hereafter to you—poſſibly it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſo already; if it does, or if it ſhould, as you may have it in your power, ſo I pray God to put it into your heart, to attempt retrieving the wrong ſteps you have taken.</p>
            <p>Your other reſolves, hinting at the removal of the people of Boſton into the country, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the ſhutting, up the courts of juſtice—holding up the legal officers of government, to the rage of a lawleſs multitude—recommending a defenſive conduct towards the General and his troops, under certain reſtrictions and limitations—and making repriſals for any perſons appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by lawful authority—have all the ſame pernicious, fatal tendency to incenſe our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and his parliament, to cheriſh and increaſe the flame in the colonies, to ſhut up every ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to a pacific accommodation, and to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce anarchy and deſtruction. It really ſeems as if inſtead of guiding and directing the continent, you were yourſelves guided and directed by town and county meetings in this province, from whom you ſeem to have copied all your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.—Your bill of rights, and your liſt of grievances, differ but little, in form or ſubſtance, from the reſolves of moſt of our county town meetings; and though they contain ſome things which at another time would be unexception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, yet, every circumſtance concurred to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch declarations from you, at that time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together improper.—Your only proper buſineſs was to deviſe an expedient for bringing the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties together, and had you recommended pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the tea, and the appointment of agents

from each colony aſſembly, to repair to the Court of Great-Britain, inveſted with proper powers, agreeable to a very ſenſible plan marked out for you; and alſo recommended a quiet, peaceable ſubmiſſion to the authority of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the mean time; I doubt not but you would have laid a ſure foundation for a redreſs of all our grievances, and a happy reſtoration of peace, and all her ſmiling train. But your grand error was in the firſt concoction.—You ſtumbled at the threſhold—you formed and proſecuted a plan of operations preciſely the reverſe of that which prudence and exigence of our affairs pointed out to you;—our cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances required healing medicines, but you applied nothing but cauſticks and the inciſion knife; not a ſingle meaſure have you adopted that had the leaſt tendency to aſſwage and cool, but all is irritating, all is inflaming;—inſtead of a flag of truce you hoiſt the flag of defiance, and paſſionately challenge to combat, without deigning even to try the gentler means of party negociation. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me to be the complexion of your reſolves, your bill of rights, and your liſt of grievances.—Your aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a commencement of hoſtilities.—But the deſign of your three addreſſes paſſeth all human underſtanding, and is ſo profoundly myſterious, as, effectually to puzzle and confound the reaſon and common ſenſe of mankind; but theſe I muſt reſerve for the ſubjects of future letters.</p>
            <p>You will, very probably, be told by congreſs paraſites and ſycophants (for congreſſes as well as Kings, have their paraſites and ſycophants) that I diſcover my enmity to my country, by thus freely condemning the conduct of the "moſt auguſt aſſembly in the world," but your penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will eaſily pervade the flimſy veil of flattery, under which ſuch popular partizans attempt to hide their dark deſigns. Truth is diſcovered only by freedom of enquiry,—ſcurrility and abuſe, as it ſhews a deſire, ſo in ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted times, it is often, too ſure a means, of hiding her beauteous form from the public eye.

The ſame inferior part, you acted in your previous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves; and thus, you betrayed the dignity of the Grand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental Congreſs, while at the ſame time, you ſuffered your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be made the inſtruments, the tools, in the hands of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans, to ſpread and eſtabliſh robbery, treaſon and rebellion throughout the continent. This ſeems, at firſt view, to concern only yourſelves; but, in reality, it touches us all; for you call yourſelves the delegates of the ſeveral colonies of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, Maſſachuſetts-Bay, &amp;c.—It affects me as an American.—I addreſs myſelf to you, Sir, as Preſident of the American con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental Congreſs—viewing you and myſelf in theſe reſpective characters, I have a right to complain of your following the lead of any town, county, or provincial aſſembly whatever;—you had all the honors,—you had the leading cards in every ſute, in your own hands; and yet, aſtoniſhing as it may appear to by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders, you ſuffered <hi>ſharpers</hi> to get the <hi>odd trick;</hi> and thus, I fear, you loſt a game, in which I, though I confeſs, <hi>involuntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> had ſtaked deep:—and yet, hard as the caſe is upon me, I believe I ſhould never have appeared openly to blame your play, had you but played your own cards in any way, in <hi>any way,—with</hi> judgment or <hi>without;</hi> but, I have reaſon to believe you permitted ſharpers to play, not only <hi>their own</hi> but <hi>your</hi> cards too;—and this, by an unſkilful agreement, in which you were <hi>taken in</hi> at the <hi>beginning</hi> of the game,—but the game is up, tho' thank God, it is but the firſt game of the rubber;—had it been the finiſhing game, I would not have troubled you in this way,—my only aim is, to excite you to more caution, circumſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and attention in the next game—the <hi>May</hi> game.—I wiſh to point out to you every <hi>paſt</hi> error, to the end you may be guarded againſt it a <hi>ſecond</hi> time, when it certainly will be <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trievable.</hi>

But to quit trope and figure, you firſt ſtile yourſelves, in this curious inſtrument, the ASSOCIATION, his Majeſty's MOST loyal ſubjects; avowing your allegiance to his Majeſty, and your affection and regard for your fellow-ſubjects in Great-Britain, and elſewhere:—This, Mr. Preſident, ſounds well; and happy had it been for you, thrice happy for thoſe, whoſe Delegates you call yourſelves, if you had continued in this loyal, affectionate, regardful temper and ſtrain: But, to the grief of all loyal, good and virtuous, by whom you were delegated, if you may be ſaid to be delegated by any ſuch, you no ſooner make this oſtentatious declaration, than you immediately throw off all appearance of loyalty to your Sovereign, of affection and regard for your fellow-ſubjects in Great-Britain, or elſewhere, and open a plan of rebellion againſt your Sovereign, calculated to diſtreſs, and in your declared opinion, to ſtarve your fellow-ſubjects in Great-Britain, Ireland, and the Weſt-Indies, at the manifeſt hazard and riſque of the total deſtruction of all your fellow-subjects elſewhere; that is, on the whole continent of America. Such is your loyalty to your King, ſuch your affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and regard for your fellow-ſubjects, as they are to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from your ſubſequent actions, the ſureſt diſcoveries of the real intentions of the human heart: You next proceed, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the apparent, general plan of your meaſures, to irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the parliament of Great-Britain, and to inflame the raging paſſions of your American fellow-ſubjects, by holding up ſundry ſtatutes as grievances, and placing them in a point of view, which, by no means, ſhews them in their genuine colours: You repreſent the late act of parliament, impoſing a three-penny duty on tea, as part of a ſyſtem of ſlavery, adopted by the Britain Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, about the year 1763, and the only reaſon you aſſign for this repreſentation is, that it is an act for raiſing a revenue in America; whereas you knew, or might and ought to have known, that if any ſuch plan was ever laid, it was ſo long ago as the year 1660, when the tobacco act was paſſed, which was for the expreſs purpoſe of raiſing a revenue upon the trade of the colonies. You knew, I preſume, that in the year 1672, a duty was laid by act of parliament, upon all <q>white, brown and muſcovado ſugars, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, cotton wool, indigo, ginger, logwood, fuſtic, and other dying wood, and cocoa nuts ſhipped in any of the plantations, to be carried to any other plantation, the ſaid duties to be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied, collected and paid, in the reſpective plantations before the ſhipping thereof,</q> and this, you muſt know, was raiſing a revenue in America. You knew of the act paſſed in the ſame year, 1672, granting a duty <q>on all train oil, and whale fin<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

taken in ſhipping belonging to any of the colonies and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and imported into England.</q> You could not be ignorant of the act paſſed in the ſixth year of George the ſecond, impoſing a duty <q>on all foreign rum, ſpirits, melaſſes, ſugar and paneles, imported into any of the colonies, to be raiſed, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied, collected and paid, unto and for the uſe of his Majeſty, his heirs and ſucceſſors,</q>—and this too you muſt know, was raiſing a revenue in America.—You could not forget that above ſixty years ago, in the ninth year of the reign of Queen Ann, an act was made for <q>eſtabliſhing a general poſt-office in Great-Britain, the Weſt-Indies, and on the continent of North-A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</q> and that one reaſon therein aſſigned for paſſing it, was, <q>that the revenue ariſing thereby might be better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, ſettled and ſecured to her Majeſty.</q>—Of theſe, and many other acts of parliament, ſimilar in form and eſſect, paſſed in every reign for more than an hundred years paſt, I dare not affront the wiſdom of the congreſs by ſuppoſing them ignorant; how then could you repreſent the tea act, to your delegators, as being paſſed in proſecution of a ſyſtem adopted in 1763? Is not this a palpable miſrepreſentation? And even upon the ſavage plan of goading the people on to rebellion, can miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be juſtified? Was it wiſe, was it politic, was it benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, was it loyal to your King, or affectionate to your fellow-ſubjects, thus to wrong the preſent adminiſtration, and to ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate the coloniſts to a forfeiture of life and eſtate, by holding up as a novelty of modern invention, what you knew was eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by ancient and continual practice? To theſe queſtions, I leave you, Mr. Preſident, to give an anſwer, which I cannot give without pain; and yet, this is the grand foundation, ſo far as reſpects all the colonies, excepting Maſſachuſetts-Bay, upon which you ground as ASSOCIATION, which your poſterity will read with that mixture of aſtoniſhment and ſhame, which we feel at reflecting on the injuſtice of our fore-fathers, in the time of ſuppoſed witchcraft. God, I hope has forgiven them—they ſaw their errors and repented. You, I hope, will have the ſame plea, and find the ſame mercy.</p>
            <p>I might eaſily go on to ſhew that the two general acts which you repreſent as grievances, on account of their novelty, are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by ancient precedents, and conſequently can be no part of a ſyſtem adopted in 1763; you need only look into the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes to be fully convinced of this; nor can either of them be viewed as part of a ſyſtem of American ſlavery, becauſe they equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affect all the inhabitants of England, Scotland and Ireland, the West-Indies; neither is it poſſible you could in your conſciences

eſteem the other acts relating to the ſingle province of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts-Bay, as grievous, or tending to enſlave that province, and much leſs all America. You muſt know the port-bill was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only for the purpoſe of obtaining juſtice, and that though it operated as a puniſhment on the town of Boſton, yet they had the means of relief in their own hands, that they <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ght obtain it upon the eaſy terms of complying with the demands of equity, and following the dictates of conſcience: You knew the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation bill was but bringing their conſtitution nearer to that of Great-Britain, the moſt excellent in all the earth, and placing them upon the footing of Britons, the moſt perfectly free people under the whole heavens. How then, Sir, could you thus at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to make blind eyes blinder, to make the mad Americans rage, and the deceived people imagine vain things? How could you thus ſet yourſelves and take counſel together againſt the Lord's anointed; ſtimulating the inhabitants of this continent to wage war with their parents, and rebel, againſt their lawful Sovereign, after declaring yourſelves his moſt loyal ſubjects, and avowing an affection and regard for all your fellow-ſubjects? How, I aſk, could you adopt and recommend ſuch infatuated meaſures, upon ſo ſandy a foundation? Yet, this you have done, to the aſtoniſhment and grief of all good men: You have for yourſelves, and your delegators, aſſociated and agreed to break off all commerce, trade and dealing with your fellow-ſubjects of Great-Britain, Ireland, and the Britiſh plantations, and this with a profeſſed intent to procure a repeal of certain acts of the Britiſh parliament, the laws of King George the Third,—that King, whoſe moſt loyal ſubjects, you, by a ſtrange perverſion of language, profeſs yourſelves to be: Surely you could not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this a healing meaſure, tending to an accommodation of our unhappy differences; you muſt know your preamble was calculated to blind the reaſon, and inflame the paſſions of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans, and your aſſociation an open act of hoſtility, which could not fail to ſharpen the reſentment of an affronted, powerful nation, jealous of their rights, and tender of their honour: You muſt know, this baneful meaſure, tended with inevitable certainty, to the introduction of civil war, and all its train of intolerable miſeries; how could you thus ſteel your hearts againſt every ſentiment of loyalty and humanity! How could you thus ſhut your eyes againſt thoſe heart-rending ſcenes of diſtreſs, into which you were plunging headlong your conſtituents, their wives and innocent babes.

Engliſhmen, Sir, can never ſubmit to ſuch deſpotiſm,—an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman cannot tamely look an and ſee the bread ſnatched by ruffians from his children's mouths; it is too much for human nature to bear; it will drive men to deſperation, and muſt ſurely be productive of confuſion and bloodſhed. It is ſtrange indeed, that wiſe men ſhould hit upon treaſon and rebellion, as the means of pacifying an offended Sovereign; and upon vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and robbery, as the preſervatives of civil liberty: How much more certainly would the tendency of a gentle, peaceable, orderly conduct, have been to obtain theſe deſirable ends!—But one part ſtill remains, equally abſurd and amazing with any thing I have yet mentioned, which is this; among the acts, the repeal of which you make the condition of your ceaſing hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, is that "for extending the limits of Quebec, &amp;c." What an inſult upon your Sovereign! What an affront to the ſupreme authority of the Britiſh empire! What had you to do with Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec? You never pretended to be delegated by that province; did you, in the plenitude of your fancied power, imagine your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Lords Paramount of ALL America? It really looks, Sir, as if you feared, leſt your other requiſitions ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with, and thereby all pretence for rebellion, war and anarchy be taken away. It looks as if the bottom of your ſcheme was an independent republic, and that this condition was thrown in, effectually to prevent that accommodation, which would defeat your favourite plan; for you muſt know this could never be complied with: There is no part of your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, at which charity is ſo abaſhed and confounded, when with her wonted good-nature, ſhe would fain ſuppoſe you meant well, general frenzy and <hi>dementia</hi> of the times.—Here, ſhe pauſes, bluſhes, looks down and is ſilent.</p>
